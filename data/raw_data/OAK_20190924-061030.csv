We want to crowdfund crowdfunding. Our early backers are token holders, not equity holders, so they want an expansive platform that values a community project in Kenya as much as it does a tech project in California. The Acorn platform will be completely free to use in any country and for any legal purpose. With crowdfunding overtaking VC's as the most popular way to get funded, and with a growing appetite for entrepreneurship in developing economies, there is a huge and proven market.

Quote Last week we hinted at a crypto hedge fund that we will be working with. We can now reveal the full details of the relationship. We will be working with Whisper IP, a $251.5M crypto fund headed up by Dan Welton, CEO of $500 million investment management firm, BellAcre. Whisper IP has a syndicate of 3,179 members and recently secured funding for Nauticus ICO to the tune of $8 million.  The Acorn team are delighted to be working with a fund that has a proven history of successfully delivering funding in the ICO sphere. Dan Welton said: ""During a meeting that I can best describe as pleasurable and fortuitous, I was immediately impressed by Acorn’s proposition. In a crowded ICO space, the Acorn platform stands out as an idea with true longevity. The potential for growth is considerable, with a multitude of opportunities for Investors, that extends far beyond the token value. Raising capital affects every business globally. Acorn's approach to capital-raising makes it more accessible, and one of the few projects I’ve seen that can have a significant global impact.""",False

Add to that, the market's a slowly recovering and you have a sale that possibly will sell out in 3 days at most.  And yes there is a difference between main sale and pre-sale.

Acorn are tackling three major issues in crowdfunding, Access, Success and Transparency, what has driven the business development.  Access Did you know that only 1.9% of crowdfunding revenue goes to developing countries?  We accept any legal and ethical project worldwide — reaching parts of the world under-served by crowdfunding. Integrated platform training and support to help inexperienced founders. Seamless and free blockchain payments system — minimal transaction costs Project Incentive Fund — we incentivise early adoption of the Acorn platform and provide starting bonuses to promising projects Read Amani’s story to learn more  Success Did you know that 78% of crowdfunding projects fail to meet their funding goal?  Acorn offer’s integrated marketing tools and services as part of our crowdfunding engine. These will be backed by data from previous campaigns, helping founders make the right marketing decisions, and giving them access to lists of backers who supported similar projects in the past. Accelerators will perform project verification and founder mentorship to support new founders, and validate legitimacy of projects. The Acorn marketplace will offer additional Acorn, and 3rd party services to aid in the funding campaign and subsequent product delivery. Founders will be given the option of withdrawing funds at milestones during their campaign to use within the marketplace for extra reach Read Nancy’s story to learn more.  Transparency Did you know that fear of fraud is often cited as a reason for backers not contributing to crowdfunding campaigns?  All transactions will be made via OAK, providing transparency. Blockchain gives the option for the founder to display all spending publicly from the raise to the delivery stage. Backers can see where money is being spent thereby increasing trust in a project and making backers more willing to support projects. Projects use Acorn’s payment gateway to purchase external products, in both fiat or tokens. These transactions are also recorded on our transparency ‘app’. Smart contract based milestones can be implemented to only release funds when certain criteria are met. These can be instituted even before the funding target has been raised, giving projects access to cash early on and increasing their odds of success.",False

Blockchain gives the option for the founder (project) to display all spending publicly from the raise to the delivery stage.  Backers can see where money is being spent thereby increasing trust in a project and making backers more willing to support projects. Projects use Acorn’s payment gateway to purchase external products, in both fiat or tokens. These transactions are also recorded on our transparency ‘app’.

These can be instituted even before the funding target has been raised, giving projects access to cash early on and increasing their odds of success.

This will happen again during the ICO main sale. Obviously, there will be some who do better and worse out of eth during this period but both sales will be tagged to the dollar equally to represent a 50% discount at dollar rates between the presale and sale. We may also introduce dynamic pricing for the sale - we’re looking into the model for it at the moment. Within the company in general, fairness and looking to add as much value as possible to the community has been extremely important to us - hopefully, that’s something that’s been noticeable. It’s certainly a legitimate concern that any early benefit will be damaged by the eth crash.

However, there is also written that Acorn will build its activities in accordance with the current legislation. And even if it wasn't written, then they would be forced to do so as a legal subject.  Yep..    I tried to answer the question ""What can guarantee a growth of tokens?"" and formulated necessary conditions.  Why am I sure that sooner or later the token will be given the functions of shares? I'll tell You.  In SEC and in any other regulator, smart guys understand in finances far more than we do. And they are now trying to understand what is a token in general?  What does this digital record in the blockchain mean? Why is it rising in price or falling? In fact, it's simply a record in a digitized distributed database. On the release of a new version of the platform or positive news this entry reacts with growth. And this record reacts to the release of a new version of the platform or positive news with growth. On the contrary, if in a specified period news output doesn't occur the record loses in price.  BUT WHY? What is the practical meaning of this?  I think about it! This is not logical!  It's as if, for example, my inscription in the children's notebook ""I love my mommy"" traded in the market and grew in days when my mother baked a delicious cake.   And believe me, guys in SEC no less puzzled.  Therefore, I boldly declare that sooner or later tokens equate to shares of companies, because in fact they are perceived by the market in this way.   In WP can be written that anywhere. But when there is an idea and a lot of people finance this idea, they are fair shareholders of the results of this idea. And regulators will come to this conclusion.",False

As an ICO that is building a crowdfunding platform, Kenya is a great place to talk about Blockchain and crowdfunding. It was really great to meet lots of professionals in the Blockchain industry. Alongside that, we were building contacts to support part of the Acorn platform.  Acorn is changing crowdfunding for good, we will be global, accessible and transparent. In order to support local growing businesses, we need professionals on the ground in the country. That's why we're visiting as many countries as possible, not only building our Blockchain partnerships but building professional contacts that can help Acorn be the most successful crowdfunding platform yet. We'll be in Moscow and Dubai soon.  We've got some exciting announcements coming up next week concerning the platform's structure so have a look at our Telegram page for the latest. https://t.me/joinchat/HI_eCBG0fCRCl1ja-d5JDg",False

This law allowed companies to attract initial investment by a simplified procedure.  Before 2012 in the US, a start-up, without becoming a public company, was can attract capital only from qualified investors. Investments in a startup at such an early stage are considered risky and, in order for these risks to be accepted only by people ready to evaluate them, was introduced the term a ""qualified investor"" .  This is a company or an individual who has more than $1 million, not including a cost of a main housing, or the annual income for each of the last 2 years more $200K, and if married more $300K, with a income spouse. This, of course, was complicates the procedure for attracting financing for new businesses.  As a result of the adoption of the law JOBS Act businesses got an opportunity take investments from ordinary citizens and not only from qualified investors. It's very interesting for entrepreneurs in General and IT-entrepreneurs in particular. Since anyone can create a company in the US, the new law attracted the attention of entrepreneurs around the world. In subsequent years in the US was a huge boom in crowdfunding sphere and development continues today.",False

Imagine that there is a country in which have its national currency and only it are accepted for payment. And there is no other way to pay for goods. Only the established currency. In this country, will be enough goods, but the currency emission is 10 times less than all cost of goods. And then what will happen in this country? There are goods, but there is no necessary quantity of money supply, so that everyone can buy any goods at any time. And the money will be in hands a limited circle of people. Only the one who was able to sell the goods for money, will be able to buy other goods in further. Thus, instead of usual commodity-money exchange, the economy this country will be stagnant.

If so, which ones? I'm interested in the system of evaluation of projects before you start collecting how will you deal with deception and scam? This is a fairly ""thin"" moment - so I want to clarify it in advance. The fact is that there are already a number of projects that need to be collected and ready to present themselves - a question when it will be possible and again - under what conditions? ?  As with ICOs people backing any project on any platform should always conduct their own research before contributing money towards it. Unfortunately in life there will always be those who will seek to decieve others which is why people must use their own common sense before parting wth their money. We have a range of review steps to counter this. The first is simply moderation of the project, which would have to pass a legal test. The second is whether it is ethical, for which we have an ethics board. The third is the backer community who – as stated above – will scrutinise before they invest. There are other flags we will monitor such as how they interact with their community and conduct their raise. Overall fraud in crowdfunding is actually quite low – the study quoted in the whitepaper is less the 5%, but we have as many mechanisms as possible in place to filter out bad actors   And what about the above by WP insurance ? Whether insurance will be available a priori? Or risks for individual projects will not be insured.  Insurance is a specialist area, so we’ll be working with an insurer such as Lloyds of London or another to develop insurance packages. These will largely be off the shelf but there will be some circumstances where we may need to asses a particular project.

I think that hundreds and thousands of projects will get a chance to live thanks to Acorn.  Is this whole platform a copy of KICKICO or is it something completely unique? Maybe someone can quickly point out the major differences. Thanks!  KICKICO is just for ICOs we are a reward crowdfunding platform like Kickstarter except ours is free, accepts any project and is available in any country. So whether it’s the latest tech project in Silicon Valley or a community farm project in Tanzania we’re the platform for that. In fact one of the few projects we won’t support are ICOs  Quote from: bitok50 on February 18, 2018, 04:44:24 PM On your website as a partner is indicated European Crowdfunding Network.Tell us, please, on which issues you are working on and what benefits this interaction brings.Do you plan to develop your own mobile application? This is very relevant and important in our time.    ECN provide a range of expertise and training on crowdfunding, so we’re using the partnership to inform our own training packages and best practice in crowdfunding. Also, they are putting together an ICO and blockchain working group that we’re just speaking to them now about being a part of. We want to use the partnership with a leading organisation to be a closer part of the crowdfunding community, develop and share best practice and influence crowdfunding within blockchain.  Mobile is highly important to us as that is how many people (particularly those in developing countires) access the internet, so having our platform mobile friendly is a key focus.   Quote from: MumboJumbo on February 18, 2018, 08:39:03 PM Softcap includes pre-sale ? Whitepaper says Main ICO Softcap 3,500,000 OAK  (~5M), that suggest no pre-sale included, is that right ?  The soft cap in the main ICO is there because it’s the minimum needed to approach the project. The pre-sale cap is different because some of those proceeds will be used to ramp up to the main ICO. Whatever we don’t use in this phase will count toward the main ICO cap, so it will contribute but isn’t the same.

We’ve had a whole crop of new Acorns over the weekend, and we’re still processing KYC, we’re also talking to some groups who – as you can see from this morning – have started to join the sale, so we’re extending the sale by 48 hours.  The new deadline is 12pm GMT on Wednesday.  We’re really excited about a great weekend here at OAK Towers, so keep your eyes on the channel as we push to close out the sale in the next couple of days!  Could you please give a good reason for the extension of pre-sale. I think part of the community will be dissatisfied with this decision.  We received a large number of KYC applications in the days leading up to the end of the pre-sale many of which required manual approval which took some time. We were also in conversation with a number of groups who wished to contribute which is why we took the decision to extend by 48 hours, as this lead to us selling out the pre-sale we believe it was the right thing to do.

Question: In what way will the seriousness of the project that will seek investment be checked? Based on what principles will be tested for the project sponsor?  All projects submitted will be subject to manual review if the project is illegal under EU law it will not be accepted. Any ethically questionable projects will be put to our ethics board who will review it. If they can’t decide then the community will vote on it to decide whether it should be allowed on the platform. There will always be bad actors unfortunately but we will leave it the community on the platform to only support those projects they feel deserve it.

In white paper it is written that the project should not be prohibited legislative, should not violate ethical norms.  Everything else I think is acceptable. Simply if the project is not worth it, it will not collect money.   And who will determine this? With the legislation more understandable. But who will determine the ethical norms? They are different in different countries. Yes and not only in countries. Even have different people they can be different. Then it may turn out that this rule will be used by the project management at its discretion?

Quote from: Streets 2.0 on February 24, 2018, 09:36:03 PM What are the plans for the project now and where will it go with regard to fees? How quickly will it be possible to obtain data on a specific product that can be used in real time? What are the plans for coverage? - not all of these questions have answers in white paper - if there is such information please write here - or in a personal message. Still wondering - are there any similar projects? How are there examples?  Hi,  There will never be fees to use our platform. The platform itself will be completed Q2/Q3 this year so successful product details will be available after that. As far as coverage goes will be continuing with the multi-channel marketing approach that has brought us great success this far. As for similar projects you have the traditional crowdfunding platform such as Indiegogo and Kickstarter that aren’t available in many countries, only accept a small number of projects and charge his fees. Our platform is free to use, available in almost any country and will accept almost any legal project.  In the ICO space there are platforms such as KICKICO but these are only for ICOs whereas these will be on of the few projects our platform won’t support.   Quote from: ifirina on February 25, 2018, 03:36:52 AM Tell us more about the Acorn Marketplace. What currency can I pay for goods? This platform can be used by anyone or only the ICO participants?  The Acorn Marketplace will be a post-campaign retail platform for goods and services that were successfully funded on The Acorn Hub, provided at no additional cost to Acorn founders. This will provide instant visibility while letting founders get a free and effective new sales channel to reach users who have already expressed an interest in crowdfunding and the projects. While platform access is free for Acorn founders, we will also accept innovative 3rd party  products for a small commission. The aim is to add value to the marketplace, Acorn founders and the OAK token, in the form of increased utility. We aim to initially allow payments in both fiat currency and OAK tokens. As the market capitalization of OAK and the number of users increase, we hope the use of fiat currency on our platform will decrease naturally due to the higher transaction processing fees incurred from fiat payments. Once again, we hope by increasing the utility and demand of OAK in the face of its fixed supply, we can generate long-term upward pressure on the value of OAK.

I try choosing projects that will fast rise to their x2 and even x3. I don’t care about FOMO or HODL. Buy on Pre sale perspective tokens, fast sell, reinvest, repeat...May be it too risky, but it works and I always have my minimum amount of free crypto for new projects (3-5 eth) I invested 3,6 ETH in Acorn and expect at least x2 after listing on exchanges.

We only need to make $5M USD from the pre-sale and ICO to make our platform viable (it will just take longer than if we hit our target), we’ve already raised $2m USD from a comparatively small marketing budget so we only need to raise $3M USD more between the pre-sale and ICO. All in all we are in a great position and the pre-sale is far from done yet!  Quote from: willoweb on February 12, 2018, 05:05:54 PM Quote from: morgan4140 on February 12, 2018, 04:09:40 PM   Do you think there is already such a need? after all, at the current stage there is a presale and collected almost 2 kk$, there is still more than a week before the end of the presale, and then there will be an ICO period. I agree, soft cap at Acorn are a little high, but I believe that they will be able to achieve it. was the lucky guy announced on the first day of the competition? I participated in the competition and would like to know where I can see the result.  They were announced on our Twitter feed and Telegram page 😊  Quote from: LaitmanXY on February 12, 2018, 08:11:11 PM All ICO projects have their own soft cap. But a projects that will be placed on your platform will have a minimum soft cap? if so what size will soft cap be or is it an individual parameter?     We will accept almost any legal project of any size great or small.  Quote from: consigliere on February 12, 2018, 11:04:40 PM I hope guys you will be able to reach soft cap as your funds depends of ethereum rates I believe that we will witness bullish market quite soon. Will there be any kind of airdrop maybe?  There’s no softcap for the pre-sale, as stated above if we hit $5M USD at pre-sale that also means we’ve hit our softcap for the main ICO. But an airdrop is certainly something we have looked at.  Quote from: appraiser on February 13, 2018, 07:46:23 PM I read in white paper that the entire amount of money that will be collected for pre-sale in case of failure of the project investors will not be returned.  Therefore, the project has no other way out only to be successful....  If we don’t hit $5M USD between the pre-sale and main ICO then the pre-sale funds will be used the continue MVP development and we schedule another coin offering. We realise this still presents a slight risk for our pre-sale contributors hence the 50% discount.  Quote from: consigliere on February 13, 2018, 08:46:12 PM Devs, I wonder what will happen with this  unsold tokens if you reach soft cap? I hope they the rest tokens won't be distributed among ico participants and will be just burnt.  Our smart contract only generates tokens when we receive ETH so there are no unsold tokens generated which means none need to be burnt.

What about my question about insurance? Are there any developments?  Sorry SparkIt didn't mean to miss yours out! There’s a lot of regulation around insurance provision so we would initially use a experienced vendor such Lloyds of London to create the first range of products, its an interesting and complicated area so we would need to look at how it could be provided to add best value to founders and backers. We will be introducing a thread on this and lots of other more specific areas of the program for you to follow over the next couple of months.  Have you already signed a contract with Lloyds of London?  No they are just one such insurance expert we are looking at.

Looks good! 200 projects are a large number, but how big are these projects? because it is important not the amount but the quality of projects  They are really far ranging from large sustainable food projects in Canada to an Australian county music artist funding her first album and a football Academy in Nigeria.  Quote from: Streets 2.0 on February 14, 2018, 07:18:23 PM Can anyone say any specific requirements for fund-raising projects will be presented? If so, which ones? I'm interested in the system of evaluation of projects before you start collecting how will you deal with deception and scam? This is a fairly ""thin"" moment - so I want to clarify it in advance. The fact is that there are already a number of projects that need to be collected and ready to present themselves - a question when it will be possible and again - under what conditions? ?  As with ICOs people backing any project on any platform should always conduct their own research before contributing money towards it. Unfortunately in life there will always be those who will seek to decieve others which is why people must use their own common sense before parting wth their money. We have a range of review steps to counter this. The first is simply moderation of the project, which would have to pass a legal test. The second is whether it is ethical, for which we have an ethics board. The third is the backer community who – as stated above – will scrutinise before they invest. There are other flags we will monitor such as how they interact with their community and conduct their raise. Overall fraud in crowdfunding is actually quite low – the study quoted in the whitepaper is less the 5%, but we have as many mechanisms as possible in place to filter out bad actors  Quote from: BeenieMan on February 14, 2018, 07:46:38 PM I have a very importan question for the team.

How will the value of the investment be secured since payment will be in acorns? Say for instance I invest 100 Oak on something but 1 Oak is $10, what happens to the total investment if it drops to $2 the following week?  projects at Acorn will be given the choice about accept funds in Fiat currencies or cryptotoken. The issue of volatility is very topical in the light of events in recent weeks. The probability of a conditional with 10$ to 2$ always exists, as well as the probability to increase from$ 10 to$50. There is another controversial issue. In addition to investors who finance the project with oak, the problem can arise in people who make a crowdfunding. They will not be able to pay by OAK for the development of their product, and they are interested in immediately selling the received tokens, which will also negatively affect the price. Can there be an explanation from devs?  Can someone gie me an answer on this? This is the only thing stopping me from investing. Putting it simply I would like to know if project is funded in oak and oak decreases in value how does that effect the target of the project? The situation described by you is absolutely analogous to that as any of us invests in ICO.  For example, when I exchanged my ETH to OAK, its price was about a quarter more expensive than today. Of course, today it is still subject to the exchange of 1600 tokens for one ETH, but ETH was more expensive. And it turns out today OAK I can buy more profitable than a week ago.  What do I want to say by this? We always find ourselves before the choice to invest now or later, or not to invest. These are our risks. And no guarantees. But the project that you decide to give their acorns will obviously have to exchange some of these funds for a fiat currency for to be able to developed their idea. And thus we can say that part of the collected funds probably will be fixed in a fiat currency.  The project founders will set their target raise in USD and any fluctuations will absorbed by our liquidity fund  Quote from: renault18turbo on February 08, 2018, 04:57:07 AM Do you have any arrangements with exchanges? what happens if you do not reach the softcap?  At the moment our exchange conversation are still at early stages as we won’t be listing till after the ICO finishes, but we are partnering with Bancor to ensure immediate token liquidity. If we don't hit our softcap (unlikely based on what we've raised so far!) we will use pre-sale funds to continue MVP development and schedule another coin offering  Quote from: Streets 2.0 on February 08, 2018, 08:33:21 AM  I got a great idea today related to my profession. I think that this can be done in an excellent project and try to place on your platform! Who you know suddenly realize the idea will soon be as simple as ""one-two-three""? If the project can be adapted to the different language groups for the collected funds, I think it will be just a bomb!

Does this greatly impact the ongoing ICO? This should not be a big problem for Acorn. Almost every project encountered a market dump in during an ICO company. Life is harsh and ugly, and only the strong survive!  So it means, no changes on the number of tokens or price per token? I believe so, many have encoutered this but some are adding a percentage to investors or simply a plus tokens to investors. I do not think that we should seriously worry about the fall of the market. For new startups, this is a chance to prove themselves. A good project is always in price.   Yeah we can say that. Hopefully those who bought when eth is at peak will not create such a fuss. One more thing, how is the team handling the security over the information specially client personal data and the ICO itself? We know some projects have suffered from cyber attacks stealing not only information. Thank you!  A very good question, we have several revenue generating mechanisms built into the platform, support services such as legal and marketing, the Acorn Market place where successful projects  can be sold and a featured projects section which will support us medium and long term. The operations fund from the initial raise will support us in the short and medium term. You can learn more in the whitepaper about these elements.

There have been private investor conversations but we have been limiting these as we want as many token holders as possible.

The whole question is that I do not fully understand - is it really necessary to bring the main profit to the project with tokens? (with the growth of the project and participants - the growth of the tokens should not make us wait.   A token sale is the only way we can make our platform completely free to use as traditional funding requires hefty profits for shareholder. By being funded through an ICO we can avoid this. As far as the platform generating profit is concerned, see the answer a few above 😊  Quote from: goovsy on February 10, 2018, 12:18:14 PM Quote from: Streets 2.0 on February 10, 2018, 09:16:52 AM If I understand correctly, the commerce of the project will go as the number of participating projects (collectors) and donors increases. The whole question is that I do not fully understand - is it really necessary to bring the main profit to the project with tokens? (with the growth of the project and participants - the growth of the tokens should not make us wait.  I think Acorn is middle term investing.  By the way who knows what project will start their crodfaunding on Acorn platforrm first? And when it will be?  We already have over 200 hundred projects signed up waiting to use the platform upon its completion Q2/Q3 this year. You can see some on the website",False

The MVP platform won’t be available until Q2 or Q3 of 2018. Even though the team states they have ventures ready to use it, it’s unclear how legitimate they are and whether they’ll value what the team produces. (-4) Inexperienced team. The founders don’t have crowdfunding or blockchain experience – the two things the platform revolves around. (-3) Risky revenue model. A major part of their mid-term revenue strategy is in the Project Incentive Fund and Operations Fund. Banking on a 5%-10% annual return for the Operations Fund is foolish. The Project Incentive Fund is great to get those first users on the platform, but it’s not certain that they’ll stay once the incentives are gone. (-3)  Growth Potential Good advisor support. The company has a large group of advisors with the skills to help fill the gaps of the management team. (+3) Untapped market. Acorn is clearly targeting a market that’s vastly underserved. Using this strategy, they could enter the crowdfunding space without having to compete against the big guys. (+6) Multiple revenue streams. The team seems to be utilizing a “shotgun approach” for their revenue. Testing out different strategies could work well in the beginning and allow them to focus on the most profitable ones as they grow. (+5)   Disposition Acorn scores +4 out of 10. The platform brings a few novel ideas to the crowdfunding space but their good intentions could be their downfall. It’s rare that you see a company that doesn’t have profit as a primary motive succeed. I’m not saying that it’s not possible – just rare.  The project may have a better chance of success if they narrow in their focus in both their overall company mission and the revenue model they use to get there.""",False

In what currencies do you accept deposits? Which wallets would you recommend to use?  MyEtherWallet, Mist, Metamask or Parity are all good.  Contributions in ETH only.  23 hours until the Pre-Sale!  why do you accept only the ethereum (ETH) tokens? usually bitcoin is taken too. Or is it only at the Pre-Sale stage?  Thanks for the question.  We only take Ether because adding bitcoin contributions would increase the complexity of our smart contract and sales process, because they are 2 separate blockchains. Our token is an ERC-20 ethereum token, so people would need an ether wallet anyway. We don’t believe it would make that much of a difference to most people.

How will the value of the investment be secured since payment will be in acorns? Say for instance I invest 100 Oak on something but 1 Oak is $10, what happens to the total investment if it drops to $2 the following week?  When a founder sets his campaign target he sets it in a USD value.  The OAK contributions count towards this funding target in USD using the current OAK exchange rate at the time.  We then protect the USD value that he has managed so far. If the OAK value goes down in the meantime, Acorn’s platform will have to make up the difference. However, if the OAK value goes up in the meantime, Acorn will be able to keep this difference.  So yes, volatility can be a problem for Acorn, should there be a prolonged or massive downswing right during the time when we’re due to pay large campaign payouts.  This is one of the reasons for the liquidity reserve. It’s an allocation of the ICO proceeds that will help to smoothen out currency swings from large campaign payouts and OAK dumping by founders, but can also be used to sell off some tokens gradually during campaign raises (helping to protect us by locking in the USD value) and also maintain liquidity for us should we need to cover some of these contributions after an OAK downswing.  It is one of the drawbacks of using crypto for campaign contributions, but we believe we’ve got a workable mechanism to overcome this.  That said, we also expect that over the long term, crypto’s volatility, including OAK’s, will improve. Additionally, crowdfunding’s expansive nature (each founder must market his project and recruit his own backers, meaning each project potentially brings in lots of new users into the token ecosystem), our project incentive fund and other token growth mechanisms should help to maintain OAK demand and support the token price over the long term.   Quote from: liquidX3 on February 05, 2018, 08:05:54 PM A very unfortunate period for the collection of funds ICO. But who knew that the correction in the cryptocurrency market would begin. This situation can affect the fees in the worse side. What will you do if the correction continues for another 2-3 months?

A large number of holders of a token  increase the liquidity of the coin. Let's imagine that the token is only ten large investors have. In this case, what interest can be expected in the market? These ten whales can hold a token until the end of the century, but its price will not grow, simply because of the technical absence of any trades on the market.  Have you ever wondered why many projects arrange free distribution of a small amount of tokens - an airdrop? At first glance, a free distribution of tokens is a complete absurdity. An airdrop depreciates the coin - so many people think. But it is this free distribution to a large number of holders and creates the initial volume in the market necessary to create liquidity of the coin.  In a full-fledged market there is always a buyer and a seller, but without a seller there will be no a buyer and will be no the market.  And initial holders can sell the token at any price, but while there is interest in the project, as long as the project develops and shows results then in the market there is always will be buyer for any current price. And then the volume of bidding increases the interest in the project for new investors who didn't participate in ICO, and learned about the project much later. So, a large number of holders it's very well for Acorn and it will increase a price of the token. Of course, provided that the project will show everything that we read in the whitepaper.",False

A Project Incentive Fund provides generous incentives for people to use our platform.   Please tell us in more detail about what generous incentives and encouragements are written on your website? For what actions can I receive reward?   There are a few incentives in place for our early platform project founders: 1. Match funding 1:1 (up to a certain figure), to double the funding for each project. 2. Provide an initial percentage of the intended raise below the minimum funding threshold (e.g. 20-50%). 3. Provide generous startup funding to attract serious project founders, but in exchange for equity. Startup funding can only take place if done alongside a crowdfunding campaign on our platform and will be at our discretion.   For the platform to achieve the global reach we aspire to, we also need to incentivize backers who are new to digital currency into the OAK token. 1. Our mechanism for this is simple and direct. We intend to provide starting bonus OAK to early backers for them to spend on further projects, essentially allowing them to back projects and receive rewards for free. 2. We intend to incentivize referrals in a similar way, by rewarding those who successfully recruit new users into our ecosystem, as part of our Affiliate Rewards system.

Is this mean that for example Iran or Russia could not start projects on your platform? What sanctions do you have in mind? If you plan to translate on other languages how to check can I start or not? not many countries are under sanctions. And it largely depends on who imposes sanctions - UN, EU, America, Canada, Russia ? I guess it depends on the place of legal registration of the project. Any project, not only Acorn, is obliged to follow the rules and the sanctions to the country , which is the place where he pays taxes.   Will the project have a serious ""know your customer""? Do they work with an external provider of identification verification?  We are partnering with Identity Mind for our KYC procedures.

Really not sure that there is real demand. Crowdfunding theme is not new, the required infrastructure is already there.  Hi, Crowdfunding is growing year on year and the World Bank estimates it will be worth as much as $1 Trillion USD by 2025. There are existing platforms such as Kickstarter & Indiegogo but these exclude many countries in the developing world, charge high fees for use and payments and only accept a small number of projects. Our platform will be accessible in any country, will accept almost any legal project and will be completely free to use. The existing platforms have shown the model works, we are simply improving upon that in a rapidly expanding market. So the difference from the usual market is only in the amount of commission? I understand that there will be free access and openness, but in my opinion it's not always a plus for consumers.  Aside from the fact that our platform is completely free, available in any un sanctioned country and accepting or nearly any legal project we also have project backer insurance, the Acorn Marketplace, our project incentive fund to match the raises of early users of our platform and our affiliate rewards system to set us apart from exsiting platforms.  Also while I can understand that some people may view free access and openness as a bad thing the entrepreneurs in countries that are currently ignored or who's projects aren't ""cool"" enough for existing platforms certainly don't!

Hi Morgan, for our KYC we'll need proof of ID such as passport or driving license and a recent proof of address if your ID doesn't have your address on there. For your proof of address you don't have a bank statement you can use Household utility bill (eg gas, electric, water or fixed line telephone but not a mobile phone bill). It must be no more than three months old and show your name and current address. You can also use a credit card bill, tax bill or voter registration letter  Quote from: liquidX3 on January 22, 2018, 08:28:24 PM Quote from: TrackICO.io on January 22, 2018, 04:15:57 PM Hello, Acorn Collective has been added to TrackICO (link: https://www.trackico.io/ico/acorn-collective). Feel free to contact us via https://www.trackico.io/contact if you have any questions. take my congratulations) 4.8 rating is not bad! But why is not 5 points? It's all due to a not enough number of Milestones? Because only for this point is not scored the maximum like    Yes it simply due to the milestones, as the project moves forward over the enxt few months we should see that rating go from 4.8 to 5.0!  Meanwhile, we have a comprehensive technical paper which outlines our approach. This paper has been reviewed by our advisor, David Ives, who is the ex-CTO of Crowd Cube, one of the world’s largest equity crowdfunding platforms.

Contributions from the Pre-Sale phase will not be refunded and will be used to continue development of our MVP and schedule another coin offering in the future.  There are no airdrops planned but we’ve run a couple of competitions on Telegram and we’ll review it over the next few weeks  https://i.imgur.com/SEZVlT9.png   Could you comment a scheme on 18 page of WP? It is very difficult to understand what it is.  It is quite a complicated diagram, it shows the relationships between all the kinds of user the platform has; project founders & backers, platform moderators and admins and the services and databases they'll need to access. These are the user journeys through the platform and it's critical to have these mapped out for our MVP build.   Quote from: consigliere on January 22, 2018, 10:35:39 PM Devs, on validated interest topic on the website you mentioned that there are great interest on projects side to be listed. Could you name some of them or it is confidential info still for now? I just hope we will here big names for collaboration, hope it will be on the very first steps of your product launching.  We will very shortly have a whole section of our website dedicated to the projects that we have recieved so far, so will be able to see them in more detail there. We have had a huge variety of projects rannging from farming initatives in Ghana, a football academy in Nigeria, an exo-skeleton for people that have lost movement in the hands in the UK, a sustainable food intiative in Canada and an Australian country music artist who wants to fund their next album. This is really excitng as it shows the global potential of our platform.   Quote from: goovsy on January 22, 2018, 10:50:05 PM Early listing of the OAK token on digital currency exchanges, shortly after completion of the ICO would ensure contributors have a viable exit strategy as well as to allow new users into your ecosyste (WP 4.2.) But what if this would hard dump your token? People who will get bonuses will fix their profit and sell token lower ICO price!!  In the short term, to be frank, we expect there will be dumping by some initial ICO participants. However, this is something quite common among many ICOs, whether they have a large pre-sale bonus or not, and is not something in our immediate control.  The pre-sale token cap of 7m ACO is not a huge percentage of the overall pool - Max supply is 90m ACO, if we reach the hard cap - If we just reach our standard funding goal, there will be ~45m+ ACO) - The bounty program has been allocated 150k ACO  There are other measures we’re taking to mitigate against coin dumping.   We expect the MVP to be ready by late Q2/early Q3 - We maintain active outreach with the community and demonstrate active development occurring to show people that the coin isn't dead, even though the price may have taken a dip - Release our platform only a few months after the ICO, giving the token real utility and recruiting actual users into the token ecosystem (and thus generating demand for it)  We have designed token growth & stability mechanisms which should further limit the impact of dumping and ensure adoption and growth of users entering the token ecosystem at an early stage - more info on this can be found in our one-pager and whitepaper  In short, yes we expect there will be some dumping and there's nothing we can do to prevent it completely, however I do think the way we've designed it and plan to move forward with Acorn's platforms and mechanisms a short time after the ICO completes can minimise the impact of dumping and make sure it only lasts a short time.   Quote from: ifirina on January 23, 2018, 09:04:47 AM In which currencies do you accept contributions? What wallets do you recommend to use?  We will only accept donations in Ethereum and you can use any wallet that will accept ERC-20 tokens. We're big fans of the security that comes with hardware wallets such as Trezor but always encourage people to do their own research before choosing a wallet.

Thanks for the answer. Hello dev, you forgot to answer this question because it is really important for many investors. Will you burn the unsold tokens or not? and when? if you burn coins after entering the exchange then this can raise the value tokens Thanks Coindest definitely an important question, AUruHM had commented on it earlier in the thread but we should have expanded upon it so thanks for the opportunity to do so. If our token sale exceeds the minimum threshold USD 5M, but we do not reach our target of USD 50M in ETH equivalent, we will consider issuing a second tranche of ACO tokens at a later stage. Once we have attained our funding target, we will disable new minting immediately and will never hold another token sale again. I believe in your success but 50 million in ETH equivalent is very big amount on nowadays. More and more ICO projects have recently reached $10-20 million. It means that you will burn the tokens at the last moment? USD 50 M is a large amount but for us to be a truly global platform it is necessary, it also is inline with amount that existing crowdfunding platforms have raised through traditional means, for example Indiegogo has raised USD 56M through various rounds. Once we hit our target we will not ever to go through any further funding. We will not need to burn any tokens as we will only mint enough inline with our raise.  Thanks for the great answer. I agree 50 million is the amount that will allow the project to exist and prosper for a long time in the current situation with the cryptocurrency. But if on the ICO are not going to be as successful as expected and the next rounds will not bring much fees. Do you have else options how to attract funds after ico?    If our minimum threshold is not reached the contributions from our main token sale will be refunded to all. Contributions from the Pre-Sale phase will not be refunded and will be used to continue development of our MVP and schedule another coin offering in the future.  If our token sale exceeds the minimum threshold, but we do not reach our target of USD 50M in ETH equivalent, we will consider issuing a second tranche of OAK tokens at a later stage. Once we have attained our funding target, we will disable new minting immediately and will never hold another token sale again. In this case, we will speak with the community  of token holders to see which they think is going to be the most viable way forward – another raise after the MVP or just create the business from where we are. This will be fairly straightforward at, say $7m – we would beuild the MVP, get traction and do a second raise. At something like $30m+ we would move forward without any raise and freeze the token number. In between those sorts of figures we would see what the token holders want to do.   Quote from: BeenieMan on January 23, 2018, 11:04:35 PM Acorn guiding principle is minimal intervention. The platform should should encourage users creativity by keeping rules, requeriments and intervention to the minimem. Well...what about scamers? How will you beat them  what a plan? A lot of people see in crypto just way to get easy money, but not the to make world better. And as we see they win for now.   As with with ICOs people backing any project on any platform should always conduct their own research before contributing money towards it. Unfortunately in life there will always be those who will seek to decieve others which is why people must use their own common sense before parting wth their money. We have a range of review steps to counter this. The first is simply moderation of the project, which would have to pass a legal test. The second is whether it is ethical, for which we have an ethics board. The third is the backer community who – as stated above – will scrutinise before they invest. There are other flags we will monitor such as how they interact with their community and conduct their raise. Overall fraud in crowdfunding is actually quite low – the study quoted in the whitepaper is less the 5%, but we have as many mechanisms as possible in place to filter out bad actors.   Quote from: zavulon1988 on January 23, 2018, 11:39:18 PM actually i dont understand the real  role of this project. ICO itfelf is a crowdfunding platform you aimed on developing countries but there is no place for crowdfinging you have restrictions in USA citizen participation - it is not good people gett token they wants do profit but not good words only   Hi Zavulon 1988, the aim of this project is to be bring free access to crowdfunding all around the world not just in developing countries. Platforms like Kickstarter ignore most developing countries which is why we can have such a big impact there as well as in countries already serviced by reward crowdfunding platforms that can use ours for free.  We nee to be clear here about the difference between the ICO - our crowdraise - and the platform - where we help others to raise. Our ICO excludes US citizens because of the SEC's view on securities. US citizens will not be banned from the platform we create, just the ICO.  People who buy the token gain profit if the utility increases and the token goes up in value, so a global platform is the best way to achieve this.   Quote from: Somz1 on January 24, 2018, 01:29:39 PM Title reads Kickstarter for Blockchain, hmm okay? Next it reads ""free crowdfunding"", what in the actual reality does it even mean? Are you trying to fund projects for free? That's great, then why are you even conducting an ico?   It's absolutely free! To clarify what we're trying to do - we're building a crowdfunding platform that's free to use. So just like Kickstarter this platform is for traditional businesses, not other ICOs. This means small community projects in Kenya or a teck project in California. At the moment the other platforms charge fees, we want to make it free and open access. This means we need to raise money to build the platform, so we're doing an ICO  Without the ICO there is no free platform and no global platform that's really accessible in developing countries. There's a good quick overview of the problem we're trying to solve and our solution to it in the one-pager on the website.    Quote from: saimonji_miko on January 24, 2018, 06:53:35 PM Could you show us prototype or site image as of now?  Hi Saimonji_miko, We are currently building our MVP, if you head to our website aco.ai you can see our roadmap and technical paper which will provide more detail around this. Also we will have a page on the wbesite going live in the next few days which will showcase projects people wish to crowdfund on our platorm upon its completion.

Thanks for the answer.  Hello dev, you forgot to answer this question because it is really important for many investors. Will you burn the unsold tokens or not? and when? if you burn coins after entering the exchange then this can raise the value tokens   Thanks Coindest definitely an important question, AUruHM had commented on it earlier in the thread but we should have expanded upon it so thanks for the opportunity to do so. If our token sale exceeds the minimum threshold USD 5M, but we do not reach our target of USD 50M in ETH equivalent, we will consider issuing a second tranche of ACO tokens at a later stage. Once we have attained our funding target, we will disable new minting immediately and will never hold another token sale again.   I believe in your success but 50 million in ETH equivalent is very big amount on nowadays. More and more ICO projects have recently reached $10-20 million. It means that you will burn the tokens at the last moment?    USD 50 M is a large amount but for us to be a truly global platform it is necessary, it also is inline with amount that existing crowdfunding platforms have raised through traditional means, for example Indiegogo has raised USD 56M through various rounds. Once we hit our target we will not ever to go through any further funding. We will not need to burn any tokens as we will only mint enough inline with our raise.   Quote from: MorganFreeman41 on January 20, 2018, 04:38:00 AM yes, the project is amazing. he is definitely on my list of the most awaited ICO. Do you have a minimum contribution limit?  Thanks Morganfreeman 41, there is no minimum contribution limit.   Quote from: willoweb on January 20, 2018, 09:06:08 AM Judging by the description of the economy of your token it is solely for use within your ecosystem. But the cost of the token will be regulated by the market. My point is that a startup selling a conventional product 1000 ASO at the rate of$1=1ACO may find that due to the reduction in the price of the token, whan his conditional product is not$ 1,000, and less than this level.  To mitigate any risks of volatility our project founders can choose to set their raise target in our tokens or in fiat.   Quote from: ifirina on January 20, 2018, 09:27:02 AM Quote from: Cryptobudgie on January 19, 2018, 06:42:27 PM We can do this because we are fudning our platform through a token sale supported by the revenue generating mechanisms within the platform such as purchasing support services and the Acron Marketplace.  Please tell us more about the mechanisms of income generation. I'm interested in what will increase the value of the token in the future. What is the profit for the investor?  Backers will be able to fund projects using our token The Acorn Marketplace will enable users to purchase goods and services using the token, The Acorn Local mobile payment app allows point-of-sale transactions using the token, Founders will also be able to buy additional Acorn Support services with our tokens  This will ensure high utility of our token, crowdfunding is by its nature is expansive which means project founders will be responsible for bringing in backers to their projects increasing demand for the token. The expansive nature combined with a fixed supply of our token will see the value to the token continue to rise in value as the use of the platforms increases.   Quote from: consigliere on January 20, 2018, 09:44:42 AM Guys whats the aim of acorn token in ecosystem of your project? Do you have any features like 'continuos contributor' that I met in other projects? So that holders of acorn tokens get some dividends for certain period of time or it is not applicable in this case? Just wonder. Thank you devs by the way for clear answers on each questions here.  Hi Consigliere, thanks for the great questions, see above for the uses of the token within the ecosystem. We will not be implementing a continous contributor features, the value of the token will simply increase in line with its use.

Quote from: Bujuman on January 20, 2018, 10:58:36 PM ""4.2 Liquidity Reserve Initially, a part of our ICO proceeds will be allocated to our liquidity reserve. If founders opt to receive their funding in BTC/ ETH or fiat instead of OAK, we will use funds from our liquidity reserve to pay them. The additional tokens that we are holding will then be gradually re-sold on to the open market. We have designed this mechanism to make currency exchange easier and to protect against large currency releases as successful projects disburse funds. As the number of projects increases over time, the additional demand created for our token will increase liquidity and minimize the impact of these transactions.""  I`m new in cryto, but I find this mechanism intresting. Will it protect investors?  Hi Bujuman, this mechanism has been designed to protect the platform and token holders alike. This means that any fluctuations in crypto value or large project payouts will not have an negative impact on the platform or the value of the token.  Quote from: appraiser on January 21, 2018, 07:45:10 AM In the documents there is a mention that the secondary market will also develop for the sale of goods and services of post-crowdsfunding. Will it be right on the platform? How will it look like?  We intend all of the platform to be easy to navigate and as simple to use as possible including the Acorn Marketplace. This will be built into the platform itself and provide a very simple transition for successful project raises to sell their product/service.The look will be very similar to that of most online market places such as Amazon as these have evolved over years to provide people with the most easy and effective eCommerce experience.  The secondary market refers more to where we have clusters of projects and backers post-funding. Because we’ll be engaging with accelerators to help develop projects it’s likely that a number of successful projects will appear in one area along with lots of backers. To add value to the projects and improve tokenomics, we’ll create a simple mPOS app that allows people to transact locally in ACO   Quote from: LaitmanXY on January 21, 2018, 06:24:39 PM It's a very good idea to create a platform for raising funds as a kickstarter but on the blockchain of the etherium ERC20 tokens. What other advantages does your platform have in addition to reduced transaction fees that are about 5%?  Firstly, it will be completely free to use! The current fees are around 3-5% transaction fees and around 5%+ platform fees. We’ll eradicate both. In addition to that, it will be available in all countries many of whom are unable to use exisitng platforms and will accept any project rather than the select few that are currently accepted onto existing platoforms. We also have other aspects such as The Acorn Marketplace for successful projects to be sold on and project backer insurance for backers to protect themselves against fialed raises.

Our bank requires KYC and it’s an important step for us to protect ourselves legally and make sure we can actually put the ICO funds into a bank and spend it.  I understand it’s very annoying during the contribution, but I hope it can also demonstrate we are serious and want to protect the company and your contribution.  This is something that has been reinforced by our lawyers in Gibraltar. As ICOs become further established this year more and more will use KYC to ensure they are not putting themselves or customers at risk as regulation is becoming a hot topic and we have already seen companies suffer by not implementing these processes.  Good catch on the ICO ANN. It has been changed to pre-sale =)   Quote from: Toltekayotl on January 18, 2018, 06:52:59 PM Seems one of the promising project of 2018. You are already negotiating with major exchanges?  Thanks for the kind words Toltekayotl, we are currently speaking to a few exchanges, but we haven’t even started our Pre-Sale yet, so it’s still early stages for us in that respect. We’re aiming for quite a large raise and we’re using an ERC-20 token, which should hopefully make listing on exchanges not too difficult   Quote from: willoweb on January 18, 2018, 08:05:08 PM I believe that there should be control over the startup funds. Every startup having received funds from its customers must follow the milestones of its project. I mean the expenditure of funds collected by the crowdfunding  Hi Willoweb, we will institute the option of all-or-nothing-funding, take-what-you-raise and also milestones. This can be decided by the founders themselves, but also remember this will have a large impact on the amount of trustworthiness they demosntrate to the community and their backers. Yes of course there is always a risk of fraud, but crowdfunding is generally about social trust and project founders convincing their backers of their honest intentions.   Quote from: consigliere on January 18, 2018, 08:34:28 PM Guys what about your main competitors on this field if such exists? I really like your philosophy and approach. Need more time to go through WP. Good luck devs!  There are the established platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo but they can't offer what we can. Our platform will be completely free to use, available in any country and will accept any legal project. We can do this because we are fudning our platform through a token sale supported by the revenue generating mechanisms within the platform such as purchasing support services and the Acron Marketplace. This means we do not need to take a percentage of peoples raises or charge payments fees. Existing platforms are funded in a traditonal way meaning they are beholden to shareholders to deliver returns, hence why they only accept a small number of projects (only the ones that they think are a guarenteed success) and take a share of the raise.  Within the crypto space there are ICO crowdfunding platforms but none in the reward and donation crowdfunding space like us, especially ones that are free and allow any project. We don’t want ICOs, we want the boring traditional projects that DON’T need ICOs. A restaurant doesn’t need a token. Neither does a farm or a traditional tech gadget.  Thanks for the question and enjoy the WP.   Quote from: yassinebenouhoud on January 18, 2018, 08:36:55 PM What about a large company like kick-starter developing their own token? They might be behind now but large sums of money and manpower could solve that, that said I don't know much about Acorn as a company and how big the team is etc.  They absolutely could, but what prevents them from replicating our model of free, any project and any country crowdfunding is the fact they’ve already been funded by outside equity shareholders. These shareholders expect a return in terms of platform profits, meaning they’d still have to charge fees and only allow projects that generate a reasonable return. They still haven’t crowdfunded their crowdfunding platform.  We can afford to be free and use our revenue generators to keep the platform sustainable only, without generating large profits and draining money from the founders and our ecosystem. The founders of our own company get rewarded by holding the token. 16.66% of tokens will be allocated to the company owners, which are under time-lock for 1 and 2 years and align their interests with those of outside token holders.   Quote from: icodigger on January 18, 2018, 09:56:00 PM Crowdfunding it is really a very good task for platform on blockchain. But if your platform is free, then why do you need it? What will be your income and incentive for development?  Our vision is to be bring greater access to funding to the whole world, including developing countries currently shut out by traditional platform. Of course there will be ongoing costs associated with running the platform so there are revenue generating mechanisms built into the platform on top of the increasing value of the token itself via the growth of The Acorn Collective ecosystem. This effect is enhanced by the expansive nature of crowdfunding with project founders bringing new users to the platform to back their projects. The mechanisms in place vary from support services to be purchased, paid featured projects and the operations fund established through funds raised in the ICO.

Quote from: willoweb on January 19, 2018, 06:19:55 AM Is there any direct benefit for token holders like voting rights, participation in revenue? After all, for example, in a kickstarter, you get only the goods / service, you will have the same?  Our platform will follow in the Kickstarter model in that respect so there won't be and equity or voting right for token holders.   Quote from: Departure on January 19, 2018, 06:40:09 AM A very big difference in prices between presale and main sale) Many investors take this into mind when analyzing the project. Is there some kind of  pre-sale token freeze ?   Hi Departure,  The reason for the large difference in price is because participating in the Pre-Sale would be considered an early contribution that carries more risk because we need those funds immediately to grow awareness and continue MVP development. As such, there are no refunds for Pre-Sale contributors and the 50% discount is intended to reflect that risk, yet still be an attractive proposition for ICO participants.

This should be done towards the end of the ICO I think it's never too early to negotiate with the exchange. Some projects immediately after the end of ICO fall on the exchange, while others can't get in there for months.  Absolutely, that's why we've begun our conversations now with a view to appearing on exchanges immediately after the ICO.

Also interesting the question whether the tokens obtained with a significant skippage will be kept. After all, they can immediately appear on the exchange   Sorry what do you mean with skippage? Do you mean discount? No, they won’t be locked so they could still be sold on an exchange immediately. However, the overall tokens in the Pre-Sale (7m tokens) is very low compared to the max cap (90m tokens) should we reach our hard cap. Even if we only reach our funding target at ~50m tokens, it still wouldn’t represent a huge percentage of total supply.

If our token sale exceeds the minimum threshold USD 5M, but we do not reach our target of USD 50M in ETH equivalent, we will consider issuing a second tranche of ACO tokens at a later stage. Once we have attained our funding target, we will disable new minting immediately and will never hold another token sale again.   Quote from: Kerandias on January 19, 2018, 06:09:07 PM Hi, I have read your White Paper, everything quite clear for me except one point. How are u going to be profitable? I mean how the project is going to bring the money for founders? Maybe I missed smth, thx in advance for the explanation   Hi Kerandiad, a good question. On top of the the benefit of the growth of The Acorn ecosystem we have several revenue generating mechanisms within the platform including paid for featured projects, The Acorn Marketplace where successfully backed projects can be be sold and support services such as marketing and legal assistance. As well as this we have the operations fund built into a our fund raise allocated to assist operational costs in the medium to long term. This makes for a profitable company that rewards the founders.  Within the ICO there is a founder allocation of 20%. This means that whatever the raise is, we will mint a further 20% and allocate those tokens to the founders - these tokens are timelocked at 10% for one year and 10% for two years so the founders have a vested interest to ensure the platform is successful in order to get rewarded.    Quote from: Hitchcock on January 19, 2018, 06:19:48 PM Just found out yourproject, didn't read the whitepaper yet. Could you briefly explain what your project is about?  Hi Hitchcock,  In short we are building a crowdfunding platform, think Kickstarter or Indiegogo except ours is completely free to use, accepts any project and is available in any country. The ACO token will be at the centre of the platform and will be used to back projects, pay for support services and can be used in the Acorn Marketplace to buy products or services of successful projects.

We will be the escrow service for the campaigns that use that and we expect most of them to be at a size of a few thousand up to several hundred thousand. As to your second question, absolutely, it's vital to us that our platform is as easy to crowdfund on as possible as we will be a global platform and many regions will not have used such a platform before as they are currently ignored by existing platforms. On top of this we will be producing helpful content from experts to guide people, as well as bespoke campaign support services (entirely optional, but for a percentage fee) available within the platform where crowdfunding strategists and marketers will be available.

Even if the token provides access to a platform that allows the holder to give away their tokens, I don't see where the ""appreciation"" comes from ---> am I missing something?    Hi guys,  these two points share a lot of the same answer. As far as why people will chose us above existing platforms we've put various mechansims in place to ensure early adoption including matching peoples raises, project backer insurance and affiliate rewards. We will have less requirements in terms of project criteria (such as how much seed funding is already, working prototype, existing social following, how ‘innovative’ or ‘creative’ the project) and operate in all countries, incl those not accepted on the other big platforms currently. We want projects like tech gadgets in the USA or developed countries (where we are free and less restrictive to join) and also projects like a farm in Africa, a football academy in South America or a family entertainment park in Lithuania (where there are often no other funding options avilable)  Crowdfunding itself is an expansive concept. Each project must market itself and find it’s own backers, meaning every project potentially bring in a lot of new backers to use our token. Since the token supply is fixed, it means there will be an ever-growing number of people trying to obtain a fixed number of tokens.  As well as these elements there is the Acorn Marketplace; a secondary marketplace to sell post-crowdfunding goods & services, a point-of-sale payments app and the ability to purchase support services, such as marketing, within the platform all using the ACO token. Not only are these great features but are also central to why the ACO token will have such a high utility and will ensure a sustainable ecosystem.  This sustainability, these features and the fact the crowdfunding market is still in it infancy, with a potential to reach anything from USD 90B to 1 trillion per year by 2025 (World Bank, 2013; MyPrivateBanking,2015), means that there’s a huge crowdfunding market that exists already and a large one that isn’t being serviced by any of the existing platforms (especially for developing/emerging countries)  And as far as the incentive to back a project is concerned we will be operating a rewards based crowdfunding platform meaning that backers' of projects will receive rewards in exchange, if you were funding a new smart watch startup, they'd send you a watch in exchange, this aspect is the same as existing platforms such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo.

(Organisations that take startups under their wing and provide investment, resources and mentorship. Usually in return for some equity).  With developed and emerging markets, I mean, among others, Ghana, Kenya, Romaina, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Brazil, UK, Germany.  Through this, we hope to: - gain access to the organisations' networks of ventures and entrepreneurs, to see whether any of their projects would like to crowdfund on our platform - learn from actual founders and organisations the specific issues that startups face in their respective regions and cultures, both in terms of funding but also just in general. And hopefully helping them to solve some of these with our services - gain insights on how to design our UI/UX, keeping in mind most users in these countries speak a language other than english and may only be using a mobile phone instead of a computer - Providing localised Acorn support services (one of our features that gives project founders campaign assistance) and a local presence in the respective countries, both as customer support and also for marketing  Appreciate your questions maurobiasolo, please don't hesitate to add more!   Quote from: OneUnderBridge on December 27, 2017, 07:54:48 PM I just checked out the site and read the one pager. I like the concept. I will be digging deeper but if we can make this happen, I think there will be a huge market for the token at least. Why has the initial coin offering been set so far into the future though? Will there be any token left for the public when that day comes?  Thanks for the positive comments OneUnderBridge!  We wish we could run the ICO sooner as well, however the industry has changed a lot from the days where all it required was a whitepaper and a website, so we still have lots of work to get everything ready before we can run the ICO  . The Pre-Sale will start on 29 Jan and the main ICO is tentatively scheduled for March 2018.  Just to clarify, we do have some private contributors for the Pre-Sale, however the Main ICO is also open to everyone. If you're interested participating in the pre-sale, please sign up to our whitelist here https://aco.ai or join our telegram group https://t.me/joinchat/HI_eCBG0fCRCl1ja-d5JDg    Quote from: maurobiasolo on December 28, 2017, 08:45:29 PM Low fees can surely help to beat the fierce competition (there are a lot of crowdfunding platforms around), what will impact is the general acceptance of crypto currencies  That's a great point maurobiasolo. Yes, actually we do think it's still an issue, getting normal fiat currency into crypto and vice versa. However, 2017 has been an amazing year for crypto and the more mainstream it gets in the coming 2-3 years, the easier this process will become.     Quote from: maurobiasolo on December 29, 2017, 09:20:10 AM Quote from: bigcash2011 on December 29, 2017, 07:46:14 AM I like the quality of their website and if they come up with a great design and interface for the crowdfunding platform i think they will be at the top.  I would be interested to know the main difference with similar projects like Kickico. They have raised lots of money in the past but dumped a lot after ICO   I copied this from another question earlier:  There will be other competitors who are: - the traditional crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo - blockchain based crowdfunding platforms, like fundyourselfnow and kickico. KickICO is a bit different, as they also focus on running ICOs instead of just traditional non-ICO crowdfunding campaigns.  Here's why we're better (taken from our whitepaper) - We want to make crowdfunding free - Other platforms charge between 4% to 10% in fees. - The crowdfunding market is still in its infancy, with a potential to reach anything from USD 90B to 1 trillion per year by 2025 (World Bank, 2013; MyPrivateBanking, 2015). We’ll allow virtually all legal projects to list on our platform irrespective of where the project originates from and irrespective of each Founders’ project goal. Project types could include but are not limited to commercial, creative, research, charity and personal causes. - - We wish to expand project exposure in new markets where previous access and competition are low, such as emerging markets <-- there are HUGE untapped markets for crowdfunding - Goods from successful projects can automatically be listed and sold on the Acorn Marketplace with no fees for campaign founders. - Subject to the success of our ICO, we have designed Token Growth & Stability Mechanisms intended to increase the value of ACO starting after token distribution. These mechanisms include: a. The Project Incentive Fund will seek to provide generous starting bonuses to incentivize early adopters and reward recruitment of founders, backers and token users into our ecosystem. This can be a double accelerator, not only will the platform be free but it would also reward those generating early traction with incredibly generous incentives. It’s a mechanism to employ a huge marketing budget in an area where it should conceivably allow rapid growth for the platform and token. b. Our Liquidity Reserve is intended to mitigate ACO price fluctuations related to large campaign payouts. c. Subject to obtaining the required license or establishing a relationship with an existing licensed insurer, we intend for backers to have the option of buying Project Backer Insurance. For an additional fee, they could insure themselves up to the full value of their commitment against the possibility of project failure. We hope this will lower some of the objections to pledging funds. d. Affiliate Rewards system: If implemented, this would provide rewards for anyone who can successfully recruit new users to participate in our platforms and therefore use ACO and our ecosystem e. Frictionless ACO Purchases: We intend to connect with the APIs of exchanges and popular wallets to integrate them into our platform, creating a frictionless transaction environment. f. Partnerships: We intend to actively explore partnerships with campaigns created on Acorn Hub as well as 3rd party platforms to integrate ACO and increase its utility  All of the above features and systems are intended to generate demand for the ACO token in the face of a permanently fixed supply.   tl;dr version - free-to-use platform - open to any legal project and any country - fixed supply token --> more users mean higher token value - project incentive fund: proportion of the ICO will be spent on incentivising early adoption of our platforms, meaning early growth of token demand - tokenomics: crowdfunding on Acorn Hub; post-campaign sales of good/services on Acorn Marketplace; purchase secondary services on Acorn Support; point-of-sale transactions in local communities using Acorn Local. All use ACO token for transactions, meaning a continuous and circular flow of our token and a lot of utility    Hope that answers your question? Let me know if there are more!

For the legal and banking clarity that Gibraltar can provide.  It is one of the few jurisdictions in the world currently where there are clear rules and where the financial regulator, with help from our Gibraltar legal advisors, is willing to work with ICOs to obtain official confirmation that our token is not an investment security and therefore fully legal to run. This means don't have to worry that we will be prosecuted afterwards for selling unregistered investment products or that our funds are frozen afterwards. - we have full banking services at a private bank there, ensuring that we can actually deposit our money in a bank account and use it, after we convert the ether into fiat currency.  Also, in the future, they are working on crowdfunding legislation that we hope we can fit into, so that we can base our crowdfunding platform there and operate with legal clarity for that too.

We really appreciate it     Yes, it is quite a big bonus. First of all, to clarify, the reason we have a larger bonus is 1. There are no refunds for pre-sale investors as these funds will be going directly towards continuing development of our MVP and doing marketing for the Main ICO. As such, there is a larger risk when buying the Pre-Sale and we want the price to reflect that. 2. We do need that funding early on to ensure the success of the Main ICO. Again, it's to make it more attractive.  That said, we have considered it carefully and don't think it poses a critical issue for token value, especially in the longer term:  1. In the short term, to be frank, we expect there will be dumping by initial ICO participants. However, this is something quite common among many ICOs, whether they have a large pre-sale bonus or not, and is not something in our immediate control.  2. We expect the MVP to be ready by late Q2/early Q3 - We maintain active outreach with the community and demonstrate active development occurring to show people that the coin isn't dead, even though the price may have taken a dip - Release our platform only a few months after the ICO, giving the token real utility and recruiting actual users into the token ecosystem (and thus generating demand for it)  3. The pre-sale token cap of 7m ACO is not a huge percentage of the overall pool - Max supply is 90m ACO, if we reach the hard cap - If we just reach our standard funding goal, there will be ~45m+ ACO) - The bounty program has been allocated 150k ACO  4. We have designed token growth & stability mechanisms which should further limit the impact of dumping and ensure adoption and growth of users entering the token ecosystem at an early stage - more info on this can be found in our one-pager and whitepaper  In short, yes we expect there will be some dumping and there's nothing we can do to prevent it completely, however I do think the way we've designed it and plan to move forward with Acorn's platforms and mechanisms a short time after the ICO completes can minimise the impact of dumping and make sure it only lasts a short time.  Hope that answers your question?",False

The Pre-Sale will always be at a 50% discount though, we will adjust it accordingly and keep the ratios the same. The main aim is to ensure we achieve our USD funding targets. Hop that answers your question?    Quote from: maurobiasolo on December 26, 2017, 08:38:41 AM  But what happens if ICO doesn't reach the pre-sale? The 50%, in this case, makes sense, but still very risky. I wonder if you are already in contact with some very large investors (they can take such kind of risks)  I suppose you mean if we don't reach the minimum funding target? In that case, we will just try again with another ICO in mid to late 2018. We have the necessary funding (we'll tighten our belts) and will have more time to grow awareness and continue MVP development. If we don't reach it this time, we are confident we'll definitely reach it on the second try, after we have released our MVP and have a working product, real project pipeline, real users and revenues. For what it's worth though, we're at a stage now where we're all quite sure we can at least raise the minimum funding level now =)  Yes, no refunds for the Pre-Sale phase is risky. However, I hope we can demonstrate with our team and our performance so far that this is a serious venture and, even if the first ICO fails, we will proceed to a second ICO. The token will be exchangeable via the Bancor network in the meantime and will still count towards a second ICO should there be this need.  To your second question: Yes we are in touch with private investors and have some already. However it's not enough to fill the Pre-Sale cap (~USD 5M) and that's fine, as we want to give the same discount opportunities to public ICO participants.",False

There will be other competitors who are: - the traditional crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo - blockchain based crowdfunding platforms, like fundyourselfnow and kickico. KickICO is a bit different, as they also focus on running ICOs instead of just traditional non-ICO crowdfunding campaigns.  Here's why we're better (taken from our whitepaper) - We want to make crowdfunding free - Other platforms charge between 4% to 10% in fees. - The crowdfunding market is still in its infancy, with a potential to reach anything from USD 90B to 1 trillion per year by 2025 (World Bank, 2013; MyPrivateBanking, 2015). We’ll allow virtually all legal projects to list on our platform irrespective of where the project originates from and irrespective of each Founders’ project goal. Project types could include but are not limited to commercial, creative, research, charity and personal causes. - - We wish to expand project exposure in new markets where previous access and competition are low, such as emerging markets <-- there are HUGE untapped markets for crowdfunding - Goods from successful projects can automatically be listed and sold on the Acorn Marketplace with no fees for campaign founders. - Subject to the success of our ICO, we have designed Token Growth & Stability Mechanisms intended to increase the value of ACO starting after token distribution. These mechanisms include: a. The Project Incentive Fund will seek to provide generous starting bonuses to incentivize early adopters and reward recruitment of founders, backers and token users into our ecosystem. This can be a double accelerator, not only will the platform be free but it would also reward those generating early traction with incredibly generous incentives. It’s a mechanism to employ a huge marketing budget in an area where it should conceivably allow rapid growth for the platform and token. b. Our Liquidity Reserve is intended to mitigate ACO price fluctuations related to large campaign payouts. c. Subject to obtaining the required license or establishing a relationship with an existing licensed insurer, we intend for backers to have the option of buying Project Backer Insurance. For an additional fee, they could insure themselves up to the full value of their commitment against the possibility of project failure. We hope this will lower some of the objections to pledging funds. d. Affiliate Rewards system: If implemented, this would provide rewards for anyone who can successfully recruit new users to participate in our platforms and therefore use ACO and our ecosystem e. Frictionless ACO Purchases: We intend to connect with the APIs of exchanges and popular wallets to integrate them into our platform, creating a frictionless transaction environment. f. Partnerships: We intend to actively explore partnerships with campaigns created on Acorn Hub as well as 3rd party platforms to integrate ACO and increase its utility  All of the above features and systems are intended to generate demand for the ACO token in the face of a permanently fixed supply.   tl;dr version - free-to-use platform - open to any legal project and any country - fixed supply token --> more users mean higher token value - project incentive fund: proportion of the ICO will be spent on incentivising early adoption of our platforms, meaning early growth of token demand - tokenomics: crowdfunding on Acorn Hub; post-campaign sales of good/services on Acorn Marketplace; purchase secondary services on Acorn Support; point-of-sale transactions in local communities using Acorn Local. All use ACO token for transactions, meaning a continuous and circular flow of our token and a lot of utility    Hope that answers your question? Let me know if there are more!",False
