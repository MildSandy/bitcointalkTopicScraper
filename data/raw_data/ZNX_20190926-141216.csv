This is a good and interesting question. Thanks. The price of the token depends on the demand, that is, on the growth of project audience. At the same time high demand is restricting the price growth. Thus, ""the bubble"" that is not accordance with the development of the project is not inflated. Example: The cost of participation in the tournament = $10. The cost of ZNX = $1. You will need 10 ZNX to participate in the tournament. 1000 participants will buy the 10000 ZNX. The price of the token will increase accordingly. Next. The price of the token rose to $2. Now you will need 5 ZNX tokens to participate in the tournament for $10. Thus, now 1000 participants will buy the 5000 ZNX tokens. The price will fall. This is a very rough example. It overlooks the fact that the prize winners will sell the won tokens. There are other users of the platform who also will buy and sell tokens and paying with these. Since the main turnover of tokens will take place through tournaments, it is the number of tournaments participants that will affect the cost of the token. At the same time the cost of the token will affect the demand. The higher the price, the fewer tokens are required for tournaments. The lower the price, the more tokens are required for tournaments. Tournament buy-in are fixed. This approach helps to keep the price in a certain price range, making the token more reliable and stable. We plan to avoid a hyperinflation of the token.",False

I respect all eSports projects and don't want to say that they are bad, and we are good. No. Everybody has their own tasks. I can tell you how our token is useful: All financial interactions between the platform participants will be carried out using smart contracts: - Buy-in in paid tournaments; - Distribution of prize funds; - Buying / selling of goods; - The distribution of prize money between team members; - Payment of rewards to coaches; - Payment of rewards to referees; - Publication of content with subsequent remuneration for authors. As Fiat money cannot be used with smart-contracts, this will require a digital accounting unit, which will have a cost - it is a token. ZNX token is the Utility token. It is used for transactions between users of the platform and also between the platform and users. One component of our platform – It is the real possibility to earn playing your favorite games. That's why it is crucial that no one of the users was deceived by someone. You can read more detail about the project in the White paper.",False
