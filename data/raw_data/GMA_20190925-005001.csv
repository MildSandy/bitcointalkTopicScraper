What is relevant is the fact that main ico investors should hold 51% of all tokens pre-ico investors 25.5% which is 76.5% where in your reality both hold together just a very small % amount. You are a notorious lier and thief and nothing more. And would you be able to use your monkey brain properly you would see that BharatDEX said 100.000gma for which he would have paid in main ico $13.000 and not $13. $0.2 royalty for 6 months for a $13000 investment.99% lost token value.No thank you   Let's see how Engelman is going to react on it   Btw i heard you are banning people who only mention the issue adressed on this forum ?    Some nice facts about the incompetence of Jenkins Since only 15 million gma tokens were allowed to receive a royalty you can easily do math that mr jenkins full operational goldma  mining company shared a profit for the last 6 months which was arround $1000-1200 .  Good profit Mr Jenkins i bet the value of the tokens will explode mr monkey thief  I got contacted by many gma investors who call them thief and gma a shitcoin but sitting calm to not get banned in hope to dump their shitcoins as soon as possible when there will be any offer near their investment price.  I would recommend to force these thiefes to buy back the tokens with 20% of their gross revenue which was part of their initial whitepaper and offer on all ico review websites. Demand what they offered to do. They can keep their own shit coins,False

Tokens are being traded on exchanges so even if i bought 10.000.000 tokens for one cent you are still obligated to fullfill your contract to me as the new owner.  I asked you several times when i will show proof of participating in ICO will i get a refund.Your answer was a clear no.So why the fuck are you monkey asking for proof if you still have no intention to refund my money.  Instead of focusing on stealing money from ico investors i would recommend to start fullfill all your promises you made on the whitepaper.You editing the whitepaper after the ICO is not something we are going to accept.This info has been already being sent to SEC and you can bet there will be a reaction on it.As this are clear scam attempts.   Mr.Jenkins i told you months before should you scam investors i will get active.You are a notorious liar to your investors and trying to cheat them on every corner.  When will the buy back with 20% gross revenue happen Mr Jenkins ?,False

Btw you didn't answered when will be the buy back with 20% of gross revenue ?   So difficult to answer questions of your claims from your whitepaper ? Everyones sees you are not answering this kind of question but instead always through in claims to move the topic to something else. What was the main reason investors who complained in your telegram group got banned ? Ahh i forgat they were all racist.Because you are black all people who post about your incompetence and studpity are racist.It of course has nothing to do that you are a notorious liar who tries to change terms all the time in your own personal favour and once people adress it they are racist. I'm now an known extortionist.You know if you claim i'm an known extortionist how does it come i'm not banned from this forum and actually have a good relationship with the admin ?  Seems funny because you don't even let people post their concerns on your telegram channel but instantly ban them and all their content with the explanation they are racist.  I tell you something Jenkins you have the brain of a monkey.I call you monkey not because you are black but because you have the IQ of a monkey.Thinking you are smart and that you can manipulate people with your reasonable ton where you are on of the biggest cheater on the forum.  I exposed enough scams here and you are one of them   Hey monkey how does it come you have paid royalties and not a single coin of goldma has been bought from these royalties even they are offered for $0.00012 per token (ico price $0.13) ?

When asked if it will be 20% of a yearly profit as 4 times adding 5% of quaterly profit is not 20% your monkey team instantly banned me since they are even unable to do proper math.  You were forced to announce later that it will be 20% yearly profit seeing we collected all evidences but still your scammy team tried to implement a 5% yearly royalty which is a total scam and avoided answering direct questions if its a 20% royalty which everyone understood this way which everyone can check on ico ratings websites.

You can't lie math.And you are right thats the beautiful on blockchain that you can explore everything.  The community waited for a long time for the token burn and were surpised 400 million tokens left where everyone only thought it will be arround 80 millions. Kind of some diffrence don't you think ?The number 80 million was through multiple times in your telegram group and as always if you can't say something good better sit calm and sit it out. Because your team had not the guts to inform the community there will be 400 million tokens. The community got that info from me when checking the explorer. Everyone myself included thought it will be arround 80 million tokens in total. So seeing 400 million token i instantly started digging from where the amount came and i found its from pre-ico and early investors. Even if i take the $8.1 million USD funding from main ico where the price per coin was $0.13 then i come thanks to math which you can't cheat to an average price of arround $0.026 per token.Thats already only 1/5 of the orginal ico price.This means you have sold the token clearly under $0.02 .Of course you deny numbers but you are not willing to provide any legit numbers.The fact is its proofen the average token price was under $0.026 .Thats the reason people are selling the token so cheap because they got it for peanuts.You raped all main ico investors. And your propaganda manipulation about value from royalty ?  Which value are you talking about ?Your other rape attempt to only pay 5% yearly royalty ?Who was it who forced you to go back to 20% yearly royalty ?Me ? And your royalty joke royalty of what ?Of numbers you take out of your dark ass ?No legitimicy no nothing.You just put numbers in the air and everyone needs to accept it.  But to show how great your royalty is even with my 20% yearly profit share : You mined in the first quater 0.5kg gold.Thats an value of arround $20k . From that we need to take away all mining cost etc which will be arround 50%.But lets even assume you had no cost and its pure profit. So from that $20k token investors will get 5%.Thats $1000 profit shared to all investors for a whole quater. So thats $1000/400.000.000 gma tokens = $0.0000025 per token.   Let's assume i invested $130.000 when buying 1.000.000 gma token. What will be my profit for this quater ?    $2.5 USD !!!!!!!  WOW what a great value you loser represent and these numbers are numbers without minding and running cost.    Quote None of our team members are citizens of the UK nor SA.

So from that $1.000.000 all token owners will receive 20% (if it won't go down back to 5%) thats $200.000 profit sharing a year.   From these $200.000k profit you need to share it to all 400 million tokens.   So what will the investor receive who bought 1 million gma token for $130.000 ?  He will receive when Jenkins will be able to increase his production by 5000% a yearly profit share of $500 for his invested $130.000 .

Asshole Jenkins is claiming the company existed before and there was some grade of equipment (like a shovel LOL ) So Mr Jenkins even if thats true where does the other 80% of royalty goes to ?20% royalty was only for ico investors reserved. You already trying to lower it to 5% showed you are clearly trying to scam the funds. Next big point Your website and whitepaper which have been safed clearly state that main ico investors will own 51% of all tokens.How does it come they don't own it ?  Ohhh you increase back the royalty from 5% to 20% but are now in control of majority of tokens which means you still pay only 5% royalty because the rest goes back to your own tokens.   Mr Jenkins your own community said its a scam and they wouldn't have invested if they would know about it.  The SEC has been informed.You are aware you offered as a US citizen a SECURITY token. I'm pretty sure they will be very interrested with your full explanation.    Best joke of all.To not get massivly attacked when the main ico investors would get their royalty Jenkins made the manipulation to not include tokens from the 2 people who hold 97% and any account bigger than 2 million tokens so all the main ico investors who only got a few tokens for their big money won't explode because of madness to increase their first quater payout by 7 times.   P.S We are looking for more information from Mr Edmoore.If somebody has more info about him please share it by sending a PM to me.   BTW Mr scammer Jenkins sold the fact that 95% of all tokens are hold by 2 people who got the tokens for way under 1/6 of the regular price as something good.  LOL Monkey Brain Jenkins,False

We are already in the talk with a blockchain lawyer from Philadelphia US .  Also i will call tomorrow with Engelman to talk about investors situation and we plan to write an offical letter with all the broken claims ,false promises and unethical practise to Tawanda A.Chiurayi  I'm pretty sure he will be able to explain to the dumb goldma CEO what a binding contract is and what it means to break it when calling themself a security token.    Only as a side note. According to their whitepaper they wanted to issue 730 million gma tokens  51% should go to main ico investors 25.5% should go to pre-ico investors which price was $0.13 + up to 35% bonus 20.4% early investors .   Thats means that from 730 million  372 million should go to main ico investors                                                186 million to pre-ico investors                                                149 million to early investors.   Since the big bag holders can't be ico or pre ico investors how does it come they own nearly 385 million tokens if the whitepaper clearly states early investor will have a max of 149 million tokens.   The scammer Jenkins broke his whitepaper so often that he had to edit his whitepaper already several times after the ico ended. He thinks he can just change a binding contract by editing it without investors consent.  Like i said a monkey brain.   Depending on the US lawyers decission we may also hire a lawyer in Zimbabwe where goldma's hq is located.",False

Since there is no more buyback so the tokens value is now only based on 5% yearly royalty.   Let's assume that thanks to black magic this project gets a BIG success and is even able to gain $100.000.000 PROFIT per year.  What would be your share for making everything possible ?The company is making $100 million usd profit and the share per token would be   $100.000.000 /730.000.000 /20 (5%) =     0,0068 USD per token or 5 million usd for all token holders which gave majority of funding compared to $95.000.000 to the company owner. I guess anybody knows what kind of gold companies do $100.000.000 profit per year ?Nearly none .But even if goldma would achieve $100 million profit your fucking share for that success would be a miserable $0,0068 per token.  Would it be 20% yearly profit sharing as advertised on their website and on ICO review websites the share per token would be $0,0272 per token which would be more adeqet to the money invested but still nothing comparable with old investment methods.Here you got no company share and no voting rights.   Isn't it a great money grab where majority is being taken from the ico owner ? I never saw a worse investment than that one if we talk about real numbers.  And the greed knows no limits which just proofed us the whitepaper v11  They basicly turned a 20% yearly profit royalty + 20% gross revenue buy back into a 5% yearly profit royalty just by changing after the ICO their whitepaper not even informing the community about it.

The change is dramatic. At least to those who can see it. Look, a lot of people are shy to call their tokens security tokens for reasons I won't get into here. However, the GMA token is unique not only because we are honest about ours being a security token, but there's a viable cash flow associated with holding the token.  Let me flesh that out a little more. If you buy many of the tokens that are out there on the market, financially speaking, your bet is that it increases in price and then you sell it off. You don't get another benefit to holding the token. With the GMA token, though, you get a quarterly payout.

Our value is immediately digitized onto the blockchain which enables the commodification of gold and overcome the volatility of cryptocurrency which will allow smaller investors to partake in the gold mining sector.

In other words, a pound of gold could make 45 coins. The next revaluation occurred during the reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (211-217 A.D.). He debased the value to 50 coins for a pound of gold, making each coin worth less and the price of gold worth more. Diocletian (284-305 A.D.) further debased gold to 60, then Constantine the Great (306-337 A.D.) debased it to 70. They did this to finance the military so they could stay in power. They also increased taxes.  These emperors lowered the value of the currency so much it created hyperinflation. To give you an idea, in 301 A.D., one pound of gold was worth 50,000 denarii (another coin based on silver). By 337 it was worth 20 million denarii. As the price of gold rose, so did the price of everything else. Middle-class people could not afford their daily needs. That's one reason the Roman Empire began to crumble.

In history, back in ancient Rome, the Emperor Augustus (30 B.C.-14 A.D.) set the price of gold at 45 coins to the pound.  In other words, a pound of gold could make 45 coins. The next revaluation occurred during the reign of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (211-217 A.D.). He debased the value to 50 coins for a pound of gold, making each coin worth less and the price of gold worth more. Diocletian (284-305 A.D.) further debased gold to 60, then Constantine the Great (306-337 A.D.) debased it to 70. They did this to finance the military so they could stay in power. They also increased taxes.  These emperors lowered the value of the currency so much it created hyperinflation. To give you an idea, in 301 A.D., one pound of gold was worth 50,000 denarii (another coin based on silver). By 337 it was worth 20 million denarii. As the price of gold rose, so did the price of everything else. Middle-class people could not afford their daily needs. That's one reason the Roman Empire began to crumble.  So even back during this time Gold was used as a medium of exchange and a store of value. Also, this is an example of what can happen to a nation when the government does the above.",False

So, even though the idea of defining the value of the dollar in terms of the value of a fixed weight of gold is not a radical notion, the cost of coping with the economic chaos is enormous and growing, showing up in many different ways.

It makes me think about other factors also such as: One of the most common criticisms of Bitcoin is that it is not backed by anything, nor is it intrinsically valuable. However, others have long been arguing that the US dollar has no intrinsic value and neither does gold. But to really answer this question, this analogy is too flat. True, the US dollar is not directly backed by a useful commodity but rather indirectly by a very large user base and indirectly with the GDP of a whole country and its resources. Gold on the other hand was used for decorative purposes and a payment method for millenniums. Bitcoin advocates argue that Bitcoin is backed by a predictable supply over time. This allows to plot the supply schedule of Bitcoin, meaning it is highly predictable while also being uncheatable through the manipulation found in traditional monetary policies.

It's very very likely that the profits will be impressive. It's well worth paying attention to this project. To the best of my knowledge, there's no other project quite like it. Instead of buying gold from elsewhere, the value underlying the GMA token is mined right out of the ground. For investors, this means a much greater probability of success, and high returns as well.

Gold - Gold is recognized as a having a long-term record of stability. The U.S. has had a completely paper-based currency for 45 years, while gold has been a medium of global exchange for more than 5,000 years. What I'm trying to say is people look for is something that’s an insurance policy, an asset that holds its value in times of trouble,”You don’t want uncertain reserve assets.” With a track record of more than 5,000 years, gold could be the opposite of “uncertain.”  2. Transparency - Goldma is also valuable because of its transparency... Most ICOs are the opposite of Transparent, With Goldma just opening the white paper reveals a world of information about the project, Goldma invites people to come and see their mine and offices and they are so transparent to the extent that the will open their books and for you down to the receipts!! So yes I agree with you Reuben when you say this is the best project ever!",False

Transparency is a major thing! Goldma is transparent because there is a solid belief in metrics here. Promises have to be measurable and then quantified. That makes it easy to see what's actually happening. The reports about what's happening at the mine will be available.  Obviously I can't ignore the hard data you're alluding to. The US Dollar has lost an incredible amount of value ever since 1971, when former US President Nixon did away with the gold standard. Beyond ease of transaction (only one of the requirements we expect from money), the American Dollar isn't worth very much. That's a shock to a lot of people but imagine this: if you had US$100 in 1971, it'll only be worth about $2 today (not a great store of value!!). Inflation is REAL!",False

With that being said I can quote Forbes Michael Roney and say Gold is not a fiat currency. Fiat currencies derive their worth from the issuing government. Unlike paper money, gold cannot be expanded to suit the needs of struggling central banks. Due to its inherent scarcity, gold will always be supported. This precious metal has maintained its purchasing power over long periods of time, unlike all of the fiat paper currencies that have been introduced over the years.",False

That dramatic loss of value is hard for many to grasp. I suppose it's because the drama didn't unfold instantaneously. Rather, it was incremental and over a considerably long period of time. Permit a seemingly odd aside. The human brain finds it difficult to understand incremental change. Our brains notice instant change much better.  However, the important change happens, drip by drip, over a long period of time. That's what happened to the dollar. Drip by drip, year by year, there's been an erosion of the dollar's value. Shifting away from the US for a minute, imagine what happens to other countries' currencies. Go look at the rate of inflation in Venezuela. Remember what happened in Zimbabwe. Fiat currencies are bad instruments of holding value over the medium to long term.  Yet another thing to remember is that your financial objectives may differ quite violently to those of the central bank in your country (or of any country in the world for that matter). Let's say they're tasked by the government to increase employment or 'boost' economic activity. They may turn to increasing the supply of money (by manipulating interest rates) in the economy. The result of that is decreasing the value of your currency holdings. The changes may not appear big in the moment but, rest assured, over time, you will lose a sizeable chunk of value.",False

To add to the above post - remember - The largest banks in the United States would have collapsed in 2008 if not for government bailouts in the form of expanded deposit insurance, guaranteed money market funds, zero interest rates, quantitative easing, foreign central bank swap lines, and other monetary gymnastics. Bank depositors in Cyprus in 2013, and Greece in 2015, received a painful education in the difference between a bank deposit and money. In both cases, banks were closed, ATMs were shut down, and paper currency was soon in short supply. In Cyprus, some depositors had their deposits forcibly converted to bank stock. In Greece, local credit cards could not be processed and a quasi-barter economy quickly emerged - much like Venuzuela - today!  In conclusion, this is a strong case for the Goldma token and why such the Goldma business model will become an important contributor to the blockchain ecosystem.",False

This will allow the GMA token holder to not only store value but it also gives the GMA token holder the added benefit of earning revenue from the net profits of the gold mine.

With regard to understanding what Minxcon is or is not, my understanding was hampered by the fact their webpage secondary links did not work.  I missed the relevant cited statement and usually rely on a secondary verification.   I did in fact intend to contact them to verify who they are etc.  I do think my cautionary stand based simply on non-functional secondary links such as contact info was warranted as this is strange for an operating business.    With regard to your disclaimer, I guess the bottom line is it is up to the investor to do the research anyway, and unlike many ICOs you gave sufficient information to do a deeper review.  Your clarification about David Drake having no part of the operation or management of the company, well...point is taken and clarification accepted.    With regard to your risk profile, I did also agree that your strategy describes a real product, process, and opportunity which is much better than the non-sense offered in most ICOs.    Perhaps I should have better said high risk/possible high reward/business case better documented better than vast majority of ICOs on BCT.

I do not take your time for granted. I completely understand that you are entitled and most welcome to your own opinion. However, I respectfully submit that your analysis is a bit one-sided and contains some inaccurate information. First, Minxcon is not a mining company. They clearly state on their website that they are a mining consulting company involved in project management and exploration. They are Not a mining company. They are one of the top consulting companies in the mining sectors with top mining companies as their clients.  Secondly, your point regarding our disclaimer is also one-sided because you fail to mention that this project offers a security token. Thus we can not use any other language to state our claims otherwise we would not be compliant in many jurisdictions including the country of Zimbabwe. I am a law abiding, U.S. citizen and a veteran of the U.S. Army, so its very important to me to comply to all laws and regulations.  Regarding David Drake, he is merely an advisor not part of our Corporate board here in Zimbabwe. He only advises us regarding the ICO and is not involved in our gold mining operations. He is involvement with other projects has no bearing with respect to our validity nor our success. You are accurate when you say we are legit. And like most ICO's - it mostly deemed as high risk. But I submit that our risk profile is much better than others who rely on market adoption and/or have no MVP or working product.",False

Gold mining company stocks may correlate with the gold price. However, the growth and return in the stock depend on the expected future earnings of the company, not just on the value of gold. Factors such as effective management, production costs, reserves, mine exploration and project development, and hedging activities are some of the factors to consider when deciding whether to buy gold mining stocks. As such, investments in gold and gold mining companies are often used as complementary investments.  The gold mining sector is large with over 300 gold mining companies listed and publicly traded. Market values of mining companies range from micro-cap companies to those with a market capitalisation larger than US$10 billion.    Established indices that provide benchmarks of global gold mining share performance include: FTSE Gold Mines Index, S&P/TSX Capped Gold Index, Philadelphia Gold and Silver Index, and the NYSE Arca Gold BUGS Index.""  However, to invest in a gold mine in Zimbabwe - there isn't a trusted means to invest into a gold mine in Zimbabwe. No indices, no Gold Index and no S&P. So, we provide a means to invest into Zimbabwe's vast gold mining market via blockchain technology. That's the difference. Hopefully, I explained it well enough.   ",False

The people that see asset-based cryptocurrency as the future are brilliant! As I said in the video, we are combining the best attributes of gold and cryptocurrency. Thus, it resolves the issue of cryptocurrency not having 'intrinsic value' by tying it to gold. But, we've taken it a bit further in our model.  Thinking as an investor, CEO and a developer, I 'not only' wanted a means to store/save the money that I earned. I wanted my savings to earn me a decent, consistent return. That's why our model is based on the net profit earnings of the gold mine. This is the genius in our model. Because everyone knows that the market/demand for gold is global and has been in demand for centuries. We never have to worry whether people will buy/adopt our product (gold) - companies, governments, and individuals are always waiting to purchase it 24/7.  There are some who misunderstand that we are storing gold in some vault in Zimbabwe. That is incorrect. We are not storing any gold. We are immediately selling the gold to the Reserve Bank and buying Ether with the cash that we are paid. So, we don't have to worry about the security aspect of storing the gold. Our value is immediately digitized onto the blockchain. So, you are not saving to just save your value (in some vault), you are actually saving to earn a return! Whether the market goes up or down it allows us to give our GMA token holders a 5% royalty (in the form of Ether) every quarter. You do the math - how much is that annually?   - God Bless the Blockchain!!   ",False
