Because of this, many of the resources available of those systems are left underutilized. Imagine an existing GPU-mining rig simultaneously mining cryptocurrencies and also doing other processing tasks like machine learning and offering co-processing power - while being rewarded for both activities – making the RIGs even more profitable. This machine learning will produce “machine skills” to be used in Artificial Intelligence processes. Who ever adds the code for the machine learning into the blockchain gains Skill Rewards when the new machine skills are used on a new dataset. This process runs on a Distributed Infrastructure As A Service architecture, splitting the workload between multiple mining rigs, while optimizing for shortest run time on minimal data traffic. This entire system is called Knowledge As A Service, and represents the backbone of KAASY, the decentralized AI assistant that you can employ to do tasks for you.

We intend to develop an ecosystem of open-source and commercial applications which will create thousands of high-salary jobs in the next 5 to 10 years in companies all around the world. These companies will capitalize on the opportunity AI is today, creating better products, faster and potentially cheaper. We desire to construct the early building blocks for the Earth AGI. This may well be in the three most important developments of the early third millennium, alongside bioengineering and becoming a multi-planetary species   Token distribution 60% will be distributed in the pre-ICO and ICO phases, to investors, available for trading 15 days after the ICO finishes 15% will be distributed to the Founding Team & Advisors - 2-year linear vesting process, issued monthly, via a smart contract 7.5% are allocated for marketing purposes and public AI awareness projects 5% will be allocated to a fund for University grants 5% will be reserved as Skill Rewards, for adding new skills in the new KaaS blockchain, before the public post-beta release 4.5% will be reserved for hackathons and bug bounty programs 3% will be allocated for legal fees and as a backup fund   Kaasy - Knowledge as a Service One of the most exciting technologies in development today is Artificial Intelligence (IA). To create it, however, many elements and ""skills"" based on the concept of ""machine learning"" are needed. This process requires the accumulation of a large number of computers to devote time and processing power. At the same time, cryptomonas know an accelerated development, with hundreds of thousands of processors being used for mining. Kaasy is a project that wants to combine the two aspects of the technological revolution that will provide valuable long-term benefits.  What is Kaasy Kaasy is a platform that allows mining to be fully exploited. It does so by using them simultaneously in cryptomonade mining and machine-learning activities. The platform offers rewards both for processing power loan and for adding blockchain to developed skills.  Problem Today, thousands of computers are used for mining cryptomonas. However, neither the GPU nor the other components of the platforms have been built specifically for this purpose. For this reason, many of the available resources of these systems are not being used efficiently.  The solution The Kaasy network allows the use of mining equipment for additional machine learning activities. This will produce useful results for the development of the IA.  The blocking store that keeps the Kaasy registry will store both leased processing payments and optimized algorithms to run the distributed calculations.  Algorithms are organized as a decentralized market. Here, anyone can add a new algorithm and can earn rewards when it is used by a member of the network.  The goal of Kaasy.ai team is to develop a blockchain of knowledge in which existing and new algorithms can be used for machine learning. There will be produced such IA skills that can be used by the entire community.  token This whole system is called ""Knowledge as a Service"". It is the backbone of Kaasy, the IA assistant that can be used to perform different tasks.  The KAAS Token will be the only currency in which users will pay for processing time to perform their tasks through decentralized infrastructure.  The project will be funded through an ICO that runs from 1 September to 15 October. The token price is 0.1 euro and 300 million KAAS were sold.  Team The team behind the project consists of experienced programmers and Romanian businessmen. They have developed desktop, web and integrated solutions, ranging from distributed company financial management software to online cryptomontage trading applications, mining pools, and mining hardware.  conclusion Kaasy offers the opportunity to develop basic IA applications using GPU and CPU cores. Developed Skills are stored on a blockchain and can be used by other community members, and their developers are rewarded for doing so.  The Blockchain and KaaS network define the infrastructure for a global knowledge-based computing IA based on the hardware currently used for cryptomonade mining. [/list]",False
