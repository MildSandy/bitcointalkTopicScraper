CrowdIF is the only crypto trading platform which is capable of objectively gathering something as abstract as market sentiment and quantify it. We call this quantified market sentiment - The SentimentScore. This is our secret rocket fuel.  As is widely known, market sentiment plays a vital role in defining the direction of crypto market movements. Capitalizing upon SentimentScore gives CrowdIF a superpower and allows it to consistently outperform market with better results than using the conventional techniques.  The Problem  New markets, Old methods The biggest problem today with most crypto trading entities both individual and institutional is trying to re-use strategy from stock markets in crypto markets.  Though this approach may work on-and-off, it's far from perfect. We strongly believe that using applying stock market strategy to crypto markets is NOT the best way forward.  That's because stock markets are fundamentally different from crypto markets in many ways  Fundamental differences between stock and cryptocurrency  - Stake ownership in Stock Markets vs. Token Ownership in Crypto Markets - Much higher volatility of Crypto markets = Higher Profit Potential but neccesitates different strategy - Asset Supply: Fixed (for most part) in crypto vs. Variable in stocks - Differences in terms of trade fluidity - Differences in trade fee and commissions (This can have a huge impact on strategy especially on zero fee exchanges in crypto)  NEW markets need NEW methods Studying the current crypto trading landscape makes it clear that there is a definite void here.  Very few, if any companies are focusing on building tools and strategy that's tailor-made for crypto trading. The need of the hour is to identify the subtle differences that make crypto trading unique and carve out tools that address this uniqueness. The need is a platform that takes advantage of these differences rather than being defeated by them  The Solution  What if there was a way to PREDIT, with great ACCURACY, the direction of crypto price movements for the coming few days and weeks? What would it take to build a platform like that?  It would take identifying the very fundamentals that make the crypto markets move.  Upon careful study, it becomes amply clear that unlike stock market, investor sentiment plays a very big role in deciding the direction of the price movement for any cryptocurrency.  A company's stock value is directly linked to the company's overall valuation, which in turn is a function of company fundamentals and the company's performance & products. For cryptocurrencies however, it's important to understand that the price of a particular coin is not directly linked to the valuation of the company behind it. Whereas stock markets rely more on company's performance, the crypto market is driven primarily by public sentiment.  Therefore, we decided to tap into the very foundation of cryptocurrency price movement - Market Sentiment.  The CrowdIF Process CrowdIF harnesses the Collective Intelligence of Crowd by following a four step process  1. High Quality Data Aggregation The system aggreates huge amounts of realtime data from all across the internet using advanced crawling and scraping algorithms. We also seek help from our users in our data aggregation efforts. The users who contribute to this process are rewarded with CIFcoins  2. Realtime Sentiment Analysis We use some sophisticated cutting-edge techniques like Natural Language Processing with advanced mathematical modeling to perform realtime sentiment analysis on what's HOT and what's NOT. This analysis gives us our proprietary ""Sentiment Score"" which is our secret rocket fuel.  3. Accurate Price Predictions The sentiment analysis results are combined with all other market signals to make price movement predictions with unprecedented accuracy.  4. Insight based Trading Our smart trading algorithms use the insights generated above to trade 24x7 across multiple cryptocurrency markets around the globe.  The CIF ICO Besides the trading engine, CrowdIF is also launching a blockchain based crypto token - The CIFcoin.  The CIFcoin has the following purposes: - To function as a medium of value exchange for all transactions happening on the CrowdIF platform - To act as an index of users' portfolio on CrowdIF platform - To reward the users who help CrowdIF in its data aggregation efforts - To reward the beneficiaries of our various other bounty programs  Here are some other details about the CIF ICO:  Total tokens available for ICO = 16.6 million (40% of the total supply)  ICO Round 1 25th June 2018  Token Price: 0.80$ - 1.25$ Tokens available for sale: 1,600,000  ICO Round 2 30th June 2018  Token Price: 1.26$ - 1.50$ Tokens available for sale: 5,000,000   ICO Round 3 5th July 2018  Token Price: 1.51$-2.00$ Tokens available for sale: 10,000,000  Minimum purchase = 70$  Soft Cap = $4,500,000  Hard Cap = $26,015,000  Token distribution For sale during ICO period - 40% Company reserve - 15% Bounty Programs - 6% ESOPs - 4% Planned slow emission over the next 10 years - 35%  Fund Allocation The funds raised during the ICO will be allocated to the following purposes:  Core SentimentScore Algorithm Development: 34% Advertising and Marketing: 28% Data Aggregation Technology Development: 14% Technology Infrastructure (Clusters, Servers etc.): 12% Operational Expenses: 9% Other Payroll: 2% Legal: 1%  Team  Anton Berislav - CEO  A pioneer in the world of blockchain technologies, having participated in blockchain activities from the early days, Anton is pleased to bring to your Crowd IF, a sensational, innovative project that has the ability to predict the world of cryptocurrency which has never before been demonstrated till date.
