Modex: Meet the Future of Block Chain technology    A few years back, in October 2008, when blockchain technology was originally created, the idea was to decentralize peer-to-peer transactions. But today, this advanced technology is used to enhance security and add a layer of transparency to the business sector, while ensuring data immutability. Currently, this ground breaking technology facilitates the creation of innovative applications called 'Smart Contracts' - the next generation of blockchain tech that enables business leaders and end-customers to transform their traditional and standard paper-based contracts into digital forms.  Developed on top of a blockchain network, a smart contract is a computer code that contains a set of rules under which parties agree to interact with each other. It transfers and validates digital assets under specific conditions and allows buyers and sellers to make trustworthy and legally-binding agreements on a peer-to-peer level. With advantages such as providing direct business facility between buyers and sellers, eliminating third-party involvement, and  eliminating extra costs, smart contracts have become an eye-catching application of blockchain technology for both business leaders and end-customers worldwide alike.  However, the situation was not the same two years ago. Though smart contracts were popular at that time, their accessibility was not very prevalent. Due to the lack of proper channels and platforms, it was difficult for business leaders and end-users to access smart contracts and optimize their benefits. Mihai Ivascu, a rising and vibrant entrepreneur, saw this challenge as an opportunity and decided to develop an app store where he could easily facilitate the adoption of blockchain technology and its application (smart contracts)  on a large scale.  In 2017, Mihai launched Modex - a complete ecosystem which enables developers, teams, and businesses of all sizes to learn, create, test, deploy, and sell smart contracts and decentralized apps in one place. Based in London, UK, the company offers Modex Marketplace - the world’s first smart contract and DApps marketplace - to developers where they can write, test,  deploy, and sell smart contracts and DApps to companies and end-users in broad-range. In addition, Modex offers other platforms including Modex Dev platform, Modex Enterprise, Modex Academy, and Modex Community to bridge the gap between developers and end-users and bring the benefits of blockchain technology to the real world.  Modex Dev: developers' choice  Nowadays, businesses are no longer using the paper-based contract method for maintaining records and confidential information.  Due to recent advancements in technology, companies are actively searching for new ways to streamline their operations and increase productivity, and many are moving towards smart contract solutions to achieve this goal.  Concerning this issue, Modex Dev, is an ideal platform for developers. Designed by placing developer’s requirements at the center, it is an opportunity-based platform that includes project repository, issue tracking, project documentation, and collaboration tools— these are some of the functionalities they can access in the Modex Dev Platform to develop the next generation of smart contracts and DApps. Mihai states that “Our blockchain development platform has been engineered with developers' needs in mind: to enable them to create the next generation of smart contracts and decentralized apps (DApps).” It creates an environment which includes a full suite of free tools: IDE, Test Net, Source Code Auditing, and Suite of Oracles—which developers can use to write, test, publish, , and sell smart contracts in the Modex Marketplace to companies and end-users. Moreover, it helps developers to showcase their programming skills and creativity and monetize them to generate revenue. Mihai underlines that “70% of the revenue goes to developers and 30% to Modex. Out of this 30 %, 15% goes to the Community Pool in order to support developer-related initiatives, dedicated events, etc.”  Modex Blockchain as a database (BCDB): differentiating factor  In this ultra-competitive business environment, there are many companies that offer similar solutions to compete in the market. But one major aspect which makes Modex unparalleled in the market is Modex Blockchain as a database (BCDB).  Modex BCDB is a platform that will significantly help speed up the adoption of blockchain at enterprise level, with core functionalities that add value to new and existing products, making them blockchain-ready. Modex BCDB is highly innovative solution goes beyond the state of the art by facilitating migration from classic client-server database products to a distributed blockchain-based back-end engine and by mixing the standard database engines with blockchain features in order to obtain decentralization, data integrity assurance, high availability and scalability, improved security, and a new way to manage business data records. Modex BCDB wasn’t designed to eliminate databases, which are essential for any enterprise, but to mix standard database engines with blockchain features. Modex BCDB presents itself in a similar way to any database engine, so implementing it into new projects will require minimal effort. For existing products, the required change of connection from the database to Modex BCDB can be more or less complicated, depending on how the software product is designed; a good design will facilitate a faster transition.  Modex Blockchain as a database is a game- changing solution for businesses in the market. It is a software product designed to support businesses that wish to migrate from client-server database oriented products to a distributed blockchain based back-end engine. It is a combination of two worlds: the blockchain framework and traditional database components. The blockchain framework brings unbeatable advantages to businesses - data immutability, data integrity, data traceability, distribution, and decentralization - while traditional database components offer big data storage and quick data access for businesses.  When talking about the additional advantages of Modex BCDB, Mihai highlights the following: “Transparency (all parties using the system will have the possibility to maintain their own nodes/data and confront on shared data transactions) and real-time backup (use as many network nodes as you need to store business data in real time).” With its wide array of services, Modex has become a fully-fledged blockchain company and a focal point of blockchain development in the country. It delivers an affordable and efficient solution to developers, enabling them to build viable blockchain-based applications in the market. Mihai adds: “Modex, the blockchain company, offers fully integrated services designed to solve the last mile adoption problem of the blockchain.”  But that’s not the end!  Moving towards a sustainable growth  Mihai emphasizes: ""The journey has been amazing so far. Modex has grown immensely in the market."" To continue this growth, the company has strategically charted out a roadmap for its future. In the second quarter of this year, the company will launch Live Net— an Ethereum network which does not require Gas for DApps and DApps at the IDE level. Furthermore, it will implement the Modex Academy, extensively. Through Modex Academy, the company will focus on the educational system to promote blockchain and its related courses amongst interested developers, while also targeting non-tech individuals with a curriculam designed to introduce them to the core concepts of this revolutionary technology.  Mihai Ivascu: “The Blockchain Business Analyst Course will help non-technical individuals understand, master and apply blockchain technology in the real world. The course has been purposely designed to target individuals with no background in programming, it has a step-by-step approach and it strives to make blockchain understandable for anyone. After completing the course, you will be able to analyze and determine how to best apply this groundbreaking technology in order to streamline operations and increase productivity in your businesses.”   src : https://www.thetechnologyheadlines.com/magazine/subscription/web/shared/Modexdgd45dfg/  tw: https://twitter.com/modex_tech/status/1150677010374713344  tw https://twitter.com/TTHeadlines/status/1151129210645352448",False

The road to Startup Grind  Between March 25th and June 14th, Modex took part in the boot camp of Romanian Commercial Bank (BCR) InnovX accelerator program alongside other nine start-ups. Modex ensured its place at the Startup Grind Europe Conference by showcasing its new project, Modex BCDB, a solution which facilitates a seamless transition to a blockchain infrastructure.  InnovX is a business accelerator partnered with Mindspace, Startup Grind, European Center for Services Investments and Financing and other Financial Institutions from Bucharest which aims to attract the most promising startups from FinTech in Bucharest to access the European market and European Commission grants and loans for innovation.  Startup Grind Europe Conference  This year the Startup Grind Europe Conference aims to build upon the foundation laid in previous editions but increase in scope and magnitude. As such, the conference will welcome over 3 000 startups, investors and innovators at the London stage to shed light on the current situation and future of startups, venture capital, artificial intelligence, fintech and more. Key players in the industry will attend the events and act as speakers in order to talk about the latest trends and shifts in the market. Participants will get the opportunity to integrate into a cohesive and friendly environment, ideal for networking, building friendships, and of course engage in discussions and exchange ideas with like-minded individuals. What set Startup Grind apart from other similar events is a set of core values which they do not stray from: “We believe in making friends, not contacts. We believe in giving, not taking. We believe in helping others before helping yourself.”  2019 brings forth a series of changes. The Europe Conference Exhibitors list is split into two programs: grind and growth. Grind startups are earlier stage and have raised under USD 3 million in funding, whereas Growth startups are situated into their growth phase, having raised over USD 3 million. The top exhibiting startups (all Growth and Top 20 Grind) will also be inducted in the brand new, invite-only community, Accelerate. Accelerate is designed to give fast-growth startups from across the world the tools and resources they need to accelerate their business.  Modex at Startup Grind  Modex will be represented at the conference by CTO, Alin Iftemi and Head of Custom Development, Dragos Rautu who will set up an exhibition stand to showcase Modex Blockchain as a Database (BCDB), a new innovative take on blockchain integration which fuses the disruptive technology with a traditional database system.  In general, enterprise products are structured in three segments: a front end application, application server, and database. Modex BCDB is a solution which enhances the communication between the application server and database with a blockchain layer. This innovative approach allows companies to tap into the benefits of both worlds, to maintain the familiarity and advantages of a traditional database front end, with all the advantages of a blockchain back end. What makes Modex BCDB stand out is the fact that it has a minimally intrusive approach, which means that enterprises are not required to rewrite their entire database and migrate it to another system. Clients maintain their database framework and accumulate the advantages of blockchain technology, like data decentralization and immutability. Blockchain technology has a game-changing impact, but it is a waste of resources to migrate the whole database to the blockchain. With our system, clients are free to choose relevant data which makes sense to be on the blockchain, cryptographically secure it and control access through a permission management system.  Modex BCDB is system agnostic. This means that we are able to connect our blockchain solution to every relevant database from the market with a plug and play approach to implementation, which drastically reduces the transition process from a couple of months to a matter of hours.   src : https://blog.modex.tech/modex-is-gearing-up-for-london-startup-grind-66c9d86e2ed5  https://twitter.com/modex_tech/status/1136220869796225024",False

On the Emerging Tech stage, Florin Otto, VP of product at Modex, together with Dan Popescu, Software Tech Lead, held a keynote on blockchain technology.  Held in June every year, DevTalks Bucharest becomes, for two days, a stage for the most powerful network of software developers in Romania where the most important local and international key-leaders from the industry connect to the latest trends in technology and contribute to the future of the tech industry. DevTalks 2019 managed to surpass previous editions in scope and dimension, welcoming over 100 international and local speakers with 12 curated conferences targeting some of the hottest topics in the tech world: Dev Ops, Emerging Technologies, Web, Smart Everything, Java, SAP Tech, Product Management, Digital Transformation, QA&Testing, Mobile, Security, Big Data & Cloud.  The two-day event welcomed an abundance of people, developers, IT professionals, students, entrepreneurs and millennials to a wide variety of interactive and fascinating demos, presentation booths and case studies, where they’ve discussed and learned more about innovative technologies and their real-world application.  Demystifying blockchain  Modex was represented at the event by Florin Otto, VP of product, and Dan Popescu, Software Tech Lead, who were on a mission to debunk common myths and misconceptions regarding blockchain, and share their knowledge with participants eager to learn more about the disruptive capabilities of a technology which positions itself as one of the main actors in the upcoming technological revolution. To achieve this goal, Modex representatives set up an exhibition stand, welcoming people interested to discover more about blockchain. “People showed real interest towards the technology, and a large majority were eager to find out how they can get hands-on experience with blockchain. We guided them to the Modex Platform, where they can use our tools to experiment and familiarize themselves with blockchain development”, stated Dan Popescu.  On the second day of the event, Florin Otto and Dan Popescu took the stage during the Emerging Technologies conference and hosted a keynote on blockchain, during which they showcased a general overview of the technology, its main features and the inner workings that makes them possible. The keynote offered a glimpse at the history of the technology, and the different generations of blockchain that appeared over the years, illustrating how each iteration expanded the scope and functionality. The first generation of blockchain, represented by Bitcoin, started the cryptocurrency craze, the second generation of blockchains, Ethereum, saw a shift to a switch army knife approach, and an explosion in the functionality dimension with the emergence of smart contracts and DApps. And the third generation of blockchains which aim to solve scalability, interoperability and sustainability issues. The last segment of the presentation underlined how enterprise-grade blockchains and the value it can add to companies and businesses. “I am delighted to say that during the Q&A session that followed our keynote the audience approached us with various questions, regarding the internal mechanism of blockchain and the applicability of the technology in the real world. I’d like to congratulate the hosts for doing an excellent job organizing the event, and for giving us the opportunity to spread the blockchain message further”, added Florin Otto.  About Modex  Blockchain company Modex is promoting the adoption of blockchain technology and strongly believes in a future built around blockchain.

Not to mention that you would require government level spending in order to maintain and operate such a machine. This factor alone significantly diminishes the threat posed by quantum computers, they aren’t available to anyone. On the other hand, blockchain technology already has 10 years under its belt, and is constantly evolving, becoming more complex. When quantum computers become available, in 20 to 30 years, blockchain and public key cryptography will also become much more advanced than what we have today.” Read the more here: https://blog.modex.tech/quantum-computing-and-blockchain-technology-41fbffb4fde5",False

In 1920, the Automobile Club de l’Est worked to launch a competition whose character was to contribute to the development of technical progress and promote the growth of the automobile. In 1922, the Club announced the creation of a new type of competition in the Sarthe, a test of endurance. During the race, the teams of two drivers per car rotate day and night for 24 hours.  The diverse line-up attracts a wide audience and the difference in speed means plenty of overtaking and traffic management, which adds to the excitement of the race. https://blog.modex.tech/modex-is-supporting-the-former-le-mans-winner-gustavo-menezes-driving-for-rebellion-42725e40384f",False

Its launch represents the most important step taken so far by Brazilian universities incorporating crypto-finance into their economics studies.  The program will provide students with research on cryptocurrency markets and industry from a more objective, academic perspective. Up until now, most of the research and knowledge gathered on crypto has been collected from a speculative perspective. The program’s coordinator, Ricardo Rochman, said it was born out of a recognizable need for specialized education in an industry less than 10 years old: “It is a market with a profound lack of people with expertise. Cryptofinance has economic and financial fundamentals that are worth discussing, researching, and taught.”  Students welcomed the news. “There is a conceptual gain of knowing both the practical applications of the technology and cryptocurrency as an alternative investment”, said Michele Araujo, a 26-year-old student of Economics at Fundacao Getulio Vargas (FGV). Sao Paulo is also the birthplace of Formula E champion and Modex Ambassador Lucas di Grassi. In his career, Lucas won multiple races in single-seaters and sports cars, also winning the 2016–2017 Formula E Driver’s Championship.  Looking at the big picture, Brazil is the country with the largest crypto market in South America. The Brazilian government has taken a rather cautionary attitude towards cryptocurrency, but the population remains bullish when it comes to this topic. According to a Bitcoin.com report from early January, there are “at least twice as many Bitcoin traders in Brazil as stock investors.” Fundacao Getulio Vargas is not the only education institution which focuses on integrating crypto-finance into their economics studies. Cambridge University has conducted substantial research into the crypto-finance field, while Swiss university Lucerne also accepts Bitcoin payments for tuition fees.",False

It's like every business building their own accounting software from scratch instead of just buying it. On the other hand, blockchain developers need to monetize their skills and be able to sell the same smart contract multiple times, just like with regular apps and software.

Will he have any time conflicts with that?  Thanks [/quote]  Hi, sorry i missed this one earlier in the trail. I was one of the (many) advisors on Humaniq which was a very good learning experience as one of the relatively early ICO and we gaineda  lot of knowldeg on structures, setups, marketing etc. My role at Humaniq was very much advisory with input as and when needed based on my focus and skills. For Modex, I have been pretty much full time from Dec 16, was one of the initial 3 equity seed/angel investors and have been actively involved since Dec 16. No conflicts with Humaniq, the user bases and prodcust are also very differerent. I do though of course keep in regular contact with the guys like Dinis as we can all help and learn from each others experiences in this fast moving space Glad to see the good feedback on what we hope is a very successful project and something that really helps the community and the growth of smart contracts and blockchain implementation",False
