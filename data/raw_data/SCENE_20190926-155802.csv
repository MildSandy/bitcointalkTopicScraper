We are currently actively engaging with companies and entities that could form a synergy with Cryptoscene as ambassadors. Our goal is to launch the first batch of magazines (10.000 Pc.) within the Netherlands and spread them in a series of shops, banks, accountancy bureaus and high traffic locations. We will expand to Spain, UK, US and China in 2019 and have already established a partnership within Spain to distribute a special edition to cover the local developments Q1 2019.    https://i.imgur.com/UT5uV1A.png    Crypto is an online happening, we get that. But if you want this tech to appeal to the general public it must be done in a way that is traditional. Therefore we are working hard to release a magazine for everyone to share and talk about, highlighting interesting developments and explaining the blockchain from the ground up.  Next to the magazine we will create a mobile app where readers can further explore and be shown content that is aimed directly at them using the premises of an attention based economy similar to Steems'. The idea is that verified authors will be able to post content for beginners, intermediate and expert users. By letting the users vote and categorize articles and rewarding them on a monthly basis for actively participating we want to sustain a small economy using our designated SCENE tokens. By allowing users of different levels of understanding to browse in an environment customized to their needs we think the entry-point to joining the crypto-scene will be reduced and therefore we will ultimately open up the market to previously non-interested users.  Since we‚Äôve started as a team to build out our vision, there‚Äôs been many amazing talks and discussions surrounding the concept. As our most recent Medium article surrounding an advanced attention economy gave away, we want to really put that blockchain (Neblio) to good use.   https://i.imgur.com/xCaFBbG.png   The idea has thus far always been to create the online platform in the shape of a web-application. A user would register, select on what level of competence they are regarding blockchain‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand see content accordingly. Users could also register to work with us as an author as a ‚Äòbounty-hunter‚Äô, effectively earning themselves Cryptoscene‚Äôs designated token: SCENE. These tokens could then be used for a variety of things, but they would also function as voting power to categorize and/or up-vote articles of registered authors.  But if you‚Äôre going to let users vote on articles and potentially reward them for it, you have to be cautious for bots and scripts that could form a threat to the platform. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre going to leave the web-application out of the picture for now, but instead make it a more secure and user friendly mobile app.  Become an author  You can already register to write and create content with Cryptoscene to be published on our website to earn a minimum of 250 SCENE per article. We have a dedicated TG chat for this: https://t.me/cryptoscenewriters  To apply you will need to be literate, insightful, unbiased and above all able to create great content. Visuals will be done by us if needed.  Got an expertise? Use it. Articles can be written for 3 types of users: Beginner - intermediate and expert crypto users. The higher tier audience you produce content for, the bigger the reward per article will be.   Currently content for the website is capped to 3 articles per week per person.  Minimum reward per article: 250 SCENE (2,5 NEBL)  Topics to be covered on crypto-scene.com:  Events (1 Author)  Neblio (1 Author)  Bitcoin  ICO's (1 Author)  Security (2 authors)  Development  Exchanges   Requirements:  üè¥ Must be able to write in proper English or translation fees will be deducted from the rewards.  üè¥ Must have previously created articles relevant to Blockchain or is able to supply a concept article to prove competence  üè¥ Must be 18 years of age  üè¥ Must not be biased or have any intention to promote projects for any other reason than to inform or entertain.  üè¥ Has read Cryptoscene's WP and is familiar with the mission, vision and concept in general   We tried to keep this short and sweet - but if you have any questions or want to go more in depth we're always up for a call or chat within our TG channel. Our crowdsale is currently live and doing well considering the current market sentiment. If you would like to participate you can do so until the 7th of August. Contributions are capped to 10 ETH per person. 1 ETH equals 10.000 SCENE with a total cap of 10M SCENE.  Crowdsale: https://www.crypto-scene.com/crowdsale",False

Informative and inspiring? Without a doubt. To give you a simple insight; we work together with established writers on a freelance basis. They have incredible knowledge and experience - but the key is to dumb it down. We start with the basis. What's blockchain, what's the benefits, why should I participate? The first edition will be the genesis magazine that is aimed directly at users that are NOT known within the scene.  By highlighting short stories, new local developments and many more subjects (let's keep it a bit fun and mysterious) we hope to not only guide the readers and inform them but also shed some light on what's been going on since 2013. As for the platform, a user with 0 knowledge would be shown standard articles that are relatively easy to grasp. By following courses (free) and reading up on more articles (or watching video's) they would slowly progress to more sophisticated articles. This whole process will ultimately decrease the time someone needs to be acquainted to the crypto scene, making it more enjoyable, leaving less to no room for false information to be spread and above all make the whole ordeal a lot more clear.  Hope this sheds some light on the matter and if you have more questions hit us up on Telegram https://t.me/cryptosceneofficial for sure!  ",False
