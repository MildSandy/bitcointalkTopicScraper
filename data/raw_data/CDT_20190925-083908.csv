This option is being pushed by people on the whitelist.  Plus say 80% ask for refund then the team have little money to develop the project effectively making the Cdt distributed effectively worthless and the project dead. This simply will not happen.  You could look at this another way. Anyone on whitelist got their tokens already so keep them. Whitelisted contributors were the ones who helped the team along the way so surely they would be more likely to believe in the project and opt to keep their tokens.   coindash could give extra % of tokens that make up for the hack.  For those who sent to fake address refubd them their eth if they want it or give them tokens if they want that (plus extra tokens same as I've said above). This would depend on the % of people who wanted refund since the amount sent to fake address is more than the whitelisted amount. Everyone on whitelist will say no to this as it doesn't favour them.  Not trying to create an argument just pointing out that if given an option both fake address and whitelist contributors would want a refund.  Only 1 thing can and will happen, everyone will get cdt tokens (possibly a higher % than they were meant to get), this will allow the team to keep the eth and try and develop the project.

Coindash is a company which made an offer on this board. You agreed on these terms and sent your ETH.So this is a binding contract between you and the company of Coindash. However the terms changed now because of that situation and according to law you have the full right to step out of the contract without the approval of the company of Coindash.  This means by law Coinsdash is forced to refund your money if you demand it. However to do so you need to inform them directly about it so you can proof it in court. After they get the email and a letter from your lawyer i'm pretty sure they will refund you silently because a court case would be the least what they want since first they would loose the case and it would create costs second the result would be made public since court cases are public and there would be instantly a mass run against that company and third the bad press which they can't take anymore.  So anyone with a bigger amount demanding really a refund should go this way since else they are going to take you hostage like i predicted it at the beginning.   ,True

Even the team is able to create coindash please tell me which serious investor/trader is going to use coindash and taking the risk to loose everything if they are not even able to safe their simple website.Safing their website would be so easy that you can call the dev team just total noobs who have no clue abot security.  Am asking also myself about their stupidity which took so long to recognize that they got hacked and take their website down.   Anyhow there are 2 possibilities.Coindash are scammers or total noobs who will never succeed with coindash as they will never ever regain trust expecially with their scam history in the past.

Yes, devs had poor security of both Slack and website. But scammed people didn't even check when they are sending the funds.  3. Devs decided to be kind enough to send free tokens even to those people who were vistims of the scams (I understand only the website scam, not the Slack scam, but who knows). Also the people who sent the ETH to the right address might have an option to send their tokens back and get refunded (probably only some people will use this possibility, the rest will not).  Situation is really simple. This mess could be fixed in matter of hours. Scammed people would be grateful that despite they deserved nothing for their mistake of not checking where they are sengidn, they would be sending token anyway. And white list people who sent the coins to the right address would feel secure that if they want they can keep the coins or return them (preferably for a limited time). Devs can either destroy those coins or issue another round of sale, whichever they prefer. Everyone is happy, confidence in project rises. Of course some trolls are trying to make a chaos here.

If you really want to gain consumer confidence you will offer people this option you have our Eth not the hacker. Bancor offered the same opportunity when they were DDOS'd during the ICO.  You have also have not addressed this issue.  Quote As sad as the theft was, the other investors get diluted against the agreed upon terms by doing this. Apart from the obvious fact that the team's credibility just received a massive hit after ignoring all the well-intended advice regarding token sale best practices meaning the token will most likely lose a good chunk of its value right from the start, this compensation scheme is also wide open to game theoretic attacks. If the above promise holds true, the attacker can simply send ETH to the fake address from another sufficiently uncorrelated and seemingly innocent address they own and mint ""free"" CDT, effectively emptying the pockets of the investor's base via downwards inflationary pressure on the price. This has zero cost on them. They just get more CDT, the more ETH they send to themselves. Also, there is no way to disprove this was an inside job which means that you can't restrict the ""compensation"" to contributions made before the announcement because the insider(s) could have taken that into account.",True

Although, I suppose it could be possible (a whitelist refund) if they planned on doing another ICO (well I guess it wouldn't be ""Initial"" anymore), only properly this time. They'd obviously receive MUCH less money but at least it'd be willing investors and the project wouldn't go under from lack of funds.  The problem stems from how much they need for their roadmap over the next year and if they can figure out HOW they were actually hacked. If they can't figure it out then we've made no progress. I have a feeling that's why they've been silent for most of today. They're trying to figure out how they were hacked and if they can track the hacker down with assistance from law enforcement (there are surely logs on the web server and what not). If they have a way to recover the funds then that's priority #1 and I could see why they'd be absent most of today.  On the other hand, they could just be fighting among themselves, blaming each other for the destruction of the project. There were a lot of legit partners involved in this that I'm sure don't appreciate the CoinDash team letting this happen.",True

This means they should provide the option to these people whether or not they would like a refund due to the nature of this situation. Those who sent via fake address has been or will be compansated with CDT tokens, to make this profitable for them, they should burn the refunded CDT tokens.  The devs should refund these guys instantly before they start distributing the CDT tokens, otherwise it'll be drawn out and possibly delayed.

Waiting for the contract address on their webpage and then send the ether to that address. I fell for it, too. Of course, you can blame me on bad diligence, but then again the only strange thing I noticed was that ugly font/design when the contract address got released. And yet I am really not into these wild conspiracy theories claiming that it all was a planned scam by the developers. So when you didnt believe that this is a scam in the first place, what, except for the design of the announcement, should have made you suspicious? Dont get me wrong, I feel responsible for the mistake I made and I am pretty sure that if there wasn't that FOMO beginner mistake, I would still have my funds. Nevertheless I think everybody should be treated equally here if the company is serious. Simply because for the fact that people got told ""do this, and you will get tokens from us"". I did that. And I got no tokens lol, I even opened a MEW address because they advised me to do so, while MetaMask would have done good too I assume.

Alon Muroch @negedzuregal Dec 15 2016 00:41 Hi @bamos01, great to have you here! Our product is 100% directed to crypto investors, developed by crypto investors. The most critical stages in a startup's life is its early days until it reaches market fit, that is, a product optimised enough to give great value to its users. The same way traditional investors invest in a company and get direct influence of its decision making (a sit in the board of directors), any of our investors will do as well. The tokens can be used by us only if we convince you, our investors, they will be used at the right development direction. As we optimise our product, the token's value will rise as it will become more attractive and the company's product becomes better and better. Buy more tokens early on, you will have more influence on decision making and future development. An incredible side effect is that the more people invest in us the more market validation we get which means, again, the company becomes even more attractive.    On top of that they strung us along asking to contact them as they had a reward for early investors  From their blog posts...  ""Ether.Camp early investors call â To further emphasis our appreciation of your support, we want to grant a special reward to those of you who backed us from day one. We are calling all of you who supported us through the Ether.Camp Hackathon to contact us and get your reward. Please send your e-mail and name used during the Hackathon to contact@coindash.io. We will reach you as soon as possible.""  Turns out this ""reward"" was just the opportunity to send them more ETH via the whitelist.

It was published on the official site and they didn't want to miss out on the ICO since many have sold out in minutes.    A solution that might still save this project is to offer 2 options for investors.   1.  Offer refunds for those on the whitelist first and if there are remaining ETHs left, offer those who sent to the fake address. 2.  Increase the amount of CDT for all those who want to keep their investments.  Use the tokens that were refunded and give those who still      want to support the project an additional bonus.

I'm not sure why that's being mentioned. They paid for a token and they're going to get it. This hack does not affect them. CoinDash is even going as far as giving those who were scammed their tokens since it was their fault for having lax security on their website.  The only issue is that now the tokens will be devalued due to lack of faith in the project/developer, but to be fair there was never a promise of value in the tokens/ICO. You're buying on speculation that they'll be worth something and because you want to fund the project. If they turn out to be worthless, then you lost on that speculation.  If devaluing a token is the main issue to some then Bancor was also wrong to keep selling over their promised limit (increasing their market cap and ruining good-faith with participants in the ICO). If anything this hack would normally increase the value of CDT because the market cap will be around 6m rather than the originally planned 12m (meaning more room for profit for investors).  Once again the real issue is CoinDash earning our trust again somehow. If people have no faith in the project/devs then the tokens will become worthless. This is coming from someone who is $30,000 deep in this mess. I obviously want CoinDash to recover so I don't end up losing my investment.

They cannot hack you just by telling them your address and transaction Hash. All the information required can be found in the etherscan without opening your wallet. if you know your address. People should get a ENS so they can check their wallet constantly without opening or memorizing their address. You can search my address https://etherscan.io/enslookup?q=gildarsh.eth for example.   It is unfortunate but this hacking happened because of their ""White list"" that sounds like racist. It puts other people who does not belong in the whitelist to be like a 2nd rate citizen. Other ICO in the past are able to provide the ETH address 2 days before the ICO. People are able to verify the contract of the ICO publicly before the ICO started. But since there is a Whitelist, they could not publish the address just to give unfair advantage to their ""Early Supporters."" Therefore, it created an opportunity to the hacker to hacked the website just after the timer started.  As an investor who missed out on the other iCO because it finishes so quickly, we did not bother checking the address. We just add the address and send it immediately without even checking the address if it is a contract or not. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7288nKEgxRJRTJfX0p2VTQtVTg In the image you can compare the 2 addres - 1 is from the contract in IMMLA (other ICO) and the other is the fake coindash address (not a contract).  I already accepted that i messed up because i did not check the address. But i am happy with the response of the Coindash team to still give our my CDT (Hopefully). Next time I will check the address before sending them, safety 1st ofcourse. Also, I hope in the future ICOs, people should go against the whitelist and request transparency of the ETH address so we can review it.",True

Quote As sad as the theft was, the other investors get diluted against the agreed upon terms by doing this. Apart from the obvious fact that the team's credibility just received a massive hit after ignoring all the well-intended advice regarding token sale best practices meaning the token will most likely lose a good chunk of its value right from the start, this compensation scheme is also wide open to game theoretic attacks. If the above promise holds true, the attacker can simply send ETH to the fake address from another sufficiently uncorrelated and seemingly innocent address they own and mint ""free"" CDT, effectively emptying the pockets of the investor's base via downwards inflationary pressure on the price. This has zero cost on them. They just get more CDT, the more ETH they send to themselves. Also, there is no way to disprove this was an inside job which means that you can't restrict the ""compensation"" to contributions made before the announcement because the insider(s) could have taken that into account.",True

During the attack $7 Million were stolen by a currently unknown perpetrator. The CoinDash Token Sale secured $6.4 Million from our early contributors and whitelist participants and we are grateful for your support and contribution.  CoinDash is responsible to all of its contributors and will send CDTs reflective of each contribution. Contributors that sent ETH to the fraudulent Ethereum address, which was maliciously placed on our website, and sent ETH to the CoinDash.io official address will receive their CDT tokens accordingly. Transactions sent to any fraudulent address after our website was shut down will not be compensated.  This was a damaging event to both our contributors and our company but it is surely not the end of our project. We are looking into the security breach and will update you all as soon as possible about the findings.  The CoinDash vision, product and team will continue to live on. We will be fast to recover and we will create the future of trading.  Reminder: We are still under attack. Please do not send any ETH to any address, as the Token Sale has been terminated.  More information will be published on our social channels and our website.  -CoinDash Team   https://www.coindash.io/  I think everything will be all right.... Let's wait ..",True

If CoinDash refunds ETH to the Whitelist, they will have no funds to actually create the product rendering CDT absolutely worthless instead of just largely reduced in value (as it is currently).  Your solution also implies that those who sent to the incorrect address on the OFFICIAL website are at fault and should just be screwed over.  This would make the CoinDash team look even worse by giving their friends and angel investors (whitelist people) full refunds and quitting on the general public who invested.  Not smart.",True

If CoinDash creates a unique and solid project, and hires some decent security people to fix their issues - why should they be any different?  It is easy in the immediate aftermath to write this entire project off as a complete failure and dead - and many will sell their tokens at a large loss.  But maybe we shouldn't just all sell out immediately.  I judge a team on their performance after true adversity strikes and how they move forward and overcome.  Unfortunately the CoinDash team has a monstrous mountain in front of them now.  How they react from here will reveal their true colors.  They need to be 1) as transparent as possible, 2) show how they were hacked and what they will do to fix the security issues, 3) work twice as hard to overcome the obvious reputation problem they are going to have with half the funds they were hoping for, 4) be as patient as saints with all the venom that is about to come there way.

However, the reality is that most of these ICOs, including the responsible ones, are raising multiples of what any comparatively sized startup in Silicon Valley raises at their stage of growth. There's no way a team this small at this stage should have a burn rate of 1M+ a month, so rationally speaking the next six months to a year are pretty much going to go as though the hack never happened.  That said, it's not like crypto markets behave rationally, so I don't expect that to be the general outlook. On top of that, it's not even crazy not to trust a trading platform that can't secure their own shit, so I'm not entirely hopeful that this project survives this, just pointing out that there is a way where they still can succeed, but it's going to be a Herculean task to pull off and I'm not sure they're up for it.",True

Actually we are all surprise by your questions about the bonus. A quick explanation...  We are offering a fix amount of CDTs, We have a cap of only 80K ETH, If those 80K will be sold during the first day that everybody gets the bonus If everybody receives the bonus there is no difference between the investors, the bonus comes into effect between the different stages, so if the sale will take further than 1 day, those buyers will get less CDTs.  This is being done in EVERY token sale with bonuses, Check it! the cap is 80K ETH we can't and won't accept more.

There is a serious connection between the scam project and coindash. The connection is the Coindash founder worked as Head of IOS in the project which scammed millions of dollars from people's pockets. Coindash founder accepted that he worked there and he said now there is no connection to the previous project. But you cannot simply ignore how suspicious all of these look.  Would you comfortably invest your hard-earned money to the project started by a guy who was involved in a scam before?

Only a week to go until our Token Sale opening shot, as we approach it, more important information will be released. This weekly update includes most of the recent development so letâs get to it!     Early birds Bonus rates revealed - As done almost in all Token Sales, we at CoinDash would also like to reward our early contributors. Those who wish to join and participate our Token Sale immediately after it starts and for the duration of the first day will receive a bonus on their contribution. The idea behind the bonus is to incentivise and reward those who make the first move and show their support for CoinDash by taking part in the Token Sale on its initiation. And so, the bonus rates that will be given during or Token Sale:    First day bonus - 30%  First week bonus - 20%  Second week bonus - 10%  Rest of the Token Sale period bonus - 0%    CDT sale price - As of now, only 1 piece is missing and that is the CDT/ETH price. Since we are offering 500,000,000 CDT Tokens in return for a Maximum of $12,000,000 in ETH equivalent, assuming the Token sale will reach the designated cap, each CDT will be valued at $0.032 however with the 30% bonus on first day contributions, the effective token price will be only 0.024$. Due to the fact the sale is conducted using ETH only, the CDT/ETH price is yet to be known. In order to mitigate ETH price volatility risk we will set the ETH price 2 days before the Token Sale according to CoinMarketCap ETH price average. official ETH price announcement will be delivered accordingly 2 days before the sale.",True

The moment you were waiting for is coming momentarily announcing the Token sale date and hard cap.  But before that, some bad news. we were approached by Bitcointalk.org moderators regarding signature wearing participants who according to the moderators are spamming the forum with poor quality posts in of topic threads. After going through the list of accused users it is safe to say they are all farm accounts and their spam is clear.  We spend tremendous efforts in making this topic and maintaining the conversation level in it. We take it very seriously that although we stated endless times that spamming is not allowed, and we ask that you only post in related topic threads and forbade the use of multiple accounts, some of you absolutely ignored that.  So it was decided that all names reported to us by the forum moderators are herby disqualified immediately from our campaign. Lets us be clear about it. All bounty campaigns numbers are subject to a final check that will take place when the campaign ends. We already spotted many duplicate accounts running by the same persons and we are sure we will find many more during the final check. We reserve the right to fulfil our commitment and disqualify anyone who will be found breaching the very clear rules of the campaign.  We seriously wish this will be the last time we will have to deal with such matters as we have far more important things to focus on at the moment",True

Make no mistake public Beta Version will be available in days, a lot of people here have already used it and loved it and soon the rest will follow Making our Beta public before the ICO was maybe our primary goal in this entire ICO campaign as we strongly believe no project should make a token sale without showing the public its working product!! unfortunately this is not a common practice those days but we will insist on that.  A word regarding the bounty program. We launched our program 2 months ago and in the mid of the way thought we can make it fancier with automated platform, the platform came out very nice but things did not go smoothly as we wanted with the Twitter counter due to many NEW restrictions Twitter has added to their API. since than we are working to find better ways to improve the count every day! and already added new server just for that. as of today almost everyone ob the platform got their counter fixed. rest assure that by the end all of you will get their stake. On a personal level I'll say that even though things went a bit harder on that aspect I see no place for projecting this issue on the project itself as this is handled by two completely separate branches and the portfolio platform itself is running perfectly.  Last, we spend great resources on publicities and marketing of our project.

After we sat and customize it for our need, we found out that due to our large number of participants making data calls to the Twitter app, we hit a restriction by Twitter allowing only few people to get their stats each day. Now, as explained OVER & OVER again, Everybody's counter will get synched with time. but, because you guys are still asking bout it every hour, we had approached Wings.ai again and they are now working on it to find ways to expedite the process.  Regarding ""Pending"" remarks around here - As all the campaign apart from the social ones, are being calculated by weekly stakes, We can not give you your reward at once prior the end of the campaign. for that reason, all bounties are pending until the campaign is over then they will be approved with your final stake.  2. Token Sale announcement - Again, we want to do it once and right. very soon you will get the full announcement. As there is almost a month left, there is still plenty of time before you need to stress and jump through hoops. When it will be ready, you will all get notified.  The token sale is planed to be 1 month Max. the coins will be sent back to the contributors instantly, There will be no ""half year waiting"" here.",True

I will not answer totally about how this can be addressed but this might helps...  First of all if someone can create 10 000 accounts on our platform without trigger our attention there is a problem.    Then you said you will short 5000 btc and go long with 5000 btc, so you need 10 000 BTC to achieve your goal. I really think someone with that kind of money has better to do than trying to cheat a system to later gain a relatively small reward compare to the amount needed. Because to do that you will have to pay a huge amount of fees. If you long and short that much BTC you will lose a lot of Bitcoin whatever is it going down or up...  Of course, I know this what a metaphor!  This is a legit question because it can be done with much lower numbers, maybe even 10 accounts and 10 BTC... You can achieve a really high performance on one account. So yes it's possible, but what will be important for any users who want to follow you, is consistency, volume and the history of your account.  Automatically if you have to make 10 accounts and divide your 10 bitcoin, you will get way smaller volume than any other good traders on the platform. I would rather follow someone with skin in the game with real volume.   I can add this: When you want to use your ""winning account"" to trick users on CoinDash, you will have no choice to perform incredibly well to stay at the top.  I really think some people will really try to trick the system   Even CoinDash Team will make some test, but I really don't think long term it will be a real problem, for the reasons evoqued and because the reward seems to be small compare to the effort needed...  There is MANY other way to really prevent that, we will of course take all the necessary measures on the go to prevent this type of problems.",True

At the moment the CoinDashâs token - CDT,  total supply is expected to be 1,000,000,000 making the bounty share at 10 Million CDT. As the projects moves along towards the ICO the total number of tokens in circulation may vary but in any case 1% will still be designated to the bounty campaign. The duration of the campaign will be from its starting day expected to be on July 2017, until the end of its ICO weather by its finishing date or by reaching its full cap.  The total bounty designated tokens will be allocated once more into several campaign pools as will be presented here. The participants in each campaign will share the total allocated bounty designated for their specific campaign in a pro rata manner considering the stakes each one of them had received. (Note that in some campaigns the Stakes or STARS as we call them, will be given to the participants for their weekly participation and thus participant that will join early will enjoy a bigger stake than others)  Let us be clear, as a social platform the most important thing for us is creating a strong and happy community. We believe that the bounty campaign is a great way to get our community both involved and happy. However, will not tolerate any spamming, trolling, abusing, using of bots, farm accounts or any other misconduct from any social bounty program participant and hereby reserves the right to ban and disqualify participants who will be found doing so at any stage of the campaign.

At the moment the CoinDashâs token - CDT,  total supply is expected to be 1,000,000,000 making the bounty share at 10 Million CDT. As the projects moves along towards the ICO the total number of tokens in circulation may vary but in any case 1% will still be designated to the bounty campaign. The duration of the campaign will be from its starting day expected to be on July 2017, until the end of its ICO weather by its finishing date or by reaching its full cap.  The total bounty designated tokens will be allocated once more into several campaign pools as will be presented here. The participants in each campaign will share the total allocated bounty designated for their specific campaign in a pro rata manner considering the stakes each one of them had received. (Note that in some campaigns the Stakes or STARS as we call them, will be given to the participants for their weekly participation and thus participant that will join early will enjoy a bigger stake than others)  Let us be clear, as a social platform the most important thing for us is creating a strong and happy community. We believe that the bounty campaign is a great way to get our community both involved and happy. However, will not tolerate any spamming, trolling, abusing, using of bots, farm accounts or any other misconduct from any social bounty program participant and hereby reserves the right to ban and disqualify participants who will be found doing so at any stage of the campaign.  Please pay attention to the following description of each bounty as the reward criteria varies from each campaign.   Bitcointalk.org Signature campaign(20% of the Bounty pool - 2,000,000 CDT) Earn CoinDash tokens by participating in our Bitcointalk Signature campaign. Designated bounty pool of 2,000,000 Tokens will be divided among the participants proportionally to the amount of their earned stakes. Weekly stakes will be granted to each participant with regard to its forum rank and campaign registry date.  Weekly stakes to be distributed to participants according to their forum rank:  Hero/Legendary : 2.5 stakes Sr. Member: 2 Stakes Full Member : 1.5 stakes Member: 1 Stake Jr. Member: 0.5 Stake *Users wearing the official avatar will be eligible for a weakly 0.5 stake increase   Signature campaign rules:  The stakes will be counted since the moment each user submit the participation form and get approved. After their approval, participants are not allowed to change their signatures until the end of the campaign! Random check will be made and those who will be found doing so will get immediately disqualified. In order to be eligible to the bounty by the end of the campaign, one must post at least 50 posts wearing the signature by the time the campaign concludes. Pay special attention to the fact that the campaign ends exactly when the ICO concludes even if that happens before schedule in case of reaching the full cap. Each participant must make at least 1 post in CoinDash's main topic every week. All posts must be made in âAlternate cryptocurrenciesâ section of the forum! Posts in off topic threads will not get counted and spamming and trolling of all kinds will simply get the participant disqualified. Multiple accounts registration is forbidden.

Example: https://twitter.com/heezyneezy/status/867328364885024768 you click copy on the traders subpage and type in with which amount per trade you want to copy and how many trades per day. when this trader opens a new trade you will automatically open the same trade with your specified amount and profit the same way. I expect coindash to work similar but with many more options like copy ICO buys and altcoin trades. more opportunities to make profit btw. my ref-link is https://1broker.com/?r=21192,True

We want to stop in the middle of all the rush at NYC and give you some news and updates!  Tomorrow CoinDash team is going to be in Coindesk's CONSNSUS conference were all the big names from the industry is going to be. As a team we decided we want to make the trip in order to get well informed and to present our platform and vision to the key players in crypto community. Immediately after the conference first day will end tomorrow we will be on our way to our NYC Meetup event where we are about to present CoinDash in front of 200 New Yorkers crypto enthusiasts. In order to get you well informed we are going to publish our Newsletter a bit later than usual and hopefully we will add to it all the videos from the last Meetups and events. If you still have not subscribed to our Newsletter this is a great chance to do so (Coindash.io)  As our Beta looks amazing and we are delighted with its progress, we are sure we can deliver a public beta even before the ICO starts.As a result, we decided to modify the ICO structure adding another section to it which will involve using our public Beta during the ICO. Stay tuned as this big announcement will be officially announced soon.  After receiving some requests regarding the signature pool we decided to enlarge the pool to 2,000,000 DCT allocated from the miscellaneous pool. We want you all to feel rewarded for your service and are open to even further increases in the future.  Last, as you already know, we partnered up with Wings DAO and we will be using their bounty platform during our campaign. As the customization process of the platform takes time we decided to start the Social Bounty Campaign manually and later on all participants will claim their rewards on the Bounty platform. So lets push on the social networks !! Be sure to fill out the bounty participation form on the bounty post before starting to reach to networks criteria!

But let's make a point on the bounties. Be more specific and talk about signature bounty. Signature bounty will take %0.15 of the total crowdsale. If you sell $10,000,000 during crowdsale, signature pool will be $15,000 right?  How many participants will you get? You did not limit the number of participants. Let's say 500 participants joined the signature campaign and 400 of them became eligible for bounty at the end of the ICO. Simple math:  $15,000 / 400 = $38 per participant WHO will carry the sinature at the end of August. Only $38, oh my god. It does not even worth it.  Let's say not 400 participants, but this time 200 participants became eligible for bounty at the end of ICO. Another calculation:  $15,000 / 200 = $75 per participant WHO will carry the sinature at the end of August. The same thing here. Carrying your signature for 3 months for that much Money?

I understand that you consider the signature bounty not rewarding enough and that is ok. We said more than once that the designated bounty pool of 40% will be used for further bounties we have in mind and for adding more CDTs to the bounty pools we notice are getting less appealing. for that reason exactly we keep them apart so we can control on real time and reinforce over crowded campaigns.  Anyhow, please look on the signature campaign spreadsheet, just few days after its launch and as we speak there are more than 60 participants already that see the campaign as worthwhile so I guess this is not meant to serve everybody in the crypto space.

It's very convenient since you don't have to spend  the whole day (assuming you are available...) monitoring exactly when the ICO will start. If you are not sure about the ICO but would like to have a chance, you can set up rules like ""If this project reaches 70% of funding"" ""in 24 hours"" then the system will trigger the investment for you.

Why would an experienced trader share his trades for free?  Wouldn't it create a lots of problems if there are more investments from CoinDash users than the ICO cap. For example, there's an ICO with cap of $1 million. Thousands of people are following a person which invests in this ICO. According to what I understand, it would mean a smart contract will trigger investments from all these thousand users. If it's an ideal situation, all the thousands of transactions would be processed at same moment. And ICO collection may total to $2 million when all transactions confirm simultaneously.  However, it's not ideal world so some transactions would be processed first and some later. The transactions processed later would be refunded by ICO as out crosses cap. So you'll be discriminating som between the users. Comments?   You instead of solving a problem, are increasing its effect. If many people use your services.

Those indicators could be shared to the network. People would be able to follow those users and opt-in to copy their ICO investments. CoinDash identifies when an opt-in user makes an ICO investment and will trigger the same investments to his followers. The validation and execution of those copy ICO requests are handled by a smart contract under the control of the user.  copy ICO fee - following and copying someone is essentially a way you transfer knowledge and expertise between users, for that the following user will pay a fee which will be divided by the top trader and CoinDash.  Why should anyone share their portfolio? - its a question we've asked ourselves and had to test it with real traders. The social aspect in trading is a powerful one, many traders already share their success and positions with other to gain social statue and some even manage other peoples money for fees. They are doing it because of social incentives (get more known in the community, gain respect, have more influence) and financial incentives (people are willing to pay a lot for the right tip for a trade)  potential problems its a bit of a misconception that everyone follow only one trader or get into the same ICO at once. We are seeing the ICO and altcoin market becoming bigger and bigger all the time, with more opportunities arise every day. Enabling people to discover investment opportunities is a win for them and a win for the blockchain space because they fund blockchain projects who otherwise would find it very hard to raise capital. The alternative is that only the select few have the time and knowledge to know what to invest in... I think everyone should deserve it. keep in mind that one of the effects of copy ICO is to channel money in a smarter way by leveraging the know how of good investors.  I think that the creation and trading of crypto assets is one of the biggest use-cases for blockchain technology. a way to change the traditional financial industry. There are flaws in the crypto market, sure... there are flaws in the ICO model, sure... but the only way to make this space more competitive and produce better results is by introducing more people to it and providing them sophisticated tools to direct their capital to the right places.",True

Investors' funds were paid out as rewards for ""completing"" development, instead of actually funding the GG project.  This allowed them to spend as little as possible on GG, and redirect most of the money into their real project, PayKey.

For example you want to buy in first, because you know the project is popular, then you simply set up the rule to buy-in directly. It's very convenient since you don't have to spend  the whole day (assuming you are available...) monitoring exactly when the ICO will start. If you are not sure about the ICO but would like to have a chance, you can set up rules like ""If this project reaches 70% of funding"" ""in 24 hours"" then the system will trigger the investment for you. That's the promise of never miss an ICO again.   On the other hand Copy trade system allows you to follow a trader and invest like him, for now the team focus on ERC20 tokens that's why we call it Copy ICO.

Thanks for your great questions. The copy ICO will work using smart contract where you will send the funds you intend to invest. Next a White List with ICO's addresses will be used in order to track funds movements to trigger the smart contract. At first we will focus on ERC20 token ICO's done with smart contracts as this is becoming the most common ICO way these days. later on we will add different options to enable the CopyICO with other types of ICOs.  Legal work is being done this days to wrap the entire thing however we are working very hard on the platform to avoid any legal complications further down the road ,True

For us $5M is a good number for funding our activity and give good performance to the investors (which is good for everyone).  I don't see a lot of services like CoinDash out there, that is why we are developing it. Melonport, ICONOMI and Taas are investment instruments (answer for the ""how"" do I trade). We want to solve the problem that all the newcomers and even old time blockchainers face, which is what to invest in and when. That is why we consider ourselves a platform/ hub for crypto investors where they can find useful tools (portfolio management), social trading and explore investment opportunities and 3rd party investment instruments like ICONOMI/ Melonport/ etc (we actually included an integration with them in our road map, check the white paper).  This space is loosing hundreds of thousands of new users every year because there are simply no good tools to help them trade.

Blockchain is so innovative that traditional financing can't really catch up, ICOs are becoming the way to finance blockchain companies. 2) its the most efficient way to build a community around a product/ company, even more so in CoinDash because ICO investors are also the end users.  I didn't want to react to the previous GetGems posts because they were written in a way that frankly does not deserve a response, by online thugs and racists.

I would like to share with you some of the latest developments from the last few days and a general orientation to where our project is heading so we all can share our ambition and enthusiasm from the future to come.  1. CoinDash's new UI design - Thanks to our talented designers and their amazing work, the new CoinDash beta version has now a great vivid design as you can see in our updated OP images and if you are taking part in our Beta tests. Redesigning our platform is just another step being made by our core and product teams in order to bring you the most intuitive portfolio management tool possible.    2. Beta testing launch - Erlier this week we started 1 on 1 sessions with several of you guys which we chose carfuly to be our first Beta testers. The responses we got so far from the community were even beyond our expectations. We got great feedbcks regarding the platform's functionalities and it's great UI. However, rest assure we do not get distracted and keep on working in order to improve the platform so we can deliver you the premium product we have in mind.  This is a great opportunity to remind you that you could still take part and be one of our testers. If you are intrested see our blog post with all requirements and scope Here  3. Hong Kong & China travel - For the past week our team representatives held many meetings and performances before the local community. As we believe China & Hong Kong are crucial players in the market we were eager to get their impression of the project. During this journey we reached a large number of agreements and understandings regarding future cooperation in connection both with platform development and the coming ICO, many of them with very influential market players in the community.  4. USA travel - Our next stop in spreading the news about CoinDash is going to be the Big Apple. in two weeks from now CoinDash team is going to appear in 4 different states in the USA taking part in many Meetups and several conferences as CONSENSUS and others. As soon as these events occur, you will get their full reports.

The platform uses your provided public key, traces back transaction in and out your account and present the user with the whole picture regarding his portfolio management capabilities, portfolio risk levels, distribution ratios and many more. At the same time using the platform each user can follow other traders and investors see their portfolios and risk structures and monitor their aggregated performance. One of the platform's highlights is the CopyICO feature which enables you to use a smart contract interface that will automatically participate in ICOs on your behalf based on investments made by reputable traders you chose to follow, So you'll never miss another ICO again!             CoinDash Tutorial      Crypto currencies market  With Bitcoin dominance diminishing over time Altcoins are gaining more and more attention. One of the biggest use cases for blockchain technology is the ability to create new crypto assets. Such assets are increasingly becoming an alternative investment channel to traditional markets because they enable new models of participation, are tradable 24/7, subject to much less regulation and are easy to create. The past few years showed a dramatic increase in trading volume, market capitalization and the number of projects using crypto tokens.  However, even with recent ROI success rates in the market, investment in crypto currencies is still considered to be a high risk investment. This is due to the fact that such investments requires facing many challenges and a steep learning curve only experienced blockchain users have. The scope of information and its rate is always on the rise, making it very difficult for new comers to get into business and keep with the pace.    Introducing CoinDash platform  Our platform will give any of its users the much needed tools in order to keep track of their performance, to manage the positions and risk levels they wish to to maintain, to get live updates on orders and holdings big traders they chose to follow just did and even to practice some automatic copy trading talking part in every ERC20 based ICO out there. CoinDash's platform will be valuable for each of its users, enabling experienced reputable traders to gain reward from sharing their information to there followers, adding a brand new concept of trade sharing revenue.     Charts and graphs will present current portfolio performances and aggregated results along with many other tools. these are essential in order to manage and interact with crypto assets. They give a deep insight into the performance and status of the userâs investments and help in data driven decision making.  Social interactions are a key part of the crypto world, projects can raise and fall by their community and the network they create. CoinDashâs social trading features remove barriers for new and existing crypto users by letting them follow and copy-trade top investors.  CoinDashâs marketplace is built around opportunity discovery and streamlined trading UX with features like: real-time social trading signals, ICO dashboard, trending assets, real-time market price tables and 3rd party integration.      CoinDash Token CDT  Every feature in the CoinDash platform that gives any financial value to its user will require them to pay a fee with the same notion, users who facilitates the use of a feature which in turn gives financial value to others will be entitled to a reward based on the platform designated token CDT. This creates a creator-consumer relationship between users in the system, not preventing users from being creators and consumers at the same time.  CoinDash's CDT which will be used to pay all fees on the platform is designed to create a direct correlation between the success of the platform and the value of the token. The more people who use the platform, the more fees will be paid, the more CDTs will be bought ultimately pushing the price of them up.  The CDT will be an ERC20 based token making its issuance solely by using a smart contract and allowing it a quick implementation on the Ethereum blockchain and exchanges listing.  CDT Specs and Allocation During CoinDash's Token Sale a total amount of 1,000,000,000 CDT will be created and allocated as follows:  50% - Designated to the Token Sale contributors (1.25% reserved for Wings forecasters) 29% - Minted for future development, users acquisition & marketing 20% - Allocated for early investors, core team & advisors 1% -  Allocated for social bounty campaign  The settled price of 487,500,000 CDT to be sold to the public, during the first phase of our Token sale will be 6,093 CDT per 1 ETH.
