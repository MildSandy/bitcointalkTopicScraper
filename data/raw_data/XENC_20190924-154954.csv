In addition, Face-Match is required as further security for your personal details. After the Onboarding is completed, the user’s Personal Details will be submitted and encrypt by our Private IPFS Nodes. Subsequently, the IPFS Nodes will pass an encrypted hash which would then be submitted to the Blockhain Network. In this case, the personal details of the user can only be retreived if the user provide the private key, which are created when the user register through the app.  As per the Flow of our Blockchain Solution, it allows our App to ensure that the user’s personal details will be store securely and can only be accessed through User’s Private key. In this case, through the use of IPFS Node, the personal details of each user will not only be stored in one place, however will be spread throughout the node allowing full redundancy if any IPFS Node is down. Furthermore the nature of IPFS would meant that existing personal details will continually be updated throughout the node, further enhancing the reliability. In addition, each personal details is encrypted by the IPFS Node, which in turn is further encrypted by the blockchain network. This meant that every personal details stored in IPFS Node can only be accessed by the Blockchain Network and the User’s Private Key.

If you are tired of taking selfies and registering non-stop at crypto exchanges just to trade your newly minted ICO tokens, you are going to love this. Each and every time, we log in to a web page, we risk getting our credentials stolen via phishing sites or emails, our wallets hacked or worse our PCs infected with spyware or malware. By simplifying this KYC (Know Your Customer) process, by taking back control of our virtual identity and credentials, we reduce that risks substantially.  I was so excited when Vinny Lingham launched Civic (CVC) token for e-KYC, unfortunately, to date, the Android app only verifies my mobile number and email address. I would have expected that with all that money swooshing around, we would a cool app that does it all.  Well, I found this ICO out of Singapore that is going into the same e-KYC space. They already have an Android app in beta and it's quite simple and cool. It takes back control of your personal credentials and allows you to control how much of your personal data you share for KYC purposes. Think of it as a Facebook type of credential management as when you log in to third party apps with your Facebook login you get to control how much of your identity is shared to those applications. Sounds cool right?  Here's a preview:-  There's more, Xenchain will be working with institutions such as credit bureaus, educational institutions and data owners to authenticate and validate your personal data. By digitizing your credentials online, you can assist in the fight against identity theft and fraud.  Xenchain is now in pre-ICO. Join their Telegram group https://t.me/xenchainio for official announcements.  P.S. I am an early investor in Xenchain. As always, do your own research and don't risk funds you can't afford to lose.",False

Xenchain is one of the companies with the necessary experience in this vertical, to solve this issue for the financial institutions. As a matter of fact, as mentioned by CEO of Xenchain, Steve Rao, he believed that their eKYC app can be used across different industries, from ICOs to digital exchanges, and e-commerce to healthcare.  Because it is built and powered by the blockchain technology, Xenchain can encrypt and store users’ personal data on a decentralized public ledger, making it safer compared to traditional storage practice.

We creates and distributes XenCoins to utilize the decentralized network of blockchain technology and enhancing personal data security by controlling where the data is stored and who has access to that information.  Problems Current verification methods are time consuming, expensive and highly inefficient for both users and businesses which revolves around physical document authentication. There is also risk of data leakage to unknown parties who can easily gain access to personal information from the traditional centralized storage system.  Solutions Personal data is encrypted and stored in a public ledger making it safe from breaches. Users will have control on who gains access to their information by giving permission to requestors to retrieve it from the network. Most importantly, the data is validated by other users to ensure its credibility before onboarding it into the Xenchain network.
