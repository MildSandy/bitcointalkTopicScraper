Their system sounds really interesting although the different tokens are making it a bit difficult in my opinion which is a shame.  But to be able to become succesful its important to be backed by the industry. Their team is hugely disappointing on that area.  They have 23-year old Janice, but she is only active in the industry for just 4 years (nice for marketing things but far from being important to get things done in the industry).  And the only one other person who has experience in the industry is Kayden, which is a prety good name (not huge, but ok), but as i read in the whitepaper she is just a ""brand ambassador,"" meaning she probably doesnt do much for the project besides popping up in some promo videos and stuff like that. But ok, maybe im seeing this wrong. And she might also have a few connections which is always handy.  And dont get me wrong i dont mean this in a bad way. Overall it looks like a great project, but some well connected people on different layers in the industry would have given it way more weight.",False
