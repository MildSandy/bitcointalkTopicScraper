When they see the excitement behind the ITO, they are ready to jump in.  The value of the tokens will be at 1 USD because the price of the products and services in-world will be valued essentially 1 STT for 1 USD. In other words, the brands price is $1/STT.  That's also the pricing they will need to maintain when selling real-world products on the platform.  If Adidas sells a pair of shoes on spaces, the rate they will charge in STT will be equal to $1/STT.    If the market rate dips below that, then people will run to exchanges to buy STT and get a discount on the real world goods available on the platform.  That demand will push the price back up to $1/STT  The idea is to award ITO investors with the bonus, so that by the time that brands and their fans are introduced to Staramba.spaces, they will pay the market value by purchasing tokens at 1USD value for 1STT for products.

Please read the following analysis before you invest in Staramba token sale.  Introduction  I am writing this because I thought that Staramba is going to be a great investment opportunity for me and my investment partners but after some extensive research and discussion with the admin of the telegram channel I have come to some pretty strong conclusions for myself.  Now, I am not going to say what my conclusions are because I do not wanna see myself sued for defamation but you can make your own conclusions based on this research. For me it was enough but you are in control of your money and you decide if it is worth it for you or not.   My initial investment strategy  This company is listed on stock exchanges compared to other companies doing ICOs so that was on the plus side. 1. I decided to start by buying some shares into the company because generally speaking, with their projected sales for 2018 plus the revenue from the ICO, their market capitalization should have been 5 times bigger than at the time i bought the shares. 2. I would await for the sales numbers of the first day of the ICO and give the go to my partners to aquire tokens.  Where it all fell apart.  Few days before the start of the ICO and also on the first day of the ICO there was a huge spike in shares sell. I have suspected that something is not right considering their previous volume so I have looked into the graphs and who actually sold the shares.  http://prntscr.com/jxcqhs   By doing a research I have noticed that Christian Daudert, the CEO of Staramba owned ~10% of the shares but he also owned ~25% more of staramba shares but in a different entity. A company called: 11 Champions AG. He is also the CEO of that. You can check that information on:  http://prntscr.com/jxcq6o  I have thought that this is just a pump strategy (sell the shares, buy tokens, claim how much you sold in the first day to wow the crypto investors to make them buy a lot on the second day) but then I have started to look into the other share holders of Staramba especially Rolf Elgeti (~29%). By looking into this picture you will notice that is guy is a director of probably more than 500 companies:  http://prntscr.com/jxcrbi  No human person in this world can be a director of 500 companies. Not because you can't own the shares but because you can't even attend the shareholder meetings or come up with anything good to boost the company revenue cause you would'nt even have the time available in a day for that.  What I did was the confront the admin of the group and you can find the transcript in this print screen. http://prntscr.com/jxcsqv http://prntscr.com/jxct2f http://prntscr.com/jxct8e  After this, 10 seconds later, I am prohibited to talk on the main ICO chat. http://prntscr.com/jxcshd  I would like to mention that I have discussed with Clay in multiple ocasions because our investment funds are quite bigger compared to the majority of the ico investors so if this might look like normal to you, I can assure that when someone is offering you the kind of money for tokens and shares that we were offering to them, they wouldn't want to discuss in this matter unless something is really shady.   Again, everyone decides for themselves because its your own money.  I am just sharing information that you can simply google and find online on your own.",False

That is good but the quote on forums still keeps the original ""proffesional"" comment.  On another note, I would recommend you to take a very long look in the mirror and think to yourself: Will I have a job in the next months on this company?  The ICO is a complete failure, you are not meeting your objectives; your company has reported just a 600k revenue (out of over 12 mil in sales which means you have deducted the rest as ""cost""), the shareholders in July will definitely inquire about this and your company will easily hit the rock bottom within the next month.

The problem is the following ad-hoc from 05-25-18  ""Due to audit obstacles, the auditors refuse to approve the annual financial statements and management report for 2017""  As we all know, this is something maket doesnt like at all. So the quote crashed from 65 to 30. Elgeti and Daudert have been buying some shares to retsore confidence. Quotes have been above 40 recently. Annual financial statements and management report for 2017 have been scheduled for 06/22 but were postponed to 06/29. So that might be the reason for the drop in the last days. We will see how the story ends in the next days.   Where did you get the information that 11 champions or Daudert have been selling shares? I havent seen anything like this.   Concerning Mr. Egleti and his ""500"" companies: He is just a director of a few ""AGs"". The other 95% probably dont need any meeting and are not operating shells.

That means, for each successfully invited friend, a user will get 2 Bonus Leondrino. Users can earn Bonus Leondrino by inviting your friends to create a Leondrino Wallet and open a STARAMBA.Token account before the Staramba ITO.  Users can share their individual invitation link on the following channels: - WhatsApp - Twitter - Facebook - LinkedIn - Google+ - Xing  or send a personal invitation link via email using the invite friends function within their Leondrino Wallet.  As soon as the invited friends have successfully registered **using the invitation link** (in social media posts or email), the inviting user will get Bonus Leondrino that can be converted into the branded tokens of his choice (in our case STT) at any time.  **HINT**: users have to make sure that the invited friend uses the invitation link to register. If not, the system is not able to check who's friend it is and distribute the Bonus Leondrino to the inviting user.  ______  **We do have Airdrops** There are two ways to benefit from Airdrops:   - users can convert Bonus Leondrino into STARAMBA.Tokens. During three airdrop events you benefit from your early contribution because the balance of your STT account will be multiplied. First event took place on 05.06.2018 the Vision Factor Event. The number of STT tokens earned before Vision Factor were multiplied by 2. Next events will be on 12.06.2018 - the Early Bird Factor Airdrop. This time, the number of STT tokens earned before Early Bird Factor will be multiplied by 1.75. The third and final Airdrop will rain on 19.06.2018 and is called Momentum Factor. That day, the number of STT tokens earned before Momentum Factor will be multiplied by 1.5.  That means, the more successfully invited friends a user has, the more STARAMBA.Token he will get.    - Users can collect additional STARAMBA.Tokens as Bonus for supporting Staramba community building via individual content in form of photos, videos or stories. Details and updates about such supporting activities and appropriate Bonuses will be published on STARAMBA social channels and on Staramba's Brand Page in the Leondrino Wallet  on Friday this week (June .",False
