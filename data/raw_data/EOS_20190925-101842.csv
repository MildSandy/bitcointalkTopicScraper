But right now, it’s the platform, not the user, that reaps the reward.”  As per the report, Block.one recently joined the Coinbase Earn program, an educational offering by major crypto platform Coinbase. The program lets users take courses on a particular crypto in exchange for a small payment in the coin they are learning about.  As previously reported by Cointelegraph, Eos recently partnered with Tether to put Tether’s USD-pegged stablecoin USDT on the Eos blockchain. The delegated proof-of-stake design for Tether EOS reportedly makes it a good fit for peer-to-peer microtransactions.  According to a recent study by Diar, social media giant Facebook’s own payments-focused cryptocurrency, Globalcoin, will face demographic challenges, as the platform’s user base is aging.",False

The company intends to have plenty of people to verify as well, the source said, with plans to spend aggressively on marketing. Block.one concluded a record $4 billion token sale in June 2018.  “What we’re aiming for is a truly self-sustaining economy of thoughts and ideas, where what’s good for the platform is good for the users, too,” CEO Brendan Blumer said at the announcement event for Voice on June 1 in Washington, D.C.  One of the main features of the new platform will be the certainty that everyone on it is real, Block.one said at Saturday’s unveiling.  Blumer told the room, “It’s never been more important to know that who we are interacting with and who we are getting information from is a real person who’s accountable for what they share.”  According to the source, Block.one is going to pay for identity verification on every single user, though the precise form those checks will take will vary by country. However, “It will require government IDs,” the source told CoinDesk.  This could be a major feature for Voice versus networks like Facebook and Twitter, which have each faced significant challenges with bots, disinformation and abuse.  With Voice, people “will realize how spammed out those other networks are,” the source said.  At the same time, however, identity checks could scare off users who prefer to maintain anonymity and the extremely privacy conscious, a group well represented in crypto. Fair launch  At the launch event for Voice, Block.one cofounder and CTO Dan Larimer explained that the economy of Voice would be governed by the voice token.  “We believe everyone deserves a voice. This is why the voice token has the fairest distribution in the world,” Larimer said Saturday.  While the precise details vary with each jurisdiction, every Voice user will receive tokens every day, the source with knowledge of the situation told CoinDesk. People can use their voice tokens to elevate their messages, if they so choose. As voice tokens get used on the platform, some go to content creators and some will be burned.  In that way, as the token supply expands each day, it will also contract as users take advantage of the site’s features, moderating the overall supply. The source did not disclose how large the supply of voice tokens would be or whether the total pool would grow with the network over time. Adoption  The hardest fight for any new social media project is to reach a large number of users.  The source told CoinDesk that Voice should be very attractive for influencers, because not only will they be able to monetize their following as brands pay them to engage with their products, but that paid content may also see a significant response from their followers.  In other words, if users engage with paid content, influencers will get paid twice.  Block.one plans to engage in a very aggressive marketing campaign to get this message out there. The source told CoinDesk the company is “planning a robust marketing campaign” that will require making use of “a lot” of the company’s capital.",False

Once deployed, genesis account holders have until April 20, 2020 to request an account recovery by signing a transaction with the Ethereum key paired to that account.  Accounts must be unused and hold less than 100k EOS to qualify for an automated key swap. To be classified as an unused account you must have these 3 requirements:  1. Needs to be a genesis account  2. Can't have ever authorized a transaction  3. Must have access to the Ethereum key that was linked to the account pre-mainnet launch.

Key Aspects of this Proposal  1. it is impossible to create an account on the Extension chain  2. all account creations are done by synchronizing accounts existing on the EOS Mainnet (including changes in authority)  3. resources would be managed by the BPs of the Extension network  4. these BPs merely operate the network  5. the Extension network does not have its own token, and BPs are paid directly on the EOS Mainnet through a corresponding contract.  6. each chain Extension is free to experiment with governance, and the provided services  More to read: Trust model, Resource allocation and BP incentivization mechanisms, Oracle design, Thoughts on Future Scaling.

Ethereum is immensely popular because of their implementation of smart contracts. However EOS is approaching this differently with asynchronous smart contracts (ASCs). ASCs are something else entirely. Blockchain technology relies on sequential transaction processing, which causes delays and can render the technology inefficient.  The throughput of a blockchain using sequential processing of transactions is limited to the computational capacity of a single CPU core. Using CPUs with more powerful cores can address some concerns, but it is not a long-term solution. Instead, we need to pursue concepts which allow for horizontal scaling, rather than vertical scaling.

The eosfinex team released a new article that goes through the eosfinex architecture. Eosfinex is the industry’s first fully on-chain, fully transparent and scalable exchange built with EOSIO.  Eosfinex is composed of the following components:  - Order books  - Order matching  - Custody and settlement  The exchange contract will initially run on a sidechain using EOX as the system token. Customers can interface with the exchange directly through the EOS blockchain, or by using a custom eosfinex nodeos plugin. Token transfers between the sidechain and main chain will be synchronized using two gateway contracts — one on each chain.  Future developments may include the increase in the number of sidechain BPs and/or launching on the EOS mainnet, along with margin capabilities.  The beta will operate as a ‘Paper Trade’ environment, providing users with the chance to experiment with eosfinex in a simulated ecosystem whilst earning rewards through providing platform feedback.

EOS token holders can shift their votes towards BPs that support the proposal. In this case the referendum would pass even if the 15% threshold is not met  2. ‘No’ voters are not incentivized to vote, as a ‘no’ vote could contribute to the success of a proposal rather than impeding it.

The EOS coin went on sale (ICO) on  26th of June, 2017. EOS, in its white paper, is creating “a blockchain architecture that scales to millions of transactions per second, eliminate user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.” EOS is a blockchain-based system which enables the development of commercial-scale decentralized applications, or dApps on the EOS.IO platform.  Similar to Ripple, EOS.IO  is able to compute millions of transactions per second, which is in total contrast to Ethereum's 20 TPS and Bitcoin's 3-4. The block one platform allows 50,000 transactions every second leveraging the smart contracts. EOS has raised 4 billion dollars from its year-long ICO.  EOS is a perfect enabler to help developers and engineers to build decentralized applications. Tech-savvy and finance-savvy investors are putting in a lot of emphasis on this coin because of its fantastic block one technology which is helping it grow up the ladder at a faster pace. If there’s one cryptocurrency, which is getting most of the optimistic prediction, EOS is the one. EOS can touch $15 by 2019. Business Insider predicts that EOS is going to evolve as the most formidable ICO in the Ethereum network. The EOS crowd sale and scalability makes it one of the five most significant tokens, as per the market capitalization.   As the acceptance ratio becomes more, the value surges upward. EOS is more technologically advanced than Ethereum and Bitcoin, due to which its pace of growth is the highest compared to other cryptocurrencies. Towards the beginning of the year, it will start on a positive note, then in March, it will decrease to half of what it was at the beginning of the year. It will take an upward rise in May and June, where EOS price will reach $9.79 by the end of May 2019. In December, it will take a long plunge upwards to $15.67",False

Very high transaction rates, much more decentralised that centralised systems. ""converging on decentralisation"" as a route to adoption and uses way way less power than POW. A ""blockchain"", you can use at scale for real-ish stuff (like gaming?...)  HOWEVER if it takes off, there is the scary danger it become, as @fractalUniverse called it FED 2.0.  The biggest problem I see is centralisation of the token distribution. A few whales dominate the voting for BPs. Vote buying is already happening so there's already corrupution, in a system that provides trust through the unquestionable integrity of the block producers...  Telos is interesting in that they capped the snapshot at 40,000 tokens on their chain. Personally I think that was too high and they really should have implemented a logarithimic function rather than a cap to give the big whale investors something for all the money they gave block.one.

I've read that according to the Steemit writer Regularrich, it is very likely that EOS will cost about $ 20 by 2019, buying one thousand units of cryptocurrency will be a profitable investment if this happens. Below is a list of possible events in 2019.  Bitcoin and Ethereum dominance in the cryptocurrency market will shrink by about 15%. More crypto are entering the market.  The cryptocurrency market will grow by about 4%. EOS may see growth in its market capitalization; about 60% of Ethereum's. if this happens, the EOS can increase to about $ 70. This is a bold prediction. EOS may face this price if additional crypto enters the market, the EOS community continues to grow. Even if all this happens, some other factors may somehow contribute or positively influence the growth of EOS. This is just a prediction.

EOS main net seems that cannot handle the volume of transactions - as adveritised - not to mention the rest.  On second thoughts, here is the rest (quoted from the article above): Based on initial interpretations of the resulting data, network emulation testing, and source code, the investigation has come to several conclusions about the EOS software: - EOS is not a blockchain, rather a distributed homogeneous database management system, a clear distinction in that their transactions are not cryptographically validated. - EOS token and RAM market is essentially a cloud service where the network provides promises for computational resources in a blackbox for users to access via credits. There is no mechanism for accountability due to the lack of transparency on what Block producers are able to create in terms of computational power. - EOS throughput is significantly lower than EOS initially claimed in marketing materials. - EOS suffers from consensus failures and lacks Byzantine Fault Tolerance. The research results prove the inaccuracies in performance claims and concluded that the foundation of the EOS system is built on a flawed model that is not truly decentralized.  I can handle myself when it comes to wallets, but trying to make one transaction the other day, using fairywallet GUI (which is fine) and a Ledger, nearly drove me nuts - for real. I must have tried more than 50 times, and when searching about the errors I was getting the answers were like ""wait a few hours"", ""delegate more EOS"" and so on. It took more than one hour to make one simple transaction. Well done EOS!! I can't believe that people still support this crap.",False

David Moss, Thomas Cox, Brian Abramson and Corey J. Lederer, the employees, were the second, third, fourth and fifth to be hired by Block.one, the corporate parent that created the decentralized operating system and application environment EOS.  EOS, a computing protocol that competes with the technology behind the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains, supplies a native cryptocurrency of the same name and has a market capitalization valued at more than $5 billion today.  At Block.one, the four employees took on overwhelmingly technical roles. Moss had been the senior vice president of technology operations, Cox the vice president of product, Abramson the vice president of infrastructure and Lederer the senior director of technology products.  The executives joined Block.one last year: Moss and Cox in August and Abramson and Lederer in September. But software developers Jon Eric-Cook and Michael S. Mason, the contractors, had just begun remote work on EOS in the spring.  According to their LinkedIn profiles, Abramson, Lederer, Cook and Mason quietly left Block.one and EOS in the summer. Moss had already quit by May, a month before Block.one published the EOS main network.  EOS launched two test networks last year in September and December and two test networks this year in January and May. The main network went live in June and was released as an open-source software platform.  ""We left because we saw a need in the blockchain marketplace that Block.one was not going to address,"" one of the former Block.one employees said, but did not specifically comment on StrongBlock's strategy to improve the EOS blockchain.  In a live tweet posted from the Global Media Blockchain Summit in Los Angeles last month, Moss, the CEO of StrongBlock, had hinted that ""EOS will be a 787 and StrongBlock will be a custom 787 factory"" while displaying a picture of two Boeing 787 airplanes sitting inside a hangar during a presentation.  The ex-Block.one associates formed StrongBlock in July with Branden Espinoza, an EOS governance specialist. StrongBlock is in stealth and does not plan on releasing its product soon.  Their exodus has opened up a talent vacuum yet to be filled on Block.one's leading technical team, despite the company having recently raised billions in investor money and initiated the early stages of a core product roll-out.  Billionaire backers In August, Block.one completed a year-long, $4 billion initial coin offering (ICO), the largest crowdfunding event involving the sale of a new cryptocurrency. The Block.one ICO priced EOS virtual currency, at the time an ERC-20 standard ethereum token, by market demand.  One EOS had reached over $20 in April. Of the raise, $1 billion had been reserved for assisting in the EOS blockchain's development and financing.  A bevy of billionaires were among those who bet big on Block.one. Venture capitalist Peter Thiel, hedge fund managers Louis Bacon and Alan Howard and cryptocurrency mining giant Bitmain invested in the round of funding that ended at the ICO's close.  Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Christian Angermayer and Lansdowne Investment Company Ltd. took part in a previous round, a company press release said.  Fred Wilson's Union Square Ventures and Multicoin Capital, a Texas cryptocurrency investment group backed by Andreessen-Horowitz and Chris Dixon, have separately bought EOS without investing in Block.one.  Block.one co-founders Brock Pierce, CEO Brendan Blumer and CTO Dan Larimer introduced EOS in May 2017.  Blumer, a video game entrepreneur, sold gaming accessories startup Gamecliff to Internet Gaming Entertainment in 2005 when he was 19. Larimer is known for architecting BitShares, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange from 2013, and Steemit, a blockchain social media network from 2016.  Pierce, who is also the chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation and co-founder of the Tether stablecoin and blockchain fund Blockchain Capital, no longer held a role at Block.one after a March segment aired on the HBO talk show ""Last Week Tonight"" hosted by John Oliver.  Oliver jabbed at Pierce's eccentric lifestyle, out-there promotion of EOS and leadership at Digital Entertainment Network, a 1990s dot-com company that allegedly ran a Hollywood pedophilia ring from a Los Angeles McMansion, according to lawsuits filed in California accusing Pierce and two DEN executives of sexually assaulting three underage males at DEN house parties.  One of the executives, DEN co-founder and then CEO Marc Collins-Rector, had been previously arrested and convicted for sexually abusing a minor in New Jersey.  Buggy blockchain EOS claims to solve bitcoin and ethereum's scalability, smart contract writing and decentralized functionality issues with delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS), a type of governance model for validating block units in a blockchain system to prevent network attacks and faulty transaction recording.  DPoS, a hybrid of the bitcoin blockchain's proof-of-work (PoW) and ethereum's proposed proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms, asks users to vote on ""witnesses"" to confirm blocks that are produced by 21 nodes. Parties pre-selected by EOS control the nodes.  In contrast, PoW forces network participants to expend computing resources by mining randomly generated cryptographic hashes to verify blocks without giving preference to individual users. Block overseers under PoS, a closer relative of DPoS, are assigned mining power based on the amount of cryptocurrency that they hold.  PoS and DPoS have been widely criticized for enabling subjectivity and centralization of network decision-making. Validation can be slower and less neutral than in PoW blockchain models because a super-majority can band together and unduly influence collective interests, staking model skeptics have warned.  Critics again voiced their concerns when the entire EOS network froze on June 16, just two days after the first release version, ""Dawn,"" had activated. Block producers locked seven accounts the next day to stop malicious actors from hacking into wallets and stealing user funds.  Five days later, the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF) executed an ""Emergency Measure of Protection Order"" that halted inbound and outbound transactions to and from 27 wallet addresses without explanation, stoking outcry that the bans set a dangerous precedent allowing users to be terminated and transactions to be reversed without cause — a risk not seen on the bitcoin network.  A block producer, who was dealing with a medical emergency, was threatened with a lawsuit in the following week for failing to comply in a timely manner with another ECAF order that had instructed him to update a network configuration, according to screenshots of WhatsApp conversations posted by several users on Twitter.  Larimer, under pressure from the controversy, issued a statement recommending that the dispute resolution body retreat into a passive role.  Since going live, the EOS network has struggled with defective source code. EOS' bug bounty program awarded a freelance software developer six-figures on the first day of the main network's release at a rate of $10,000 for every error patched.  Business bump Kyle Samani, a managing partner at Multicoin Capital and a vocal supporter of EOS, has not been discouraged. In a June interview with Fortune, Samani admitted EOS has made mistakes but compared them to the rough start that the ethereum blockchain has gradually overcome.  Multicoin Capital owns large positions in both ethereum and EOS, but has highly praised EOS in particular for its scalability, interoperability, low transaction fees, on-chain governance, arbitration constitution and inflationary economics in a glowing review downloadable for viewing on the fund's website.  Asked about Block.one being short-staffed, however, Samani told CoinDesk in an email:  ""We don't have anything to add on this front.""  Israeli decentralized cryptocurrency liquidity protocol Bancor last week publicized a cross-chain expansion from the ethereum to the EOS blockchain to leverage EOS' transaction speed and cost-savings. BancorX, the anticipated product in the move, will trade between ethereum and EOS tokens distributed from ICOs and decentralized applications.  But Moss, the former Block.one technology VP, has said in an interview with ZenLedger CEO Pat Larsen that EOS' claims about being able to process ""millions of transactions per second"" is ""a lot of hyperbole"" because ""there are some physical limitations, like the speed of light.""  The network had conducted only about 4,000 transactions at most at any given time, Moss clarified, but added it was ""amazing"" and ""exhilarating"" to take EOS live with DPoS voting.  As of June, ethereum had eight decentralized applications running on it with 300 or more active users, while EOS had three. Ethereum launched in 2015.  Block.one did not respond to requests for comment about StrongBlock and the departures.",False

Deposit and withdrawals of EOS are already open on Bitfinex and it should not be long for Binance now. Staking EOS is important for the mainnet and to have your airdrops  ,False

The entire community was asked to shut down all the nodes and downgrade to version 1.0.3. All the BPs, along with the Block.One team worked on this issue and has been providing constant updates on their progress.  One of the Telegram Channels named “Mainnet Status” also broadcasted all the instant updates regarding the same. The team also mentioned that the root cause of the issue was due to how deferred transactions were handled.  Following are the steps taken by the team to fix the issue:  A nodeos fix will be released The block producer nodes will be upgraded Blocks will be replayed until last irreversible block Block producers will sync to each other Chain will be opened up for mainnet and has been upgraded to version 1.0.5, without losing any data on the blockchain.  The fix was released by Block.One on GitHub and has been verified by the Block Producers and Standby nodes. At 14:48 UTC, the blockchain went live and the firm released a statement which summarized the entire bug fixing process. The statement was published in English, Chinese and Korean by the Block Producers.  Something in eos lately has a lot of bugs and errors. It seems to me that the price has fallen so strongly against this background. Maybe early launched their network?  Source: https://ambcrypto.com/eos-back-in-action-mainnet-is-up-and-running/",False

The fallback method is meant to capture as many unregistered tokens as possible and make them available to their owners immediately at launch.  The fallback method works first by identifying the Ethereum addresses that hold EOS ERC-20 tokens but do not have corresponding EOS public keys mapped to them (i.e. unregistered). First, it grabs a public key for that address from the Ethereum blockchain, and then the Ethereum public key is ""converted"" into an EOS public key.  How is that possible? Think of it this way, your Ethereum public key is just the wrapper around a longer array of numbers which are compressed into a 64 character string that you call your public key. This 64 character string is specific to Ethereum and always begins with '0x'. If you “reverse” the process you can go back to the array of numbers and encode it for another blockchain, in this case EOS, which always begins with 'EOS'.",False

Also, the ICO had been happening for about a year, so it's not like people haven't had tons of time to figure out what's happening on their own.  It's also not like the way EOS is working during its launch hasn't been clearly stated, publicised and explained to everyone, including on the EOS official website.  They are trying something totally new, so... To participate in something so new requires paying some attention, but not much.  I don't see that as a huge drawback. I'm also having a hard time identifying where people will lose any coins other than being totally stupid by falling prey to scams or thinking their ERC-20 placeholder coins are the real EOS coins when they're not (and then never claiming their real EOS coins).  Those blunders would fall into the category of being ""totally stupid"" in my book.  Other than that, for people with coins on the reputable and enormous exchanges currently allowing EOS trading, it seems all the technical aspects will be handled by those exchanges before they allow people to transfer any real EOS coins off those exchanges.  For those holding their EOS balance placeholders in ETH wallets, EOS has been publicising how the claiming of real EOS coins will work with those placeholders for a while now.  Of course that doesn't mean there arent still totally stupid people in the world unable, unwilling or too lazy to do a little reading before sinking their money into something (or too lazy to check into mandatory software update developments (after they've been around for months)).  Many others salute those people, because their lost coins from errors like you described above only decrease the overall coin supplies in the long run.  Try not to ever be one of those people.",False

All of these questions are answered all over the place.  They are in the testing phase now (phase 2 of 4), which could take days, something that was very well publicised, including a huge article on Coindesk.  Anyone with EOS coins on an exchange should currently leave them there, as there is no wallet yet. No one yet knows which will be the main chain, and untill they are certain everything works, a blockchain rollback is possible, hence they are in testing. Therefore, there is no wallet yet. There is also no block explorer yet.  EOS coins currently on exchanges are placeholders for what will be swapped to ""real"" EOS coins once people are free to move their holdings around. The exchanges I know of are taking care of any technical aspects of exchanging any placeholder coins into real coins for people with coins on their exchanges.  Whether various exchanges will honor any airdrops following (or happening during the launch) largely remains to be seen. Hopefully, most will. The more hell everyone gives the exchanges, the more likely they will be to honor any airdrops, hahahahahahaha. But do give them some time to sort through all the dust and make official announcements about airdrops before giving them any hell.  Additionally, anyone who pre-registered their ETH wallets and are holding their placeholder coins in an officially approved ETH wallet (as opposed to on an exchange), will gain access to any airdrops once the dust settles. Placeholder EOS coins in officially approved ETH wallets will then need to be claimed for real EOS coins once officially approved EOS wallets are up and running.  Remember, ERC-20 placeholder coins were just used for the ICO, and once real EOS coins are released into the wild, they will be their own animal, which means they will not be ERC-20 coins. The ERC-20 EOS coins are just placeholders for the balances people will use to claim real EOS coins once official EOS wallets are up and running.  Until people are 100% ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN they have determined what the main chain will be (as well as which wallets are officially on that chain), no one should attempt to move any coins around.  There will likely be a million scams, which is all the more reason to be 100% certain of what you are doing (from information distributed from official channels) before doing anything involving moving coins.

I fully admit I'm technically not as up to speed as most of you on here, and I'm still pretty new to this scene but I'm having loads of trouble getting my MEW address registered for the snapshot and I just don't know what to do next.  I have a pretty small amount of EOS for what it's worth, but it would still suck to lose it. I sent it to MEW from Kraken where I had bought it. I followed all the instructions on the EOS page, verified that 'Amount' was set to 0, hit 'Generate Transaction' and lo and behold, it tells me I don't have enough gas to fund the registration.  Now I'm all confused about this whole gas thing, I'm trying to learn about it but it honestly is going over my head.  So I send about 50 bucks worth of ETH to MEW, hoping to push this transaction through. Follow all the steps again, and when I hit 'Generate Transaction' it tells me I need to set a gas limit of at least 90 000. So ok, I type in 90 000 and send it through. Now I'm seeing that my transaction is 'out of gas'.  I'm so worried now I'm going to lose my EOS, just because I tried to do the 'right' thing and send it to MEW even though Kraken claims it will take care of all the technical details for the holders, and I was tempted to just leave it in the exchange since I know I've got so much to learn when it comes to the technicalities of crypto.

Do this soon like today if you got a lot of eos on exchange.

This customization can include configuring token supply, initial distribution, default seed nodes, token symbols, and more.  BEWARE OF FRAUDULENT NETWORKS  Many are eager to receive free airdrops offered by one or more community driven initiatives. Scammers may attempt to utilize this time to launch chains and/or distribute software designed to steal your private keys. Please remember to carefully read and review everything associated with a project before taking any action.  A scammer that successfully steals your key will gain control of your account(s) on all community blockchains. For this reason it is critical that users do not download, compile, install, or run software from untrusted GitHub repositories. Please use caution before using any community efforts, as Block.one will not review, certify, nor endorse any specific effort.  Before compiling code from a potential EOSIO fork, please use diff tools to identify how the author modified Block.one’s reference code to support their chain. If you are unable to audit the code yourself, find or hire someone you trust to do it for you.  Secondly, do not run code published by anonymous sources. Everyone should carefully vet any team that manages an official GitHub repository for a chain. The team responsible for the GitHub repository will also be responsible for coordinating all official releases, upgrades, hard forks, etc.  While GitHub allows anyone to fork the software for a chain, developers, block producers, and exchanges will likely rely upon a semi-official GitHub repository.  Every community should make sure that their GitHub repository is in trustworthy hands.  Software Updates, Bug Fixes and Support  The EOSIO software is provided “as is”, without warranty of any kind, express or implied. If someone chooses to adopt and deploy the software, they take full responsibility for patching and upgrading the software as necessary to serve their use case.  Block.one cannot offer free support to all of the potential chains that may be launched, nor can we take responsibility for bugs or unapplied patches. Any and all community-driven chains are services offered by community members to other community members.  Block.one will continue to enhance the EOSIO reference software. In this process we may find and fix bugs on our own schedule. It is up to each EOSIO-based blockchain community to review, merge, and implement an upgrade strategy.  Upon the release of EOSIO 1.0, Block.one may provide support services for a fee to enterprises and individuals who require development and configuration assistance with their chain.  If you or your business are considering deploying a blockchain based upon EOSIO and anticipates it will require assistance with this process, please contact us at support@block.one for more information.",False

The update includes a number of changes in preparation for the full launch of EOSIO 1.0 in June, according to Larimer’s Medium post Saturday, May 5.  Block.one is an open source software publisher currently working on EOSIO, a decentralized operating system designed for industrial-scale applications. EOS, the ERC20 Token that is fueling the EOSIO platform, currently has the fifth largest market cap of all cryptocurrencies, according to data from Coinmarketcap.  One month after Dawn 3.0 was released on April 6, the 4.0 update includes a number of new features and guidelines, according to Larimer’s Medium post.  It is mainly focused on inter-blockchain communication, a feature that Block.one believes to be critical for scaling blockchains up for large user bases.  According to Daniel Larimer, Dawn 4.0’s inter blockchain communication would give applications running on different blockchains the ability to purchase the unused RAM from each other over “multiple chains with independent memory regions running on independent hardware.” Specifically, Block.one predicts “many applications will prefer the many-chain approach to scaling as it will lower overall costs and scale faster.”  Dawn 4.0 seeks to encourage users to distribute their unused RAM by letting supply and demand govern the price. As EOSIO expects increased demand for RAM, the price will automatically increase, “so that the price approaches infinity before the system runs out of RAM.”  In addition to inter-blockchain communication, Block.one has “been focused on cleanup and stability of the EOSIO software.”  According to Github, where the project is currently in development, there are 508 open issues with the software at press time. However, with 987 issues now closed, EOSIO is the eighth most active C++ project on Github for the past month, not far below Bitcoin, which holds the sixth place.  source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/eosio-announces-dawn-40-update-full-release-slated-for-june",False

EOS is paired with the fixed-price token, and profit taking or stop losses are showing that the USDT is a necessity when it comes to securing crypto gains. In the case of EOS, the wild series of volume records, unprecedented BTC and dollar prices, may be broken by skeptics. The involvement of Brock Pierce in the project, the talks of price manipulation, and the potential troubles around the elections for block producers may shake the confidence in this project.",False

This means that if you want to trust your value in bitcoin, then you have to put your trust mainly into the exchange cartel. You have to trust them for not creating funny money on their on exchanges and not to pump up the value with wealth that doesn't exist outside of their books. There is no solid legal framework around cryptos yet, so you can use all kinds of shenanigans and clear yourself of blame pretty easily. This part is the biggest unknown to me with cryptos, because for instance, if we would find out that Tether was funny-money, then it won't only hit BTC hard but every crypto will suffer.

It was also risky to buy ETH in 2015 or BTC in 2011. The main factor driving the pumps in crypto is always hype, not practical effectiveness. If effectiveness was the driving force, then bitcoin market cap. would be outside of top10 at least. The main thing that makes EOS very attractive to me, is the potential to build hype on. It has better base to build hype on then ETH had. It has higher goals, better known dev and the environment where attention has shifted more from bitcoin to newer projects.

Would be amazing if it wouldn't be so and bitcoin would drop, while more practical alts gain value, but fat chance of this happening.

Verify what I said  here:  https://eosdac.io/tokens/ "" unquote ( end of my friend's questions )   UPDATE:  He got a response from Exodus that said:   Unfortunately, Exodus will not be supporting the eosDAC airdrop directly. There are so many forks and airdrops occurring weekly it is not possible to keep up with all of them.  Having said that, you will receive the eosDAC token in your Exodus wallet if you have 100 EOS or more in your wallet at the time of the airdrop and your EOS address is registered. However, the eosDAC will not be directly available in your Exodus wallet; you will need to export your private keys to access the token, you can find more information here: https://support.exodus.io/article/697-how-to-deal-with-airdropped-token-with-exodus  Please be very careful with your private key! It controls your ETH and all your ERC20 tokens.

EOS is mainly pumped hard by multiple paid YouTubers such as Cryptoversity. I'm glad its unavailable in the USA because they don't want to register it as a security -like all other public companies do- and have their crooked books opened to public, why dont they?.  ETH is mineable coin with a 72M coin premine. Its partially centralized due to Vitalik's power and say over its direction. It's mainly used for making scams but it's a heck of a lot better than EOS. With all of that said ETH marketcap is $45B which is only 6.5 times of EOS. That is a crazy ratio for a proven success of ETH backed by mining power of millions of miners compared to a centralized piece of pumpware EOS that could collapse one day or if the billionaire guy behind it decides he has made enough money already.

BlockOne are not responsible for launching this software. They are only responsible for taking a snapshot of your EOS-ERC 20 token balance  4.

ETH is switching to POS at some point. DPOS would almost always ends in cartels. In POS with 1% of the supply you get 1% of rewards, in DPOS even owning 1% or 10 Million EOS you could get none of the rewards. As demonstrated in practice by LSK.  The switch from 5% to 1% rewards is an acknowledgement that DPOS is a poor consensus model imo. If DPOS was good a voting system, then honest voters would direct the 5% inflation to high performance nodes, awesome development & marketing, while returning the unneeded amount equally to shareholders/burning it, ergo the % inflation wouldn’t matter. But the EOS developers know most of the funds will just end up in the hands of the most powerful voting cartel who will pay themselves millions per year for nothing, hence reduce it to 1% to minimize damage.  With few nodes and votes in the hands of cartels + Low privacy  (Dan actually advocates even less, he wants ‘radical transparency’ - phone number, photo, birth date etc - which would make EOS non-fungible.) People will realize EOS provides very few of the advantages of decentralization so they’re better off using a centralized private blockchain run by IBM/other if the main thing they want is a distributed ledger & high performance.  As I said I think >10X gains is doable for EOS this year but it doesn’t have a long life expectancy at the top because many others are competing on vastly increasing performance but also vastly increasing decentralization, privacy & adaptability, all of which need to be combined to create the market leading smart contract blockchain a year+ from now.",False

If you think about it, each distribution cycle, we get 2.000.000 tokens added to the market, which currently has about 750.000.000 issued tokens. This means we regularly dilute our token supply by what are currently about 0.25%. The thing that makes this bear hard on price though, is that there are a lot of people trying to ""flip"" the ico and arbitrage a bit by getting in slightly under market prices and selling as soon as as they receive the distributed tokens. Current daily volume of traded EOS on bitfinex is 4 million on all pairs, that makes the 2 million from the token sales sound a lot more important, and even if only 10 percent of people try to flip it creates significant downward pressure on price.  So what I'm saying is unless trading volume gets really high or there is a sharp spike in public perception thanks to a news announcement etc, we likely won't see much price action until we are closer to launch imo.",False

I stopped following EOS a long time ago when they were clearly taken to answer for their laziness in coding (basically they just took an old framework and updates it to say EOS).

It will be ERC20 so make sure you hold your EOS off exchange when the snapshot date (to be announced) occurs. If you participated in the crowdsale, be sure to claim your tokens beforehand. We will give at least a week's notice ahead of time so you have time to prepare.  We will be releasing the tokens before the June 1 2018 EOS mainnet release. This should help stimulate community growth and engagement, especially because we want token holders to vote for some ground rules of the Everipedia Network.

Once the wallet is registered just transfer all your EOS tokens to it (The MEW Wallet). You only need to register the wallet once so if you want to buy more on exchanges and send them to the same wallet later, you dont have to re-register them - the wallets are effectively tied so that when the Jun 1 snapshot is taken, your EOS wallet (tied to the MEW wallet) will have equal tokens.

EOS is the brainchild of 31-year-old Hong Kong-based internet entrepreneur Brendan Blumer and programmer Dan Larimer.

Block.one is registered in the Cayman Islands, and comprises roughly 50 employees. Development for the project reportedly occurs through an open-source development platform, and as such, the company does not have a central office.

These are all things that were stated or implied before the ICO.  It’s not strictly necessary for it to be fraudulent for it to be illegal under securities law.  But I bet the SEC can find some fraud and misrepresentation of material facts any way. They’re quite expert at digging out that stuff and even offer huge $millions bounties to those who will provide inside information to them.  Also given that they’re attempting to claim the token sale is not a security issuance, then they will also be subject to consumer protection laws as well. Those complicit in selling MLM bags to greater fools could I guess also possibly be culpable.  I mean basically get involved with something shady and do not be surprised when you end up in some troublesome shit.  And I hope nobody is spending their profits from all these token sales as clawbacks are potentially a threat. And then if you can’t pay back, you’re in deep shit.

It promises nothing in return and is an open source software that will be released. You sure wasted a lot of words and don't even understand what EOS is.  The securities law is based on the profit expectations of investors, not what EOS writes in their legal documents which do not reflect the economic reality of the situation.  Do you see Blockone actively ensuring that the EOS tokens will not have any value? Did they sue the exchanges to prevent the tokens from being listed?  Open source does not help them avert the securities regulations, because for one thing they pooled the funds raised and are expected by investors to use those funds to develop the open source.  The investors expectations are proven by the comments in this thread. All the SEC has to do is capture this thread. Note I have archived this thread at archive.is to help the regulators.  Quote from: Red_Sanford on October 14, 2017, 02:09:24 PM As far as US buyers using VPN to get around getting EOS tokens, 99% of other ICO's have allowed the same loophole. They gave the same warnings with even stronger language discouraging US buyers  Nevertheless, the US buyers side-stepped the controls and thus EOS (i.e. blockone) has likely violated the law.  Disclaimer: IANAL. This is not legal advice.  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 09:50:32 AM It will be epic if all those funds get frozen and clawed back. Let’s see which “partners in the silicon valley” take the risk of receiving black money and risk a 20 year felony prison sentence per the money laundering laws in the USA for accepting funding that was obtained via illegal activity.  Quote from: scaryvirus on October 21, 2017, 09:06:16 AM Any other ICO format for a PoS coin would be literally idiocy.  You could have at least done the SAFT and limited it to accredited investors. Then at least you’d have some heavyweight legal research behind you.  But then of course you might not have received $300 million because you would need to know the identity of each person, do a background check, etc..  […]  I read that EOS plans to show some auditing ostensibly to claim “proof” they were not buying token sales from themselves. But that can be subverted given that tokens were sold apparently without requiring identity checks. Thus it is easy to operate with ETH loans or other ETH the insiders have access to through sock puppets.

I couldn't find anything that suggests that EOS is a scam.  1. Claiming they are not subject to US securities laws because they claim they did not sell to US persons, yet it is documented that US persons did purchase the token sale. They refused to do KYC to prevent US persons from participating. Ditto for Chinese, Koreans, UK, Canadians, and other countries which have strict securities laws and are cracking down. So they incorporate in the Caymans and presumably expect to hide behind layers of lawyers. Let’s see how that works out for them and those accomplices affiliates like @chryspano.  2. Running the ICO for a year so they can pump hype about being ahead of schedule, cause the price to jump way up so they can sell, then let the price crash back down so they buy their own ICO. Recycling their money over and over again to extract maximum rents from the ecosystem while ending up with most of the ICO tokens for themselves via numerous sockpuppets same as they did for Steem. Running their tokens through Bitfinex in Hong Kong with that Tether et al scam that Brock Pierce is involved with so presumably they can obscure the disposals of the funds to fiat so as to obscure how their extensive organized crime syndicate is buying their own ICO. Look into the conglomerate structure of the parent companies of Bitfinex and climb down that rabbit hole. Even Dan announced in a blog that they would do this admitting in writing that he is scamming.  3. Documented upthread that the ICO is designed to be algorithmically gamed (details linked upthread) so that this is unfair. Dan was warned about this before launch and chose to ignore it.  4. Terms of the token sale claim that the tokens are not be part of any future software distribution, and that there is no common enterprise because the funds raised are not being used to create such a software distribution, yet in videos  and promotions they claim exactly the opposite that they are using the funds to develop what will be the software distribution. Clearly all the speculators here expect the tokens to be the tokens of the software distribution.  5. Lying about their technology. Ridiculing other experts (including PhDs of computer science from Tendermint, Vitalik, and myself) who write correctly about their technology.  6. Failing to admit that DPoS only functions properly if the stake (tokens) are controlled by an oligarchy of whales.  7. Lying about the past performance of the technology, even having their shills here declare me a liar when I point about that the Steem system has been DDoS attacked numerous times because the zero transaction fee nonsense does not fund the perimeter nodes of the system.  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on November 06, 2017, 12:17:48 PM Actually I had always thought that Dan was genuine but just a bit weird/myopic in terms of his design choices and political-economic philosophy. But the premeditated sneakyfastmine of Steem (wherein he wrote a blog in advance announcing they would do that) to grab 50+% of the money supply for an oligarchy of whales caused me to start to doubt whether he was innocuous. But then I realized he did not have much choice because DPoS does not function properly with chaos in voting (he was frustrated the Bitshares governance was not working correctly to approve funding for some of the things he wanted to be worked on) and must be controlled by a like-minded group of whales. And Steem was somewhat interesting because it was the first experiment for onboarding the masses. And the first with a front-end interface and use case outside of just a wallet. So I rolled with it and used the lessons learned (such as my blog mathematically figuring out that voting from minted tokens of the collective can never be fair and must aggregate to the whales) there to guide my project plans. But the $2 billion “useless token” sale and all this distortion of the material facts while ridiculing others in the industry is way over the top and has lowered my respect for Dan even further into the gutter.  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on November 05, 2017, 02:56:17 PM Quote from: btcbringer on November 05, 2017, 02:36:49 PM it seems the price will not rise high until the ico end  Ah I would not count on that. When BTC peaks, then there might be a lot of FOMO money spilling out into alts. And looking at major alts, there are not that many solid choices. So many speculators are perhaps going to look at ETH at $28 billion marketcap and EOS at $0.5B mcap, and somehow equate the two since EOS will have a first-mover advantage higher transaction volume capability (even though it is just vaporware and a lot of work to get to point that ERC-20 tokens are being issued on EOS someday).  Betting against FOMO-fever is not wise. It will all probably come crashing down someday, but probably not in 2017. I think the prior decline in price before the recent hype about accelerated progress, was probably the down move for 2017. Alts are about to catch a bid after mid-November.

Expected to support 10K transactions per second on 1 CPU-core.  It scales: Their Virtual Machine can do all the calculations in parallel. So easy to add 50 or a 100 cores. According to Dan hundreds of thousands of transactions per second per chain.  It's free: You can't compete with freemium. Look at a company like TomTom with their navigation system. How can they ever compete with Google Maps which is free?? In EOS the dApp creator stakes a bunch of EOS (they might ask you to help here a bit with some staking) so the Block Producers give them a certain capacity (like 1000 transactions per second). So as a user you don't pay anything. That way someone could make an exchange (like a Poloniex or BitTrex) with zero fees. And by the way: that exchange is in a smart contract no risk that they steal your coins because they can't (if the contract is proper that is ).,False

One explanation is arbitrage.  But according to https://eosscan.io/ the price for period #146 (which ended 25 min ago) was $1.72, and even tho Bitfinex received a ton of EOS right after period #146, the price didn't drop from $1.78 (it may have dropped 2 cents from $1.80).  If this pattern were just arbitrage, I'd expect the crowdsale price to be closer to the exchange prices.  I have witnessed this many times--ICO price a bit below exchange price, but the exchange price doesn't drop right after the period ends.  In other words, this pattern is probably not part of an arbitrage strategy.  If somebody is accumulating EOS, there is no need to send to Bitfinex.  https://etherscan.io/address/0x4e8c49fab23532ef2ed14058639f55cf45bade1e https://etherscan.io/address/0x59438809e11ef3a9e197de965abbfd6792092b76 https://etherscan.io/address/0x9fad7a730ba976ea8cbcf8fcd6e4c217386520a8 https://etherscan.io/address/0x188fb986e8932e8469578430acaa5a2c12f5c48b https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3c2e9512ea8026b68f69012944e89238a011ac7 https://etherscan.io/address/0x71d8b9755bbca15fc491e6520c21e319a574680b https://etherscan.io/address/0xeae47e717bb68f80180382e954320bed9072676b https://etherscan.io/address/0x8c63dfba829060122225d22c9d1d33841d8468d0 https://etherscan.io/address/0x47fcb6d294aad242088b026ad87867166c375207 https://etherscan.io/address/0xe777cde17e532f78227554607872adbb36597f06  also, EOS seems to be maybe the most transacted token at finex: https://etherscan.io/tokentxns?a=0x1151314c646ce4e0efd76d1af4760ae66a9fe30f&p=1  I am a huge fan of Dan Larimer, Steemit is a wonderful platform, and I really like the EOS project.  However, I cannot come up with a legitimate reason for the pattern I am seeing above.

Heck Mark Zimmer of Apple Computer (a programmer/founder/CTO I used to work with/for, who was personally recruited by Steve Jobs) gave me that idea on his blog several months ago, of automating the things for companies that are being stolen such as customer logins and identity (do you want the link?). Come on. I remember when I pointed out to Dan in a Steemit comment in 2016 that SSL certificates could be made more secure on the blockchain and he thought that was a really cool idea. So maybe I am the one who started his thought process down the direction it is now. Who knows.  Execution is what matters. And decentralization.  If they were sure of their own execution, they would not need to cash out1 before they even produce it.  Ideas are like assholes, everybody has them.  Do you have any idea how many people are working on ideas in this world? Expect the number of token projects to multiply by another factor of 10 by next year. Execution is what matters. There will be an oversupply of ideas.   I am starting to read and research more about EOS. I am still not convinced to investing, but every day looks like a great idea.  There is a lot more to making an investment than just an idea. Do you support their ethics? Is the token sale transparent and above board (did you not see upthread that the token sale is being gamed algorithmically)?  Do you want to invest in centralized ledgers? Is centralized governance via voting the direction you think our future will go? Did we get into crypto because we wanted to replicate the horrific political-economics of governments?  Etc, etc, etc.  Only you can decide what is important to you.  Personally I got interested in decentralized ledgers (decentralized coordination) because I wanted to try to see if we could change the structure of the world, not right back to same ole shit. Wallstreet, money, governments, and corruption. EOS appears to be knee deep in that shit.  If you just want monetary gains from speculating that others will speculate. Then by all means grab some of the FOMO train and ride on.  1 Even if they’re collecting the funds to form an investment fund in app developers, that is still not a valid reason they need to take it upfront. They could have instead executed first, then sold tokens into the market to raise funds after they proved their execution. But they apparently think they have avoided securities laws by structuring it the way they have, but I do not think so. I think the securities law avoidance is just an obfuscation of their desire to cash out because they’re not sure if they can really execute. Execution is more than just producing a functional blockchain. It is about also proving they can get any market uptake and interest from real adoption in the corporate market they’re targeting. Perhaps they think they can with $2 billion in funds essentially bribe/incentivize interest to adopt, but markets can not be created artificially. There actually must exist use cases. If the funds can be employed to develop for actual use cases the markets have, then it works. But they have not proven that they have these marketing and development chops (a combined skillset). So far I do not see any accomplished software product marketers on their team listed on their website. They have enough funds to hire some. For example, I could refer them to Steve Guttman who I worked with when I worked with Mark Zimmer. Steve was a VP of Marketing at Adobe and made Photoshop the king of commercial graphic editors. He was VP for us at Fractal Design and he went on to be a VP of Marketing at Microsoft. If I see them hire someone of that caliber, then maybe I will think they’re serious about execution. So far all I see is mostly these ii5 people from Hong Kong who are roughly in their 20s and have no experience.  Btw, EOS apparently did no KYC and thus backlash is coming:  Quote from: http://www.businessinsider.com/switzerland-ico-crackdown-2017-9 Still, the massive growth of the ICO market, which has ballooned to more than $2 billion this year, according to data from fintech analytics firm Autonomous NEXT, has forced the agency to crack down.  And EOS will add another $2 billion.  AML law typically says that if selling a convertible virtual currency, then must do KYC. I have no idea what quality of attorneys are advising EOS. Are they ignorant of AML laws    Possibly Dan et al are going to have bigger problems to worry about than coding and execution.  Disclaimer: I am only expressing personal opinions.

My recent blog which afaics strongly evidences that Dan is not thoroughly qualified, was excerpted from that white paper.  Vitalik is finally getting closer to my design as I have taken so long to get my design to release. But afaik he is not quite there yet.  Because the dickhead keeps slandering my coding performance over the past couple of years, I want to set the record straight on this matter. I tried to ignore it, but he continues repeating this point beating me over the head with my chronic illness debacle. Because he is evidently an absolute scumbag similar to @DecentralizeEconomics. I would have preferred to settle the issue privately with him, but he is too much of a faggot (keyboard warrior so brave hiding behind the network) to face me in person man-to-man, so therefore I will set the record straight in public.  The only thing that stopped me from releasing it earlier in 2017 was because I was undergoing a 6+ month antibiotic treatment for disseminated tuberculosis which was so toxic to my liver which in turn was so neurotoxic (the meds are known to kill 0.02% of those over age 50 due to liver toxicity and 2% can not even finish the antibiotic regimen due to liver toxicity, additionally my liver was already beat up for having the active form of the illness for so many years prior) that I could not maintain the concentration and mental energy to code. I battled this problem every day for years. It was (perhaps still is) a debacle which words can not adequately describe.  Liver toxicity combined with auto-immunity (because the immune system is attacking the body tissues infected with the disseminated bacteria) mimics the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (because the endocrine system gets messed up), and this can mean severe brain fog, chronic fatigue (meaning not enough energy to tie shoes), and numerous other symptoms. The closest most of you have experienced to this, is drinking a bottle of Tequila (including the worm) and being totally shitfaced hungover with dry heaves in the bathtub the next day. Now imagine that condition for years. Would that make you irritable?  And then there was a several month recovery process.  All those investing in EOS long-term be forewarned. I am probably going to destroy your investment. Short-term FOMO speculation I can not impact.  Good luck.  (And no, I am not short EOS. And no I am not promoting my project, as I am not even going to announce it on BCT. I am forced to write something to correct lies of the dickhead. No choice).  I have created million user software all by myself in the past such as one of the first easy-to-use, drag+drop WYSIWYG web page editors Cool Page which had ~1% market share of the entire Internet in 2001. As well, I am one of the early co-devs of what is now Corel Painter (not Paint), the first that simulated the physics of natural paints and media and pressure. I have worked with for example Lee Lorenzen who created Ventura Publisher, one of the worlds first WYSIWYG desktop publishing software back at the time of that revolution in the late 1980s before Aldus PageMaker and Adobe Photoshop. I even created one of the first such software in the late 1980s named (Neocept) WordUp, but for the Atari ST. I did not switch careers from an entirely unrelated industry just to get into blockchain development. I have been a computer programmer and computer scientist all my life starting at age 13 in 1978. Was a contractor for EOS Photomodeler in 1996 and created the 3D Viewer and some 3D import/export formats, before I created my Art-O-Matic software and then Cool Page after that. Then after making a lot of money on Cool Page, I basically retired until I got interested in blockchains, because I had not found anything to work on that interested me sufficiently and which could make a world impact. Also because my life took a mid-life crisis dive in my 40s (some destructive quagmires I got snarled in due to choice of a wife and I guess we can say wanderlust/disgust with USA culture at the time), which is the reason for the health problems and eventual poverty (by 2013/4) which I ended up (coupled with an illness that prevented me from working effectively), which I am now climbing out of.  I am going to make you STFU dickhead. Most likely, as @DecentralizeEconomics has done due to his failure of judgement, incorrect slandering of me, and subsequent failure & embarrassment, you will crawl into a cave and disappear.  In fact, if I had not had disseminated Tuberculosis from 2012 - 2017 (but did not even know what disseminated TB was and thought I had Multiple Sclerosis because the symptoms were similar), I would have produced software in our crypto industry many years ago. Many times over those years I thought maybe my health was improving (because it turns out that high dose vitamin D3 spurs the immune system to fight back), but then it relapsed (because the TB bacteria will lay dormant to hide then re-emerge) and I did not realize I had a disseminated (meaning not confined to the lungs, but also in the lymph nodes, gut, possibly brain, etc) bacterial infection. It was not until January 2017 that I was diagnosed. I was there discussing the technology with them since 2013. Charles Hoskinson offered to create a project with me before he approached Vitalik to create Ethereum. And that was when he told me what Dan did to him, but I encouraged him to create another project and not be downbeat. And no I will never repeat what he told me to anyone. It is private. But I refused because the technology was not yet mature. But those guys (Dan included) wanted to rush and release something before they had developed the technology. I had even warned Charles that Turing complete contracts on a blockchain would lead to some sort of DAO attack. And I refused to get involved in selling an ICO in 2014 and all that noise. I told him I was not ready and to go ahead without me. Also I knew I was sick, but not as sick in 2013/4 as I became in 2015/6. Note Charles has subsequently pointed out in public that he was against the ICO and wanted Ethereum to take investment from venture capitalists instead.  I am not like that. I do not sell hype. I create solid technology and products.  Just to set the record straight on your lies dickhead.  Actually I had always thought that Dan was genuine but just a bit weird/myopic in terms of his design choices and political-economic philosophy. But the premeditated sneakyfastmine of Steem (wherein he wrote a blog in advance announcing they would do that) to grab 50+% of the money supply for an oligarchy of whales caused me to start to doubt whether he was innocuous. But then I realized he did not have much choice because DPoS does not function properly with chaos in voting (he was frustrated the Bitshares governance was not working correctly to approve funding for some of the things he wanted to be worked on) and must be controlled by a like-minded group of whales. And Steem was somewhat interesting because it was the first experiment for onboarding the masses. And the first with a front-end interface and use case outside of just a wallet. So I rolled with it and used the lessons learned (such as my blog mathematically figuring out that voting from minted tokens of the collective can never be fair and must aggregate to the whales) there to guide my project plans. But the $2 billion “useless token” sale and all this distortion of the material facts while ridiculing others in the industry is way over the top and has lowered my respect for Dan even further into the gutter.

And to reiterate, what really set me off was @chryspano claiming that I am subservient to Dan, just because I was a blogger on Steemit as if I work for them (the hierarchy of whale oligarchy in Dan’s kingdom blockchain projects). Lol. In your dreams, mofo.

And let’s not forget my blog and a companion BCT thread urging going all in on BTC when it was ~$600. And the screaming all over the forums to buy LTC at $6 because it was going to $50, then $100, which caused a ban. And what did LTC do? It went to $50 and then $80 (where I sold and repurchased at $40s) and now it is going to $100 - $150. They key there was selling at $60 (on the bounce from $40s) and buying BTC on dip at $4000 with the proceeds (which btw I did not do even though I thought about it, bcz I was busy on other more important matters and because I had not yet time to sort out my thinking on the timing of any possible SegWit booty theft attack, but I did sell some at $60 for BCH). As for Steem, I cashed out as much as possible at $4. Looks to me that @chryspano is still holding bags which I may send to zero price (although chart wise, looks like Steem might have another huge move up which presumably would be due to its first mover established marketshare and perhaps some key change that will be made such as partnership with a major social network?, but not certain).  Remember anything can happen during competition. The best laid plans of mice and men can be disrupted and this can cut both ways.  But there is no need to be lying about material facts. Compete on the merits not sleazy.  Quote from: chryspano on October 20, 2017, 07:45:04 AM In the meantime Dan is building scalable blockchains with governance systems that are years ahead of any ""competition"" while others cling to the past and are showing their envy with FUD, no, FUD is not the right word, BS is!  Governance = centralized clusterfuck, due to the political-economics science of voting. Thus not Internet scalable. Transaction volume scaling is not the only facet of scaling.  Here is a key example wherein a whale can cause censorship:  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on November 02, 2017, 06:24:51 AM UPDATE: We have @chryspano a whale-dolphin at Steem abusing the downvoting feature to censor the images and my entire blog post at Steem is now hidden (so much for the power of decentralization when the blockchain is overlorded by whales). Note the busy.org rendering of my blog page is still intact as that site apparently doesn’t enforce Steemit’s whale-controlled censorship.  The entire fucking point of the game theory of Bitcoin is to be immutable and remove governance. Now we await to see if the SegWit “pay to anyone” booty will be stolen with a long-range chain attack restoring the immutability of Bitcoin, or if the game theory failed.  What is the use case of the new Dtube app for Steem is the whales can censor content the same as Youtube is?",False

They create opportunity costs to destroy the peg by extracting value out of other facets. This can be examined formally with math.

That is one of the reasons I wrote upthread that EOS can talk the hype and even have a $2 billion war chest, but it does not mean they can necessarily solve the underlying free market opportunity costs which have prevented widespread adoption.

Of course you do not.  You’re technologically illiterate.  Let’s go on a live video debate? Lol.  Here is another DPoS shill idiot:  Quote from: https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6qm0y2/is_the_ethereum_team_defending_their_ground/dooqy3t/ Proxy is just another name for another account or whale or public person or not used at all, makes little difference. If we're talking about ""power"", mining pools in eth are far worse..  He did not even read what Vitalik linked to which refutes the power of miners do such malfeasance that can be done on DPoS:  Quote from: http://vitalik.ca/general/2017/05/08/coordination_problems.html With blockchain applications, however, we are doing something different: we are using coordination problems to our advantage, using the friction that coordination problems create as a bulwark against malfeasance by centralized actors. We can build systems that have property X, and we can guarantee that they will preserve property X to a high degree because changing the rules from X to not-X would require a whole bunch of people to agree to update their software at the same time. Even if there is an actor that could force the change, doing so would be hard. This is the kind of security that you gain from client-side validation of blockchain consensus rules.  Note that this kind of security relies on the decentralization of users specifically. Even if there is only one miner in the world, there is still a difference between a cryptocurrency mined by that miner and a PayPal-like centralized system. In the latter case, the operator can choose to arbitrarily change the rules, freeze people’s money, offer bad service, jack up their fees or do a whole host of other things, and the coordination problems are in the operator’s favor, as such systems have substantial network effects and so very many users would have to agree at the same time to switch to a better system. In the former case, client-side validation means that many attempts at mischief that the miner might want to engage in are by default rejected, and the coordination problem now works in the users’ favor.   Note that the arguments above do NOT, by themselves, imply that it is a bad idea for miners to be the principal actors coordinating and deciding the block size (or in Ethereum’s case, the gas limit). It may well be the case that, in the specific case of the block size/gas limit, “government by coordinated miners with aligned incentives” is the optimal approach for deciding this one particular policy parameter, perhaps because the risk of miners abusing their power is lower than the risk that any specific chosen hard limit will prove wildly inappropriate for market conditions a decade after the limit is set. However, there is nothing unreasonable about saying that government-by-miners is the best way to decide one policy parameter, and at the same saying that for other parameters (eg. block reward) we want to rely on client-side validation to ensure that miners are constrained. This is the essence of engineering decentralized instutitions: it is about strategically using coordination problems to ensure that systems continue to satisfy certain desired properties.  Vitalik did not bother to reply to all these idiot shills because never interrupt the enemy when they are in the process of destroying themselves.  And you recently said I was junior to Dan. Lol. I am going to hold your feet to the fire for that delusion you have.

Do we even know who you are? A budding enrollee into organized crime syndicates?  I completly forgot that you also have legal ""expertise"" too! Although you sound more like a buffoon.  Vitalik had an interesting comment that is applicable:  Quote from: http://mengnews.joins.com/view.aspx?aId=3038837 Quote China has decided to fully regulate ICOs. The Securities and Exchange Commission has also decided to allow ICOs only when they fulfill all the criteria necessary for initial public offerings.  ICOs are also likely to be banned in Korea. What do you think about the regulatory moves by the nation toward ICOs? Will the regulations hamper technological development?  I think banning ICOs completely will definitely hamper technological development, as we return to the problem that the open-source software industry has had before, which is that software development is very hard to monetize.  Imposing very specific regulations is also problematic at this stage, as rules that are not well implemented can often be either easily worked around or even counterproductive, as they encourage further obfuscation. Deliberate ambiguity, so as to keep open the option to go after truly bad actors, may well be the optimal strategy in the short term.  Dan the guy who has admitted in writing doing premeditated scams, continues to misrepresent material facts, goes for a money grab in cohoots with various shady people, and intentionally trying to subvert securities regulations might be an ideal candidate for bad actors.  The Block.one team is basically all the ii5 people that the CEO of Block.one brought in from his company in Hong Kong and a few people Dan brought with him from Bitshares/Steem. They put this together with Brock Pierce’s connections to investment bankers and created an offshore Cayman islands corporation yet still end up selling to US persons because they apparently did not KYC on buyers of the token sale.

Claiming they are not subject to US securities laws because they claim they did not sell to US persons, yet it is documented that US persons did purchase the token sale. They refused to do KYC to prevent US persons from participating. Ditto for Chinese, Koreans, UK, Canadians, and other countries which have strict securities laws and are cracking down. So they incorporate in the Caymans and presumably expect to hide behind layers of lawyers. Let’s see how that works out for them and those accomplices affiliates like @chryspano.  2. Running the ICO for a year so they can pump hype about being ahead of schedule, cause the price to jump way up so they can sell, then let the price crash back down so they buy their own ICO. Recycling their money over and over again to extract maximum rents from the ecosystem while ending up with most of the ICO tokens for themselves via numerous sockpuppets same as they did for Steem. Running their tokens through Bitfinex in Hong Kong with that Tether et al scam that Brock Pierce is involved with so presumably they can obscure the disposals of the funds to fiat so as to obscure how their extensive organized crime syndicate is buying their own ICO. Look into the conglomerate structure of the parent companies of Bitfinex and climb down that rabbit hole. Even Dan announced in a blog that they would do this admitting in writing that he is scamming.  3. Documented upthread that the ICO is designed to be algorithmically gamed (details linked upthread) so that this is unfair. Dan was warned about this before launch and chose to ignore it.  4. Terms of the token sale claim that the tokens are not be part of any future software distribution, and that there is no common enterprise because the funds raised are not being used to create such a software distribution, yet in videos  and promotions they claim exactly the opposite that they are using the funds to develop what will be the software distribution. Clearly all the speculators here expect the tokens to be the tokens of the software distribution.  5. Lying about their technology. Ridiculing other experts (including PhDs of computer science from Tendermint, Vitalik, and myself) who write correctly about their technology.  6. Failing to admit that DPoS only functions properly if the stake (tokens) are controlled by an oligarchy of whales.  7. Lying about the past performance of the technology, even having their shills here declare me a liar when I point about that the Steem system has been DDoS attacked numerous times because the zero transaction fee nonsense does not fund the perimeter nodes of the system.  Vitalik was interviewed:  Quote from: http://mengnews.joins.com/view.aspx?aId=3038837 Quote Concerns about as well as regulatory measures to control initial coin offering (ICO) is on the rise. Are ICOs a necessary part of the process in the development of a blockchain ecosystem?  ICOs are a powerful tool and one that in many cases is an important aid in funding protocol development. In general, open-source protocols are very hard to monetize, and so the fact that in this particular area, we actually do have a way to monetize protocol development is something that we should be thankful for.  However, they also have their flaws, and I think many of these flaws arise from the fact that even though the ICOs are happening on a decentralized platform, the ICOs themselves are hardly centralized; they inherently involve many people trusting a single development team with potentially over $200 million of funding.  There are also not very good incentives for people to produce information to help people determine which projects are worth participating in. I think in the medium term, getting funds with ICOs will get harder, regardless of whether or not regulation is implemented.  Vitalik is wrong. There are numerous methods for monetizing open source:  http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/magic-cauldron/magic-cauldron.html  All of them require actually producing something that people use first before monetizing.  Apparently Dan has decided to go the direction of the Wall Street criminal syndicate and cashing out before producing things that are valuable. Steem has no viable business model. Dan is only creating scams that require more greater fools to sustain them. Nobody is willing to pay anything for a Steem blog. There is no actual commerce going on over at Steem.  What is going on now is selling ICO bags to grandmothers. Once we have all the ICO tokens in the hands of n00bs, then the crypto winter comes and that is when the regulators come in because so many grandmothers will have lost their life savings. Because as Vitalik has accurately predicted, 90+% of all ICO tokens will go to zero.  This is what Goldman Sachs does. They did it to Greece for example. Dan is an accomplice and maybe they will leave him hanging out to dry as one of the fall guys.

Because up to this point, all of his designs have been Rube Goldberg obfuscations. Even the pegging of BitAssets is not viable. Pegs can never be maintained (this can be proven mathematically) and they require centralization to hold up for the limited time until they ultimately fail. I can not find anything he has ever designed that had any prayer of actually being decentralized. It is all adhoc (not researched) bullshit.  As far as I can tell (after watching numerous videos, interacting with him on these forums in 2013, and observing his designs hence), Dan is not a genius. He is a moderately intelligent aerospace engineer who switched over to computer programming. Evidently, he is in way over his head in terms of trying to solve the decentralization of the Byzantine Generals Problem. Have they hired any academics or researchers who are capable? Afaics, Ian Grigg is not an expert in Byzantine Fault Tolerant decentralization. I saw his presentation trying to justify the governance of DPoS.  EOS will scale transaction volume, but because it is controlled by an oligarchy of whales. And this is not resilient, trustless, permissionless, nor decentralized control. Thus it will never Internet scale, because it will fall to the political-economics of centralization and voting.  Vitalik is closer to a genius, and I am sure he is much smarter than Dan. Dan is pragmatic. Vitalik is idealistic and trying to find an algorithmic solution. It’s possible that Vitalik's idealism may end up causing Ethereum to fall behind in the race for transaction volume scaling. Dan’s pragmaticism is to go after transaction volume scaling pronto and disregard the idealism for a decentralized solution, and instead pretend DPoS is decentralized.  Any way, EOS and Ethereum are not the only horses in this race. Surprises are coming. There is already Cardano which was produced by academics. That is from Charles Hoskinson’s IOHK (the co-founder Dan kicked out of Bitshares and broke verbal contracts with). There is the RBB academic work out of Australia. And there are others coming up in 2018 as well.  Nobody is against Dan doing his thing and putting his hat into the ring. But the lying and bullying of respected experts is ridiculous. Dan participated in a technical discussion on Tendermint’s Github (and I heard PhDs participated), then he runs to his whale controlled circlejerk on Steemit to write some nonsense to his faithful n00b idiots like @chryspano. Ditto in the debate with Vitalik.  Instead Dan and Block.one are not driven by the goal of academic research and acknowledging all feedback and working for the best outcomes. Clearly instead they are motivated by money and money and money only. They will do anything and say anything to get money, even when by doing so they are suppressing the advancement of the science. I had the thought that maybe Dan became more insecure about sufficient funding after Bitshares exhausted their funds. Yet he claims they already have enough self-funding from their Steem premeditated, sneakyfastmine money grab.  And srsly, going for a $2 billion fundraising and lying to get there, is of course going to cause blowback as what you are seeing here now. If he was really serious about the work, he does not need $2 billion all at once. He could have held tokens and built up the project, then his tokens over time would be worth much more than $2 billion if he actually succeeded. But no, they want to do it some scammy way where they get all the ETH and they get the tokens also (by manipulating/gaming the token sale), and then advertising to grandmothers with billboards and taxi cab ads in New York.  What really set me off is when @chryspano seemed to think that Dan is superior to me in research and knowledge about decentralized ledgers. Even after I wrote a blog demonstrating he is mistaken, he refuses or is incapable of acknowledging reality.  It is not really a big deal to code up DPoS (yes of course any significant coding project requires effort and man-years). The more difficult challenge is finding the design that can actually remain decentralized.  Also the zero transaction fee design has tradeoffs. Do you see EOS being open in their prospectus about the tradeoffs? Or are they claiming that everyone else is incorrect and their solution is perfect!  Srsly going for a $2 billion token sale and not even having a quality white paper.  ",False

When BTC peaks, then there might be a lot of FOMO money spilling out into alts. And looking at major alts, there are not that many solid choices. So many speculators are perhaps going to look at ETH at $28 billion marketcap and EOS at $0.5B mcap, and somehow equate the two since EOS will have a first-mover advantage higher transaction volume capability (even though it is just vaporware and a lot of work to get to point that ERC-20 tokens are being issued on EOS someday).  Betting against FOMO-fever is not wise. It will all probably come crashing down someday, but probably not in 2017. I think the prior decline in price before the recent hype about accelerated progress, was probably the down move for 2017. Alts are about to catch a bid after mid-November.  There’s no argument from me about them being astute at money grabs. Their timing was impeccable.  Unlike @chryspano, I am not going to intentionally lie to you to try to force the reality to be different than it is, so I can end up being wrong later. I’ll call a spade a spade.  Even the 0.5 billion shares still to be issued, does not put EOS at $28B mcap yet. Isn‘t the FOMO-fever capable of pushing EOS up to near ETH’s mcap in spite of it being not yet launched, nor even to be a mature product when it is launched in middle of 2018?  Please do not tell me that suddenly our ecosystem will become prudent and virtuous. It’s all about flipping bags to grandmas and millennials. Get on board the train man so no child left behind!  Do not forget that we have Dan’s “sui generis, blockchain mogul” reputation on sale here. Afair, Steem peaked briefly as a Top 5 mcap, or surely it was Top 10.",False

I have no feedback from any of you other than 18 upvotes before @chryspano censored it from Steemit’s viewers as explained in my prior post.  Was the math of Byzantine fault tolerant consensus more comprehensible the way I explained it? I had edited what I had from my white paper to make it a bit more explanatory.   Quote from: pilum5 on November 02, 2017, 06:18:37 PM Hello, I didnt get why you need only 33% to shutdown the blockchain.  Thanks for asking. I realize that math result is non-intuitive and difficult for a layman to believe.  See the “Math of liveness & safety” section of my blog. Study the explanation of the math that is quoted from my white paper.  It is because over the overlap of 2 elections for the relative pairing of two blocks, and the fact that there are N delegates who vote yet the quorum size must be T. We then solve for a mathematical relationship between T and N by equating the two expressions, because we have another requirement that the excess of N - T be equal to the aforementioned overlap 2T - N - 1.  The point is that it is the need for the ability to objectively prove the relationship between any pairings of block elections in the case that everything is relative because all actors are untrusted and the network propagation order is indeterminant (which relates back to the oft-cited FLP impossibility theorem which is mentioned in more detail in my yet unpublished white paper). This is why mathematically 33% can halt the blockchain, if we care about there existing an objective consensus (i.e. safety and consistency) and not just an unbounded number of subjective competing forks (i.e. double-spends and chaos). Of course a boastful, overeager FOMO-bag seller like Dan would claim this is incredulous, because Dan is apparently ignorant of the math and does not have his priorities on being expert on the research. I find it incredulous that Block.one raised ~$500 million thus far and apparently can’t even be bothered to hire some researchers to teach them about their technological weaknesses.  It is all in the math. I know it is non-intuitive but this result is from the 1980s (although the way I have derived it and explained the well known result may be my own unique insight). Sheesh and Dan is not even aware of it.  Realize the 33% liveness threshold (where 33% can shutdown the forward progress of the blockchain) only applies for an elected set of delegates and not to proof-of-work.

If Travis’ goal is world impact and really wants to invest in decentralization as he claims (if he is really serious about building it out decentralized to 100s of millions of users), then he better not make the mistake Mark Zuckerburg made (which nearly caused him to lose Facebook) and instead invest with my decentralized ledger design instead.  Besides afaik EOS (unlike Steem) has no significant onboarding model. Even Brock admits the goal is all about the size/production of the community that can be onboarded. The tokens are being issued to speculators, not to users. So any apps that want to involve users and tokens (i.e. token gamification), are depending on users to go buy tokens which they will not do (instead EOS expects apps to hodl tokens, delegate their bandwidth to users, and profit on the speculative rise in the value of their hodled tokens). EOS expects the apps to pay for the usage of the blockchain by hodling tokens, yet even though that is dubious enough as is, I also point out in my blog that there is no funding for the websocket servers of an app for example (which was the discussion upthread about the DDoS attack).  Dan is rushing this because he (and apparently Brock Pierce, who is a founding board member of EOS and was founding board member of the 2013 Mastercoin ICO “scam” and who might have shady past) saw a huge $2 billion money grab to go grab asap and the technical and adoption/ecosystem market options are not well thought out.  UPDATE: We have @chryspano a whale-dolphin at Steem abusing the downvoting feature to censor the images and my entire blog post at Steem is now hidden (so much for the power of decentralization when the blockchain is overlorded by whales). Note the busy.org rendering of my blog page is still intact as that site apparently doesn’t enforce Steemit’s whale-controlled censorship.  Also why Travis would get tied up with the probable illegality of the EOS tokens which I explained in detail upthread. I’ll presume Travis is smarter than Dan.  Brock Pierce claims EOS only sold tokens to USA persons, but I documented upthread (and this all archived) that is not the case. Brock also seems to think that 99% of the securities regulation enforcement risk comes from taking funds from USA persons, but I think that is an exaggeration! Afaik, the UK and Canada also have significant securities regulation. Perhaps he means perhaps only the USA has the wherewithal to really fuck you up if they want to. I realize lawyering up and jurisdictional gaming of securities regulation is strategy, but also I think I have documented that the Block.one token sale is about as blatant of a willful attempt to violate securities regulation that I have analysed. Including massive misrepresentation of material facts, which is thus the fraud element the SEC needs to further motivate them. No need to repeat my analysis which is already upthread. I suppose Brock Pierce is very well connected in venture capital and investment banking circles (he mentioned in another video being friends with Goldman Sachs, so I have my suspicions that the regulators are being bought behind the curtain, which is perhaps maybe why you need to grab $2 billion). Note I think the entire securities regulation game is a corruptible mess that needs to be disrupted/disintermediated anyway, so I’m not relying on the SEC to aid my competition against Dan and EOS. I’m just saying whoever partners with Dan’s centralized Rube Goldberg shit, is going to get their butts kicked in the free market by decentralized Internet scalable designs and projects which scale more bottom-up, virally, and not top-down overlording as per the DPoS/EOS/Steem (aka @dantheman) model.  But why would developers want to put their entire future life at risk of going to jail if they do not need to? As I said, afaics the incentives for developers on EOS’ are not good. You have Block.one with $2 billion in capital, so they are going to dole it out to developers and basically pick the winners and losers instead of the free market. Has my blog post linked above not demonstrated that these dudes are far from being sufficiently omniscient and technologically astute. The truly ironic reality is that the best developers work not mostly just for money but because they want to impact the world, thus they will favor decentralization over top-down scams. And the irony will likely be that developers who approach Block.one will be scamming Block.one to get a slice of the $2 billion. Satan operates this way. Block.one scams the greater fool speculators, then the developers of apps will scam the greater fools at Block.one  Why would an independent development group go work to build the other guy’s token, when you can make your own? This is why there’s very few expert developers available for hire in our ecosystem. You’d only join EOS because you’d been fooled by some ideological+technobabble BS or you’re not very capable, i.e. you’re better at scamming than creating something to impact the world, or because you presume no other option will have sufficient economies-of-scale or that all the momentum will go to EOS (the latter of which I think would be an incorrect analysis).  Another potential problem with taking an uncapped amount of fundraising over a year’s time, is that it’s possible in some cases to deplete the market of future buyers of the token. EOS will have to end being a Top 5 market cap in our sector and possibly even necessary to onboard new capital from outside our existing speculator ecosystem, because they will have taken $2 billion of out our ecosystem in the ICO.",False

So imagine 50 block producers (BPs) on the EOS network. They all sync the transactions and data. App-devs (like a social media network) stake EOS in a contract to hire resources.  So let's say a social media network stakes 3000 EOS in a contract. Now the miners offer that dApp 15.000 Ts/sec. for example. But there's more. The owner of the dApp can vote for a certain miner, maybe a trusted one which is producing blocks for over a year now. So that block producer now has an extra vote.  So EOS will pick the 21 block producers with the most votes. And they are making rounds of 21 blocks (21 seconds) for example. Or 10.5 seconds with a 500 ms. blocktime.

The flaw is in Dan’s ability/desire to do comprehensive game theory analysis (actually someone claimed on Twitter they had warned them about the propensity of such flaws). There are at least two or three instances of that already.  2. @smooth and I discussed upthread the potential for spamming EOS (DPoS) by whales and why the whales could still hypothetically profit even if the price catered. So ETH is more fair because perhaps more or less anybody can spam it, whereas potentially EOS will be even more totalitarian and only the whales can steal everything. Which is pretty much been my analysis and complaint against Steem and all of Dan’s designs. (Note I do not want to put words in @smooth’s mouth so please re-read his equivocations)  Of course they try to turn this bad news around and hype as some benefit of their technology. Another case of them distorting material facts which I believe are fraud under securities laws. But given they were willing to take $300 million from anonymous sources, I do not know how they expect to escape the 20 year felony (20 years for each instance!?!) in the USA for accepting money with a criminal lineage (even though the law does say they need to have knowledge of the criminality of the funds received, I believe the token sale to the public-at-large requires them to register a MSB). The only rationale I can think of is they’re running a criminal enterprise (buying off regulators, etc). If I suddenly get suicided or assassinated, maybe I will realize I should not have posted in this thread, huh.  Why didn’t Vitalik do an ICO to his own ETH base and collect several $billions into a huge money pot? Probably because he has been advised it is illegal. And note when we see serious looking investors at a recent conference listening to presentations by Brock Pierce and Block.one, afaik those attendees are there to see presentations by many entities and are not necessarily representative of who participated the EOS token sale.  Therefore, this is my last comment about the EOS token sale.  Good luck.

Do not like this  Something you should like: the money raised is purportedly slated for reinvestment into the EOS ecosystem  What experience does Dan have as a venture capitalist and picking winners and losers in terms of software applications.  It is somewhat analogous to giving the government a lot of money and then they spend $100,000 per public toilet.  “An elephant: A mouse built to government specifications.” — Lazarus Long  Instead why not allow the applications to compete in a free market which allocates the capital to the winners and losers. The free market is composed of many decentralized actors which each make localized decisions optimized by local information which the top-down entity can not accurately appraise. This why ice when cooled slowly has fewer cracks (related to simulated annealing) because the localized molecules are able to have more time to rearrange themselves optimally based on local gradients.

The next stage for the Red Belly Blockchain is to make it available to all Internet users and eos may no longer be needed.  Just like DPoS (EOS, Steem, Lisk, etc), Byteball, and Tendermint, this RBB also relies on a permissioned set of delegates, aka a “consortium blockchain”.  What makes proof-of-work (and my upcoming decentralized ledger) different is they’re permissionless participation. This is important because we discussed upthread that selecting a set of permissioned delegates always implies an oligarchy or centralization due to the Iron Law of Political Economics.  Permissioned and centralized is what we’re trying to eliminate.  Whale controlled clusterfucks just puts us right back into all the corruption and failure that the world is collapsing into. If we’re going to innovate out of this, we need truly decentralized systems.  Also I have argued that centralized clusterfucks do not scale out economically due to the point about corruption, infighting between whales, lack of degrees-of-freedom and level playing field for non-whales.  The reason this matters is because ecosystems with centralized overlords who play favouritism are not trusted and invested in generally.  Ian Grigg provides another perspective on the distinction between permissioned and permissionless. His Constitution without walls is my decentralized ledger design, except he has a mistake. He wants to do it with voting, elections, delegates, but that is known to fail to be fair due to the Iron Law of Political Economics and the power vacuum. However, my solution is algorithmic and deals with this more effectively I think. To the extent that the Constitution is algorithmically objective then no forks are created. Also I think he is formulating a false dichotomy by concluding that win-lose is correlated to a permissionless decentralized ledger.   I tried listening that CEO of Block.one and Dan, but they bored the fuck out of me. The CEO dude appears to be a technological neophyte. And Dan speaks far too slowly for me (I was falling asleep). This Brock Pierce dude is quite articulate and seems astute, but unfortunately he goes on about decentralization but doesn’t seem to factor in the impact that EOS’s consensus algorithm is centralized due to the political economics of voting. Brock Pierce is correct though to point out that potential for decentralization can in some cases be present at other scopes of a model.  That Block.one CEO dude is nodding his head affirmatively when another person says the blockchain must track all our identities and by implication we should not have any privacy any more! Even if they refer to pseudonymous identity, it should still be optional in many cases.  Dan made an astute generative essence point that decentralized ledgers enable an equity model instead of a debt model.",False

Quote from: smooth on October 21, 2017, 08:05:26 PM Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 09:50:32 AM The bolded point above by Vitalik is that if transactions are free up to the burst limit, then the DoS attackers can avail of it. Thus the DPoS blockchain is attacked and not just the servers (nodes) on the periphery. A sock puppet attack can be employed to defeat any attempt by the block producers to fairly limit each user. This would have the effect of forcing all users to the minimum transaction bandwidth their stake will accord, because a significant portion of the stake is maxing out the bandwidth and compensation of the block producers.  The burst capacity is of limited use to spammers. There is a burst limit that is some moderate multiple of your minimum allocation, I think currently 10x.

I do not understand why both of you guys seem to be ignoring Vitalik’s point.  As I understood his point to be that as spammers max out the utilization (presuming they have significant stake, not the 0.1% in your contrived example) then users no longer have that reserve of burst capacity available, thus they have to buy exactly what they may need in their 99th percentile usage pattern and this is thus more expensive than just paying transaction fees.  Granted that Vitalik’s scenario does require the attacker to control significant stake (and spread it around in sock puppets), and you might retort that why would those who own a majority of the state want to destroy the value of their own coins. Yet you @smooth afair used to argue exactly the opposite against proof-of-stake arguing that since nothing is at stake they can short the market, profit, rinse, buy low, the market rebounds on their pump, then repeat. Unless I am somehow misstating your past stance on proof-of-stake.  Sorry the inconsistency around here is wasting my time.  I wasn’t paid to explain Vitalik’s thinking. I get paid to produce an altcoin. And so please excuse me if I exit from this never ending series of explaining everything.  I have no beef with @smooth. I appreciate very much our interactions (we’ve had our instances of strife which can be due to numerous factors but overall is dominated by rational dialogue). I have a beef with those who use @smooth as some battering ram against me.  Quote from: scaryvirus on October 21, 2017, 05:31:02 PM A sock puppet attack would do nothing since bandwidth is divided from maximum bandwidth per vested coin, not per account, so irrelevant.

They could also disrupt by electing malicious or just poorly-performing block producers, especially given the natural and inevitable voter apathy problem where a large portion of stake does not and will not vote intelligently or at all. (It is quite plausible to me that a motivated 10-20% stakeholder could either vote all block producers or disrupt the voting sufficiently to cause other problems.)

I am confident that in his mind he is so damn sure that the issue is black & white as he perceives it, but until we have a real debate in a setting where one side can’t hide behind the keyboard while throwing out slander, then it is possible for the accuser to be perfectly confident while being also possibly entirely delusional himself (of course the vice-versa is also entirely possible which is the point of having a verbal dialogue to bring some sanity to the apparent cognitive dissonance or stubborn wills or what ever the case may be).

Maybe ""Gleb Gamow"". I loved his altcoin announcement. Lol.  What can I do with trolls[the self-anointed, omniscient ethics judges] who refuse to have any sort of reasonable interaction? Just refute, move on, ignore.   A few facts which John Titor can not deny (unless he wants to lie):  Someone misquoted me with a verbatim quote that alleged I wrote verbatim “dpos was down”. I never wrote those exact words and it is trolling to insert words into a quote which someone did not write verbatim. John apparently claims I am lying about claiming I did not write those exact words. Thus John is lying. Notwithstanding that he says he read my discussion with @smooth and any interpretation he chooses to make from that discussion (which I may disagree with), but in no way can that cause those exact words to be what I wrote when I factually never wrote those exact words. The major websites that drive data to the decentralized ledger of Steem/Steemit were down. This affected 1000s of users. I was not lying when I claimed that the ledger was essentially down, because most of the users were presumably unable to send any transactions. I never wrote that the block producers or every specific aspect of the decentralized ledger was down. I wrote that Steemit DPOS as seen from busy.org (and steemit.com and steemd) was down. That is what I wrote, yet somehow John claims I am lying. I pointed out that this could possibly affect other altcoins which also employ DPoS and my thinking on that was further explained in the recent discussion where I explained for example that collectivized transaction fees apparently means there is no direct revenue model to fund these “sites” aspect of the (interaction with) ledger which are necessary for the users to be able to interact and send transactions to the ledger. Afair, I also went to steem.org and tried to find a block explorer or any documentation which would have given me any additional insight and was entirely unable to find anything in short order that would be applicable. The salient point being that the project is highly disorganized and lacks even technical documentation, reliable block explorers, etc..  I have no idea what the hell is wrong with him. I wanted to speak with him and get some clarifications. I tried.  I certainly do not understand how the above stance is delusional. I would like for him to explain that allegation to me. But based on his communications, I do not think he is interested in truth.  Srsly John, if you wanted to pick an issue to try to nail me to the cross with, you’d pick one with less ambiguity so you could have the unequivocal proof you need. Opinions are like assholes not like unequivocal facts.  In short, you made a mountain out of a molehill, beat a dead horse, and slandered a person who is working as hard as he can to try to counteract very serious problems in our ecosystem and in the coming global world order.  Oh but I am delusional so I just think I am doing that and it is all in my imagination. In fact, I ingested magic mushrooms and I am hallucinating about it all. Gotcha. You hold on to that thought. Put it in your pocket and do not lose it.  It is not an issue of myself being unwilling to accept being wrong. I accepted @smooth’s factual assertion that the block producing nodes were not down and his argument that this meant technically that the “blockchain” was not down from his perspective of what it means for a blockchain to be functional or not.  I will not accept someone falsely accusing me of lying and accusing me that I claimed something I did not claim. If I had 100% certainly that every aspect of the blockchain was down, I would have written that! Instead I wrote what my observations were that Steemit DPoS was down as observed from busy.org, so I qualified my assertion by mentioning what I had checked. Do you not think that myself being a programmer that if I had certain knowledge of the inner most core of the ledger system of Steem/Steemit being down that I would not have harped on that   Come on man. Use your brain.  And again, I do not feel any remorse at all for mentioning that it was down, because as I said, it was down effectively for 1000s of users.  In the software business, defensive positions about definitions are for losers who do not understand the bottom line. When the shit is down for 1000s of users, then you have a serious fucking problem.  Quote from: private discussions They are trying to claim I am derelict and that I claimed the blockchain was down when the block producers were not offline. But I did not exactly make such broad claims. I merely claimed that the system appeared to be down from the sites I had checked. And actually most of the transaction traffic to the ledger had presumably gone offline. So he claims I am intentionally lying. Wonder why he blew a fuse?

The ledger is a holistic concept.  I'm not sure what you were talking about here. The ledger was not down. Exchanges (which run their own nodes) were still able to transact. Other people running their own nodes (including myself) were able to transact. Some lesser known web-UIs running their own nodes were still functioning.

I do not understand why that is so difficult for people to appreciate.  Again it was not only Steemit that was non-functional because of the inability to pull data from the blockchain. It was also busy.org and also steemd was non-functional (an error about something) at the same time. I would quesstimate that 90+% of the traffic to the block producing nodes was non-functional and not sending transactions.  Again it was apparently not the websites which were non-functional as the web pages were loading. Yet it was the data from the ledger which was not being served. Now you claim these servers/nodes which supply the data from the blockchain to these sites is not part of the blockchain. That is your definition. There is no conspicuous official documentation I have ever seen which makes all of these definitions you are claiming to be the official ones. Heck there is not even a proper whitepaper for the DPoS blockchain. It is not even clear if there is any funding and economic model for these nodes/servers which are suppose to provide the data from the blockchain to the front-end sites.  Yet somehow you still claim that the system was functional. Yeah functional for a few whales and nerds, but not for the users. Isn‘t that just a wee bit disingenuous or facetious to claim it was functional?  It's akin to arguing with your girlfriend that you only broke her arm in one place and not two. Only a clueless nerd would try to argue the distinction. Steve Jobs would fire the person who claimed it was functional when 1000s users were offline.

Having behind us the commercial interests and the laboring interests and all the toiling masses, we shall answer their demands for a gold standard by saying to them, you shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.  The Silver Democrats, led by William Jennings Bryan (1860-1925) and his famous speech against the Gold Standard, overvalued silver on a ratio to gold at 16:1, which led to massive arbitrage. Silver poured into the country and gold fled. This unsound finance led to the virtual bankruptcy of the USA by 1896.  This is when JP Morgan came to the rescue and arranged for a gold loan to bailout the US Treasury. It was Morgan who made every effort to raise the stature of the United States in dealings in London. Indeed, by 1914, that was the final peak in the pound and thanks to World War I, Britain had found itself deeply in debt.

I don't disagree on that point, as I said it was an important application (or part of the ""system"" if you want to call it that) that was down.  Quote Again it was apparently not the websites which were non-functional as the web pages were loading. Yet it was the data from the ledger which was not being served. Now you claim these servers/nodes which supply the data from the blockchain to these sites is not part of the blockchain. That is your definition.

I should also acknowledge that my original comments could have been construed to mean by some people that every facet of the system was down especially the concept of a blockchain as distinct from the ecosystem built around the potential forward progress of the ledger (regardless of whether most of the ecosystem could not send a transaction) and the nodes which are relied upon to serve the historic data, and thus you were correct to correct me on that point. I stand corrected and I admit I was wrong to give such a broad scope impression to those who interpreted my words as such. In my haste, I admit I failed to be as circumspect as I could have been in properly articulating myself to avoid angst and incorrect interpretations. And I admit that those who have railed against me are probably correct that I had some intention in my mind to draw a bad light on this fundraising effort (for the various reasons I had mentioned), so it is quite understandable that they would dig into me about this issue.  John has finally decided to open a dialogue and is pointing to this comment I made (extracted from a lengthy list of issues I raised):  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 06, 2017, 03:18:14 PM Steemit’s DPoS was offline for over an hour before I slept. And when I awoke it has still been down several hours later. The DPoS centralized ledger design is not robust enough to scale out to the world. It works for some small shit like Steemit sometimes.  Again I believe he is reading what he wants to read and not my intention. I am clearly linking there to:  http://archive.is/http://www.isitdownrightnow.com/steemit.com.html  Obviously that is not a link to any full node proof or claim that the block producing nodes are still up (even though that link does give a good indication that most of the forward progress of the blockchain would be stalled and thus down).  The context of that post was I was making general criticisms of DPoS and for example another criticism which has come forth is that the design of DPoS apparently does not fund these servers/nodes which have to supply the data from the history of the blockchain. To me, that is part of the blockchain, because it influences whether there will be (significant) forward progress of the blockchain because most of the users depend on it (as currently implemented afaik but no documentation for me to be sure unless I dig around in source code and such).

Quote from: http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/23/wrongful-conviction-no-surprise-to-kansas-black-community.html WICHITA, Kan. –  Rose McIntyre says she wonders whether her refusal to grant regular sexual favors to a white detective prompted him to retaliate against her black son, who spent 23 years in a Kansas prison for a double murder he didn't commit.  Rose McIntyre recounted in her affidavit that Golubski coerced her into a sexual act in his office in the late 1980s and then harassed her for weeks, often calling her two or three times a day, before she moved and changed her phone number.  ""He had total power, and I was terrified that he would try to force me again to provide sexual favors,"" she said in the affidavit. ""I also knew that there was no one I could complain to, as Golubski was known to be very powerful in the community and in the police department.""  Golubski was so involved with black female prostitutes and drug addicts that he fathered children with some of them, according to an affidavit from retired police officer Ruby Ellington, a 25-year Kansas City police department employee.

The problem with Bitcoin is scaling, not Visa level speed (although nanotransaction speed of Bitcoin is a problem but that wasn’t what Satoshi was refuting). The quote I provided spoke about speed of confirmation, not scaling.  Afaics Dan did not paradigmatically improve on this. He created a centralized system which requires the coordination of whales, and thus all he did was essentially copy Visa. Perhaps we can argue that DPoS is more like federation.  Of course it is possible to scale to Visa speed with a centralized system. Duh. But scaling to billions of users requires decentralization, because coordination of whales turns in a clusterfuck as the collectivized pie for fighting over becomes larger.  And Vitalik has already explained why the zero transaction fees is collectivized nonsense and will be attacked to hell once you put in a system with $billions riding on it and not some underutilized toy like Steemit.  And worse yet, he launches his money grabs in ways which arguably are getting closer and closer to securities law violations and enforcement actions.   In the meantime banks are becoming CHEAPER and FASTER than bitcoin is today (at least in EU with SEPA transfers), but yeah shitoshi ""politely slaped"" Daniel because Daniel 7 years ago could foresee a problem that still hasn't been solved yet!  Many of us saw the problems. And I was also one of those in discussions on this form with Dan back in 2013 about potential solutions and Dan was always proposing weird collectivized shit that did not adhere to the principles of decentralization. And he was working on pegs, which are nonsense because pegs are never sustainable.  Lots of hair-brained Rube Goldberg machine type ideas. But Dan did come up with at least two or three really good ideas and I commend him (e.g. TaPoS, locking up onboarded tokens for a period of time, and onboarding users by awarding tokens although this last one was also my idea). But the money grabs and the obfuscation of centralization (and even falsely claiming he solved decentralized budgeting when he mathematically did not) does not impress me. And then the “useless token” sold to non-accredited USA persons raising some $300 million seems to me as if he (as a USA citizen) is taking some huge legal risks. If you’re impressed then go forth and reap what you sow. We can agree to disagree about priorities.   In the meantime Dan is building scalable blockchains with governance systems that are years ahead of any ""competition"" while others cling to the past and are showing their envy with FUD, no, FUD is not the right word, BS is!  There is no envy son. Is your head so big that you‘ve become delusional. Just giving readers another perspective so they can make their own informed decisions.  Sounds like you’re envious of my standing? If I was nobody, you would not bother to attack me so vehemently. I do try to be fair in my assessments and when @smooth came here then I acquiesced to factual corrections.  I almost became a supporter of Steem (even contemplated talking with the founders about joining as a developer) and actually I do still continue to comment positively about the facet of Steemit providing censorship resistant blogging (which is one of the reasons why I continued to blog there and not Medium), but as I analysed it I realized the centralization makes it not what I want to be involved in trying to spread out of to the world and invest 5 - 10 years of my life in.  Hopefully I won’t start a project in haste, make some catastrophic errors (e.g. launching an illegal security, designing the onboarding to subject to the political whims of some leftist whales[1], etc), and then leave to go do another money grab. I would intend to stick with my project and see it reach its maximum potential.  I smirked when Dan stated he will not have to move on from EOS because he does not think it will run out of funding, and the reason for my smirk is if the regulators come after Blockone and seize their assets. Dan might end up causing huge problems for himself which exceed the problems from his ex-wife, which apparently launched his passion in this space (see below).  Dan argues for a more incremental approach of creating a project and then leaving to make changes. Actually that would make sense if he offered an airdrop to his former project token hodlers. So excuse me if I am somewhat skeptical about whether Dan’s intentions are really more about money grabs. We’re all here hoping to make some money from our efforts, yet I believe the profit should come from the results not $300 million up front. I repeat that if Dan had raised $10 million to fund his ongoing efforts, I would be less skeptical.  Btw, if Daniel is creating governance systems and whale controlled clusterfucks then he is deceiving someone (maybe himself):  Quote from: https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@dantheman/daniel-larimer--co-founder-of-bitshares-steemit Finding Free Market Solutions to Secure Life, Liberty, and Property  About 5 years ago I came to a realization that the solution to the organized crime syndicate commonly referred to as government must be born from the free market. Furthermore, any free market alternative to government that is unable to free us from the current government will not be strong enough to prevent a new government from taking over.  Btw, Dan’s outcome with an ex-wife is similar to my experience in discovering I was a slave if I stayed in the USA, which is one reason I left and ended up in the Philippines which ended up being also a huge mistake because I caught Tuberculosis which apparently infected my gut and lymph nodes. So it appears that to similar to myself in the past when I was younger, Dan may have thrown caution to the wind in retaliation:  Quote from: https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@dantheman/daniel-larimer--co-founder-of-bitshares-steemit Meditation  It was at the depth of this despair that I learned how to let go. Holding on to anger and resentment was only holding me back. I started meditating and learning who I really was. I learned the joy of living in the moment and not dwelling on my story and the injustice of it all. I had to let go of things I could not change and focus on what I can do. This experience gave me the strength to be calm in any storm.   Renewed Commitment  Not wanting to give up, I became more determined than ever to find a way to get justice. I started getting back into Bitcoin and attempting to figure out ways to organize society that did not depend upon violence. More specifically, I started looking for ways that everyone could work together to defend ourselves against this organized, family destroying, crime syndicate.  And then he began to slip down that slippery slope of rationalizing collectivistic clusterfucks (it is interesting because it somewhat parallels the decline I went through after I left the USA and started rationalizing various mistakes in judgement I made because underlying I was still so angry about being a slave in my home country due to an immigrant wife I stupidly brought to the USA):  Quote from: https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@dantheman/daniel-larimer--co-founder-of-bitshares-steemit I also learned that my capitalist mindset was too short-sighted. I began to see how building a community around the selfish motives of earning income by charging fees on transactions limited adoption. I learned that ""inflation"" isn't theft if it is done to compensate those who bring value. I learned that true theft is expecting people to work for free without getting a share in the product. This maturing perspective caused me to diverge from many of people who were originally attracted to BitShares.  I do not think anybody is refuting that Dan has created blockchains and accomplished a significant amount of development work. I certainly have never stated otherwise.  Btw Daniel admitted that Bitshares governance was not working as Paul Sztorc explained, but Dan claims Steem solved decentralized budgeting but I have pointed out it is mathematically impossible that it did or could.  [1] Note that Dan has always been (since I first knew of him in 2013) on this theme of “non-violence”. That exhibits an unrealistic fantasy bubble type of mentality. And a leftist leaning lie to oneself. Some of the whales who were attracted to Steem seem to have a similar attitude based on my interactions with them over there.  Quote from: https://steemit.com/introduceyourself/@dantheman/daniel-larimer--co-founder-of-bitshares-steemit As someone who attempts to follow the silver rule, ""Don't do unto others what you don't want others doing to you."", I concluded that initiating violence against others is not an option. I know that I cannot remain rationally consistent while violating this rule.  The logical outcome of this belief is that using threats of violence to extort money from others for any purpose is something that is off of the table. This means taxes and everything taxes pays for is off the table. This means war and violent revolution is off the table, but that doesn't mean I want to sit back and do nothing!    Dan is still making technological mistakes. He erroneously claimed that block producers in DPoS do not have the power to produce incorrect blocks. I understand he is thinking about verification of transactions, but he is continuing to making the mistake he made when I corrected him before. DPoS is Byzantine Agreement, and thus if more than 2/3 collude they can double-spend and it’s impossible to know which delegate block producers are lying and which are telling the truth about the ordering of transactions. He continues to not understand this. Yet he seems to admit it. Additionally if more than 1/3 stop producing blocks, then there is no objectivity on the ordering of blocks, due to the liveness threshold being exceeded. That he does not acknowledge this and what can catastrophically happen by putting centralized power in the hands of a dozen delegates, exemplifies to me that he still doesn‘t quite grasp all the risks.  Just imagine if the government goes after these block producers with rubber hoses and national security gag orders.  Dan even admits these delegated block producers can censor transactions, seize accounts, etc..   I see Dan is making a legal argument for the EOS token sale not being a security, so he is essentially arguing that because they did not use the pooled funds for developing the software (which he claims are revenue for a software sale, not an investment in the future value of tokens). The Howey test will look beyond such obfuscations of the economic reality. The economic reality is the investors are depending on Blockone to provide the profit expectation for the tokens. I suppose analogous to the arguments for the SAFT, they’re thinking that the pre-functional tokens are securities (although they claim they’re not and are revenue) and the functional tokens at the time when Blockone is not running the nodes are not securities because Blockone as the common enterprise will have ceased doing the significant efforts. Even if courts and regulators agree with that logic, the pre-functional tokens are clearly securities (as are the shares of a SAFT) and they have clearly been promoted to and sold to USA investors. Also the USA is not the only country with securities laws. And the funds invested were pooled with Blockone regardless whether they used the funds or used prior funds. One of the arguments for the SAFT is that because the pre-functional shares are treated as securities, then the public-at-large (i.e. the non-accredited investors) are protected from the sort of fraud and insufficient disclosure that securities law is designed to protect. So Blockone did not adhere to the protections that would make the SAFT concept worthy to society and regulators, and instead sold the pre-functional token (as an investment contract!) willy-nilly. Dan was asked why they made the pre-functional token tradeable which adds evidence that investors buy it to distribute it as underwriters, and Dan basically gave a nonsense response. This sort of hair-brained stuff from Dan is what boggles my mind. I presume he is thinking that if they have enough money they can afford attorneys and buy off regulators or perhaps even lead an overthrow of the powers that be? In that case, even a $billion is not enough.  Dan’s response to the question about what assurances do buyers of the token have is very incriminating in my opinion. Basically he is admitting they have to obfuscate the economic reality to attempt to evade securities law. In the prior response he stated that they needed to create a distribution, so this implies there is an expectation that some group will launch the live network honoring that distribution, and then they mention they will use the $300 million to develop ecosystem infrastructure and apps, yet then they somehow disclaim that that will be connected with this spontaneous formation of a live network that honors the distribution of the formerly “useless token”. Dan tries to imply that the distribution is distinct from the Blockone common enterprise (which issued the distribution in a token sale) and that the common enterprise is just selling open source software token which anyone might or might launch into a live network, and thus implying Blockone would not be the issuer of the eventual live network tokens and also claiming they are not issuing a security for the pre-functional ERC-20 token. This is clearly a premeditated obfuscation of the economic reality. Buyers of the EOS ERC-20 tokens are clearly expecting the live network to honor their share and they are clearly basing their profit expectation on the efforts of Blockone to develop the software that will form the live network. The current speculative trading on EOS ERC-20 tokens on exchanges is clearly based around those expectations of the ongoing efforts Blockone must complete. What are their lawyers smoking? I want some of that shit.  My understanding is that the securities law attorneys who advise for example Blockone, are paid to provide a legal OPINION. This means their culpability is limited as long as they provided a reasonable justification for their opinion. Yet the culpability for breaking the law will rest on the principals of Blockone, not on the attorney. The attorneys could be fined or in the worst case dis-barred, but the criminal and culpability for returning the $300 million rests on the principals of Blockone and possibility any affiliates and underwriters complicit in the scheme which might include some of you shills in this thread.

Nope. Basically a gentlemen’s club of “you scratch my back, then I will scratch yours”. And essentially of these systems end up being centrally controlled by an oligarchy.

Vitalik followed up.  Note though I agree Casper is flawed. I am not arguing that DPoS is not at least as good or better than Casper. I think they both suck, but it is okay to have the experimentation. At least DPoS is a fairly straightforward way to scale transaction volume and latency for experimentation on applications. In that way, I view it as somewhat wise way to move forward until something better is devised and proven.

But I expect you will not understand why so.  Quote from: scaryvirus on October 21, 2017, 09:06:16 AM And here you can see how much more decentralized producers are in dpos:    The fact that you and Dan are making this argument, exemplifies how ignorant both of you are about byzantine agreement and the FLP theorem. You‘re trying compare proof-of-work systems which have probabilitistic finality and permissionless block producers, with no liveness theshold to permissioned byzantine agreement which has a 1/3 liveness threshold and permissioned number of block producers. A proof-of-work block chain is like a Whac-A-Mole game in that if you shut down all of the miners but one dude with a Rasberry PI, then system would continue functioning (not factoring in hash rate attacks just liveness).  Due to a Sybil attack and sock puppet identities, it is very easy to make it look like DPoS has distinct control, when in fact it can be (and per the iron law of political economics, it must be) just an oligarchy behind the curtain controlling it all.  That is not to say that proof-of-work does not have issues also, but to paint DPoS as some panacea is really deception and fraudulent misrepresentation of the material facts.  The above chart is purely an attempt to deceive investors of the token sale and is being archived for the securities regulators. As they will typically prioritize cases that also include fraud.  Quote from: scaryvirus on October 21, 2017, 09:06:16 AM Oh, and current launch stats for EOS are in 10s of millions tx/sec with 0.5 sec block time, no fees, and <1 sec finality.

But the problem is the fact that issuance appears to be an illegal security in some jurisdictions.  I read that EOS plans to show some auditing ostensibly to claim “proof” they were not buying token sales from themselves. But that can be subverted given that tokens were sold apparently without requiring identity checks. Thus it is easy to operate with ETH loans or other ETH the insiders have access to through sock puppets.  What I want to see and what I am aiming for with my project, is that tokens are awarded with some evidence in the community and on the decentralized ledger that those receiving the awards are actually helping to build the ecosystem. Something that can‘t be easily obfuscated by a sock puppet attack, i.e. achieving some reasonable level of independently verifiable objectivity. To get tokens into the hands of the most productive and ardent supporters (and not favoring any political ideology or what ever, but objective metrics of benefit for the project). Now the problem is that even issuing a token in exchange for effort from others is a security if the others have a profit expectation which depends on some common enterprise. So then you need another mechanism to make sure there is no profit expectation. Just writing in your prospectus to not expect a profit, is not sufficient. The actual reality must be that the recipients of tokens can not legally expect a profit. That was my epipheny and break through recently on the matter.  Quote from: scaryvirus on October 21, 2017, 09:06:16 AM I have no idea whether EOS will succeed, but Hyperme.sh seems to have 0 knowledge about this subject  Lol. In your dreams.  I don’t know if you’re just willfully trolling with that absurd, ostentatious (and erroneous) claim, or if it is just a Dunning-Kruger effect.  Guys I hope we can wrap this up because I think I have completed my analysis here and any further effort here is wasting precious time. I think I understand now what I need to understand about this for the time being.    Quote from: https://steemit.com/eos/@dan/reponse-to-vitalik-s-written-remarks Service Should Pay  Lastly EOS is designed around the idea that service providers (DApp Developers) should cover network costs, not the users. A good application needs a monetization strategy that is fully independent of network operation.  I agree with this. But I have two additional thoughts:  The network costs should approach epsilon any way. The huge fees in smart contracting ledgers is because every damn node has to re-run the smart contract. There may be clever solutions to this (such as STARKS, trusted computing environments, and statistical validation). The latter is likely to be my initial approach and thus augmented with the others later. Service providers can pay (by employing gamification) without the entire damn thing being collectivised which has some serious flaws as Vitalik pointed out:  Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6qm0y2/is_the_ethereum_team_defending_their_ground/dkzoj5t/ You can do this in ethereum too. You can have applications that refund transaction fees to their users. And yet none of them do this, and moreover none of them want to. This is for good reason: the users are ultimately the ones that have the most control over how many transactions they send, and so they should be the ones that bear the marginal economic responsibility.  I also suspect that STEEM simply has not yet had enough interest to be the victim of a properly well-planned denial-of-service attack...  The bolded point above by Vitalik is that if transactions are free up to the burst limit, then the DoS attackers can avail of it. Thus the DPoS blockchain is attacked and not just the servers (nodes) on the periphery. A sock puppet attack can be employed to defeat any attempt by the block producers to fairly limit each user. This would have the effect of forcing all users to the minimum transaction bandwidth their stake will accord, because a significant portion of the stake is maxing out the bandwidth and compensation of the block producers.  Vitalik‘s comment below is spot on. Relate it to what I pointed out near the end of my prior post, but most of you will not understand what he means thus it will fly right over your head:  Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6qm0y2/is_the_ethereum_team_defending_their_ground/dkzoj5t/ If I had to summarize the reason why I dislike the DPOS philosophy I would say that it's waaaay too subjective. If you want to see why it's a bad idea, take a look at any bitcoiner's criticisms of Casper, and multiply them by ten. Casper uses subjectivity only as part of its very weak synchrony assumption, which it uses to reject long-range forks and resolve majority-offline attacks. This is a highly contained use of subjectivity, and it works totally fine as long as you or someone you trust logs on once a month - a rather trivial bar to pass. DPOS seems to rely heavily on users' subjective judgements for... pretty much everything.  And this following guy makes the same mistake that Dan makes which I pointed out near the end of my prior post:  Quote from: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6qm0y2/is_the_ethereum_team_defending_their_ground/dl8x5m1/ Your argument that the DPOS philosophy is too subjective isn't very compelling given the objective nature of the blockchain and the fact that transaction processors have a simple job that can be automatically assessed on behalf of users that do not intend to actively vote.  I quote it again for easy reference:  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 06:06:37 AM Dan is still making technological mistakes. He erroneously claimed that block producers in DPoS do not have the power to produce incorrect blocks. I understand he is thinking about verification of transactions, but he is continuing to making the mistake he made when I corrected him before. DPoS is Byzantine Agreement, and thus if more than 2/3 collude they can double-spend and it’s impossible to know which delegate block producers are lying and which are telling the truth about the ordering of transactions. He continues to not understand this. Yet he seems to admit it. Additionally if more than 1/3 stop producing blocks, then there is no objectivity on the ordering of blocks, due to the liveness threshold being exceeded. That he does not acknowledge this and what can catastrophically happen by putting centralized power in the hands of a dozen delegates, exemplifies to me that he still doesn‘t quite grasp all the risks.  Just imagine if the government goes after these block producers with rubber hoses and national security gag orders.  Dan even admits these delegated block producers can censor transactions, seize accounts, etc..",False

I certainly did not in the post he quoted. Neither did I in the new links you are providing (which he did not quote from). Learn to read. Go read it again and also read the context wherein I explained to smooth and you that Steem/Steemit is synonymous is the minds of many readers so the terms are often used interchangeably.  Broadcasting to numerous threads that others create to talk about EOS, Steem, and DPoS enabled systems, is I think consumerate to the level of the $300 million money grab and incorrect hype and snake oil salesmen obfuscations underway.  Moreover, I stated exactly what was down for me (and 1000s of others!) in my follow up. Never did I write that I was 100% sure that all block producers stopped communicating with any other node! I challenge you to find any place where I claimed I had verified that block producers were not communicating with any other node. I wrote specifically what I had checked (steemd.com, Steemit.com, and busy.org). And then it was discussed. And I explained that the distinction between the web/cache ledger servers/nodes being down for most users and the blockchain being down for some whales who happen to run full nodes is another deception. Steem does not encourage users to run full nodes. Steem encourages users to employ client-server driven GUIs. There is not even any complete technical documentation that I could readily find last time I visited steem.org. Besides I have explained how DPoS is vulnerable to transaction spam attack per Vitalik’s point, especially more so when we start looking at smart contract transaction costs which will presumably be orders-of-magnitude more costly than Steem’s transactions.  Who the fuck cares if DPoS block producers were still communicating to a small circle-jerk of whales? And given that even that inner core can perhaps be DOS’ed by transaction spam attack on EOS and/or some strong power attacking the small group of money grabbers behind the curtain who control all these entities of DPoS.  You’re grasping at straws trying to discredit me, Vitalik, and anyone else who exposes Dan’s money grabbing scams which you’re apparently complicit in.   Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 06:06:37 AM I see Dan is making a legal argument for the EOS token sale not being a security, so he is essentially arguing that because they did not use the pooled funds for developing the software (which he claims are revenue for a software sale, not an investment in the future value of tokens). The Howey test will look beyond such obfuscations of the economic reality. The economic reality is the investors are depending on Blockone to provide the profit expectation for the tokens. I suppose analogous to the arguments for the SAFT, they’re thinking that the pre-functional tokens are securities (although they claim they’re not and are revenue) and the functional tokens at the time when Blockone is not running the nodes are not securities because Blockone as the common enterprise will have ceased doing the significant efforts. Even if courts and regulators agree with that logic, the pre-functional tokens are clearly securities (as are the shares of a SAFT) and they have clearly been promoted to and sold to USA investors. Also the USA is not the only country with securities laws. And the funds invested were pooled with Blockone regardless whether they used the funds or used prior funds. One of the arguments for the SAFT is that because the pre-functional shares are treated as securities, then the public-at-large (i.e. the non-accredited investors) are protected from the sort of fraud and insufficient disclosure that securities law is designed to protect. So Blockone did not adhere to the protections that would make the SAFT concept worthy to society and regulators, and instead sold the pre-functional token (as an investment contract!) willy-nilly. Dan was asked why they made the pre-functional token tradeable which adds evidence that investors buy it to distribute it as underwriters, and Dan basically gave a nonsense response. This sort of hair-brained stuff from Dan is what boggles my mind. I presume he is thinking that if they have enough money they can afford attorneys and buy off regulators or perhaps even lead an overthrow of the powers that be? In that case, even a $billion is not enough.  Dan’s response to the question about what assurances do buyers of the token have is very incriminating in my opinion. Basically he is admitting they have to obfuscate the economic reality to attempt to evade securities law. In the prior response he stated that they needed to create a distribution, so this implies there is an expectation that some group will launch the live network honoring that distribution, and then they mention they will use the $300 million to develop ecosystem infrastructure and apps, yet then they somehow disclaim that that will be connected with this spontaneous formation of a live network that honors the distribution of the formerly “useless token”. Dan tries to imply that the distribution is distinct from the Blockone common enterprise (which issued the distribution in a token sale) and that the common enterprise is just selling open source software token which anyone might or might launch into a live network, and thus implying Blockone would not be the issuer of the eventual live network tokens and also claiming they are not issuing a security for the pre-functional ERC-20 token. This is clearly a premeditated obfuscation of the economic reality. Buyers of the EOS ERC-20 tokens are clearly expecting the live network to honor their share and they are clearly basing their profit expectation on the efforts of Blockone to develop the software that will form the live network. The current speculative trading on EOS ERC-20 tokens on exchanges is clearly based around those expectations of the ongoing efforts Blockone must complete. What are their lawyers smoking? I want some of that shit.  My understanding is that the securities law attorneys who advise for example Blockone, are paid to provide a legal OPINION. This means their culpability is limited as long as they provided a reasonable justification for their opinion. Yet the culpability for breaking the law will rest on the principals of Blockone, not on the attorney. The attorneys could be fined or in the worst case dis-barred, but the criminal and culpability for returning the $300 million rests on the principals of Blockone and possibility any affiliates and underwriters complicit in the scheme which might include some of you shills in this thread.

Steem does not encourage users to run full nodes. Steem encourages users to employ client-server driven GUIs. There is not even any complete technical documentation that I could readily find last time I visited steem.org. Besides I have explained how DPoS is vulnerable to transaction spam attack per Vitalik’s point, especially more so when we start looking at smart contract transaction costs which will presumably be orders-of-magnitude more costly than Steem’s transactions.  Who the fuck cares if DPoS block producers were still communicating to a small circle-jerk of whales? And given that even that inner core can perhaps be DOS’ed by transaction spam attack on EOS and/or some strong power attacking the small group of money grabbers behind the curtain who control all these entities of DPoS.  Refute that.  I am not lying. I never wrote “dpos was down”. That is an attempt to put words in my mouth taken out-of-context. I clearly explained that the Steem/Steemit was down from my perpective (and presumably 1000s of others given I verified those were down via numerous proxies all over the globe) and that Steemd.com gave an error which lead me to believe that the blockchain might not be communicating to Steemd. If you’re going to quote someone, then quote what they wrote. Do not insert some words they never wrote verbatim taken out-of-context, purely as an attempt to draw attention away from all the correct claims being made on various issues. And the point below potentially links the periphery being down to the design of DPoS and collectivized transaction fees.  Indeed Steem (as perceived by 1000s of users) was down. That is fact.  It is an entire system. Those of you who are trying to obfuscate what was discussed, are just conveniently trying to weasel your way out of culpability for the system being down.  I am sorry for you John if you bought this token and now feel you have to defend it, if that is the case. Certainly you are not being objective about the full scope of the discussion about Steem/Steemit being down. It was down! None of you have denied that the sites I checked were down and that busy.org was unable to load content from (caches of) the “blockchain”.  What do we mean by “blockchain”? Okay so we put hashes of content on the data stored by block producers and then we grab cached content that matches that content from other nodes/servers. So if it is possible to DDoS attack those nodes which serve up data that users expect to come from the “blockchain” then is the blockchain down yes or no?  It is a matter of perspective. That is what @smooth and I discussed. You read only what you want to read into the discussion which is from my perspective an incorrect summary of the discussion and what transpired.  If Steemit has 1 billion users and it goes down and you tell them, “oh but it is really isn’t down”, they are going to say you are either a liar or have lost your mind.  The fact that they have not been able to yet scale the entire system out such that it can’t be DDoS’ed attacked is I think perhaps relevant to the discussion about whether EOS can scale. As Vitalik pointed out, the collectivized transaction fee scheme has  not been tested at smart contract scale yet. Moreover I should have pointed out in my discussions with @smooth that perhaps the reason the cache servers were insufficient to defend against the DDoS attack might have something to do with the fact that presumably no transaction fees are being paid directly to them (they presumably depend on residual income that somehow trickles down from the collectivized circle-jerk). The collectivization of fees works perhaps to fund the inner whale circle-jerk for the 100 witnesses, but it apparently does not scale out decentralized in the ecosystem, which was the point I been trying to articulate to @smooth over the past weeks in several facets that DPoS can’t scale the ecosystem from an economic analysis. And apparently also the point Vitalik was making. When I refer to circle-jerk, I mean in many facets including that the last time I checked there was still no formal specification of DPoS nor sufficiently organized documentation so that any one could even know where the fuck to look in terms of knowing whether the circle-jerk DPoS “ledger” thingy was still functioning whilst the GUI user-level access points of the ledger data were down due to DDoS attack.  DDoS attacks will happen and they can be a learning experience that can possibly be adequately defended against by making some changes. I am not expecting them to never have an incident as they grow and learn. Steemit was also DDoS attacked in 2016 much more frequently. Yet I also stand by my skepticism about whether a centralized ledger of 100 (potentially sock puppet) witnesses can be a robust system against more powerful attackers. Also if the whales start attacking each other is another possibility I worry about. Yet I also was willing to tolerate it as a scaling mechanism to test out new ideas, but my main objection thus far is that the systems seem to be whale money grabs. Even the voting on Steem/Steemit seems to be “if you scratch my back and help us money grab, then we will give you a cut of the action”. My interest in supporting a decentralized ledger is I want my ROI to not depend on kissing any one else’s ass or corruption. I want to be able to go build things based on the merits of the followers I can create, the value to others out there of the products/apps I create, etc.. I am not going to support any system where the ROI is subjective on whether I support things I do not think are correct.  I am pointing out about Dan potentially enticing securities regulators to look more closely at our ecosystem. And I am not happy about some whales raping the ecosystem and squandering it on illegal shit. Broadcasting to numerous threads that others create to talk about EOS, Steem, and DPoS enabled systems, is I think consumerate to the level of the $300 million money grab and incorrect hype and snake oil salesmen obfuscations underway. Centralizing a huge pot of money is going to raise angst in our ecosystem because it leads to massive failure, e.g. Mt. Gox, the DAO, etc.. EOS illegal securities might be the next black swan that takes our ecosystem into another crypto winter (not sure about that though). And $300 million is not actually that huge any more as the market caps have increased significantly over the past year.  Luckily so far I am not censored at Steem/Steemit when I argue with whales. But I have had my entire awards (from 100s of voters) nullified by a couple of arrogant whales who abuse the downvote feature. It is not the loss of money but it is that I want a meritocracy. I want to have a decentralized ledger that I can invest my effort in and not feel like it is being wasted (potentially in a future fireball of securities regulation or DoS attacks) or gamed.  Mostly I just intended to write down some of my thoughts about balancing the disclosure about EOS so that readers can judge for themselves both sides.  Never have I stated that I thought EOS would be a bad speculation. I am not commenting about that other than to note most of these FOMO things tend to have their pumps eventually.",False

Nope. Basically a gentlemen’s club of “you scratch my back, then I will scratch yours”. And essentially of these systems end up being centrally controlled by an oligarchy.  That's your opinion. Plus you might just view reliable witnesses being voted in consistently as an oligarchy - hard to say. You don't need any coins to be voted in. Out of all the options it seems to be the least bad.  Also approval voting takes care of that in part: https://i.imgur.com/GmixVHd.png  Each coin and thus coin holder controls the system in the end - quite literally and formalized.   the points Vitalik made about collectivization of transaction fees are astute.  lets see what he said: Code: The poor, who are not interested in putting the entirety of their often very low savings into a funky new cryptoasset in order to be able to use a blockchain.  great, they won't have to, because there are no fees, so can take those out right after. can also borrow someone elses bandwidth for free (i.e. app host lending it to users) or pay a fee (just like in eth) to use someone's bandwidth (lending market) or not use at all. overall, a lot more options and giant fees in eth seem to be more important here.  Code: nyone who wants to use the blockchain only a few times and then go away (they would need to buy coins and then sell them again)  same as above. so can do what he says and can do what eth does or even pay nothing if dapp pays for you (like amazon servers pay for you using amazon servers when  you're browsing)  Code: Anyone who experiences prolonged unexpected spikes in demand (ie. pretty much eveyone); users will have to buy enough coins to cover perhaps the 99th percentile of their expected usage, so that they don't get stuck being ""out of gas"" and having to go to an exchange.  he has it backwards - you get coins to be guaranteed some bandwidth under maximum load, anything extra you get is free bonus when network is under lighter load. and again, can rent or borrow more.   Linear will be entirely gamed and thus centralized anew  being gamed isn't the issue, it's if system is usable by everyone -  honest or not. who cares what people use it for. point is they are distributed by honest participants to honest participants, losses to gaming are assumed by default.   So now we have community voting for which apps get funded? Another huge pot of money grab for whales.  That's why he focused so much on getting good distribution to make it too expensive to grab coins. Just think of whales getting more as staking. Honest people can still get what they need from honest participants.   Fact is that Steemit was down.  Steemit website is not relevant to steem. I don't even understand how little someone might know about blockchains to think a random website being up is important for any discussion. And the steem blockchain was not down. I do know of an instance when one dpos chain was down, and this isn't it or even close, and it wasn't a big deal.   And 20 delegates is not a lot for the national securities agencies to take down if ever they need to.  It's not 20, it's at least 100 in top 100 list and unknown numbers afterwards with only few minutes it takes to spin up a new witness node and get current state.   formal specification for DPoS  it's called github code. plus which one, there's like 20 versions continuously evolving. dan even wrote this recently.   weaknesses of DPoS being that it is form of byzantine agreement (which has liveness threshold flaw)  treshhold flaw is nonsense as mentioned in this comment. All his proposed weaknesses require 2/3+1 of witnesses to collude to fork, better than chance based in pow where even <50% can attack.  it was brought up in coversation about tendermint/cosmos liveness flaw, not dpos: ""1/3+ can halt the consensus process"" also mentioned here. It refers to LIB (optional guideline of when chance of  irreversibility is extremely high) but simply waiting for all witnesses instead of 2/3 to validate is enough.   There is one additional level of confirmation that could be implemented in DPOS: require 100% participation and 21 blocks. With 63 seconds of confirmation and 100% participation then you can be certain that you will never get “stuck” and that every transaction you receive is truly irreversible and globally accepted. source   I already refuted that line of argument in the post of mine to which you are responding to.  It will be epic if all those funds get frozen and clawed back. Let’s see which “partners in the silicon valley” take the risk of receiving black money and risk a 20 year felony prison sentence per the money laundering laws in the USA for accepting funding that was obtained via illegal activity.  You can't refute an opinion lol. money grab or not, they have other funding, and it doesn't matter. if silicon valley doesn't want to buy, they don't have to.   Vitalik followed up.  I love how vitalik ignored all the major corrections and criticisms, like not knowing the basics about dpos. and focuses on obsurd things.  pointless comment about parity syncing their light client fast with all that bloat ignores point about him being wrong about merkle trees some crap about physical ethereum coins - wtf a lot of power in hands of proxies comment - ignores that he got called out on using data from 2014 beta - as opposed to 2 mining pools in control of eth and, like what, 5 important nodes? every coin gets a say in dpos. lmao Ignores that there's vested money in dpos with nonsense comment like ""That's the exchanges of today."" that ignores that dpos can handle replacing all global exchanges. And once again, slashing rules cause centralization by punishing dissent - something ethereum does often critique on many delegates choosing to be public - not necessarily, and their actions are public too and get peer reviewed as well calls it subjective, yet first thing he does and cites in the bailout is a vote (w/ only 4% approval lmao)   I think they both suck, but it is okay to have the experimentation. At least DPoS is a fairly straightforward way to scale and experiment. In that way, I view it as somewhat wise way to move forward until something better is devised and proven.  I think everyone agrees with this. It's the least sucky thing I'm aware of.   Irrelevant. But I expect you will not understand why so.  It is relevant, because it was an irrational statement you cited,  so you don't understand why.   trying compare proof-of-work systems which have probabilitistic finality and permissionless block producers, with no liveness theshold to permissioned byzantine agreement which has a 1/3 liveness threshold and permissioned number of block producers  dpos doesn't have that treshhold, it literally has no liveness issues unless 2/3+1 collude, so you're clearly out of scope. you're thinking tendermint.  probabilistic finality is an issue with PoW making those mining pools less secure than 50% treshhold, and 2/3+1 requirement makes witness system more secure than 50% treshhold. so that chart is actually too nice to PoW approach.   A proof-of-work block chain is like a Whac-A-Mole game in that if you shut down all of the miners  That's true, you would have to shut down 2/3 of witnesses at same time to cause manual intervention. Any delay and you get countless runner up witnesses replacing the others.  And again, liveness or security tradeoff - pow just keeps going no matter what, dpos keeps going unless 2/3+1 are compromised + plenty of runner ups, and tendermint keeps going until 1/3 are compromised    Due to a Sybil attack and sock puppet identities, it is very easy to make it look like DPoS has distinct control, when in fact it can be (and per the iron law of political economics, it must be) just an oligarchy behind the curtain controlling it all.  That is not to say that proof-of-work does not have issues also, but to paint DPoS as some panacea is really deception and fraudulent misrepresentation of the material facts.  I made that for lols just to shit on waves, wasn't made with EOS in mind. And you're right, all of them can be sybil attacked, hell every color on every coin can be same person in control. what I'm saying is that dpos relatively has best attempt to remedy wealth concentration.   You could have at least done the SAFT and limited it to accredited investors.  p.s. I hate ICO's and think they are all securities too no matter what.  my solution was to burn all proceeds tbh, but I'd rather entire supply of eth be used to pay for maximum frequency of transactions on eth blockchain for as long as possible to demonstrate its fee based flaw.  another solution they found is not even launching the public blockchain, there can be multiple public ones, and they are not voting for which one is main. only thing sold is right to distribution that might or might not be used by someone and it won't be block.one. kinda brilliant. I'm not even sure if profit expectation comes from work of block.one or random internet people launching chain by copying block.one code that happen to use the distribution.  wait your solution for distribution issue is to make it permissioned? lmao. that's literally limiting how many can get coins and puts huge barrier to entry for everyone - worst thing you can do in any stake based coin & security issue.  no matter what you do, even if you ID everyone, it can still be real life sock puppets - doesn't help anything and only limits width of spread by requiring some id standard. so you solved no issue, and only made it worse (e.g. omg failed at this)   given that all the bids are pooled to determine the price for the tokens offered during each interval  you have it backwards. because liquidity is likely higher on exchanges than in each individual day pool, price is determined by exchanges with ICO price being an afterthought for arbitrage and inflation.   The bolded point above by Vitalik is that if transactions are free up to the burst limit, then the DoS attackers can avail of it. Thus the DPoS blockchain is attacked and not just the servers (nodes) on the periphery. A sock puppet attack can be employed to defeat any attempt by the block producers to fairly limit each user. This would have the effect of forcing all users to the minimum transaction bandwidth their stake will accord, because a significant portion of the stake is maxing out the bandwidth and compensation of the block producers.   Besides I have explained how DPoS is vulnerable to transaction spam attack per Vitalik’s point  nonsense.  No one should expect any more than amount guaranteed by vests, borrowed or owned. Network assumes being spammed to full capacity, with some benefits when it's not.  It doesn't really cause an issue because maximum global rate is always limited.  Using network to full capacity is not an attack, it's standard assumption.   DPoS is Byzantine Agreement  it's not.   Yet he seems to admit it.  link doesn't say anything that admits incorrect blocks. he literally says the blockchain can see the blocks are not correct (i.e. how slashing conditions kick in), and all they did is not use slashing conditions because those mistakes can be done by honest players accidentally.    then there is no objectivity on the ordering of blocks, due to the liveness threshold being exceeded. That he does not acknowledge this and what can catastrophically happen by putting centralized power in the hands of a dozen delegates, exemplifies to me that he still doesn‘t quite grasp all the risks.  well, at least you're not claiming it goes to a halt then. and it's not an issue if people only use blocks once witnesses are replaced.   Dan even admits these delegated block producers can censor transactions, seize accounts, etc..  that's true everywhere under attack. difference being dpos provides review for such actions with significant costs - permissioned producers and but completely decentralized permissionless review.  anyway, nothing is perfect. i only argue for dpos cause it's most shit on.",False

Plus you might just view reliable witnesses being voted in consistently as an oligarchy - hard to say. You don't need any coins to be voted in. Out of all the options it seems to be the least bad.  Well it is not just an opinion, but rather the generative essence of the matter which is argued to be inviolable. That is why cited this comment from the 160 IQ genius who created the term “open source” and the other very astute blog from the highly intelligent Paul Sztorc.  And just because you have not thought of other options, doesn’t mean you can logically conclude there can’t exist possible better options. You’re not omniscient. For example, do you know the design of my decentralized ledger? If you do, I must ask you how you obtained such top secret information?  I hope to entirely eliminate voting! I think Dan is wrong where he claimed in that all decentralized ledger consensus is equivalent to voting. Wrong. Voting is subjective. Objectivity requires that votes do not matter. That is what proof-of-work attempts to accomplish. No one in theory gets a vote on the outcome with PoW, presuming that hash rate is decentralized. The nothing-at-stake problem was in theory avoided by burning external hard resources such as electricity, so as to avoid the problems of voting, sock puppets and other forms of political manipulation and the power vacuum thereof. That was the epiphany of PoW as idealized in the original Bitcoin white paper (although it apparently has fallen apart in practice for various reasons). Seems Dan missed the entire point, which is perhaps the generative essence of why Satoshi was politely slapping him back down (although I have my suspicions about whether Satoshi’s true intentions were for the ideal of decentralization, yet still he would be expected to pretend so).  Dan is afaics a neophyte (relatively speaking to Vitalik et al) when it comes to some facets of the research and theory of Byzantine systems. He is evidently an applied expert on building certain aspects of systems. But he is evidently not an expert of all facets of the theory. Vitalik is much more skilled in that theory area (and too much so I think so much time was lost on theoretical cul-de-sacs), but Vitalik is weaker in applied aspects and depends on others for that. I straddle both areas of focus to some more or less degree (but a chronically ill person who can’t recall where the door is due to liver induced brain fog, thus can’t code, that is just a fact of nature, but when a person has become healthy then others might expect he can’t do something which is quite capable of doing and I like that very much).  Hey IOHK is also working on smart contracts and they have a formerly verified secure PoS with a delegated option as well. And they are proving they can do applied work and have launched a blockchain. There’s also NEO but I do not know much about it yet. Dan and Vitalik are not the only horses in this race.   Also approval voting takes care of that in part: https://i.imgur.com/GmixVHd.png  Each coin and thus coin holder controls the system in the end - quite literally and formalized.  “approval voting” apparently means that each voter can vote multiple times, one vote each for each of the 21 slots for block producers or the 100 witnesses. Thus no whale with less than a majority of the stake could ensue winning a slot.  Yet that does nothing to ameliorate the winner-take-all power vacuum of voting which inviolably leads to an oligarchy in control. Again I refer to the aforementioned two links on the political-economics issues with voting.   Quote from: Vitalik Anyone who experiences prolonged unexpected spikes in demand (ie. pretty much eveyone); users will have to buy enough coins to cover perhaps the 99th percentile of their expected usage, so that they don't get stuck being ""out of gas"" and having to go to an exchange.  he has it backwards - you get coins to be guaranteed some bandwidth under maximum load, anything extra you get is free bonus when network is under lighter load. and again, can rent or borrow more.  No he has it correct. You’re not factoring in his point about a DoS attack which I elaborated for those of you with a slow mind. Again refer to the blue highlighted text in my post to which you are replying to.  The rest of your quotes and comments about Vitalik were nonsensical because you took them out of the context of his argument and point, which you apparently did not grasp. Again read the blue text in my post to which you are replying.  It is quite hilarious the Dunning-Kruger replies I get here.

Source code is not a specification.  And putting specifications on Steemit under a personal account name is not the correct way to disseminate documentation for the repository to which it applies. And the linked blog is still not a formal specification.  I should be able to go to one official resource and read everything I need to know.  Cripes you are fundraising $300+ million from non-accredited investors and you expect them to go hunting around in source code.    And the following is incorrect!  Quote from: https://steemit.com/dpos/@dantheman/dpos-consensus-algorithm-this-missing-white-paper All blockchains are fundamentally a deterministic state machine acted upon by transactions.  Quote from: https://steemit.com/dpos/@dantheman/dpos-consensus-algorithm-this-missing-white-paper Note that this “rule” is similar to the 6-block confirmation “rule” for Bitcoin.  Proof-of-work is probabilistic, not deterministic. DPoS if formally specified as Byzantine agreement is deterministic if the liveness threshold is met, but it comes with the disadvantages I mentioned before such as not being permissionless and can be entirely stalled.  And again he repeats the same mistake, even I had already taught him this is incorrect (he forgot apparently):  Quote from: https://steemit.com/dpos/@dantheman/dpos-consensus-algorithm-this-missing-white-paper Like all consensus algorithms, the most harm the block producers can cause is censorship. All blocks must be valid according to the deterministic open source state machine logic.  Here is how I explained in a prior post which you apparently did not comprehend:  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 06:06:37 AM Dan is still making technological mistakes. He erroneously claimed that block producers in DPoS do not have the power to produce incorrect blocks. I understand he is thinking about verification of transactions, but he is continuing to making the mistake he made when I corrected him before. DPoS is Byzantine Agreement, and thus if more than 2/3 collude they can double-spend and it’s impossible to know which delegate block producers are lying and which are telling the truth about the ordering of transactions. He continues to not understand this. Yet he seems to admit it. Additionally if more than 1/3 stop producing blocks, then there is no objectivity on the ordering of blocks, due to the liveness threshold being exceeded. That he does not acknowledge this and what can catastrophically happen by putting centralized power in the hands of a dozen delegates, exemplifies to me that he still doesn‘t quite grasp all the risks.  Just imagine if the government goes after these block producers with rubber hoses and national security gag orders.  Dan even admits these delegated block producers can censor transactions, seize accounts, etc..   The following is incorrect! There is no way to get back an objective state once the liveness threshold is not met. The only way is to hardfork this blockchain. We already had this debate and discussion over in the Cosmos and Tendermint threads which Dan participated in.  Quote from: https://steemit.com/dpos/@dantheman/dpos-consensus-algorithm-this-missing-white-paper Lack of Quorum of Producers  In the unlikely event that there is no clear quorum of producers, it is possible for the minority to continue producing blocks. In these blocks stakeholders can include transactions that change their votes. These votes can then select a new set of producers and restore block production participation to 100%. Once this happens the minority chain will eventually overtake all other chains operating with less than 100% participation.  […]  Unlike some competing algorithms, DPOS can continue to function when a majority of producers fail. During this process the community can vote to replace the failed producers until it can resume 100% participation. I know of no other consensus algorithm that is robust under such a high and varied failure conditions.  Dan even linked to the discussions where I had explained to him and them about this.  The following is also incorrect! OMG, and this is the guy you are giving $300 million to. Dan needs to read the research on Byzantine agreement systems which starts from decades ago. With 2/3 control a Byzantine agreement system never has any objectivity. This is really troublesome that this guy is being entrusted the way he is given he does not even know basic fundamentals.  Quote from: https://steemit.com/dpos/@dantheman/dpos-consensus-algorithm-this-missing-white-paper Corruption of Majority of Producers  If the majority of producers become corrupt then they can produce an unlimited number of forks, each of which will appear to be advancing with 2⁄3 majority confirmation. In this case the last irreversible block algorithm reverts to longest chain algorithm. The longest chain will be the one approved by the largest-majority which will be decided by the minority of remaining honest nodes.   The following is also incorrect! With 2/3 control over block producers it is possible to make it appear that block producers were lied to and were forced to sign conflicting forks and it will be impossible to prove which producers are lying and which are honest. Thus the 2/3 majority can continue on signing the fork and nobody can prove which of the 2/3 are complicit, so they would not know which ones to vote out and destroy. If they destroy the honest ones also, then the system is dyfunctional. The reason Dan does not understand this is because he has never studied the research on Byzantine agreement. Thus he is speaking out of his asshole. This is pitiful. And all you n00bs fall for this. I did the research! That is what I was explained at the Cosmos/Tendermint thread but they decided they wanted me to leave so I left. And then Dan continued on with his neophyte misunderstanding summarized as follows.  My attitude was never interrupt the enemy when he is in the process of destroying himself.  Quote from: https://steemit.com/steem/@dantheman/response-to-cosmos-white-paper-s-claims-on-dpos-security If the majority of the block producers collude to produce a longer chain in an attempt to fork beyond the last irreversible block, then no exchange, block explorer, merchant, or other validator would switch to that fork. The entire world will agree on the ""first fork seen"".  This means that the only way to effect a double spend / reversal beyond last irreversible block is to isolate your victim and partition the network + collusion of producers.  […]  I believe I have proven the the block producers cannot defraud 1000's of independent validators without partitioning the network  […]  The blockchain will remain live (advancing the last irreversible block) so long as at least 1 block producer is able to process enough pending transactions to elect a new set of witnesses who then start producing the last irreversible block.    Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 09:50:32 AM weaknesses of DPoS being that it is form of byzantine agreement (which has liveness threshold flaw)  treshhold flaw is nonsense as mentioned in this comment. All his proposed weaknesses require 2/3+1 of witnesses to collude to fork, better than chance based in pow where even <50% can attack.  it was brought up in coversation about tendermint/cosmos liveness flaw, not dpos: ""1/3+ can halt the consensus process"" also mentioned here. It refers to LIB (optional guideline of when chance of  irreversibility is extremely high) but simply waiting for all witnesses instead of 2/3 to validate is enough.  Sorry as I mentioned above, all of that is incorrect. Dan needs to go read the research.   Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 09:50:32 AM trying compare proof-of-work systems which have probabilitistic finality and permissionless block producers, with no liveness theshold to permissioned byzantine agreement which has a 1/3 liveness threshold and permissioned number of block producers  dpos doesn't have that treshhold, it literally has no liveness issues unless 2/3+1 collude, so you're clearly out of scope. you're thinking tendermint.  You’re confused on multiple levels. The liveness threshold (1/3-1) is not the limit of collusion (2/3+1). And DPoS and Tendermint are both Byzantine agreement. And apparently Dan does not realize this fact.   I love how vitalik ignored all the major corrections and criticisms, like not knowing the basics about dpos. and focuses on obsurd things.  You are not capable of even understanding what Vitalik is writing. And I am not going to waste my time trying to unravel your bizarre interpretations[hallucinations] about what Vitalik wrote.   I think everyone agrees with this. It's the least sucky thing I'm aware of.  Well perhaps that argument could be made in terms of production ready blockchains. I would need to think about this some more though. I am willing to concede that point for now.  Byteball with a few tweaks is superior. That is once we discard the nonsense claims Dan made as quoted above which are incorrect. And mine will improve on Byteball in a way that is I think unexpected. Both of which are not block chains.   Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 09:50:32 AM Due to a Sybil attack and sock puppet identities, it is very easy to make it look like DPoS has distinct control, when in fact it can be (and per the iron law of political economics, it must be) just an oligarchy behind the curtain controlling it all.  That is not to say that proof-of-work does not have issues also, but to paint DPoS as some panacea is really deception and fraudulent misrepresentation of the material facts.  […] And you're right, all of them can be sybil attacked, hell every color on every coin can be same person in control. what I'm saying is that dpos relatively has best attempt to remedy wealth concentration.  I don’t think I can agree it is clearly superior for “remedy wealth concentration”. I currently see pretty much everything in blockchains is all about wealth concentration from greater fools to snakes.   Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 09:50:32 AM You could have at least done the SAFT and limited it to accredited investors.  p.s. I hate ICO's and think they are all securities too no matter what.  I am willing to tolerate a minimal amount of fundraising to advance progress (e.g. $5 - 10 million) if it does not sell the majority of the token supply. I want the token supply to be awarded for onboarding but unfortunately the Steem voting method seems insolubly flawed so I tried to find another way that would be legal.  I will not respond to your other comments about alternative issuance and launch strategies.   wait your solution for distribution issue is to make it permissioned? lmao.  I do not think it is possible to make distribution permissionless. Proof-of-work is competitive but the problem is that most people can’t compete thus the onboarding is very narrow and the token stays mired as a speculation and HODLER coin.  What I hope is that it is possible to convince the market that the distribution is meritorious and objective (not biased, no nepotism and kickbacks). Then the permissioned aspect has to be dealt with in terms of securities laws, which can be an orthogonal issue to the perceived objectivity of the distribution. Ongoing the decentralized ledger can be permissionless if it is proof-of-work, except that PoW has apparently flaws that it becomes permissioned eventually. So thus I intend to bring an entirely new consensus algorithm and we’ll see how it holds up to peer review. But I do not expect a panacea. And I will not fight nonsensically/ignorantly to obfuscate any flaws like the other clowns do around there.   no matter what you do, even if you ID everyone, it can still be real life sock puppets  Real production can’t be a sock puppet. Marketing companies know how to measure metrics about what is creating value and what is not. This is a science and a craft.   Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 09:50:32 AM given that all the bids are pooled to determine the price for the tokens offered during each interval  you have it backwards. because liquidity is likely higher on exchanges than in each individual day pool, price is determined by exchanges with ICO price being an afterthought for arbitrage and inflation.  What I wrote was correct. Just because the price that the participants target is dictated by external factors, does not make my statement false. Learn logic.   Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 09:50:32 AM DPoS is Byzantine Agreement  it's not.  You would not even know how to make that determination. Read the research. I am not being paid to explain this to people who do not know.   Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 21, 2017, 09:50:32 AM then there is no objectivity on the ordering of blocks, due to the liveness threshold being exceeded. That he does not acknowledge this and what can catastrophically happen by putting centralized power in the hands of a dozen delegates, exemplifies to me that he still doesn‘t quite grasp all the risks.  well, at least you're not claiming it goes to a halt then  The objectivity does halt if the liveness threshold is exceeded. That is unless there is objective bounded synchronisation of the block producers (which is what IOHK’s Ouroboros is about but the majority of the stake has to remain online at all times). Again I am just going to tell you and Dan to read the research.  It’s all because propagation is not proof of fault in an asynchronous network.

You’ve lost all credibility in my evaluation of your ability to comprehend. Don’t let the door hit you in ass on the way out. I do not need dumb people with us. Go for the dumb projects.  You can not seem to comprehend the subject matter. The point is that is the distinction between made by @smooth is an entirely meaningless diversionary tactic. All I can do is suggest you re-read my prior explanation after you’ve let your pride and emotions settle down and you are ready to read objectively. But perhaps you may simply lack the understanding of the subject matter to understand the argument entirely.  If you would like to talk on Skype about this, I would be more than happy to take the extra time to explain to you your error, given you had supported me in the past. Just Pm me a contact number or Skype account and I can call you now. Frankly it is disappointing, because I thought you were more astute and smart guy.  I understand you feel you are trying to call a spade a spade, but you are simply incorrect here.  I am always willing to admit when I make a mistake. I readily accepted that not all the block producing nodes were down and afair I never claimed they were. I do not remember claiming that the block producing nodes had been directly DDoS’ed. Even I reminded @smooth that I had not forgotten he had told me in the past that the block producing delegates have secret IP addresses (so why would I think they had been directly DDoS’ed). Your thought process does not make any sense. Again I challenge you to find a quote where I said they were. My point was the system as a ledger and a holistic economic system was down. And I was correct. The terminology around what means what specifically for Steem/DPoS/Graphene/Steemit is not well defined. There was not even a damn specification for this stuff. I was clearly referring to the fact that the sites I accessed were down and that the data from the ledger was not loading (which one would presume to be decentralized). There was never a specification on which terms we are supposed to use to refer to the data of the blockchain as separate from the block producing nodes. I wrote “Steemit DPoS was offline” as a way of expressing not just block producing nodes. I did not write “dpos was down”. It is quite clear who was lying.  Btw, we should add the point that I should have made to @smooth that secrecy (about IP addresses) is not security. Damn he knows that! He can’t possibly be a server guru if he does not know that. The asymmetry that the block producing nodes have is afforded to them because they trust their immediate connections to the outside word who feed them data. If that trust is violated, then they can be DDoS’ed. The vulnerability that could fail someday is still having these permissioned nodes in a privileged state. I am confident @smooth would not disagree with that. And I am confident that the collectivized transaction fees will also play into a vulnerability for the entire system in numerous facets.  You decide to read it the way you want to so that can find fault, but you are just injecting your own subjectivity into the analysis.   You are now claiming they are synonymous to readers which is a bullshit statement, you cannot speak for the readers.  You could argue you misspoke and that you meant to refer to the website, but instead you try to deny reality AND call me disingenuous on top of it.  Your statement implied that dpos was down and was not ambiguous, Smooth inferred your writings the same way, I am not alone here.  Afair I did not write “Steem is down” instead I wrote “Steemit DPoS is”. And even if I had written that, it is not quite clear in terms of definitions of names (e.g. Steem) where the demarcation is between data that has to be fetched from the ledger and block producing node activity. My prior reply to you explained that if the former is not funded, then the ”Steem” ledger is not really functional. So the design of DPoS with its for example permissioned and collectivized transaction fee mechanism is pertinent to whether the ledger was down from the perspective of needing to obtain the data from the ledger. Cripes man. Where is your comprehension level?  You are too focused on ambiguous vocabulary (as explained in the context why it is ambiguous) and not on comprehending the holistic nature of the issue and subject matter.  In short, @smooth was incorrect[imo pointing out a fact which I have explained is not germane to my intended point about the centralized clusterfuck of DPoS as pertains to genuine economic scaling], but I did not want to drive a stake through him nor beat a dead horse when in fact he was not trying to push his point beyond merely pointing out the fact that he did. You are the one who is forcing me to attack @smooth in order to defend myself. So who has the big ego here?  If it makes you feel validated somehow, just continue on with your interpretation. No big deal. Go your way and I will go mine.  Yet my holistic point is very very relevant and yet it gets lost in the nonsense about definitions of terms.   just the clear error you made in your analysis when Steemit was down.  There was no error in my analysis. Never did I claim I had inspected the block producing nodes and concluded they were down. WTF    Never did I claim that because Steemd.com was down it meant certainly that block production had ceased. I dare you to find anything I wrote that was even remotely insinuating that. I did claim that it meant some aspects of the (access to the) ledger seemed to be offline.  What are you smoking.  P.S. Honestly I am still not even knowledgeable (due to lack of a specification and not wanting to waste my scarce time to go digging in their source code) about whether the data written to the blockchain is retained by the P2P network full nodes (or whether just a hash is retained) and whether these nodes can supply the data or just the hash. And whether the sites that access this data have their own private caches or whether they use some feedthrough web servers which get the data from the full nodes (possibly caching it for efficiency). And how these web servers are funded so there is a sufficient network of them to be resilient against DDoS attacks. And that all ties back into my point that if the sites are down, then in effect the ledger is also down, unless we assume that these sites will have their own funding and fund private web servers not shared with the overall ledger, but in that case where is the funding coming from given there are no transaction fees? Is Steemit displaying advertising or some other form of revenue to pay for private web servers? Well I know Steemit, Inc. sneakymined a shit load of coins (50%?) so but then how is this distinct from the DPoS ledger given it is the same whales who control both and who take their funding from the various collectivized schemes for whale money grabbing. @smooth has a tendency of making pigeon-holed argumentation which just does not make much since from a helicopter perspective where you look at the entire thing holistically.  Oh and another point I did not make but would have if I was trying to really argue it as if someone was going to think @smooth slapped me down (geez you guys are always so damn focused on that aren’t you like chest thumping baboons), is that DDoSing the web servers is the low hanging fruit, thus in effect it is an attack on the ledger. Strengthen the web servers then the incentive to attack the core block producing nodes increases.",False

That's (as always) the big question. Qtum has a cap of 654 Million. Neo a cap of 1,4 billion. And these projects (just like EOS) are competition for Ethereum. The difference right now is that not all EOS tokens are distributed yet. They're around 50%.  So if EOS becomes as much wanted as Neo its cap should be 50% of Neo's cap which is 700 million. Or 1,69 dollar per EOS. If EOS becomes as much wanted as Qtum is should be at 0.79 cents.  But my impression is that a lot of people don't have a clue. Just imagine 1 billion EOS tokens out there next year and think of a marketcap you think is possible in 2 years. I would say above 10 billion USD so around $10 per token. That's why I'm buying at these prices. Would even be cooler if EOS really kicked Ethereum's ass at 27 billion. Ethereum was a nice idea but nobody is using it for anything other than ICOs. That's because it's limited as hell with 15 ts./sec. EOS opens the door to big social media platforms and really fast decentralized exchanges.  ",False

Note I recently became aware of the legal argument as presented in the SAFT whitepaper that when the market price of the token is dependent mostly on free market speculation and factors, then the token would not be a security despite ongoing activities of the issuer. Yet in this case, I have archived this thread where clearly the investors are citing the ongoing developments of Blockone (and Dan’s reputation) as the reasons to invest. So clearly this token fails to meet that legal theory.  And note upthread I stated that $300 million is not necessary to fund development of a blockchain. Had they raised $10 million I would not be complaining. They are presumably drawing the attention of the regulators due to the extreme amount raised in addition to the overt attempt to evade securities law with doublespeak while still apparently issuing a security.

Every Legendary I know has lost massive amounts of BTC due to scams and theft. This will continue to be the case.  Since many or perhaps most of you have become wiser about safeguarding your private keys and not leaving your BTC on exchanges, the Zionist bankster thieves need a more sophisticated method of taking your BTC from you gullible goyim.

They’re quite expert at digging out that stuff and even offer huge $millions bounties to those who will provide inside information to them.  Also given that they’re attempting to claim the token sale is not a security issuance, then they will also be subject to consumer protection laws as well. Those complicit in selling MLM bags to greater fools could I guess also possibly be culpable.  I mean basically get involved with something shady and do not be surprised when you end up in some troublesome shit.

Afaics, Satoshi was incorrect:  Quote from: satoshi on July 17, 2010, 10:29:13 PM The payment processor has connections with many nodes.  When it gets a transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends.  If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad.  A double-spent transaction wouldn't get very far without one of the listeners hearing it.  The double-spender would have to wait until the listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processor's broadcast has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the remaining nodes.  Quote from: satoshi on July 18, 2010, 01:59:15 AM Quote from: llama on July 18, 2010, 12:03:29 AM This is a good start, but still not impermeable.  I didn't say impermeable, I said good-enough.  The loss in practice would be far lower than with credit cards.  A selfish miner with 33% of the network hash rate would simply withhold the double-spend transaction and release it when it wins the next block, thus reverting innumerable instant transactions.  Thus the loss rate could hypothetically be egregiously worse than the 5% chargeback rate on credit cards.  What Satoshi didn't account for is a systemic attack where the attacker has a game theory to bring down the Bitcoin price, e.g. is shorting it.  I am not saying that case is likely near-term, but when you are talking about the politics of who controls the world's transaction system, the Satoshi's design loses the key quality of it being impervious to control. Thus it is a power vacuum, which is precisely what we are trying to eliminate with blockchains.  Satoshi apparently didn't account well for the systemic risks that come from the natural centralization of mining due to economics of ASIC farms. He seemed to think these parties would be ruled by the Nash equilibrium that says if they attack the network, then they destroy the value of their own investment, but he forgot about shorting and also that ASIC hardware can be fungible and used to mine other coins.  Also bytemaster (Daniel Larimer) was correct about the bandwidth and computational resources being a problem, but he didn't emphasize that the problem was scaling without centralization of the full nodes. But that centralization is coming to Satoshi's design any way due to the (even political, e.g. subsidies in China) economics of ASIC mining farms.  I suspect Satoshi knew this weakness and didn't emphasize it on purpose.  Note Dan's DPoS ""solution"" is centralized control as well, so it is not like Dan found a solution. He just made the centralization more efficient before Bitcoin does. One could argue that DPoS with a competitive distribution is at least the same as democracy (unlike Steem which is authoritarianism), but democracy is what we were trying to eliminate with blockchains, because it is a power vacuum.  Note wrote the above before writing the following and realizing that proof-of-work was designed by Satoshi to become centralized:  https://gist.github.com/shelby3/e0c36e24344efba2d1f0d650cd94f1c7  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2251762.msg22889412#msg22889412  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2259054.0;viewResults  Quote from: key_z on October 19, 2017, 03:39:41 PM Design of a Digital Republic (Medium)  I’m trying to speed read it now because I have to leave in a moment. I do not agree with their presumption that a 51% attack never happened or that it is necessarily self-destructive. SegWit is a 51% attack on Bitcoin (see my links above), and I expect a 51% attack to destroy SegWit by stealing it back in the future, but I do not think that will be self-destructive. I think it will strengthen the immutability of Bitcoin.  I do not agree that digital land has scarcity. Digital money has scarcity because of the coordination problem which can’t be removed because money has to be fungible. The coordination problem of digital land is always being removed, e.g. IPv6 will have virtually unlimited quantity of addresses. Urbit can try to make moat around their digital land, but they will ultimately fail.  Note in my blog about the coming world currency, I rebuked some of Curtis Yarvin’s (aka Moldbug’s) past theories about money.  Republics are what we are trying to kill with decentralization, but so far nobody has been able to design a ledger that is truly decentralized. So thus far, the axioms stated hold. I will propose a new decentralized ledger technology (which scales even better than DPoS) which I posit can remain decentralized if the majority of the participants are not politically motivated to defect or who can’t be manipulated. So what I expect is the the intelligent minority will fork off and run their own decentralized ledger on this technology. If the majority attacks it and necessarily raising its value, the intelligent majority will take the gains and fork off again. By eliminating the mining, I make this plausible.

With this model it's best to spread out your buy orders over time and not buy all at once while repeating the same process I just mentioned.  I would have to disagree that $0.50 is too high for a few reasons. First, there are probably a lot of big investors that bought into the project from the very beginning and are holding for a very long time thus limiting the supply for others. Second, the volume is consistently extremely high even though the price has been going down. High volume means a lot of orders being placed. If you look at the market depth chart on Bitfinex, the walls are too high for the price to drop that fast. There will have to be enough people willing to sell for such a low price and fill those buy orders. And finally, this is a very ambitious project. It took years for Ethereum to take off and it still has problems. Waiting just one year (maybe less) for a blockchain to get released that's from the very start superior to Ethereum shouldn't be a problem, it give you more time to collect  . On top of that, they're already working with major companies and building their business before they have a product. Ethereum didn't do that until after the product was released and the word spread.  My suggestion, buy in small increments where there's strong buy support (again, look at market depth chart), keep your tokens in a separate wallet, and wait until the blockchain is deployed. If something goes wrong, you will see it in the market orders before the price even changes. People underestimate that chart, when in fact that's the first place they should look before considering to place an order.",False

The SAFT is very likely a security, namely an investment contract. Once the tokens have been imbued with utility and are genuinely functional, the SAFT investors’ rights in the SAFT automatically convert into a right to delivery of the tokens. For the now-functional utility tokens, there is a very strong argument that the tokens themselves are not securities. The same should apply to any ultimate sale of the tokens to retail purchasers, whether by the SAFT investors or by the seller.  So vaporware ICOs are securities. Fully-functional tokens if have sufficient free market factors other than just ongoing developer efforts, are probably not securities.  Quote from: http://saftproject.com/static/SAFT-Project-Whitepaper.pdf#page=17 Moreover, since the tokens are not securities and the SAFT is non-transferrable, the investors do not, merely by purchasing the SAFT, risk being deemed underwriters if they resell their tokens.⁷⁵  ⁷⁵ Investors are participants in the distribution of the utility tokens following conversion of the SAFT, but the token is not a security. Though the SAFT is a security, they do not distribute it. The definition of underwriter under the Federal Securities Laws is limited to the participation in a distribution of a security, thus SAFT investors need not fall within the definition or risk exposure associated with being deemed an underwriter. See Securities Act Section 2(a)(11), 15 U.S.C. § 77b(a)(11).  So by this logic, a token which was issued and sold as a security (e.g. pre-functional vaporware ICO), would not necessarily become a non-security when it is sold by investors later when it is fully-functional and has sufficient free market factors other than just ongoing developer efforts, i.e. when the “from ongoing efforts of others” prong of Howey is no longer satisfied. Because the investors could be considered underwriters if they had not held the token for some reason other than to distribute it, which as I had pointed out upthread may require up to a 3 year hold before selling.  The separation of the issuance into a security that has rights for a token (instead of issuing a pre-functional token or promise) and separate issuance of the fully-function token is argued that the investors in the former (e.g. a SAFT) had no intention to distribute a security because the fully-functional token is argued to not be a security because it fails the “from ongoing efforts of others” prong of Howey. Whether the issue of the former security (which can be traded for a fully-functional platform token later) was legal is a separate issue, with for example EOS’ issuance being very suspect of not complying with securities regulations.  Perhaps, if EOS is required to pay back all the money that might hamper development.  However, the following may even implicate the Platform tokens as securities:  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 12, 2017, 11:22:54 AM Quote from: http://saftproject.com/static/SAFT-Project-Whitepaper.pdf#page=20 Second, a seller might weaken its defense against the fourth Howey prong when the seller significantly over-promises in its sales materials. In such a circumstance, the seller’s efforts to imbue the token with greater utility might still predominate the variety of other market forces acting upon the token’s price. A profit-seeking purchaser might predominantly rely upon the efforts of the seller, even post-functionality, where the seller makes bold promises of developing more sophisticated functionality beyond that present at issuance. Purchasers might rely on those promises and expect to profit from the resulting increase in functionality, thus satisfying Howey’s final prong.  Ah the above might even endanger the EOS Platform tokens as being securities!",False

To punish so perhaps our ecosystem might become more focused on real technological and business model innovation.

Had they raised $10 million, I would be much less vocal. Maybe said nothing in that case. Give the benefit of the doubt about what Dan might do with $10 million to make an important breakthrough. But $200 million is … not justifiable (if they did in fact raise that much, might just be buying from themselves).  Well a more open-minded viewpoint is that the free market destroys the capital of those who misallocate it. So perhaps it is all meant to be. It is the process.

My worst sheep suicide story? The first year we kept sheep, we thought it would make sense to set up a hay net in their pen, which keeps the hay off the ground and lets the sheep feed themselves by pulling hay through the very loose loops of the net. Turned out, though, that the loops were so loose that a determined sheep could put her entire head inside the net, and if one sheep could do that, then two sheep could do that. And given how the hay net was hung and how these sheep were sensing each other, they started to move clockwise in unison, each trying to get an advantage over the other, still with their heads stuck in the net. At which point the net starts to tighten. And tighten. And tighten. My daughter found them the next morning, having strangled each other to death, unable to stop gorging themselves or seeking an advantage from the behavior of others. The other sheep were crowded around, stepping around the dead bodies, pulling hay for themselves out of the net. That was a bad day.  In both markets and in politics, our human intelligences are being trained to be sheep intelligences. That doesn’t make us sheep in the modern vernacular.  We are not becoming docile, stupid, and blindly obedient. On the contrary, we are becoming sheep as the Old Stories understood sheep … intensely selfish, intensely intelligent (but only in an other-regarding way) and intensely dogmatic, willing to pursue a myopic behavior even unto death.",False

Requires a vote (or some centralized power) to remove the faulty block producers, but there is even a threshold where the voters can not objectively determine which ones are at fault. This is Byzantine agreement.  The entire point is that in an asynchronous setting, there must be adherence to the liveness and consensus thresholds, else nothing at all is objectively observable.  Perhaps it would fork or stall in chaos or the strongest centralized power would take control (if there is one that is much stronger than the rest). Also afaik DPoS is not a formal Byzantine agreement protocol and there’s just an assumption of trust and correct synchronous ordering of block production, but afaik no actual protocol mechanism between the block producers to enforce it? I have never seen a formal specification of the DPoS protocol that block producers follow. IOHK’s provably correct Ouroboros’ PoS protocol can be delegated, so DPoS could be changed to that to get a more formal result and then from there we could analyse the dependencies that are just undeclared and adhoc in DPoS.  There is an Issues thread some where on Github where we delved into this last year and even Dan came in there. But I don’t remember where that thread is. Perhaps it was in Cosmos’ issue tracker.

Let me make one final summary post in this thread of my objections to EOS.  I’m just making readers aware of:  There is a reasonable expectation that the EOS Platform tokens are going to eventually end up being illegally issued securities and banned, c.f. my posts in the prior two pages of this thread. Steemit’s DPoS was offline for over an hour before I slept. And when I awoke it has still been down several hours later. The DPoS centralized ledger design is not robust enough to scale out to the world. It works for some small shit like Steemit sometimes. Steem’s voting is a horrible design that can’t scale, because non-linear rewards are required to prevent cheating yet these disproportionate rewards go to the whales (so the system unavoidably ends up ever more concentrated). Voting is a low entropy paradigm. Thus Steem is a pyramid scheme. Vitalik already explained astutely why a pooling of transaction fees to give the illusion of them being free is an idiotic design. EOS’ enemy #1 when it tries to scale to challenge Mossad’s Bitcoin is going to be DDoS attacks by the Mossad (most DDoS is originating from Israel). I believe our project is going to kick EOS’ ass into the abyss (both adoption wise and technologically) and it will not be issued by ICO nor as an illegal security (thus I can legally make such speculative statements). My opinion is our project name (same as the token/cryptocurrency name) is far superior. Our onboarding plan and business model for apps is far superior. I have experience creating million user software for the mainstream. Afaics, my (soon to be our) design (is the only one that) securely scales decentralized with millisecond confirmations (and it can withstand massive DDoS).  I’m putting my effort on the ~$5 million market cap which is legally issued, not the $200 million market cap with an inferior design, plan, and illegally issued.  No ICO will ever end up being the token used all over the world due to the legal encumbrance. The gimmick of separating the issuance token from the platform token is an obfuscation of the actual reality of the investment contract and investor expectations and thus will be void. Why are we in crypto turning our ecosystem into a scammers haven public relations disaster and incriminating ourselves with centralized shit that thus (due to centralization and scamming) can’t create scalable network effects?  Create instead decentralized paradigms that avoid legal entanglement:  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 05, 2017, 05:11:16 PM The law is the domain of the Great Harlot. Come out of her.  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 06, 2017, 04:44:48 PM My point is about transparency. And about not issuing illegal securities and then not providing all the material facts for the insiders.  If indeed @tonych was given kickbacks, then this could violate laws about securities or consumer protection laws about proper disclosure.  These tokens which have non-transparent issuance problems are not going to be reliable when the nation-states start using their laws to attack cryptocurrency.  Quote from: Hyperme.sh on October 04, 2017, 06:12:58 PM Quote from: bathrobehero on October 01, 2017, 05:43:26 PM So the ""devs"" might have 50 sockpuppet accounts they ask coins to. It's basically the next iteration of the ""x% premined"" scam as it is not that transparent.  Apparently that is what NEM did. They try to deny it, but when it is pointed out that they refused to even use Facebook verified accounts, they just claim that verifications were done but don’t provide any independently verifiable objective proof.  And Byteball airdropped to exchanges who held so much BTC, so guess for yourself if any kickbacks were involved.

Quote from: chryspano on October 05, 2017, 09:45:03 PM sladering your superior doesn't earn you any credibility points  Cut out the crap, I was teaching and refuting @bytemaster (aka Daniel Larimer) on these forums back in 2013/2014 way before he became a big time scammer doing premeditated illegal securities issuance.  Dan has always been making the same fundamental mistake since 2013. He always wants to pool everything in collectivism. His Steem voting design suffers from this flaw as well as the his zero transaction fees concept, which are both making it impossible for these systems to scale in terms of the economics and threats against them.  I remember back in 2013 he was proposing some interest rate payment scheme for hodlers his Protoshares, and I explained to him why that was unsustainable and flawed. You’ll find that Charles Hoskinson was also involved in the discussions on BCT back then.  Btw, Charles Hoskinson told me all the details about how Dan Larimer broke his verbal contracts when he kicked Charles Hoskinson out. But I have never and will never repeat those details to anyone.  I do acknowledge that Dan’s TaPoS invention is conceptually astute, but I was there in the thread when he announced the first ideas for it and pointed out to him that he had some flaws.   You should expect that when you go raising $200+ million in a scammy ICO thus creating a public relations disaster, that some people who care about our ecosystem are going to criticize you. If you do not want to be criticized, then do not overtly try to scam the ecosystem.

John Mcaffee, CEO of the antivirus security company went so far as to say he would eat his dick live on tv in 3 years if Bitcoin ISN'T worth 500,000$  http://nypost.com/2017/07/19/cybersecurity-legend-i-will-eat-my-d-k-if-i-lose-500k-bitcoin-bet/  Giving BTC to ICOs which are going to fail, is indeed not wise when in fact BTC will continue to rise significantly over next years.  Presuming BTC hits $10,000 in Q1 2018, that would be a 1000X gain from $10 in 2013 when I agreed with my business acquaintances (such as @rpietila) to buy BTC. He sold $100,000 of silver and bought 10,000 BTC then became a multi-millionaire by the end of the year. (He then apparently proceeded to lose it all somehow)  So taking the 5th root of 1000, give us about an average compounded gain of 4X per year. So 3 years from 2018 and $10,000 would be $10,000 x 64 = $640,000.  But that requires that BTC’s rise in price is not slowing down, which would be not the normal pattern for an S curve adoption so I presume it is decelerating. Also Mcaffee’s 3 years was from earlier this year, not Q1 2018.  I do think BTC will exceed $50,000 within 3 years, i.e. exceed $1 trillion market cap.  But some altcoins will go from $10 million to $1 billion market cap in 3 - 5 years. And perhaps one will go to $1 trillion market cap within 5 years (still lagging Bitcoin’s market cap though).  Which one?  Remember this. PhDs did not create Apple Computer nor Microsoft. PhDs did not create Facebook. PhDs did not create WeChat. PhDs DID create Google. But that should not be taken as an excuse to give $10 million of play money to junior-level programmers who lack the discipline/focus/experienced oversight of those aforementioned examples who created those hugely successful companies.

The point is that the system is not permissionless for nodes as is the case for proof-of-work. You depend on whales and their secrets. If whales start fighting each other or get attacked by a powerful entity personally, the system is not real-time resilient. It may or may not be resilient after there is a vote.

Scale and up then the fireworks are more likely, because the incentives to attack it will be much greater.  [1] Bandwidth attacks are asymmetrical in favor of verifying nodes because said nodes do not pay for incoming data. So I am referring to the cost of verifying the signatures, which in the case of elliptic curve cryptography is asymmetrically in favor of the attacker so it is better to turn this into a bandwidth attack (for the attacker to send more data at his cost than the cost of verifying the signature, but what if the attacker has botnets and does not pay hardly anything for bandwidth). And Hashcash-style proof-of-work as anti-DDoS is not viable because it is asymmetric in favor of the attacker versus the legitimate users. Throttling by IP may be ineffective as IPv6 is adopted. Fast signature verification becomes very important in the future (unless the economic size of the system dwarfs botnet bandwidth value) and DPoS’ centralization remains a separate problem.",False

You're confusing block producers and regular nodes.  No I am not. I clearly made the distinction between the block producing/generating nodes and the perimeter nodes around them.   If the bulk of the block producers are taken down, the network will grind to a halt.  If more than 50% are taken down then the consensus is ambiguous. But the entire trust model of DPoS is non-objectively verifiable as Vitalik explained.  Byzantine agreement has a liveness threshold and if it is not met, then the result is indistinguishable from an attack.  The liveness threshold is normally 33%, and a 50% threshold reduces either the safety and/or the fault tolerance, or introduce centralization trust.  The only other way to avoid liveness thresholds is eventual, probabilistic consistency (e.g. proof-of-work and my upcoming design which is something new):  Quote from: https://groups.csail.mit.edu/tds/papers/Gilbert/Brewer2.pdf#page=9 Scalability:  Increasingly, we require that our systems be scalable, designed not just for today’s customers but also for growth tomorrow. Intuitively, we think of a system as scalable if it can grow efficiently, using new resources efficiently to handle more load. There appear to be inherent trade-offs between scalability and consistency. For example, in order to efficiently use new resources, there must be coordination among those resources; the consistency required for this coordination appears subject to the CAP Theorem trade-offs. Studying this question may help to explain why even within a data center, where there are rarely partitions, it seems difficult to efficiently scale strongly consistent protocols (like Paxos [20]).  Tolerating attacks:  The CAP Theorem focuses on network partitions: sometimes, some servers cannot communi- cate reliably. Increasingly, however, we are seeing more severe attacks on networks. For example, denial-of-service attacks are becoming a near continuous threat to everyday network operations. A denial-of-service attack, however, cannot simply be modeled as a network partition. Similarly, we are seeing problems with malicious users hacking servers and otherwise disrupting major internet services. Tolerating these more problematic forms of disruption re- quires a somewhat different understanding of the fundamental consistency/availability trade-offs.    It is a lot harder to do that for two reasons. One is that the services they provide at the p2p layer are very limited and by design like all p2p layers somewhat difficult to attack (compared to the web service layer which requires higher level operations like ""show me all of @user's posts).

There's never been an inability for any ordinary node to connect to the p2p network afaik (other than implementation bugs, none known to exist right now). In fact I'm not aware of any p2p network that has been successfully DoS attacked on a large scale. It is certainly a lot harder than attacking a few known web servers.  The problem then is the web serving is not a sufficiently diversified P2P network as I stated. Indeed P2P networks are more resilient, but do note the footnote in my prior post. When IPv6 comes, the IP throttling that protects most P2P networks will be useless (not the long-term connection between themselves but the new connections from the outside from users).

I also made the separate point that the block producing nodes and the secrecy of their connections to the others (surely not pigeons if we want fast transactions) can be threatened as the economic value of the system grows.  Also there is the point that the delegate block producers operating independently (i.e. so they do not need to connect to many other nodes) is only possible because as Vitalik pointed out, there is no verifiable objectivity in the consensus. It is all trust based shit. Which means indistinguishable from attack when the block producers start fighting each other one day.  Really DPoS is all about obfuscating what it really is. We might as well just ask Visa to provide servers and be done with it. Why obfuscate it what it really is in the end game? (Oh so we can shill some FOMO bags to n00bs)  Permissionless, decentralized, scalable consensus algorithms are an extremely difficult problem to solve. Vitalik and separately myself (and others) have been working on this problem nonstop for the past years. DPoS is a very simplistic way to cut corners and not actually solve the problem at all.  DPoS was an expedient semi-centralized solution for scaling and proving a use case like Steem. For that reason, I supported it. But then when that same centralized ledger technology is repackaged and resold in a $200+ million “no rights token” sale, I realized there is no intention of actually solving the most difficult and fundamental technological problems. They presumably have enough money already and in my ethics they could have spent that first on research before entering the market to take more money from n00bs.  I wanted to see that money from Steem go to a solid technological research effort. It’s a shame that so much resources are being presumably squandered on who knows what. All I see is he realized there was all this n00b ETH for the taking. Speculation focus, not technology focus. Turns me off. And ditto on the user adoption marketing and business model development as well. Instead of focusing on that hard work, appears to me the focus is on selling FOMO bags.",False

Offering for sale is illegal also, even if no sale was made. The USA is not the only country with securities laws. And EOS did not sufficiently hide direct selling efforts that were clearly visible in the USA by USA persons such as myself. As well, there are even threads on this forum discussing how USA persons can employ a VPN to buy into the EOS token sale. They are responsible for doing KYC and AML but afaik they did not because ostensibly they want to be able to buy the EOS tokens from themselves.  Also there is the issue of resales to USA persons after the ICO and the culpability the issuers and affiliates have given they know a priori that they can’t prevent this. See Rule 903 for Regulation S resales.  It is not just the USA that you have to worry about, but rather the entity that controls not only the USA but most nations on earth (alternative link). They know damn well what they are doing to sucker all of you into scams and illegal activity before they harvest you c(l)ow(n)s.

I have studied.   Can you name anyone who was prosecuted for buying a security?  The SEC has prosecuted people for distributing securities. You should review the definition of underwriter in the 1933 securities act. As I have read, the tokens have not been held for 3 years, then every person that resells is deemed a distributor of the currency and culpable.  As for the whether the government can go after a larger group of people, I suggest you look at how crazy things are getting now in the USA. We are headed towards a 309 year level political and cultural crisis in the USA. There are very big and draconian changes coming. Governments have massacred millions and millions of their own citizens. This is a repeating occurrence throughout history.  But you are perfectly welcome to think otherwise and take your chances.  The more scamming, the more fuel added to the fire of the chaos that is coming down the pike 2022ish. Geez Dan doesn’t need $200 million to develop a damn blockchain. Even $10 million is much more than is needed. Why can’t he wait to take his gains after the tokens are already a currency that can be spent on goods & services? (Because presumably he knows it will maybe never reach that level of adoption and use and ostensibly because his group presumably wants to buy tokens from themselves to make it appear as though they raised more money than they actually did and so they secretly own money supply which they can manipulate the price with on exchanges or what ever)  Cryptocurrency and blockchains which are not decentralized and permissionless, are afaics really useless in the end game of chaos of the paradigm shifts that are going to turn society upside-down over the next several years.

I just thought that question was easy and thought I'd answer it succinctly. If you understand the meme, then you understand my answer.  I personally have not bought any EOS tokens in the ICO. If you search for my posting history on EOS, you would see that although I think that it has long term promise, I am still holding out on my intuition that the coin would be overvalued during the initial distribution chunk.  Since it was overvalued, the buy support for the rest of the ICO is having a hard time keeping up with the ICO inflation. I guesstimated that I could eventually buy it for cheaper, and hopefully after some type of a software release or two.  I never ever invest in vaporware personally.

It’s tough because there are competing factors that could influence it. For example, if you hold all development and news as a non-factor, the supply increase that you mention will likely drive the price down. However, you have to weigh that out against the possibility of other factors raising the price between now and the middle of next year - anything from the September release of the testnet being a success to the simple notion that more people will find out about EOS. Not to mention other influencing factors such as regulatory changes, correlation to the total crypto market, etc.  For me personally, I’ve chosen not to spend my time trying to calculate the perfect time/price of entry. Instead, I’m much more interested in determining whether I want to participate at all (FWIW, I do) by evaluating the project on the basis of the value it’s attempting to bring to the market and the likelihood of that happening successfully. Based on the outcome of that analysis, I set an allocation to EOS and dollar cost average my way there. I figure that if the project is successful, it won’t matter nearly as much (note: I’m not saying “doesn’t matter at all”) whether I’m in at $0.80 or $1.00 or $1.50.  Quote from: yugu on September 06, 2017, 01:54:50 PM Quote from: key_z on September 05, 2017, 11:14:42 PM Two possible approaches: Gamble on the promise with the hopes of being rewarded with a gain that is commensurate with the additional risk taken or Wait until after the official EOS blockchain is released next summer and acquire actual EOS tokens/coins. You'll miss you on some gains but surely not the bulk of long-term value But don't forget, if you pick to wait for major release you may lose the opportunity to get really high gains The difference could be 20x growth for the first choice and 50x for the second one. It is a huge difference.  Yes, we are in agreement. That difference of ~30x that you mention is what I was referencing by the “gain that is commensurate with the additional risk taken.”  In the context of the entire investment world, those multiples (the 20x or the 50x) hardly exist outside of VC investing and even then, only for the very best. It’s hard to measure the risk-adjusted return of crypto investing but even that fact notwithstanding, I have a hard time seeing a 20x as anything other than an absolute investment grand-slam.",False

A risky one, in fact. A myriad of circumstances could arise that result in loss of value. Simply nature of the beast and isn't unique to EOS as much as it's an attribute of the whole business of investing in a frontier technology/space.  That said, couple of random thoughts on your comment: The crowdsale of EOS tokens isn't a source of revenue to build their project - at least that's what Dan stated on the Epicenter podcast (Link here). He said block.one has all the capital they need to develop EOS and the crowdfunding revenue is bock.one profit and capital to build/support the app environment on the EOS network once it's launched. He could be lying but that's what he stated. Regarding the legal disclaimer and ""they must have a reason to be shady"": I may be the rube here but I view this with an Occam's Razor philosophy more than anything else. It seems fairly logical that their actions could simply be explained by the elephant-sized compliance/regulatory risk of what they're trying to do. Could it be a result of shady/ulterior motives? Of course. It just doesn't seem like the most straightforward reason underlying their approach to the ICO/disclaimers Regarding Larimer being in the project for himself and his own $: I believe there truly is a diminishing rate of utility as one accumulates vast wealth. I couldn't even begin to guess what Dan's net worth is but I suspect he's got enough to do whatever he wants to do with his time on earth. What's more, some people, contrary to popular belief, are motivated by things beyond accumulating wealth. Maybe it's wanting to make the world a better place. Maybe it's wanting to innovate, create, and do what nobody else has done. Some have other reasons altogether. I don't want to (and can't) know what Dan's motives are. But I can speculate and my gut feeling is that it's something beyond (or at the very least, in addition to) accumulating wealth. But that's just one dummy's feelings. Also, we have to consider the fact that Dan's partners (Brendan, Ian, et al.) have staked their reputation to this project as much as Dan has. So if it is a nefarious cash-grab, they are either being duped too or are complicit in something that will likely ruin their professional reputation.  Just my $0.02  -Kesey",False

Will they ever actually pay dividends?     What would an ideal scenario look like where purchasing these tokens would be profitable? Say, 10 years from now?  the tokens are not ownership tokens and they do not pay dividends.  These are not even the native tokens that are needed for the EOS blockchain to function.  These are ECR20 tokens that function on the ethereum blockchain and you are not even sure that they will be swapped to the native EOS blockchain tokens (= the real tokens that will hold value in the future).  See Q&A 21 on the eos.io website.  Cheers     Quote from: jlp on June 28, 2017, 11:37:12 PM I just read the white paper.  It does not provide a good technical explanation of how it will process in parallel and how it will process millions of transactions per second.  Does anyone understand how they will be able to do this?     Quote from: GinkgoFarm on July 04, 2017, 02:22:02 PM I think it's a clever ico structure, designed to channel funds, that would otherwise be trading on exchanges, into the accounts of the project creators.  Ultimately there are just developing software that a third party may or may not launch a platform on.  If people keep sending them ETH during the year, then you can imagine future icos may follow their lead. But the price could plummet if people lose interest over the year. The price relies on more people contributing to the ico every day. And at a price they have no idea of until the end of each 23 hour period.

Do you really think he explains how he's going to enable parallel processing from that one slide?  I'm not saying that he definitely won't be able to pull it off.  But it's going to take many very smart OS level programmers, not necessarily blockchain programmers, because parallel processing is very difficult at the OS level.  I wish he does pull it off, because it will benefit many projects, including ours.  I think this parallel processing is what is going to make or break EOS.  There is no scam in regards to the EOS token, not launching the blockchain and leaving it up to the community to do so.

They say they will not perform any share buybacks and if they did I think it would be pretty much impossible for them to hide and they would be pretty much screwed pretty fast. There are a lot of suspicious deals happening with EOS. For example this is from HitBTC http://i.imgur.com/o4BIJvz.png  Check ask and bid amounts and how big trades are.    Quote from: Afrikoin on August 04, 2017, 12:50:53 AM Hmm   from what i understood, you have to own EOS tokens on the EOS platform to have access to bandwidth proportional to your holdings.  A delegated POS also implies takers have to hold EOS  i also understood EOS is targeted enterprise use  If a large company, say Facebook, or Microsoft, wanted to use EOS for *some* unimagined application, they would have to buy and hold EOS to participate in the network.  I think this is one way EOS token will gain value.  As soon as one company announces it is building on EOS, token price might go up.  Please correct me if Im wrong.  OR  add more information    No answers for any of the tough questions which are key questions to be answered.  Lots of people who want to believe though. All their faith in one man basically, as I read things, which leads to another huge red flag: a single point of failure.

If you are a developer or company and want to use the blockchain to build an application, you will need resources. These resources are made available to you in proportion to how much EOS tokens you hold.  The network itself will work ok.  But if/when there is a congestion, then your EOS tokens entitle you and your application accesss to bandwidth for your transactions.  I am not worried  I have watched enough videos and I am satisfied.  I am also always on the telegram group and  your questions are regurgitated daily.  Because of regulations, EOS and blockone cannot be explicit about the tokens, their role and what they represent. They also cannot make promises. The ambiguity is to avoid falling under SEC purview  1.Watch dan's coin interview 2. listen to DAn on a recent epicentre bitcoin podcast   Check out my thread ""EOS tracker - the Ethereum Killer"" https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2105333.msg21465001#msg21465001  some of your questions have been addressed  and i have shared content on the thread   if after all this you are still skeptical, i suggest you avoid the token sale or buying EOS until you can get a satisfactory answer  my opinion:  the more clear it becomes, the less of a discount on price  there is a lot of FUD on the webs.

Upto the team at blockone and EOS i guess  2. it is (partly) about faith. as with most ICOs and even, bitcoin itself. I mean, who thought back in '09 that bitcoin would take off? A lot of people dismissed it, even the smartest ones. And had a lot of questions that couldn't be answered. Yet, here we are  i dont think the ambiquity of the project is anyy different from most ICOs.  the problem people have is with the 1 year token sale and 1 billion tokens  3. to answer you last question  it cuts both ways.I believe EOS and blockone are confident of their product, hence why they are issuing 1 billion tokens at a *free market price*  if all off us decided not to buy, the price would go lower  if less people took part in the token sale daily auction , and less ETH was sent, then they would receive less money  remember, the tokens are priced at the end of the day's window after all ETH has been collected.  So if there's money coming in, means people are interested. Cant really blame the issuer.  Block one are conducting heavy marketing if you look around and  business development. So the money is not going down the drain  also, some of the money will be used to fund projects on EOS blockchain   a lot of people are equating "" i dont understand"" or ""its blurry"" to = scam. which is just an opinion",False

I do believe price of 2 USD per coin may hold for 11 months straight until the end of ICO. I also believe that EOS might eventually go up during that period of 11 months because all altcoins are still very attached to our leading coins Bitcoin and Etherum and they will clearly rise.  I don't believe though, that this 11 month of ICO will do much good for EOS. It will be good for their pocket, they will have a lot of money and if they put that money to good use and deliver, good. But there are projects that offer the same thing, smart contract projects that are out there already working and won't need 11 months before the start.  NEO the Chinese Etherum and Waves. Those projects have same market cap and are already out there to compete with Etherum. I was going to invest hard on EOS but after doing some research i decided to go with NEO. I still believe in EOS though, Dan Larimer is a smart guy and both Bitshares/Steem are currently one of best blockchains out there in terms of transactions per second. EOS will have the very same thing and is to be able to handle more than Bitshares/Steem. The plan of weakening Etherum by building on it and then splitting from their chain is great too, genius to be said. And if they delivered on their promises then that is some big monster on the horizon, but 11 months of wait time is far too long in my opinion.  I'll make a bold statement and predict the market cap of EOS to be 7.4b$ at the end of ICO in July 2018. That is a very positive prediction, actually. And even then it won't really matter, because other projects that are targeting Etherum will already be up there with 50b market caps. And etherum itself probably around 100b alone.  So to sum it up - in my opinion buying EOS will be worth it in a long time hold and will already net a 3.5-4x ROI in a year from now. Although i do believe, that other projects like NEO/Waves will net a way higher ROI within the same time period.",False

I don't know if I sound like an a$$hole ""attacking"" NEO and waves but this is my honest opinion, my strategy is always long term and usually involves hodling for at least 1-2 years, that's why my skepticism on NEO and waves, short term I have no clue.

Did you send it today? You can only claim your tokens after the token period of the day ends, which is 6 hours 45 minutes from this comment. What you'll do is go into the contracts section, select the EOS contract from the dropdown, and then change the thing you want to do at the bottom left to ""claimAll"", you'll be asked to load a wallet, so choose the one you want to store your tokens on. After that, click the ""Write"" button, you'll be asked to send an amount of tokens, but just leave it ""0"". And set the ""Gas Limit"" to around at least 3000000, or the transaction may run out of gas and fail. When this transaction completes, the tokens will be associated with that wallet and you'll see them on the right side whenever you log into myetherwallet.  I would recommend against buying into the token sales though, they always end up more expensive than just buying the tokens on the exchange.

I think they will map out the EOS tokens onto the cryptographic tokens on the EOS blockchain.  I'm more concerned about their ability to enable parallel processing.   The biggest selling point of EOS is its claim that it can process millions of transactions per second.  To do this, Larimer said that they will enable parallel processing.  PP is extremely difficult.  It takes teams and teams of programmers to enable this on a single computer.  I don't see how EOS is going to do this over many distributed remote computers.  I read their white paper and it does not explain how they will achieve parallel processing.  Based on such little information, the probability is that they will fail.  If they fail, then EOS will be similar to Bitshares.  Maybe they know more than they are disclosing in the white paper.  If they pull off parallel processing, it will be a monumental achievement.

That's why this section exists on the eos.io website:  Quote Failing to register a public key for your Ethereum account If you hold EOS Tokens in an Ethereum account and fail to register a public key or lose the private key that maps to your registered public key, then your EOS Tokens will not be part of the snapshot when the EOS Tokens become fixed and non-transferable on the Ethereum blockchain. If and when someone launches a blockchain adopting the EOS.IO Software there may be less than 1 billion EOS Tokens outstanding after taking into account those who fail to register a public key.  That's everything you'd need to know about how it is expected to play out right there. And that is also why they have those disclaimers everywhere about the tokens having no worth, because the EOS team has stated many times that they themselves are not going to be launching a public blockchain. They are only creating the software for others to run a blockchain on. So if everyone who implements EOS's technology decides not to use their Ethereum snapshot to have a jumpstart of users on their blockchain, then yes, your token will become and remain worthless after that freeze. But give the amount of money behind EOS and the amount of users involved, a company would be crazy to not use the Ethereum snapshot to get a massive and instant influx of users and money into their new chain.",False

Some quotes:  ""Block producers publish their available capacity for bandwidth, computation, and state. The EOS.IO software allows each account to consume a percentage of the available capacity proportional to the amount of tokens held in a 3-day staking contract. For example, if a blockchain based on the EOS.IO software is launched and if an account holds 1% of the total tokens distributable pursuant to that blockchain, then that account has the potential to utilize 1% of the state storage capacity.""  ""One of the major benefits of the EOS.IO software is that the amount of bandwidth available to an application is entirely independent of any token price. If an application owner holds a relevant number of tokens on a blockchain adopting EOS.IO software, then the application can run indefinitely within a fixed state and bandwidth usage. In such case, developers and users are unaffected from any price volatility in the token market and therefore not reliant on a price feed. In other words, a blockchain that adopts the EOS.IO software enables block producers to naturally increase bandwidth, computation, and storage available per token independent of the token's value.""  ""A blockchain that adopts the EOS.IO software will award new tokens to a block producer every time a block is produced. In these circumstances, the number of tokens created is determined by the median of the desired pay published by all block producers. The EOS.IO software may be configured to enforce a cap on producer awards such that the total annual increase in token supply does not exceed 5%.""  So, in summary: Your EOS app receives computational power proportional to the amount of tokens you hold. Block producers are rewarded with new tokens produced by the blockchain and the market price of the tokens control how much computational power the block producer can afford. So just like Ethereum the token amount is indefinite with a proposed cap of annual increase of 5%. Sounds like it could work.",False

I have confidence in Dan's skills, and to those that are espousing that there is not much information as to exactly how EOS works... there is probably a good reason for that. Ethereum, et al, would love to digest a competitor's roadmap for scaling and possibly implement some of the ideas in their own implementations (if found worthy.) I am sure Dan has a plan, but whether it is the best smart contract scaling plan is yet to be seen. That ads risk alone.  But... let's assume that he has the best plan for scaling smart contracts. As expected, the first ICO window set an astronomical tone for the valuation of EOS tokens. As such, I did not participate in it.  650,000 ETH for 200,000,000 EOS  = 0.00325 ETH per EOS token  There will be 1,000,000,000 total EOS at the end of the ICO.  = 3,250,000 ETH Market Cap  = $942,792,500 USD EOS Market Cap   If EOS is eventually successful, then this might seem like a value at this point in the general cryptocurrency market timeline. However, you must keep in mind that practically every cryptocurrency is overvalued at this time and that market capitalizations will retreat back to pre-bubble levels in the nearish-mediumish term.  There is no escaping the overall cryptocurrency bubble, and all cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin included) will feel the consequences of such. EOS is no safe haven, and I expect to buy EOS in future rounds at a discount compared to the prices that are currently being paid.",False
