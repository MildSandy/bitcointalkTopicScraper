We paid several BTC upfront in order for our bounty camp to be run in a professional and trustworthy manner. This ended up being a sham, as the tokens which were sent to the bounty manager, Atriz, within like 2 days of the ICO ending were nearly stolen by them/him - the team eventually managed to get them paid back to us - we found out (after the fact) that he had never attempted to even distribute them  2. This issue arose as we were preparing for the build of our first DC. We had to scramble to try and make a plan for the distribution, even though not a single person on our team even knew how the bounty worked. spreadsheets were incomplete, we never knew if items on the sheet were real of fake, we had no way of working though this. Bounty is not our speciality, and we had to try (with the help of the community and some bonters/sig members) work out how to finish this. we eventually completed this, and published the new spreadsheets --- we allocated everybody the stake They applied for, because we could not check up on 21,000 transactions --- we know there were some liars and cheats, but we paid them anyway (sound much like a scam?)  3. when we appointed a dev (and paid 20ETH) for the contract and distribution ((this was majorly overpriced, but we did it anyway, just to try and help the counters get their tokens faster-- do we sound much like a scam/cheats??)) we found that there was a technical issue with the airdrop syncing up. this is the issue we are trying to fix, and this is the sole hold-up on the distribution.  4. the team, and our CEO has promised the bounters their tokens. the tokens are locked in a dedicated wallet, ready to be airdropped as soon as practically possible. we are not trying to hold back tokens, or rob anybody of their rightful earnings. we believe in our project and the value of the tokens, and therefore want them to be sent out to everybody who worked for them.  it would be much appreciated if people could cut us some slack, and allow us to work through this, without FUD-ing our thread.  *****  As for the project, and the build:  1. we are in progress - start date has moved 3 weeks to beginning of Sept due to a change in equipment orders which was necessary to accommodate for increased mining difficulty and lower market prices. This was run through our community telegram group and channels, and ""approved"" en mass.  2. our first phase is larger (in terms of mining capacity) than planned, meaning more mining yields.  3. we are also developing a 35MW miner co-location business in the USA.  4. To answer @Shayesmiles question, we have 18MW available at the moment, which we are filling up with our own miners (moonlite project) ; and 35MW in the works in the USA - this will only be online in the next 3 months or so.",False

Here is some info, which I hope helps:  1) sig campaign was billed and paid in BTC (to the manager) upfront (payments in beginning of Jan & Feb & Mar, for the whole month) - it is our understanding that this BTC gets paid to the sig members accordingly, and that this is taken care of by Atriz. From our side, the whole cost of each month was settled in full, upfront.  2) the bounty camp worked the same. Atriz runs the camp, and tokens are paid to the bounters accordingly. here are the tx hash's for the payment of the bounty tokens to Atriz so that they can be distributed, please note the dates:  - 0xee58ac823b6289c226d86eda81ffcf699b354a157fbef3aa23900de135e0e8cf - 0x8e53a71f9dbf91cf4ce175a547ba6c81a80ff3e0d6de518d2848675fb0798fd0  1m tokens were paid over 37 days ago..

I must apologize for taking this long to reply, I normally received a notification about a new comment on the thread. Not sure why this was missing this time around...  due to limitations on the number of replies I can do in a certain amount of time, I will combine all answers in this reply, and the team will monitor our ANN thread far more closely in future..  @btcthor : again, sorry for the wait. Iceland allows exemptions to IT and similar projects that meet certain requirements (we do) - the IT equipment is exempt from VAT or import duties (effectively 0% Tax) & corporate income tax is capped, irrespective of revenue - there are no maximum / minimum thresholds.  Our income from presale and ICO was around $9m , and additionally we received around $21m in large scale institutional investment in many forms (direct investment to the project, bank guarantees for suppliers, property purchase guarantees, and other instruments such as credit lines for IT equipment etc) - our capitalization model is fairly complex, as we could no longer rely on 1 smart contract address to get 100% of our funding. in these tough ICO times, we would have failed if it were not for being more dynamic in our offering/approach  we made certain deals with large scale investors that allowed them unseen security and liquidity inside of the deal, such as bank guarantees presentable to our suppliers who require guarantees - the net result is we did not have to fork out our ICO earnings on these commitments.  I would like to re-itterate:  - our project has been funded successfully, and we are proceeding as planned - our token is trading on fork delta (ether delta too, but more slowly) - (https://forkdelta.github.io/#!/trade/0x0d62dc6cd8c81dca8caadccf01ffe7c1f31d9402-ETH) - all pre-sale tokens have been successfully distributed to the contributors - our bounty tokens have been sent to the bounty manager, and are currently being distributed to the bounters. - we are working with 3 other exchanges, but will be holding a vote amongst the token holders as to how we will proceed with this - more info in the newsletter mentioned next; - SEE OUR MOST RECENT NEWSLETTER FOR MORE DETAILED INFO ON THE PROGRESS OF OUR PROJECT, YOU CAN EVEN SIGN UP - https://mailchi.mp/f13262116868/ready-set-go-data-centre-here-we-come  we are super grateful to the community for embracing our project, as without this, we would not have been funded to the levels we see today. Any talk of Moonlite being a scam is not even worth replying to - my suggestion would be to start saving for your trip to Iceland in Aug'18, where you can come and visit the DC, and see it with your own eyes.

This has caused sales to soar! we had 17,000,000 tokens allocated for presale, which were supposed to last about 8 weeks. these have been snapped up, and don't look as if they will last another 2 weeks. this is truly an honor! so thanks to everybody for that.      To address the so-called ""points"" as raised by @OGNasty:  I really do not know how you could draw these conclusions? there is nothing in the numbers, or white paper, or web site, or reality, from where you could possibly deduce this info? I can only imagine that these numbers were thumb-sucked to de-cred our project.  - the total team tokens are 5% of the total supply, locked up for 180 days. this is clear in the white paper, web site, graphs, token swap summary, everywhere? I am not sure where you see that the team has ""allocated 83% of tokens to itself"" ; nor are we ""paying ourselves USD300,000"" at any given point. the profit distribution allows for a small team bonus on an annualized, performance based bonus. THE INFO YOU HAVE PUT IN YOUR POST IS SIMPLY INCORRECT AND MISLEADING  - regarding ""only 28% of funds go to equipment"" - this is also incorrect. we are building our first data centre in 3 phases, just to be frugal. 100% of capital allocated to phase 1, 2, and 3 is used for equipment, construction and setup & retained cash. not $1 is spent on anything else. this is clear in our financial forecasts and Capex budgets on the investor section of our web site. to take this further, we are aiming for $30m-35m on for our ICO. only $12m is allocated for the first data centre. this is again, just for redundancy and to be safe with investor funds. this additional capital (USD28M+) is kept in cold storage until used for expansion. once our first DC is live, we are then in a position to expand with the capital we have raised and stored, instead of waiting for operational profits like pretty much any other mining operation (all expansion decisions and source of capital to be used are vote upon by all token holders) // by managing the cash reserves and deploying operations in a slow and controlled manner, we are preserving capital security, and not wasting public funds on ""school fees"" -- everything we do is audited and publicly reported on, and voted on where needed --  - setup costs are absolutely minimal, around 10% of capital spend during construction, not 45% - this is made up of construction costs and other costs directly related to equipment housing and installation.  - to correct you on your assumption on what we ""expect"" of our token holders. we expect nothing from anybody. investing in this ICO is totally voluntary. we use 100% of invested funds on equipment, setup, and the balance stays in cash/currency, and provide audits on every single step. we keep the business almost 100% liquid, and after month 2, 100% liquid (cash and unencumbered assets)  ; plus we mitigate risk on every possible level, from currency depreciation, energy, equipment, team, weather and more.. we promise security and transparency to everybody.   - Lastly, you mentioned that ""by some miracle, we raise $2,55m"" - well that was less than the first week's token sales. we will be sold out of presale tokens in the next 2 weeks or so at current rates - around 55% of the way through our presale phase. our seed round was oversubscribed by over 200% in the first week. we expect a full sellout of MNL tokens during our ICO, which may raise around $80m-100M (depending on bonuses paid) if we succeed.  - the maths that you have used to attack our project is fictitious, and frankly laughable. I could not even use those numbers as a means to comment, as they are so wayward, and 100% made up.  I feel that this thread is heading in the wrong direction, and although I invite qualified questions, to which will be answered as best we can, I ask you to please cease this fruitless line of trying to shoot imaginary holes in our project. we have done everything in the spirit of transparency and blockchain. it is actually disappointing to be reading your write ups.  **** AT THIS POINT THE MNL TEAM, MOONLITE PROJECT, AND ALL ASSOCIATES, EMPLOYEES, ADVISORS AND AGENTS HERBEY RECUSE OURSELVES FROM THIS LINE OF COMMENTING - ANY FURTHER COMMENTS, FICTITIOUS NUMBERS, ANGLES OF ATTACK AND ANYTHING TO DO WITH @OGNASTY WILL BE IGNORED.

By rights, the linked-in profile of Eric Krige needs to be updated, so thank you for this. Pentahash was actually the genesis to the MoonLite Project, when we first planned to do it in SA as a private project. As the project scope grew and we realized what we could create, we exited from this original plan due to several factors ranging from political stability, energy prices, energy supply etc, and pentahash was downgraded to a non-project, while we focused on MNL. the equipment is privately owned and operated, and is of no direct interest to the MNL project. the equipment will ultimately be merged into the main data centre as part of MNL (at no cost), and pentahash will be terminated. the important thing to note is that this was the testing ground for the systems, procedures, AI, custom codes and the like, that will be instilled in the MNL project.  in a way it was actually a very important development step, but I can understand the confusion, so I apologize for this.  EMK Capital (Pty)Ltd is a SA registered company, that holds the business interests of E Krige in SA. this is not related to MNL or the Capitevo Group.  The corporate structure for MNL is fairly complex, as we have to be compliant in many jurisdictions, and we have to provide token holder security. in short:  1)Capitevo Group is the holding company (in registration) - this owns all companies below it, relating to the MoonLite Project.  2a) A LLC still in registration in Iceland will own the physical operating equipment, leases, HR contracts and the like, and will function as the ""operating entity"" for the MNL project 2b) The data centre property and buildings will be purchased through another pre-registered Icelandic corporation to make the process shorter, less complex due to foreign land ownership laws, and reduces transfer taxes - in other words, the property we are buying is already in an LLC, we would effectively be buying the stocks in that company.  3) Capitevo Investments (in registration in 2 jurisdictions) is the investment arm of the group, and executes investments as per the whitepaper and token holder votes.  we have not elaborated on corporate structure as most would find this confusing and would tend to think down the path of ""scam"", but this is certainly not true. the structures are designed to provide security to token holder capital in the event of downside risk becoming prevalent, and to take advantages of tax laws, and to comply with multi-country laws in many jurisdictions. although not really elaborated on, this is something we have spend a great deal of time and money on, getting it ""just right""  E Krige's linked in profile will be updated to prevent any further confusion. we hope this has answered your questions.

I have seen some comments which question or even try to degrade the sincerity of the project and its rollout. to explain this, we appointed an independent external auditor who will provide the following: audit of power supply, power price agreements ; audit of premises and associated agreements ; audit of the milestones and timing ~~ literally every single thing we have written into our timeline and white paper is audited and publicly reported on. if we miss 1 goal, it will be public knowledge.  we have developed a tight rollout schedule, but it is achievable. just watch this space. pre-sale tokens are nearly sold out, so be there or be square",False

You're planning to pay yourself $300,000.00 out of the raised funds here and issuing 83% of the tokens to yourself and team, so it's reasonable this wouldn't have your full attention.  Any response as to why you're paying users to advertise who bash other community mining projects?    Let us have some fun and do the math.  You plan to raise, what?  Let us say by some miracle you sell out the presale and raise the $2,550,000 needed for your numbers to be accurate.  $300,000 of that money goes in the advisor's pocket immediately.  That means each person's invested $1 is now worth $0.88.  Even worse, they'll only get 17% of the produced tokens, making their $1 investment in ""Moonlite"" now worth <15% of the funds they put in!    It actually gets even worse though as only 28% of funds are marked for actual hardware.  That means a $1 presale investment gets turned into only $0.04 worth of mining equipment!  Don't forget that you got a 300% bonus, so it's expected that future token buyers will pay $0.34 for that ~$0.01 in mining equipment for the presale token holders to break even.  I didn't even add in the 45% ""Setup Expenses"" or the 3% Capital Distribution to the ""Advisory Team"" or the 23% Profit Distribution for ""Provisions"" which I don't know what that is.  Looks to me like you want investors to buy you equipment, pay you to setup a mining facility, pay all your costs, give your team 83% of the mining operation for free, and pay you $300,000 for this privilege?  Please explain to me what I'm not seeing.  Please use real numbers and show what a $1 investment in the token presale will turn into as far as mining equipment, and what % of that mining equipment will generate profits for the token holders.  TL;DR  Turn your $1 into $0.04 worth of mining equipment in the form of 3 tokens that you get to pay someone to setup and manage for you, then try to sell each token now backed by ~$0.01 of hardware for $0.34 so you can break even!",False

All energy in Iceland is generated by Hydro, Wind, and Geo-Thermal installations. these are 100% green. and the energy will be delivered to us on a multi-year fixed base rate (still accounting for CPI)  Hope this info helps!
