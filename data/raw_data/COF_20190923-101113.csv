We’ve had ups and downs in the past couple years, but we’re still here and working on our mission of bringing wall street caliber trading tools to the crypto market – granted, what that actually looks like has evolved over the past two years – a lifetime in the crypto world!  We’ve shared updates on our mistakes, our strategy, and renewed focus in blog posts here:  https://blog.coinfi.com/a-look-back-at-the-coinfi-whitepaper-and-the-path-forward-through-crypto-winter/  https://blog.coinfi.com/coinfi-update-july-2019/  While we have pivoted our focus on trading algos after initially focusing on signals (the second major problem we identified in our whitepaper), we are still developing product and working to achieve long term goals for our team and token holders.  It’s easy to make unsubstantiated claims online, and it’s certainly your right to do so - and by online standards you did it relatively respectfully Yes, those are our real LinkedIn profiles, with our real names and our real personal connections. It’s not exactly a secret – it’s on our website here https://www.coinfi.com/about  Startups are always faced with making tough choices, and we’ve certainly had to. Tough choices involve trade-offs. We’re making the decision to focus on a new product direction and pivoting, rather than doubling down on our decisions. It’ll take longer to get where we need to go, but we believe we will get there.  You may disagree with our approach and that’s certainly your right, but if you’re really interested, in good faith, in finding out more about what we’re working on - we are currently doing user interviews to better understand crypto traders and get feedback on our product development. You can reach out to me nate [at] coinfi.com and I’ll be happy to schedule a call with you to find out more about your trading habits and show you what we’re working on.",False

First of all, we want to thank all of you for being part of the CoinFi community. It’s been incredible to watch this community grow from just the 3 of us cofounders and a few of our crypto nerd friends, to a team of 12 and over 20,000+ Telegram users in just 5 months.  Today we’re announcing that CoinFi will be cancelling our public sale (both presale/crowdsale). Instead, we will be airdropping 9,375,000 COFI tokens to our whitelist. If you signed up and submitted your KYC documents (and aren’t from a restricted country), you will receive 500 COFI tokens on Jan 31, 2018.  Why are we airdropping COFI tokens instead of holding a public sale?  We’ve mentioned in the past that there was a private sale round with early adopters and partners who bring a strategic benefit to growing the CoinFi platform. Having a group of early backers was a core part of our strategy to quickly launch and scale the CoinFi platform.  Although these private partners were allocated only a portion of the token sale, due to the extreme run up in ETH recently, this strategic private sale has now filled our entire hard cap.  After the recent ETH run up, there was simply no way to run an equitable public sale without drastically increasing our hard cap, which was never an option. Our goal has always been to only collect as much as we need to scale up our platform.  At the same time, an airdrop allows us to show you our gratitude, and having 18,000+ token holders bodes well for the future of the platform, as CoinFi’s crowdsourced model depends on having a large community of engaged users and quality contributors.  So how do you claim your 500 COFI tokens?  If you’re receiving this email, you're getting tokens! We’ll be airdropping 500 COFI tokens to the Ethereum address in your dashboard on Jan 31, 2018. These tokens will be fully unlocked.  It’s that simple!  You can login to your dashboard to confirm that you’re eligible for the airdrop or to modify your Ethereum address.  Expect big things from CoinFi in 2018!  Cancelling the public sale and replacing it with an airdrop also means we can accelerate our development timeline and roadmap. Instead of focusing our team’s energy on running a public sale for the next month and a half, we can focus on building and delivering on our core mission of bringing Wall Street caliber trading intelligence to the blockchain.  As we move forward into 2018, we’re extremely excited to share what we’ve been working on and show the world exactly how CoinFi’s crypto financial intelligence will help you make more intelligent trades.  We want to continue to reward you, our loyal community member, by working our asses off to deliver the best product we can.  Cheers,  The CoinFi Team.  P.S. In case you’re wondering about staking access to the platform, everyone who whitelisted will only have to stake 2500 COFI to access the basic tier of the platform, instead of 10,000 COFI.",False

That is correct, although we will be adjusting this number to reflect recent ETH movements. At the moment, 1 ETH will give you 7500 COFI - the title graphic of the thread will be updated shortly.  Since we're discussing changes, it's also worth mentioning that the presale date has been moved to Jan 15, 2018.  The CoinFi team puts in a lot of time carefully engineering our token sale structure.  Over the last week, as we've seen momentum build toward the presale launch, we started looking ahead and analyzed several sources of traffic for the upcoming presale rounds 2 and 3. Our internal modelling shows that the Christmas season and New Years could have a greater than anticipated slowdown effect on those future rounds.  Since momentum is so important to a successful token sale, we don’t want the holidays to dampen all the excitement and buzz the presale launch would generate, so we’re just pushing it back a few weeks so when we open the presale the round will sell out fast.  Speaking of buzz and excitement, Buzzfeed recently interviewed several crypto experts, including Ian Balina and our cofounder Timothy Tam.

There is never 1 form of analysis (fundamental or technical analysis) that can make 100% correct predictions when it comes to the markets.  The best traders (fundamental or technical) leverage their own styles of analysis that give them an edge and use signals and tools to help them make smarter trading decisions that align with their style. CoinFi provides these signals and tools.  For example our crowdsourced market analysis will help fundamental traders identify pieces of news moving the market, faster than fundamental traders who are still digging through various twitter/telegram/slack channels.  Our institutional quality trading signals and algorithms provide traders who follow the technical side of trading with an edge as well, but different traders will use these tools in accordance with their own styles.

Some members of our community have asked why we don't just burn unsold tokens, which is a very valid question. The answer is that we considered this issue very carefully and ultimately, the point of burning unsold tokens is to protect token holder value. We believe that returning tokens to the foundation and using those tokens to incentivize more research, analysis, signals etc. will provide better overall value for the COFI ecosystem to than burning them would.   Does the risk of decreasing the price of tokens after ICO exist?  In any market, there are always macro risk factors that can affect price. However, in considering our token sale structure, we've carefully looked at other tokens that tanked post-ICO and engineered our token structure to avoid those same pitfalls. We believe we've done everything in our power to minimize the risk of a price decrease post-ICO, but are happy to answer questions about specific risk factors you might still have concerns about.",False

This information remains scattered across a variety of platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, Slack channels, Telegram groups, personal blogs, podcasts, Youtube videos, etc.  Furthermore, the relevance and quality of the content varies widely - you may need to read a dozen articles of mediocre to poor quality before discovering a thought-provoking piece backed by strong reasoning and verifiable facts.  Here are some examples of common problems and questions that all investors want to determine about a coin before investing:  1) What does the coin do, what is the technology behind it and what problem does it solve? 2) Historically what news drove the large price movements in the coin? 3) What is the history, track record, integrity of the management team? 4) What is the quality of the development team? 5) How many coins were sold during ICO and at what price? 6) What is the upcoming schedule of development releases and expected company announcements?  Real-time Access to Market Impacting News There are many different types of news related to a specific coin that will drive the price to move quickly up or down. Some historical examples of this include:  1) A coin getting listed on a new exchange 2) New regulatory announcements surrounding the cryptocurrency space 3) A recently discovered security concern/breach in a coin or a high profile exchange 4) Announcement of a development release 5) A thought leader saying something positive or negative about a coin  Certain news releases drive enormous price volatility in the cryptocurrency space. Investors stand to lose a large amount of money when missing this type of timely information.  Detecting Abnormal Market Conditions Right now with the current universe of coins in the cryptocurrency space, it is impossible to quickly identify which are the coins that have abnormal movements. For example, these are common questions traders have on a daily basis:  1) Which coins are trading an abnormally high volume in a short space of time (this is usually an indicator of a rumour or piece of news that has just come out. 2) Which coins have had a large acceleration in price in a short space of time. 3) Is there a sudden acceleration of tweets or social media signals that indicate that news has come out in a coin?  Right now traders manually scan for these conditions. A platform providing signals which can automate the early detection of these conditions would provide extremely valuable data since they lead to profitable trading opportunities.  Inability to Obtain Best Price Execution Bitcoin alone currently trades on over 400 exchanges, and the difference in price on these exchanges for USD/BTC can be up to 20%. Currently, there is no easy way for investors and traders to automatically find the exchange with the lowest USD/BTC price. Bitcoin can be traded on multiple currency pairs as well now including both crypto and foreign currencies (i.e. ETH/BTC, EUR/BTC) which often results in this spread widening further.  In addition, crypto markets have a large number of automated trading bots and market makers who place and cancel orders quickly and try to trade ahead of individual crypto traders in the markets. To obtain the best price execution, institutional quality trading algorithms that can detect this type of automated behavior will give traders an edge over manual order entry. These algorithms are commonly available in the traditional asset markets like equities, FX and bonds, but do not currently exists in the cryptocurrency space.  Given the flow of institutional money and the rapid growth in hedge funds in the industry, inevitably the demand for institutional quality trading tools will only increase.  These problems and our proposed solutions are outlined in our whitepaper.",False

Compared to the kind of tools and on-demand financial analysis to which equities traders have access, the cryptocurrency market is drastically underserved.   How Big Is The Market For Crypto Financial Intelligence?  When the stock market and financial data transitioned from analog to digital networks in the 70s-early 80s, Michael Bloomberg launched a business that revolutionized the way equities traders processed information.  This was the famous Bloomberg Terminal.  Bloomberg Terminal in 1987 https://blog.coinfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bloomberg-terminal-1987-bud-fox-charlie-sheen.jpg   Bloomberg Terminal Today https://blog.coinfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/bloomberg-terminal-now-gordon-gecko.jpg  Because every serious trader needed to have a Bloomberg terminal in order to trade effectively, Bloomberg LP still owns 29.4% of the $25 billion financial data industry - 36 years since its inception.  As finance moves from traditional markets to the blockchain, a similar disruption will occur.  The Same Opportunity Exists In Crypto, But Who Will Win?  As the market opportunity of providing financial intelligence to crypto investors continues to grow, Wall Street institutions will do what they always do - use their tremendous resources to build “toll-booth” businesses that will tax the eco-system.  Bloomberg costs $24,000 USD for an annual subscription and is only available to the elites.  But unfortunately for them, the dominant market intelligence platform for crypto won’t be built through antiquated, pre-internet enterprise sales models.  Instead, it will be built around a token economy - a sustainable system that intelligently incentivizes & rewards those who provide value to the eco-system - the researchers, analysts, curators, and coders.  There is an arms race coming between Wall Street and the crypto community to build the dominant market intelligence platform - the Bloomberg of the crypto markets.  We believe CoinFi will be the Bloomberg for Crypto.  The CoinFi Solution  CoinFi provides in-depth analysis, research, and trading tools that offer Wall Street-like precision - without the Wall Street greed that hoards value creation to the top .01%.  The CoinFI platform is powered by sophisticated algorithmic trading signals, real-time analysis of news through machine learning, and ""best execution"" trading algorithms.   https://blog.coinfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CoinFI-bringing-wall-street-intelligence-blockchain.png   CoinFi already contracts a team of several junior equities analysts to help perform altcoin research and compile data. We have also developed several in-house trading signals that are undergoing internal alpha testing, with very promising results.  For example, here’s a look at our backtesting data that shows how we can analyze accelerations in trading volume to help predict coin price movement:   https://blog.coinfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Video-Screenshot-How-You-Can-Make-50-Profit-In-12-Hours-Trading-NEO_480.jpg  We’re currently live testing different trigger levels and filters to improve accuracy of this signal and minimize false positives. Obviously there are no trading signals that are 100% accurate, but as you can see in the video, our backtesting shows that CoinFi’s volume acceleration signal can already predict price movement with enough accuracy to make profitable trades.  If this is your first time hearing about volume acceleration signals, our tech co-founder Han put together a video showing you the basics of how abnormal trading volume correlates to news and price movements, using an earlier version of CoinFi’s alpha software.   https://blog.coinfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Video-Screenshot-Detecting-Abnormal-Trading-Volume-As-A-Predictor-Of-Price-Movement_480.jpg  Predicting Coin Price Movement Via News Analysis  Speaking of news and its correlation to coin price movements, we are ramping up our capacity to perform natural language processing and sentiment analysis on real-time news - this work is still in the early stages, but we are already seeing some very positive signs.  Arbitrage Signaling  We’re also developing a tool that can identify arbitrage opportunities to notify COFI token holders whenever there is a chance to squeeze out risk-free profit.  Our co-founder Tim shows a live example of one of these arbitrage opportunities in the video below:   https://blog.coinfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CoinFi_arbitrage-video.jpg  CoinFi team member Dom Wells wrote up a fascinating case study of how he used a CoinFi arbitrage signal to make a virtually risk-free 1.5 ETH by taking advantage of the price difference of Bitcoin Gold between Bittrex and HitBTC.  The FinTech industry publication PYMTS also interviewed CoinFi cofounder Timothy Tam recently and published a pretty interesting piece about the arbitrage opportunities that are popping up in the inefficient, volatile crypto markets.  Tim was even quoted in a recent Bloomberg article about the arbitrage opportunities in the crypto markets with the listing of Bitcoin futures on CME.  VentureBeat also featured an article from Tim explaining how bots are manipulating cryptocurrency prices, and what you can do about it.  Unlocking The Wisdom Of The Crowd With The CoinFi Token  As the platform grows, the company will transition to a fully crowdsourced model to provide research, analysis, and trading signals incentivized via CoinFi tokens. Access to the platform’s advanced features and premium content will require staking tokens to reward token owners and reduce volatility.  *********************  You can read more about how we’re solving problems for crypto investors in the CoinFi Whitepaper and on our website Coinfi.com.  *********************  What Sets CoinFi Apart From Its Competitors? Unlike other projects that set far-fetched goals of decentralised technology and are years away from being functional, the CoinFi team includes experienced entrepreneurs and growth marketers who understand how to ship rapidly, iterate based on real user feedback, and quickly scale a passionate user base.  Team  https://blog.coinfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CoinFi_team.jpg https://blog.coinfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/coinfi_team_nav.jpg  Advisory Board  https://blog.coinfi.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CoinFi_advisory-board.jpg  Along with our underlying tech and financial expertise, this will be key to the platform’s success and the value of the COFI token. COFI’s value isn’t based on hitting a moonshot - the COFI token will have real long term value because we’re already developing valuable solutions that are solving real-world problems for crypto investors.  >> See our blog for real world examples <<  In an industry where a sexy website, shiny LinkedIn profiles, and a snazzy whitepaper can be enough to secure tens of millions in funding, we believe the CoinFi team really sets itself apart with its experience bootstrapping web properties from 0 to millions of users, as well as growth hacking for some of the fastest growing startups in the world. This is what sets us apart from our competition and will allow us to build a long-term sustainable business.  CoinFi is not just a financial tech company, it is a media business in an exploding industry - and having the expertise to scale both sides of the business quickly is an advantage (we believe) we have over our competitors.

Our advantage over Wall Street is that the crypto community, and the nature of cryptocurrencies themselves, makes it harder for large institutions to monopolize value. On our crowdsourced platform, the engineers, analysts and researchers, who are providing the value will receive the bulk of the profits.  In the ICO space, the closest comparable competitors that have done ICOs would be: 1) Santiment 2) Cindicator 3) Enigma  Santiment predominantly provides data feeds and trading signals.  Coinfi does that, but also provides crowdsourced research/analysis and trading algorithms.  Cindicator predominantly provides trading signals but does not provide data feeds, crowdsourced research/analysis and trading algorithms. They recently released an arbitrage bot that costs $21,000 USD to access at the moment. CoinFi has a similar product in closed beta that will be released significantly cheaper.  The market is maturing and starting to see the need + demand for quality news, trading signals and algorithms.  Santiment is up 275% in the previous month.  Compared to Enigma, we are fundamentally different in a couple of important ways: 1) we are targeting a significantly smaller raise of $15m only vs Enigma’s $45m. Because of their massive hard cap, Enigma’s token value has dropped whereas the competitors who have raised smaller amounts have gone up.  2) While enigma provides the data, we service the layer above i.e. the signals, news and algorithms that directly help everyday traders make more money.  With Enigma’s model you need to take their data and program your own tools, while CoinFi’s platform will be available directly to CoFi token holders.",False
