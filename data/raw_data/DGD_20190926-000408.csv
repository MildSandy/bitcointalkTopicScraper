General Information as stated on the Digix Website:  Hello and welcome to Digix – an asset tokenization platform on Ethereum that puts gold asset ownerships on the blockchain, making digital gold transferrable on the blockchain.   Digix created DigixDAO (DAO stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization) – a way for all of us to build a digital gold payment system together on the blockchain. It allows all DigixDAO token holders to participate in the direction Digix takes to build this gold payment system into reality.   Instead of a company or an individual issuing shares, a software protocol issues DAO tokens as a software product. DigixDAO function with a bottom up governance where digix, the employees of the DAO, submit project proposals to the DAO token holders to build the platform the way they want it. Dao Token holders have the final say as to what projects should be approved or rejected, not Digix. Some projects that we propose includes planned integration of EtherEx, a permissionless p2p exchange, and payment processors several other integrations as detailed in our crowdsale document (see below).  For your participation, you will receive, as a reward, all transaction fees on DGX gold tokens on Ethereum based on the number of DGD tokens you hold!
