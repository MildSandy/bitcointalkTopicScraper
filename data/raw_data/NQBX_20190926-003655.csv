Challenges that include traffic, housing, pollution, energy demand and much more. In other words: Our cities are a mess. Nevertheless, there is not really a solid plan how to resolve all these growing problems.  So, are there even solutions for all these problems? The answer is yes! By turning the cities smart, it is possible to regulate traffic, decrease pollution, organize cities in a healthier way which is more eco and citizen-friendly and much more.  Of course, every city is different, with it´s own rules, organization and society which means that every city plan must by tailor made and engineered to respond as good as possible to every city´s needs.  So, what is NiQBiX exactly, and how does it work? NiQBiX provides the hardware and software to make every city as smart as possible. This means we have to work closely with engineers and architects all over the world to find the best solutions for each and every city. Therefore, NiQBiX is not really a product or a program, but either a whole project with a vision for the future.
