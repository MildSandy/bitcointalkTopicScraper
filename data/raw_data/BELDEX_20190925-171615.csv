Specifications:  Algorithm           :   Cryptonote Block Rewarded   :   100 Block Time   :   2 Minutes Total Coins   :   1.5 Billion  Beldex: https://beldex.io/  BELDEX has launched a privacy coin that ensures privacy, security, untraceability and fungibility. Some of the common advantages that BELDEX offers to its customers are as follows:  Fraud Protection: BELDEX coins are digital and cannot be counterfeited or reversed arbitrarily by the sender or receiver.  Identity Theft: Credit cards operate on a “pull” basis, where the store initiates the payment and pulls the designated amount from the account. Whereas, BELDEX coin uses a “push” mechanism that allows the cryptocurrency holder to send the exact amount to the merchant or recipient with no further information.  Immediate Settlement: Purchasing real property involves a number of third parties, delays, and payment of fees. Smart contracts can be designed and enforced to eliminate or add third party approvals, reference external facts. It can also be used to complete at a future date or time for a fraction of the expense and time required to complete traditional asset transfers.  Globally Recognized: BEDLEX coins are globally recognized and so it can be spent anywhere in the world on a daily basis. The inclusion of a utility debit card ensures the aforementioned point and thus provides high liquidity.  Lower Fees: BELDEX coins can be exchanged at a very low transaction fee and when transacted using BELDEX exchange, users are given special compensation on their transaction fee. This service acts like Paypal does for cash or credit card users, providing the online exchange system for bitcoin, and as such, they’re likely to charge fees.  Untraceable: BELDEX coins cannot be traced back due to encryption. This is achieved by masking the sender and receiver addresses. With the usage of RingXT coin algorithm, BELDEX ensures “stealth” mode during the transactions.
