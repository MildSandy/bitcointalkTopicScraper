We take it for granted. However, no one is insured against disability. Of course, many people are already born with certain disorders in mental, psychological or physical development, but millions annually come to disability due to harmful work, injuries, accidents.   According to sociologists, at the moment more than a billion people suffer from disability problems, which is about 15% of the world's population. When the World Health Organization conducted such a study in the 1970s, this figure barely reached 10%. Most of all, people of retirement age are prone to disability, but children are not protected from this problem.   The disabled include not only wheelchair users and people who have lost limbs, but also children and adults with complex psychological or physical diseases, with complete or partial loss of vision, hearing, developmental problems and more. Each such group needs a special approach, but it is important to understand that they all have the right to a full and happy life without restrictions.

With efforts undertaken for the good of the public, IDAC seeks to contribute to the global charity landscape for disabled people. In the traditional Internet world, information could be transmitted all over the world, but this was not the case for value.  However, value is the most significant entity that is in need of distribution in the public welfare ecosystem. Therefore, a transnational, trans-regional and a global public welfare ecosystem without racial boundaries cannot be established based on the traditional mode. However, with the means provided by blockchain technology, there will no longer be distinctions along racial and national divisions. As long as people share the same values and beliefs, they can come together to form the foundation of a system that supports the transmission and circulation of value.  Based on a comprehensive analysis, all sorts of problems arising from public disability assistance can be attributed to the trust issue resulting from the information asymmetry. The consequences due to the public‚Äôs loss of confidence may lead to multiple problems. If we are able to resolve the trust and credibility issue, an increasing number of caring people will be more willing to contribute to public disability assistance funds, and more disabled people can benefit from it.  Blockchain technology gives us renewed hope that the future direction of charity will change because of the attributes of the new attributes it can offer: decentralization and detrust, which is congruent to the traits that will fit the public welfare ecosystem for disability assistance. With the emergence of blockchain technology, IDAC was henceforth established. The organization seeks to serve as a bond and bridge connecting the disabled and the able-bodied people on a worldwide scale which brings hope to and ushers in a new future for the 650 million disabled people in the world. Blockchain technology that is to be used for disability assistance is foreseen to help the disabled alleviate the grief they have suffered in their hearts.  The IDAC project aims to solve the inherent complications easily bred in the traditional charity setup by establishing a database for some 650 million disabled people to achieve directed poverty relief and one-to-one assistance, attract more caring people into the public welfare ecosystem to help the disabled out of concern and a sense of responsibility and thus enable the disabled to be a generator of value while receiving financial aid with dignity.  üî∫ Lean more about us here: http://www.idacpro.io  üìç Join now: Telegram chat https://t.me/IDACOfficial1",True

As for blockchains, there is no central database but data will be distributed and stored on many nodes. Data on the blockchain is connected from end to end by virtue of the encryption algorithm, by which the data can be infinitely extended and is thus tamper-proof.  Technically, blockchains solve the decentration and detrust problems due to these attributes it possesses. It is believed that blockchain technology will be the chief architect of the fourth industrial revolution, by changing the underlying production relationships to boost productivity greatly.  The progression of civil society can thus be predicted as follows: decentration>centralization > over-centralization >decentralization.  ‚ñ™Ô∏è Why the need to become decentralized?  This is because over-centralization gives rise to the problems caused by the high cost incurred to be perceived as being trustworthy, such as the waste of resources and persistent levels of poor productivity and these consequences can combine to hamper the social development of society. In the field of charity, there are also various problems resulting from centralization, including the lack of data sharing, the gap in communication due to the lack of connection between smart devices and the increase in susceptibility to corruption scandals.  Above all, it is the failure to achieve maximum assistance for the disabled people that matters the most. Blockchain technology will serve as a trust-building technology with the features of decentralization, temper resistance, openness, publicity, and transparency, which is suitable for point-to-point payment, clearing and settlement of transaction deals in the financial field, as well as helping to increase the legitimacy of the public welfare field in which credibility is gradually fading away.  üî∫ Lean more about us here: http://www.idacpro.io  üìç Join now: Telegram chat https://t.me/IDACOfficial1",True

While 62% of organisations surveyed reported launching their own blockchain initiatives.  600 executives from companies across 15 nations participated in the survey. As we have already said almost 84% adopt blockchain for their business processes, however, so far just 25% have reached the stage of launching a pilot version of a blockchain network. What‚Äôs interesting is that businesses from almost all known economy sectors are trying to bring blockchain to their organisations.  PwC has also asked companies about the main challenges in making the switch to blockchain: some organisations just don‚Äôt know where to start, while 14% of executives complained there was no control and integration mechanisms for the new technology, discouraging them from adopting the technology. Some executives have also expressed fears of high expenses tied to integrating the distributed ledger technology into operations.

Do you know that the modern system of charity management has a number of limitations?  And one of the biggest problems in this area is the inability to track the transfer and disposal of donations.  From this problem, in fact, there are several other problems, the most striking of which is that the donor does not actually have a voice in the decision ‚Äì making process on the use of donations.  Moreover, today there is no standard mechanism for the distribution of charitable funds. Instead, charitable organizations and headquarters are to decide for the donor how  their contributions will be used.  This way of management is not always fair and equitable, because charities very often have other goals, as well as a desire to achieve greater recognition through media coverage. When these goals are mixed in the decision-making process about the use of donations, there is a deviation from the true goals of the creation and existence of charitable funds, because the funds are often not used to help people in need.  üî∫ Lean more about us here: http://www.idacpro.io  üìç Join now: Telegram chat https://t.me/IDACOfficial1",True

Bitcointalk was originally created by Satoshi Nakamoto, the ""father"" of bitcoin, a man whose true identity is unknown (who knows, maybe it's not just one person, but a group of people who operate under the same nickname). Before creating Bitcointalk, Satoshi used the SourceForge forum to discuss issues related to Bitcoin. Unfortunately, this forum is not available anymore.  By the way, the profile of Satoshi on Bitcointalk can be found today - the last time he logged in his account was on December 13, 2010 (here‚Äôs the link to his profile https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3) One of Satoshi's last posts before he eventually disappeared was regarded to WikiLeaks.

As you know, we are open to always new and sees big potential in the developing technologies and new tools for various fields of business. Obviously this refers to the digital world closely connected to blockchain, cryptocurrencies and ICOs. However, not all countries are as positive on this industry as others, for example, the USA.  Let‚Äôs look into the reasons for that.  The United States of America is among the top picks for cryptocurrency businesses and ICOs in particular.  However, even the projects and companies that have opened a representative office in the US for conducting an ICO and issuing tokens often use another legal entity in jurisdictions where such activities are openly welcome, or when the question of legality has not yet been established by the time of the token sale. Another concern is the fact that US citizens and residents participation in token sales is limited. This is due to the country‚Äôs stocks and securities trading legislation.  Many projects dream of someday conquering this market. But why are ICOs banned in this country? They were never banned, just regulated. In July 2017 the SEC has issued a statement that tokens can be considered securities, provided they meet certain requirements (such as voting rights, stake in the company, promise of profits, etc.). To determine if the token is a security it is run through the Howey Test, Family Resemblance Test, Capital Risk Test and some other additional tests. The SEC has also issued a number of documents warning future investors of possible risks pertaining to ICOs. This is why, as we have said earlier, companies from the US choose other jurisdictions to issue tokens so both their investors and themselves don‚Äôt have to jump through unnecessary hoops.  All these restrictions concern other ICO projects everywhere in the world. Many ban US investors from participating in their projects. The prospects of development for ICOs in that country are, at least for now, rather fuzzy. The US is most likely to remain popular as a place for headquarters, while tokens within ICO campaigns will continue being issued in other, more suitable jurisdictions.  üî∫ Lean more about us here: http://www.idacpro.io  üìç Join now: Telegram chat https://t.me/IDACOfficial1",True

Conventional charity organisations are highly centralised and it is often impossible to get a full picture when it comes to the management of charitable funds. This can lead to undesirable results such as corruption in management, bad decision making, etc. With the emergence of blockchain technologies, we are confident that the conventional way of charity can be challenged and changed, for the better.      Current Limitations in Charity Management  One of the biggest problems with conventional charity organisations is that how donations are being managed and handled are unbeknownst to us.  This creates several issues - Donors have no say in the decision making process regarding how the proceeds shall be used. Instead, the charity organisation as the centralised institute decides for us where and how our donations will be used.  Such a way of handling is not always done in good faith or is equitable in fairness because charity organisations often have other implicit agendas such as the wish to garner greater recognition by virtue of higher media coverage. When these extra agendas are mixed into the decision making process, a deviation from the true purpose and responsibility of the charity organisation is created, because it dilutes their commitment to the charitable cause.    This way of centralised management is also prone to corruption. There are numerous cases where charitable funds were unlawfully used for personal gains.    One major case of such corruption recently was the Red Cross Association's misappropriation of 500 million US dollars that was supposed to be used to support relief efforts after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. People around the world donated to the American Red Cross with generous contributions that amounted to nearly half a billion dollars. The funds were supposed to be used for the development and restoration of key infrastructures in Haiti but none of these actually materialized. Corrupted management within charity organisations can lead to a general decline in people‚Äôs faith towards the charitable cause.  People who were once passionate and sincere about helping the community may instead have second thoughts when being asked to donate. This creates a vicious cycle by which charity organisations have to channel more resources towards promotional and publicity efforts in order to get more donations from the public.  Concurrently, people are unfortunately less willing to donate to these organisations because they become disillusioned with the fact that such monetary help may not always be directed to the people in need.  Alas, the real victims of this vicious cycle are none other than the less fortunate people in our society.          12345678910111213141516171819  International Disabled Virtual Community  In order to protect and realize the interests of disabled people around the world, the establishment of a global virtual community is imperative. The community is formed by both donors and the 650 million disabled people globally, with the integration of all relevant resources in order to maximize the efficiency when it comes to fund management and beneficiary targeting. 12345678910111213141516171819     The IDAC Eco - system   The IDAC eco ‚Äì system comprises of the international disabled virtual community, technology developers for the disabled, government bodies as well as Non ‚Äì profit organisations. 12345678910111213141516171819  Real -World Applications    Partnership with insurance companies, handicap technology research firms, education institutes are being established in order to create real life applications for IDAC tokens.
