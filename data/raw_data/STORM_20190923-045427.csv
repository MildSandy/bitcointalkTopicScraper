Great project you have there, and it's really cool mobile app is already working. @stormtoken, I'm just a little voice from a community and you can ignore me, buut - you guys should dedicate some more time in marketing, it will greatly expand community/adoption/app's user base(!). Here are few things that should be fixed:  - topic name. it should not say ICO since it's over. Also, it should contain as much info about the innovation coin brings (earn/free are catchy, but smth about the mobile app can be added, I mean, this coin is backed up by something real).  - the poster at the starting message should not say ""crowdsale coming soon"".  What can be done as well - setting up some rewards for marketing: writing articles, posting stuff on social networks. Makes sense?

Please be advised that we are experiencing some errors with the Ethereum based Tokens smart contract. We decided that the best way to solve the problem is to fork the Smart Contracts.  It was a simple process and everything worked out without issues. We implemented a seamless procedure to update the smart contract using an automatic process through MyEtherWallet services.  Please use the link below to unlock your wallet through MyEtherWallet and follow the instructions on our website.   https://myetherwallet.comk   Failure to do so may result in loss of ETH or Tokens.

Token Storm avec l'echange Bittrex  cakeCodes, Inc. situé à Seattle, WA, États-Unis, annonce officiellement son événement de génération de token. Les tokens de Storm  seront disponibles au public le 15 août.  CakeCodes, Inc. est fier d’etre le développeur de  l'application ""BitMaker"", une plate-forme qui relie les entreprises et les utilisateurs directement en proposant la crypto-monnaie  comme principale récompense. Nous avons reconnu le manque d’eficacité dans l'espace publicitaire numérique et nous avons décidé de les résoudre. Les utilisateurs ont été inondés avec plus de 5000 annonces par jour, et les annonceurs ont constaté des retombées négatives sur leurs investissements. Les gagnants dans l'environnement actuel étaient les intermédiaires, les éditeurs d'annonces.  En créant BitMaker, nous avons pu créer une plate-forme qui avait un sens financier pour les deux parties. Les gens étaient récompensés en crypto-monnaie  en échange de leur engagement significatif avec les annonceurs. En payant les gens en Bitcoin et en  Ethereum, les annonceurs ont pu augmenter la quantité d'utilisateurs qui s'engagent avec eux, augmenter leurs ratios , Et augmenter la valeur à vie de la clientèle.  Exemple: 10 000 $ dépensés pour une campagne de CPM    •   Dépenses publicitaires de 10 000 $ x 2,7% = 270 utilisateurs générés à partir d'une campagne publicitaire •   Si LTV d'un utilisateur est de 5 $ (jeux mobiles au niveau 6) = chiffre d'affaires de 1 350 $ généré - 10 000 $ de dépenses publicitaires = (perte de 8 650 $)  Exemple: campagne de CPA pour dépenses publicitaires de 10 000 $  •   Si LTV d'un utilisateur est de 5 $ (jeux mobiles après avoir atteint le niveau 6) = récompense de 3,50 $ par utilisateur après achèvement •   Budget de 10 000 $ / 3,50 $ = x Utilisateurs oX Utilisateurs  * LTV = 14 285,71 $ générés o $ 14 285,71 $ revenus générés - Dépenses publicitaires de 10 000 $ = 4 285,71 $ BÉNÉFICE   Après avoir construit une entreprise rentable et durable avec plus de 900 000 utilisateurs dans 187 pays, nous avons réalisé que notre plate-forme possédait des capacités supplémentaires qui pourraient aider à unifier la main-d'œuvre globale.  Présentation de StorMarket  Au fur et à mesure que les employeurs commencent à mettre davantage l'accent sur la technologie et l'automatisation, il devient beaucoup plus difficile pour le travailleur moyen de trouver un emploi traditionnel. Au cours des 5 dernières années, le marché de l’emploi indépendant a connu une croissance exponentielle, devenant un secteur de 2 milliards de dollars avec des signes continus de croissance. La croissance est alimentée par les benefices  des  deux côtés de l'expérience du marché:   travailleurs  •   Soyez votre propre chef •   Plus grand potentiel de gain •   Travaillez où vous voulez •   Travaillez quand vous voulez •   Flexibilité, liberté •   Utilisation des compétences  Employeurs  •   Accès au pool mondial de talents •   Un travail de qualité supérieure axé sur la rétention •   Coûts inférieurs (sans prestations) •   Faible risque  Le marché de l’emploi indépendant continue de croître jusqu'à 37% d'une année a l'autre. Il y a un important potentiel inexploité sur ce marché car 27% des 4,68 milliards de travailleurs éligibles dans le monde ne font plus partie d'un emploi. En utilisant BitMaker comme point d'insertion, nous serons en mesure de développer de manière rapide et transparente StorMarket, une plate-forme qui peut profiter à des milliards de personnes partout dans le monde qui recherchent du travail.  Bien qu'il y ait eu du succès, il y a des inefficacités sur ce marché qui limitent son potentiel. Par exemple, les plates-formes traditionnelles de micro-emploi facturent des frais déraisonnables, ce qui a entravé à la fois l'affiche du poste et l'interprète. En créant StorMarket, un marché de micro-emplois sécurisé et décentralisé, nous pourrons éliminer les inefficacités de ce marché.  Frais actuels de l'industrie et Commission Mechanical Turk ----- 20-40% Fiverr ---- 20% + Frais Paypal $ 0.30 + 2.9% Upwork ---- 10-20% TaskRabbit ---- 30% + 7.5% Trust Frais  En utilisant la blockchain, nous pourrons automatiser davantage le processus du marché du micro-travail en intégrant directement les aspects de gestion de projet et de marketing dans notre plate-forme. StorMarket pourra éliminer presque tous les frais (frais Ethereum) et remettre le pouvoir aux utilisateurs. Token STORM  Approvisionnement: 7 500 000 000 token Allocation pour les participants: 66,7%   Allocation pour le personnel: 18,3% Allocation pour les utilisateurs: 15% TGE Période: 8/15 / 17-9 / 14/17 Token distribués 1 semaine à la fin de l'événement de generation de tokens  STORM Sera  le premier événement de génération de tokens hybride avec 40 millions de dollars délivrés par des contrats intelligents. Les 10 millions de dollars restants seront générés grâce à Bittrex Exchange.  Nous avons un partenariat direct avec Bittrex. 10 millions de dollars du montant total des 50 millions de dollars seront émis via  l'échange Bittrex et seront disponibles pour échanger immédiatement après la fin de l'événement de génération de token sur la plate-forme Bittrex.  Les 40 millions restants de la génération de jetons seront émis au moyen de contrats intelligents le 15 août.  L'événement de génération de token sur la plate-forme Bittrex permettra aux participants qui ne connaissent pas le processus des contrats intelligents de contribuer facilement à l'événement TGE.

Quote from: stormtoken on July 06, 2017, 08:43:45 PM We have a direct partnership with Bittrex. $10M of the total $50M raise will be issued through the Bittrex exchange and be available to trade immediately after the end of the token generation event on the Bittrex platform.  The remaining $40M of the token generation will be issued through smart contracts on August 15th.  Token generation event on the Bittrex platform will allow participants unfamiliar with the process of smart contracts to easily contribute to the TGE event.   I have a question is there any method to confirm the status of this they are part of this project.",False
