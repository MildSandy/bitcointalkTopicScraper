Their goal is to create a decentralized transportation system. Everybody needs transportation. TrafficX wants to keep users privacy, reduce emission, support carpooling, lower traffic on the road, show events on the map, make one integral system for transportation all over the world and more.  This DAPP will contain the following features and more: -Decentralized transportation system -Safe payment systems -Showing nearby events -Sharing rides -Fair pricing system for both parties -Privacy securer -Employability platform to create more jobs -Encryption  These are the main features. There are more features on the application which will differentiate this application even more than the current ones.  Why the decentralization? TrafficX wants this platform available to every human being on this planet, no matter where they live. People should be able to use this platform without any data getting sold to third parties, as we concern about users privacy. Our main goal is to offer a platform where drivers and people who need transport can connect in an anonymous way. Another benefit of this platform is providing more employability. People can work as many hours as they like to earn money. The potential? Our platform will offer fulltime anonymous transport on a daily basis. In the near future we aim to expand with public transport. Decentralise all the transport.  It is important that everyone can travel with ease and maximum privacy.
