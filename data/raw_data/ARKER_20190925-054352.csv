It will last 50 days, the first days will have a bonus. We do not have a defined price for the token, the price will be defined according to the people who invest.  We are convinced that it will be a very promising project, since we are very involved in all aspects of the game and have a lot of advice from people. They tell us what they want to have in a game of this type.  On the other hand, we are different from other projects like this, since most of them what they do is mine with your device and give you a small portion of the generated reward, which seems to us an abuse of hardware, apart from other things ( use of the battery, higher consumption, low performance of the device ...).  We want to motivate the player by rewarding their time, They feel that they are doing something productive while being entertained, without their device being at 100%.  Therefore the player can get Arker Coins just by playing, and these can be exchanged again in the game by special objects or take them out and operate with them in the crypto marker, the player will be the absolute owner of their wallet.",False
