Let me give an example:  Let’s say there’s only 100 shares available.  A bids to buy 10 shares at $200 each. B bids to buy 150 shares at $50 each.  The Dutch auction algorithm will find the best price per share. There’s many algorithms, but the simplest one is to pick the lowest price that sells all the shares.  In our example that price is $50. So A gets 10 shares at $50. B gets 90 shares at $50 each. A tried to pump up the price but failed. However, since A’s bid was higher than B’s, A is first in line to be allocated the shares.  Now, say if instead, A had bid $11 for 100 shares and B had bid $10 for 100 shares. Even though the winning price is $10, it is A who will get all the shares. So there’s an incentive to bid higher to get priority in the line. But at the same time you’ll still be awarded a fair price.  You can also check online for more examples on how dutch auctions work.",False

Prospective participants must create an account with Maecenas in order to participate in the online auction. A limited number of users will be allowed to participate in the beta launch. The artwork will then be put on auction via a Dutch Auction process starting at 10AM CEST on Wednesday, 25th of July 2018, in which the final price per fractional unit will be determined by a Smart Contract. Both the initial sale and any subsequent buying and selling of these fractional units are tracked on a blockchain.

Buyers will be able to purchase digital certificates on the blockchain representing fractional ownership in the painting using cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Maecenas’ native cryptocurrency, ART. The final auction price for each painting share will be determined by a Smart Contract run on Ethereum, notably one of the fairest and most transparent pricing mechanisms to date on the blockchain.

Eleesa Dadiani, the founder of Dadiani Syndicate, will be auctioning 14 Small Electric Chairs by Andy Warhol on the Maecenas art investment platform.
