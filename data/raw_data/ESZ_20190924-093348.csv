We must ensure a profitable and successful product first.  We also have multiple applications in with many exchanges and are under review. We also have exchange brokers working on our behalf to help with a medium size listing. These two things are our primary focus.  It’s important that ESZPlay is successful and generates revenue in the form of cash initially so ESZCoin will have successful buybacks. We cannot include ESZCoin as a form of payment for matchmaking at this time. Near the end of the summer we will be implementing a fiat cash system through skrill first.  At this time we will not be implementing any new ideas. We just rolled out the buyback and burn model reducing the market cap by over 3 million ESZCoins. We will take your ideas into consideration for future implementation but at this time we are focused on the product development for beta launch and an exchange listing.   FYI We have an ESZCoin related update early to mid next week that will discuss additional revenue streams and partnerships in the pipeline.'  To join the discussion, see https://t.me/ESZCoin",False

We will have a full status update late today as normal.  Obviously we were unable to list on a major exchange this month. However we saw some good volume on IDEX and smaller instant liquidity is always available on Bancor if needed.  The failed KuCoin listing set our progress back some with other exchanges. I will say we have applications in with other exchanges now to be listed and are in negotiations but none came through for April. Normally it’s a 30-60 day process. We are also looking at more costly exchanges also but want to make sure it does not hurt the project overall.  There has been some pushback from some exchanges based on the token model being a future reward token. We are looking at alternative exchange models also that could resolve that. We have meetings setup today and Wednesday to review.  We are very happy with the platform development progress and believe we are on schedule for end of Q2 for a solid Beta with at least two playable games.  To much to talk about in one messages - thanks for sticking with us and again we will provide a full update this afternoon along with some measures we are taking to protect the value of ESZCoin.'

Make sure to join here https://t.me/ESZCoin  Hello everyone, we are getting back from the Game Developer Conference where we finalized partnerships with vendors and game developers. We will have a news update soon to go into more detail but I wanted to let everyone know how productive our meetings were. We were able to meet with Playerunknow Battlegrounds business development / API team. They really like what we are doing and we have been given early access to the PUBG API / developer portal. We hope to be able to launch PUBG on the platform on or before Q4! We also have formed a marketing / developer partnership that will help with the launch of the beta / production product - we can't talk about this yet but will soon.  Regarding the exchange - we will release something more formal via blog but we were scheduled to be listed on KuCoin but they requested an outrageous amount of ""resources"" right before we were to be listed that that would ruin the project - even though we had already finalized the listing date and had put substantial ""resources"" into the future marketing of the listing. We were very disappointed that our project was treated this way.  That being said we are back talking with smaller / medium size quality exchanges that actual have some integrity and we will be announcing a listing with one of them in the next two weeks for the month of April – this is still inline with our roadmap of a Q2 exchange listing. We are open to hearing suggestions on smaller / medium size exchanges.  We are working to launch a bounty / voting campaign with Bounty0x to help with an exchange listing and spreading the word on ESZCoin / EtherSportz project. We have a new website being launched that is focused on the product that will be ready this week. More news to come!  For the beta we will be launching CS:GO end of Q2",False

ESZCoin holders will collect 50% of the fees generated from the EtherSportz platform as a quarterly reward. Non Ether fees such as Cash and Bitcoin will be converted to Ether and held in a secure Ethereum reward pool smart contract, that will be publicly accessible and transparent to the network.",False

They've shown some forecasting on the growth of the esports industry though in the whitepaper which you can find at the link below. I personally looked at some stats like rolling player bases, average tournament entry, and percent of player base that would compete competitively and then did some simple calculations. You can look at steam charts for rolling player bases on some of the steam games they are looking at adding but the other information can be tough to find.  A lot of the demand growth will depend on advertising and how the platform compares with alternatives. Ethersportz is the only business model structured as it is with a simple cash/currency based competing platform with token holders receiving a percentage of the reward pool that will scale with the platform. Competitors use the token as utility or are non-crypto companies that have other methods of payment to players like giftcards or other items.  https://ethersportz.com/whitepaper.pdf  http://steamcharts.com/app/570            Quote from: Adokelv on February 19, 2018, 01:46:36 PM Do you visit meetups or roadshows to attract new investors or partners ? Which of them ?  The team has said in the latest update below that they are looking at adding a new team member to help with marketing and partnership efforts. They are looking at partnering with pro players and streamers to add visibility to the platform as they ramp up toward the beta's. Many streamers generate insane traffic and can help spread the word quickly.  https://medium.com/@EtherSportz/ethersportz-project-update-1-2-coinmarketcap-blockfolio-listings-fc4d5022f19b",False

Quote from: Akinohn on February 13, 2018, 10:00:50 AM Haven't find the info so maybe I could ask here. Who if at all are your similar competitors? And how does EtherSportz differs from them? Thanks.  I know Firstblood.io is a potential competitor but the biggest difference between competitors and Ethersportz is that Ethersportz is not developing a utility token. You use the platform directly with cash, bitcoin, or ethereum. The token is specifically to reward investors and those that helped fund the project. You receive dividends distributed quarterly that are a percentage of the total prize pools so you scale with the platform. If the platform takes off, so does your quarterly earnings.

You need a simple and seamless way to make it easy for average gamers to be able to compete and you need to have enough popularity to support the various times and games that are on the platform. I definitely believe there's plenty of pro gamers and streamers that would love to make some money on the side competing on the platform and if big streamers come online, their viewers will see and tell their friends, and it could spread quickly.

How are you going to advertise your platform?  One method they are looking to employ is reaching out to streamers and pro gamers that can give visibility to their fan base. If you can partner with enough streamers and pro gamers, the network effect can help it spread quickly. Some of those pro's and big streamers have tens of thousands watching them at any single point in time.  Quote from: Doomredeemer on February 13, 2018, 12:27:59 PM Can I connect with founders?

Could you please explain why the token is needed for this project? Why did you decide to do this through the ICO?  It's a compliant method to raise funds to develop the project. They are structuring the platform to appeal to any gamer through allowing both fiat and cryptocurrency entries to be made. The business model is structured to directly reward token holders with the increased success of the platform as a percentage of the prize pool is distributed to token holders as quarterly dividends. 10% of all prize pools are collected as fees. half of that is distributed to token holders.

With such a decentralized platform, there is no country of residence so they don't need to follow taxation regulatory of particular countries, allowing them to eventually set 0% tax on the prize pool for the players (this means 0 dividend to holders and 0 gains from the team and is not such a good idea), but even if is not a good idea to set 0%, we can set for sure a percentage that is much much more convenient to players.... so i thing medium players will choose a platform where on a 1vs1 match the can win almost 100% of what they bet and not just 80% or similar, like it happens nowadays.  Hope someone will share my opinion and eventually point a some error i made!!",False

They will play the game and then the winner or winners will be paid accordingly with 90% of the prize pool. The other 10% of the prize pool will go to support operations and reward token holders. Let me know if this does not answer your question and I can try to clarify more.    Quote from: giovenice on February 12, 2018, 02:08:06 PM Hi guys! It would be nice if u can better explain how token holder can earn income with the platform fees. I read in ur WP that u will distribute 50% of those fees.... but i can t find anywhere an example where is explicity said the amount of fees PAID BY PLAYERS for partecipate to a tournament. Is something like 1% of the torunament prize pool? Or is like 20%? I think the value of this percentage is crucial to the whole business... either for token owners but even more for the players! (Easy to say: the less fee i pay the more i want to play with that platform)    Players will pay 10% in fees to use the system as I understand it. Because 10% of the prize pool will be taken as fees, half used for operations and half to reward token holders with quarterly dividends.

What that threshold is where revenues turn to profit I am not sure. But the success of the token is directly tied to the success of the platform. 10% of all prize pools will be collected by the company as fees. Half that will go to the company for operations and the like. The other half will be distributed to token holders quarterly as a dividend. So since its percentage based, you earn more as the platform becomes more popular. Let me know if this doesn't answer your question and I can clarify anything.
