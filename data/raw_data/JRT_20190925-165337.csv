There will be basically no efficient market without a market maker. They are everywhere and work with everyone: in exchanges, in banks, in brokers etc.  The term market maker can have a bad meaning because a market maker can decide whether to hedge or not the position they have against a trader. Meaning that a market maker will win if the trader loses.  Since retail traders are mostly losing, it is very common for the market maker to only trade against the retail trader, knowing that in the long term they will more money than ever.  The more the market maker trade against a user, the less fees there are since they make money with the losses of thousands of traders. So if you want a low fee or no-fee broker, you go with a market maker.  The risk is that the market maker can lose money if all the traders start winning. It happen in 2017 when BTC started its rally, many market makers have almost bankrupted.  The less market maker trade against you, the more fees there are  Most of the time market maker has 2 books, book A and B, and a shady book C sometimes  All the orders in the A Book are hedged so the role of the MM is to make money on the spread by quoting the asset on several places, hoping to win with the difference. Orders in the B Book are internalized, so the MM trade literally against its client. C Book is highly illegal but some broker do it All the order there are replicated for the benefit of the MM.",False

We do hope that Sony will lend Venom to have a movie with the Deadpool and Venom  But to go back to Jarvis,  the story behind the name Jarvis is actually linked to Jarvis AI, yes  Before to fall into the blockchain space, Jarvis was a trading platform. We will tell you the whole story soon, it is worth to know it ! It was an afternoon, while we were developing the first prototype of Jarvis (by this time, a trading platform for Forex traders), we implemented a voice recognition feature within the application : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=The09nzQMEE.  After that, a team member suggested to call the software Jarvis. As some team members had just came back from Greece, and the name Jarvis sounded like a Greek name, we have all said : ""Oh yes ! Let's do this it sounds like a Greek hero"". We realized few days after that actually the developer proposed the name Jarvis in reference of J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man.   We have kept the name Jarvis, because we do see AI as the new UI. Asking Jarvis to ""open BTC H4 chart"", ""send 20 euros in BTC to @Bob"" or ""show ICO calendar"", is cooler than the usual navigation menu. Isn't it ?  AI can really change the way we do interact with software.",False

Because of the current state of the ICO we preferred to slow down the development to secure the company and adapt to our situation. We also slow down the development of the exchange (that cost 15 to 20k per month to develop. In this process we have lost our wallet/solidity developer and a our technical advisor. There is still 350 to 700 hours of work on the wallet as we are reversing our roadmap (we wanted to do the Dapp browser and semi-DEX at the end of the year but our current fundings and ICO results will not allow us to launch the centralized exchange in Q1) Still 700 to 1000 hours of work on the trading app (the trading app allow to trade on many brokers and exchanges through API, as well as to trade Fx and leveraged crypto from our wallet). Our own exchange UI (which is actually the same UI as the trading app, so    ---  What needs to be done We will discuss here about our Wallet, ou Trading app, the Exchange, the liquidity network and the partners.  1. Wallet The most important would be to be able to launch a MVP wallet with a dapp browser to start acquiring users, and start to integrate Celsius and Simplex or Mister Tango. But prior to that there is still a VERY IMPORTANT question that needs to be answered: do we keep a multi-currencies wallet or do we go for a smartcontract based wallet?  There are pros and cons.  Multi-currency Cons : keeping a multi-currencies wallet damages the user-experience: we currently do not have solutions for mainstream seed-phrase recovery and easy key management system, or seamless multi-login. Pros : we already have the design and a working wallet (ETH/ERC20 and BTC ) but it needs a big refresh on the UI side and to add features such as a Dapp browser, and support of ERC721.   Smart-contract Cons : we have to redo part of the design, and we will most likely not be able to reuse our previous codes. We also lose bitcoin support at least for the beginning. Also as the Parity wallet issues showed, smart-contract based wallets suffer from human mistakes. A lot of work a lot on the security aspect is expected. Pros : we can implement a user experience similar to a centralized app  and since we focus a lot on the mass adoption it is a big plus. It will enable easy key management and recovery system, universal login, gas-less transaction etc. Also it will ease our future development such as integration within our exchange, identity management etc..  In any case we want to keep the technology stack we worked with: React Native, Redux and TypeScript because we use Electron. It allows to have a single code, that works on iOS, Android, PC, Mac and Linux. We also want to implement gas-less transaction with proxy contract or meta-transaction and implement state channel and locking function for instant payment, off-chain transactions/trades with a single on-chain settlement etc.  Quote For this project we estimate that there is still a lot of work to be done, probably between 350 to 700 hours of work, so between $9,000 to $35,000 dollars depending on the hourly rate (we prefer to outsource). We are discussing now with 5 companies in France, Poland, Bulgaria, Vietnam and Sri Lanka. We will take a decision soon.  2. Trading app Then comes the second most important thing, our trading interface to be able to start acquiring traders (we already have 1200 users of the Fx trading platform). The app can connect to many brokers or centralized exchanges through API, including our own semi-decentralized exchange/broker.  A smart-contract or multi-sig wallet, or state channel, would be needed to lock users funds in order to gain a trading power to gain exposure to Forex, stocks, crypto etc. This will allow us to compete with any FX/CFDs brokers as well as with Okex and similar exchanges which provide non deliverable leveraged crypto.  Quote For this project there Still a LOT of work on the user interface, we estimate that it is still requiring between 700 to 1000 hours of work, so between $20,000 to $50,000 dollars.  3. Do we need to launch the exchange first? No… but let's be clear on how we see things. You need an exchange to… exchange assets… trading does not always meam the exchange of an asset. When you trade Forex, Futures, options, CFDs or even leveraged cryptocurrencies there is no asset exchanged between the trader and the counter-party. Why trader does use centralised exchange instead of decentralised one?  For the speed… actually when I do trade BTC or ETH, I use margin. Because I am not looking to own BTC or to sell mine, I am looking to gain exposure to the underlying movement. And so does most of the crypto trader… Launching first a trading app will then be more logical for us.  At launch we can rely on third party exchanges to create swap/exchange within the app instead or our own. Plus, an exchange is very pricy to run, and at the moment we do not have the funding capacity to run properly an exchange. So the roadmap will be changed.   4. Liquidity network We are in touch with some companies that can help us with the smartcontract to allow to trader leveraged crypto and FX from a DAI, USDC or many ERC20 tokens deposit. We are already working on the liquidity aspect with aggregators and traditionnal LP that accept cryptocurrenies for settlement. We found a huge crypto LP but unfortunately they aggregate order to have a 50 BTC volume on the top of the books, creating an average of 12 dollar spread… we are negociating to lower their top of the book aggregation to have decent spread, not more than a dollar. If they are agree we can offer a 20x crypto leverage + a 100x leverage on Fx. We also are discussing with a LP that can lend us money for the deposit, from 10 to 50% of interest rate per year (payable daily). Quote This project mainly requires time and some setup fees amounting $20,000 dollars, and deposit. A $500k to $1M deposit would be the best fit. It will also require some dozens of hours of work.  5. Partners Then finally come the integration of partners solutions such as Celsius, Simplex, Nexo, Shapeshift, Daneel, etc.  Quote They all require time + dev + setup fees as ex for Simplex. We estimate around 150 to 200 hours of work to integrate Celsius as we need to do a lot of UI work, 90 hours for Shapeshift, Faa.st or Uniswap, and few hours to integrate Daneel. So around 500 hours of work for all of them, amounting between $12,500 to $25,000. Setup fees are expected to cost $20,000.  ---  These things are the most important aspect of Jarvis on the short term prior to engage more money to finish our own exchange, payment gateway or card solution (for this we would need around $200k of setup fees and $50k of development, as well as around $300k a year of operational cost) etc.  What I described before will allow us to have a go-to-market strategy, and start getting users and earn revenues. I have 21k French Forex traders community that is only waiting for the trading interface from where they can trade Fx from their wallet, or using their current brokers.  So we would need roughly 30 to 85 000 dolalrs for dev, so from 50 to 100 000 to add some margin and 500k dollars for liquidity. These numbers does not take into account the operational costs of running these applications. But we do estimate at 20 to 30k euros per months for the strict minimum.",False

When I meant MM I meant LP, not these cheap bot faking volume  MM here are basically prime brokers. Jarvis needs to hold an account within them to get some leverage (from 5 to 100 depending on the markets) to be able to provide it to users. I do not speak about the exchange, but the broker side : user set funds into an escrow or state channel, it triggers a loan within our deposit in the LP, and they can trade leverage products, non delivrables. So you can trade Forex, CFDs, stocks, commodities and crypto by locking your assets.  In order to make this deposit you need money, and many companies are willing to loan you money.  But the real game changer would be a multi-sig wallet where the LP has one of the key (we wouldn't need to have a deposit within them then) or a state channel between the user and the LP. But LP are still not ready for that    For the exchange (delivrable) we will work with order books aggregators services which aggregates liquidity of other exchanges.

Too many projects that exist and do their work and that are full of pseudo here bring FUD. Brings criticism into the void just to hurt companies' reputations. I find that this forum is very badly managed by the administrators. It's a shame because it scares people away! And, here is not a reference for exposing an ICO. In my opinion.  When a company is late on its roadmap, it receives a lot of FUD here. As long as they don't always give follow-up information here, because the rest is followed by telegram, there are certainly nicknames that will say anything and hurt the forum. This has happened many times on other projects that exist and that many come to put their bad language. I'm sure Jarvis will not escape this problem on this forum.

In the meantime, how we will be different (1) and how we will attract traders (2) ?    1) Different  Exchanges focus on how to make money, how to be more scalable, how to increase liquidity and increase margin, and how to attract traders by having less fees or more products, or how to be more regulated, or secure. Honestly, I do like Bittrex, Kraken or Binance, but what are their value proposition ? To be able to exchanges crypto and tokens, with some advanced orders or leverage (Kraken).  While we will also focus on these aspects, it is not our value proposition. We want to be different and to provide a whole user experience. Not only the UI/UX of the platform, but the experience, the feelings, Jarvis can provide.  Imagine you have a wallet. And from this wallet, you can access to Forex trading, crypto exchange, stocks investment. From your wallet. It is a plug-n-play wallet, how cool is that ? When you are done with your trading, you can plug this wallet to the payment gateway, and go spend your asset in the real world. You can spend with debit or with credit... If you want to explore the immense possibilities of Dapps, you plug then your wallet to Multi-token or Totle, OpenSea or ETHLend. And what about some decentralized betting or poker game ?  Imagine alos that you have BTC, and you want to convert it to AAPL. Such interoperability is not provided by classical exchanges.  And imagine now that you do all of that, withount any BUTTON, no navigation bar... because you have JARVIS, an AI who is here to help you access whatever you want. Just write it or say it. You want to trade Fx ? Just write EURUSD H4 and JArvis will bring you to a EURUSD H4 chart. You want to send money to your relatives? Just write ""20 eur btc"" and JARVIS will understand it has to open the sending screen, loaded with 20 euros in bitcoin to be sent.  Imagine now that, since with Jarvis you trade, invest, pay, discuss, access Dapps, you create a HUGE amount of data. Imagine now that you own this data, and you can make any use of it. What about asking Jarvis AI to analyse it to provide you an even better experience. Or opportunities ? Or correct your way of trading ? Or what if you just decide to sell your data ? Or even better... to collateralize it and make a credit on the top of it...  And I even do not mention how our trading platform is different from the others...    2) User acquisition  Of course we will do referral. Of course we will have bounty. Of course we will organize some discount fees campaign. Like everyone does. Of course we will advertise our unique value proposition. I bet that if you trade on a FX broker, and you see Jarvis, you will dump your broker immediately.  But more than that, we will acquire users thanks to our partners; through our Reward Token (which is designed to reward Influencers, Partners, Affiliates, etc.); through education also! Education is embeded in our UI, but also in our genes! Through gamification; through standalone products (the trading platform can be detached from our exchange and be connected to other broker and other exchanges, so people can know us from that); but mainly through developers! The platform is developer friendly, allowing any developers to program in any language.",False

Listing a token without product and without traction is basically throwing away the value of the toke; hence we will list the token only on our exchange, and few month after our products are live.  > then, buying the token during the ICO gives way more advantages: it gives you a special status, so you get more revenue, more commissions, as example, at the moment we plan on giving back 25% of our revenue to token holders : 20% to every token holders, 4% only share among ICO participants and 1% shared only between private sale participant (202 persons will basically share 1% of the revenue).

The DAO members are token holders.  Important to know : these 85 000 000 tokens will allow the SAO and the funds to receive revenue as well; so they will both receive an important part of the dollar shared every month; they will use these dollars to buy back tokens from the markets, to refill the fund, and sometimes can use it to pay in cash the winner of contests.  The first vote of the DAO will be how much token to be allocated everymonth for the ongoing bounty/contests. As example they can decided that 500 000 tokens per month, for 5 years, will be distributed, and how many bounty/contests per month (as example 10, so each bounty/contest would have a 50 000 tokens allocation).  Then everymonth, the winners are rewarded. Winners could be: - the user who have invited the largest number of new users in Jarvis - the developer whose add-in has been the most used/dowloaded/bought in Jarvis - the influencer who has gain the largest amount of follower, or who has received the largest amount of tip (in Jarvis trading platform, you can tip people) - the partner who has made us earned the most (as example, by integrating a DEX, user of the DEX could withdraw in cash through Jarvis fiat gateway, generating revenue for us) - the trader with the best result of the month - the user who has helped other users the most in the forum (it can be calculated by ""this post was useful"" - etc.  And for bounty, it will be an ongoing one so as example : register in our exchange (+x tokens), download the app (+x tokens), take few trades (+x tokens), share our content on social media, etc.   The difference between the DAO and the strategic fund managed by the company, is that the company will mainly use the tokens for incentivizing partners, and communities to join Jarvis, while the DAO iwll mainly focus on individuals.",False

But it is a good idea, I can work on that next week.  - From what we can say, regarding value proposition : IDAP proposes various asset, so does Jarvis. They also deliver derivatives, and free trading. - Spotcoin shares its revenues with token holder, so does Jarvis. - EMX is like IDAP, but with trading fees and less derivatives (only futures).   Jarvis has a different value proposition: access to the same markets to these exchanges, but also to Dapps, and the interoperability between assets; so you can trade Apple from bitcoin, or Oil for gold. Assets within Jarvis can be utilized as a medium of payment, as a collateral or can be lent. User can create their whole ecosystem around the exchange, it is not another exchange.  Jarvis value proposition is about experience, not about creating another exchange with more products. Plus, from a UI point of view, we do not use TradingView like all the others, but our own charting library; the UI features will allow any developer to create a plug-in on the top of the platform (we are very developer orientated), will enable to monetize content, analysis, so it will be perfect for influencer and trading communities.  Trading communities are important for us, as we are leading one in France (19k+ Fx traders), and our ambassadors as well in Spain or Germany. This will give us a very good exposure in the Fx industry, so easier for us to acquire Fx trader. We are developing tools for these communities, to manage them in an easier way directly from the platform. As example we have developed a tool to send an analysis from a platform to another platform; so people selling their analysis, or trading plan, can use this feature to replace email as example. This alongside with others features (such as mouse trading) drive a lot user acquisition.  But anyway, there is room for several broker and exchanges, and at the end, only being user-centric matters to drive users acquisition; since our business model do not rely on fees, but on communities, we can also easily adapt to the competition by droppinf our fees near 0 if needed one day to increase user acquisition.",False

We do rely a lot of private sale contribution and fiat contribution to compensate the market behaviour. And if the ICO is not a success, it means there will be less token; so less token = more revenue per token, and a bigger room for increasing its valuation. So it will not be a very bad news for our token holder as example.   Then regarding the project : crypto are going down (and for me it is good, it was insane the level of valuation of 99% of the crypto/tokens) but if you notice, volume doesn't get lower. They are quite stable. And they will increase.  You have to notice that a bubble market is not safe, is not normal. It is made by holder, not by traders, so if you do participate in an exchange and the token derive value from the usage of the exchange, you might prefer if the volume increase; if crypto become more stable, at lower price, this could increase the exchange/trading volumes so it is actually very good for exchanges.

It is true that utility token is to incentivize (usually) the people handling the network, but the team has not interest as if they are a normal company, they will do revenue in another way. This is what happens with Ripple. The team/company does not care what can happen to XRP. Because they make money without using this crypto.  We can discuss a long time to find other problems: the fact that there was a bubble was also a problem! Raising millions with a basic website was easy. Also, utility were listed months, if no years before any product to be delivered, so it is basically only a speculative market. Listing a utility token ONLY when a product is live, and the token is used within it, would have been better for ICO and for the market.  As you said, the problem with STO is the ROI... you can forget about x1000.  Therefore, maybe the truth is in the middle : to always have two tokens, one for staking/dividend, and one for utility. There is a VERY interesting one, one of our advisors work on. http://wetonomy.com/ and the concept of debt token is very promising to me. An interesting mix could be : you could sell an utility token (to pay fees); for each utility token bought, you send as well 7, 10 or 20 times more ""debt token"". You buy back debt token with your profit so contributors receive somehow a dividend until they run out of token, and they still have a utility token.",False

Would they be sold with the intention to increase in value, they were at risk of being deemed securities. And securities come with regulatory oversight and cannot be sold on unregistered exchanges. Additionally in contrast to shares utility tokens do not grant any rights other than access to the product. So you understand why being labeled a security or equity was to be avoided. Even though the teams could sell their unsold tokens on the secondary market, that would just be a bonus. The focus was to raise as much capital as possible before the regulatory ban hammer came down while pretending to be productive. Obviously raising money riding the hype was much easier than actually building a product that could give the utility tokens any value.  Security tokens grant right to dividends, however I am not sure they give a significantly bigger guarantee to ROI compared ICOs. Why? Security tokens still do not grant any voting rights nor any rights to company assets. Therefore security token teams still do not have to have any responsibility as the relation with their investors harbors no threat, liability or urgency. We can only hope the dividends increase the incentive a little bit for the teams to build some value for security tokens.",False

Most of the brokers, as you might know, are here to take your money; most of them have bad practice, and I even do not count the number of scams there. I see it everyday! Even from ""big worldwide brokers"". Actually, a lot of brokers, who made a lot of money by scamming people with binary options, are now making ICO to take even more money, and then make an exchange, to take even more money  So when I see a broker making an exchange, for me it is most of the time a RED FLAG.  Also, most of the brokers do not care about customer; they do everthing they could to attract beginners, and make them deposit the largest amount possible. They do not try to be user friendly or to help too much their custimer, because they make more money on their losses that on the trading fees. So these brokers has proposed very bad trading platform for a while, they are not user-centric, and they are not here to change ""the world"" or to deliver value to end-users.  This is what is different with us. Check the work of Cyril Tabet; he was the first one to implement a new strategy: user-centric, transparency, and only a trading-fee based business model. JFD brokers was an earthquake in the brokerage industry. Their value proposition was: lowest fees, better exectution ever, absolute transparency (you can see what happened to your orders, who was the counterparty). This is how they became in 5 years, in the top 10 brokers worldwide! Cyril has fought all his carreer the bad practices of brokers, and became famous in the industry for that.  Check as well the work of Pascal Tallarida: he launched 7 years ago a trading school; it was the first trading school that show publicly the results of the students! And which was backing the best students with real funds! He did the first trading school with unlimited coaching, because he cared about his customer, and wanted to deliver a tailored solution for each of them. He also became famous because he was giving his knowledge for free on his Youtube channel, and had a very franky way of speaking; he is known to make fun of any trading theory, or pattern, as his trading is only based on logic and statistics, and simple support and resistance; people were not buying his lesson as they were for free on the Internet, but were only buying his time to be coached. He then started designing trading platform, with the hundreds of feedbacks he got from the people he trained. He invented new concepts such as ""the mouse trading"".

Another solution is the mirroring; you are mirroring real position taken on the market; so actually when you buy stocks using Jarvis, you are taking a position on the market, and this position is mirrored in your wallet.  For that, you only need a brokerage license.  And you have access to a larger liquidity since you connect to the market.  As the position is mirrored, it becomes a digital asset (the position, not the stock); but for the end user it is the same: they hold the digital image of the stock, or of the gold, or of any contract.

But let me tell you something. Our project started with ""Jarvis Trader' (you can google it). It is a platform made with the heart! With passion! With features that are really helping traders; and with my partners, we have wondered for years: WHY brokers, or others platforms, didn't think about what we have done? We have just created useful tool (a concept named mouse trading), so with their money, why they didn't do it before? Well, the answer is that: they do not care about it, they are not using their own product!  If the Coinbase founders, or management team, were coming from the trading world, if they would have faced what we are facing, they would have probably set adding stocks as a priority.  But Coinbase is not for that: they aim to be the leading entry point in the crypto space, and to acquire market shares there; this is why they launched Paradax or Toshi wallet. And more recently their own stablecoin.   And I think this is our strengh: we are passionate, and we are the users of our own products. And, I personnaly spent he last 7 years, teaching everyday to thousands of traders; so I do know perfectly what matters for them, what they want, what they need.   And then, to conclude, it is not because it is doable that everybody will do it: you should see that there is market for that; or it has to match your value proposition; the value proposition of Jarvis is to give freedom, by being able to access any resources. To compete siloed centralized ecosystem, with an open world. That is not the value proposition of other exchanges.",False

The entire premise of the semi-decentralized structure of Jarvis is to essentially make it so that there is nothing to hack at Jarvis because all funds will be held either directly by the client or will be securely encrypted and locked in escrow.  If there was some type of attack such as DDoS or otherwise then there are very robust architectural components and underlying structures which make is very all systems to automatically change parameters and re-allocate resources such that any single component that is being ""attacked"" will not impact the rest of the system and will the required functions that this specific component is providing will be automatically replicated separately with a preemptive rule which prevents people the same attack from happening on that resource.  There are several top solutions which we will be using along with internal monitoring and both internal and external auditing on a wide range of components.    For any parts of the more centralized systems which can be audited there will be ongoing audits performed by external partners who will conduct such audits every 30 minutes and publish all results in a blockchain such as Ethereum.  So between the various companies we are working with for exchange security and the design of the system and the various safety protocols there will be an extremely high level of security when using Jarvis compared to most other available solutions.

There are other benefits in addition to these.  Regarding the many exchanges popping out, yes you are correct.  We see that as a great thing for many reasons.

We use the right technology to deliver the right result. Decentralized one are used to facilitate interoperability, security of funds, anonimity, trust, tracability. But some of the key components are centralized in order to have a level of performance needed to handle millions of users and huge amount of trades per second.  And, from an idealistic viewpoint, there are actually very few fully decentralized exchange; it would mean for the order book/matching engine to be on-chain, would mean that the whole code should be open source, that no-one owns the exchange, no support team, etc.   Regarding the cross-chain and cross-asset exchange, yes this is super useful as it increase the user experience overall.

The experience it provides ! You can trade crypto, token, stocks, Forex, commodities, from your wallet, by making any deposit (fiat or crypto). You can access to DAPPs. You can freely exchange any asset for any asset (cross-chain and cross-asset class). You can use your asset to collateralize them. You can lend them. It gives freedom of action.  Not to mention the user interface, which will be drastically different from what you have seen before.    Here are a previous answers for this question :  Quote Honestly, we do not want to compete Binance or Kucoin, we want to fill the gap they are leaving : user experience. Today, exchanges or decentralized applications are not designed to be used by everyone; and if we do want to compete with centralized Fintech which are capturing a lot of value (Robinhood, Revolut, etc.) we need to design product, we need to design experience, and deliver features that these applications can't propose.   To reply quickly, there are some differences between Binance/Kucoin and us (we do like also to be compared with KyberNetwork and 0x, that we aim to work with):  You can decide to trade either in a centralized, or decentralized way with Jarvis; users have the choice. You can trade cryptocurrencies and tokens with leverage, and you can also trade Forex, Stocks and other traditional products; in the future we intend to partner with several tokenized asset projects to list their products. By offering this, we can target a large audience of traders. The network of liquidity pools will enable instant cross-asset classes exchange and interoperability between all assets. This will provide a lot of use cases. Our user experience and interface are very different. I know it is what most of exchanges highlight (most secure, most user-friendly etc.) but in our case UX and UI are a religion. The whole project is designed with this obsession. Soon we will publish two videos that will showcase the user experience of the trading interface.   By the way, we are so proud of our UX/UI, that we have decided to allow our trading platform to be connected to other exchanges. You will be able to trade on Binance and other exchanges, using the Jarvis interface. This will help us to drive our user acquisition and also to increase our brand awareness.    Here are the 6 facts highlighted :  Quote The Jarvis Reward Token (JRT) rewards the token holders with a percentage of  the exchange revenue. 20% of revenues are shared among every token holder and an additional 5% among the original TGE participants.   The Jarvis Exchange can be switched from centralized to semi-decentralized mode. In both modes its off-chain matching engine is capable of 5M tx/s.   Through a network of interoperable liquidity pools, both exchanges provide cross-chain and cross-asset exchange and multi-asset trading. It allows Forex, stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies and tokens trading with or without leverage.   Within Jarvis, users assets can be managed in a centralized or decentralized way. They can be utilized as a medium of exchange or of payment, as collateral for a loan or lent to a liquidity pool.   The user interface has been designed to provide the most innovative user experience and is entirely part of our branding. The interface is enhanced by Jarvis, an AI with conversational skills and ability to perform tasks that simplify operation  The founders and ambassadors of Jarvis are followed by large traditional traders communities. These communities have been supporting the project since the begining. They were the first who tested the prototypes, gave feedbacks, and participated in a successfull private sale (over 1 million dollars).",False

With FX either the  broker or the prime broker has an account with a liquidity provider, which provides the Forex liquidity. When you deposit money into the broker account, the most brokers will take some  funds and  put them in a centralized USD pool, and the broker will open a mirrored trading account in USD in your trading platform (let say, it is MT4). So the money you see in MT4 is the mirror of the money you have deposited in the banking account of the broker. When you take a trade, you make a loan within the liquidity of the broker. You trade with their money, and a leverage.  So Jarvis does the same : we open an account within a Forex Liquidity provider (not a broker). As example, 1 million USD deposit. But instead of depositing money in a banking account, you deposit it in your wallet.  From your wallet, either you have fiat (let say 10 000 USD) or you have another asset (let's assume few Bitcoins). When you trade FX, we will lock your money (either the 10k USD or the BTC you have) into an escrow. Then, a loan is triggered in the liquidity pool connected to the Forex liquidity provider. You can now trade Fx without a broker, directly from your wallet.  I hope it answers your question  There is a drawing on the whitepaper, by the way, to explain a bit how things are structured.",False

Mind that the company will manage a pool of 50M tokens and the DAO will manage a pool of 30M. These pools will be used to drive user acquisition and will then replace the need of conducting a classical marketing campaign. To drive user acquisition, there will be some ongoing bounty campaign / contest such as : the 10 users who have brought the most of new users through their referral link; these 10 users will share the monthly prize pool; or it could be the 10 developers whose add-on are the most downloaded this month.  Having these contests / ongoing bounty campaigns will incentivize these developers, or these users to commit even more, because they will become stakeholder and receive more revenus per token if the ecosystem keep growing, or just more revenue by growing their token stacks.   2. As the pools have 50M and 30M tokens (12% and  7% of all the tokens) they will also receive, like any token holders, a part of the revenue. In that case it will be 12% and 7% of the 20%. These revenues can be used for classical marketing campaign or can be used to buy back tokens from exchanges, to refill the pools, until the moment these pools will definitely be empty. So as you see there is some virtue circle.   3. An exchange does not need millions per month to be run efficiently. Even by giving away 40 or 60% of an exchange revenue, you might end up to be still profitable. This is why people are very interested to buy tokens distributing the exchanges revenues. Exchanges are the most valuable piece in this ecosystem. They can generate a lot of revenue.",False

So first, how to switch from the modes : by the mean of a button. When you switch, your available funds are moved automatically from the centralized exchange to the semi-decentralized one (so from the exchange wallet to the user’s wallet). Users can select some of or all their assets to be moved. It is important to note that to move funds from the semi-decentralized exchange to the centralized one require to have an account within the centralized exchange.  So if you intend to make a lot of short term trades a morning on the BTC/USD pair, you can move only your BTC to the centralized exchange, trade several time, buy, sell, buy again etc. (since you have instant settlement in the centralized exchange) and then move back your fund to the semi-decentralized exchange when you are done. Please note that this use case will be also available in the semi-decentralized exchange (many trades without settlement, and only one final on-chain settlement) but not soon.   2. Then why semi and not fully decentralized ? To enable the best user experience as possible. The matching engine and some components of the exchange are off-chain. The funds are held within the users wallet, and the settlement is on-chain. So you can have a very scalable and performant matching engine, you can place complex orders, with no fees, while keeping your assets secure.  Our positioning is that decentralized technologies, including Blockchain, should be used where they bring a real value to end-users; if we use these technologies it has to provide a better user experience and give more value than a centralized technologies/applications without any sacrifice or compromise so it can be mass adopted. As example, decentralized technologies are better than centralized one when it is about storing, exchange and traceability of assets and data. But for some tasks, like calculating, analyzing etc. they should be done off-chain.  In the future, side chains and some Blockchain will maybe be scalable enough to compete with solutions such as Azure or AWS but at the moment it is better to use off-chain component, hence the semi-decentralized. You have all the advantages of decentralization (including privacy, no account needed) with the advantages of centralization.   Note 1 : you can pass your KYC on the semi-decentralized exchange to access to Forex trading as example.  Note 2 : our off-chain components are decentralized and distributed to guarantee the best performance; extract of the white paper : Quote Other aspects have been designed to further support a network load of tens of millions of simultaneous users. This includes but is not limited to having a decentralized load resource structure where user specific information is stored both by the user on their device as well as on encrypted servers which are distributed around the world with commercially available solutions including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, as well as decentralized storage solutions. With this distributed and decentralized structure, historical data can easily be made available to the users from “Geo-Local” servers. If the ultimate level of privacy is desired, users can set their data settings to only be stored on and accessed from their own devices.",False

With Jarvis the target audience and scope of services is different.  Currently there are millions of people around the world who trade traditional financial products such as FX, CFD's, and more,  they would like to become more involved in the crypto market but in general the user interfaces and trading experience with most crypto exchanges is just not very good.  Our target audience and user base is not just the existing crypto community but more the non-crypto community who are trading other products or not trading at all.  We are already seeing that exchange fees in crypto are following what happened in the FX market are becoming more competitive and will eventually go to zero.  Jarvis is focusing on the delivery of a wide range of solutions which benefit from the interface and will be capable of generating revenue from a wide range of products and services outside of exchange fee's.  So as time goes on and more integrations and solutions are included with Jarvis and the community grows the revenue will grow even if our exchange fee's go to zero.  This is far more sustainable and beneficial for the community and long term success of the token than just exchange fees.  One example of a different type of revenue stream in Jarvis.  There is a trading community which likes to share charts and information between traders.  The lead trader provides many services for free but can also provide additional paid services for a small fee such as $25 a month per client.  Jarvis makes it super easy to share charts and information with specific clients and also helps to facilitate the automated collection and payment of this fee from the client.  In exchange for helping this trader up-sell their products and services Jarvis collects a small fee just like if the company used an external company like paypal or other online subscription solution.  This is a win for the client, the trader, and Jarvis.   With thousands of such traders and services the revenue from this type of interaction will quickly surpass what is made from the exchange.

So the first idea is to provide users with the choice. The choice between centralization and decentralization. Both mode are accessible through the same user interface, with almost the same user experience. But in decentralized mode, you can trade without account, in full anonymity and of course you remain in control of your keys.  Let say that if you are a normal trader, who will not make trade on high frequency (like several buy/sell during the same hours, like short term trader do) you will chose the centralized exchange, since settlement is instant. If speed of settlement is not a priority for you then the semi-decentralized will be ok.  Another reason why we have the two exchanges, is to deliver a very smooth path to decentralization. We want to onboard millions of mainstream, who will probably chose the centralized solutions as they will not want to deal with their private keys, and we will be able to convert them slowly to the decentralization.",False

I am excited to introduce you to Jarvis. Your personal financial hub!  Jarvis has been designed to give as much freedom as possible to the users by making it easy to access existing centralized and new decentralized technologies from the same interface.  Think of Jarvis like a wallet where all assets are securely stored and interoperable. You can connect this wallet to a wide range of native or external ""apps"" like trading or payment gateways with just one click so you can immediately trade on any financial market, or pay in fiat using any assets you hold, including your stocks. Think of it like a ""plug-and-play"" wallet that you can use to create your own financial hub.  From Jarvis you can pay. You can trade. You can invest. You can borrow. You can lend. You could even play poker, or bet on a sport match through partners Dapps. All of this, from the convenience of your wallet. It is like having one account from where you can seamlessly access Robinhood, Revolut, Acorns, Zopa, Coinbase, Binance, FXCM, Betclick etc...  And now imagine how cool would it be to simply communicate with this wallet to navigate easily among the ocean of possibilities it enables. Because this wallet is equipped with smart AI, you can reach any feature, any data, anything, by just writing or saying it. This is what we are doing! We want to change the way you trade, invest, pay, and the way you manage your finances.                    TECHNOLOGY FRAMEWORK ___________                                                                                                                                                                                                        Jarvis is a financial ecosystem built on the Jarvis Technology Framework.  The framework includes : licensed centralized and semi-decentralized exchanges and broker; a web3 wallet advanced escrow type functions; a network of liquidity pools which aggregates the liquidity of several centralized and decentralized liquidity providers and protocols.  The framework allows : to choose to manage one's assets in a centralized or decentralized way; access multiple Dapps; instant cross-chain and cross-asset class exchanges; multiple off-chain trades with only one on-chain settlement to trade leveraged products; users to access any financial market; the utilization of any asset as a medium of exchange, or of payment, as  collateral for a loan or margin trading, or to contribute to a liquidity pool; the automation of every process needed for exchange, transfer, trading, loan and payments so that users can easily derive value from the underlying technology.          Network of liquidity pools Aggregating exchanges, brokers, market makers and users multi-asset liquidity. Interoperability Allowing instant cross-chain and cross-asset class exchanges. Fiat and payment gateway An interoperable payment network that can use any asset to pay in fiat. Escrow functions For collateral credit, instant trading and transfer, lending and margin trading.     Centralized and decentralized Users can chose how to manage their funds and assets. Infinitely scalable Off-chain matching engine that can handle millions of transactions per second. Secure by design Users retain control of their private keys and can use cold storage solutions. Open API Enables interoperable liquidity to  both centralized and decentralized applications.                 INTUITIVE AND POWERFUL ___________  How we intend to deliver decentralized technologies to mainstream users.  We have designed user interfaces that improve the user experience for everyone.  These interfaces embed a conversational AI to provide a new way to interact with software. The AI can prevent mistakes, help automate tasks or ease navigation within the applications. If a user would like to open a EURUSD chart, open their Bitcoin wallet, or get the price of Amazon shares, they can just write or say it.  Through these interfaces, users can manage their assets, use various Dapps, trade, invest, share and discuss, etc.  The mobile, desktop and web app integrate a web3 browser to launch Dapps. While the mobile app has a focus on payment and asset management, the desktop and the web one focus on trading.                                A trading platform to replace your broker and exchange apps. The fully customizable web/desktop application gives access to any financial markets from users wallets with innovative trading, analytics and social tools.  The platform provides stop loss order, margin trading, OTC, paper trading, algo-trading in any language, our innovative ""mouse-trading"" feature, a social network, etc.                               A wallet interface to replace Fintech apps The mobile application puts users finances at their fingertips and enables quick deposits, exchanges, transfers or payments.  The application allows to pay in fiat using a Crypto debit card or directly the Smartphone (NFC) with any asset, to rebalance users portfolio allocation in one click, etc.                  TWO TOKENS ___________   Jarvis Reward Token (JRT)                               Once the stable coin is released, Jarvis will reward contributors, users and partners by redistributing the generated income of the Jarvis Ecosystem on a monthly basis.

The team is very diverse but united around the same idea: delivering the value of decentralization to everyone.  Jarvis is born after the meeting of Pascal and Cyril. Cyril has occupied C-Level position at Alpari, Interbank Fx or more recently at JFD, leading them to be ranked in the worldwide top 10. During his successful career, this visionary who set up a precedent in the brokerage industry at the head of JFD's, became passionate about technologies that can disrupt industries. Pascal is a senior Forex trader and entrepreneur who founded DMTrading, a community of 21K French traders. He coached thousands of traders and launched a trading platform, Jarvis Trader, to ease trading, analysis, and sharing. It was on this occasion that he met Cyril, who convinced him to start looking at crypto and Blockchain and to embrace it. They co-founded Jarvis.

With Jarvis we want to ensure that the trading experience is the very best.  The user interface, the interoperability of assets, and more.  Having very good fee’s is a part of this approach but Jarvis delivers much more and shines in other areas beyond just competitive fees.   We know that over time as things become more decentralized the fees in many places will go to Zero and so the important aspect of Jarvis is that our business model is not dependent only on exchange fees. The whole industry will follow a low fee practice to keep or gain some market shares, we will drop our fees to remain competitive but we will keep and gain market shares by being focus on more valuable value proposition.  As for the Jarvis Reward Token, it has another utility that paying fees. We value a lot sharing the ecosystem revenue as we think it is a virtue circle. The token is designed to incentivize token holder to bring more and more value : the more value the ecosystem generate, the more revenue token holder receive. So the JRT will be used for that.  In addition, it will allow any token holder to participate in the Jarvis DAO.",False

Exchanges are the most valuable piece of any financial ecosystem.   Honestly, we do not want to compete Binance or Kucoin, we want to fill the gap they are leaving : user experience. Today, exchanges or decentralized applications are not designed to be used by everyone; and if we do want to compete with centralized Fintech which are capturing a lot of value (Robinhood, Revolut, etc.) we need to design product, we need to design experience, and deliver features that these applications can't propose.   To reply quickly, there are some differences between Binance/Kucoin and us (we do like also to be compared with KyberNetwork and 0x, that we aim to work with):  You can decide to trade either in a centralized, or decentralized way with Jarvis; users have the choice. You can trade cryptocurrencies and tokens with leverage, and you can also trade Forex, Stocks and other traditional products; in the future we intend to partner with several tokenized asset projects to list their products. By offering this, we can target a large audience of traders. The network of liquidity pools will enable instant cross-asset classes exchange and interoperability between all assets. This will provide a lot of use cases. Our user experience and interface are very different. I know it is what most of exchanges highlight (most secure, most user-friendly etc.) but in our case UX and UI are a religion. The whole project is designed with this obsession. Soon we will publish two videos that will showcase the user experience of the trading interface.   By the way, we are so proud of our UX/UI, that we have decided to allow our trading platform to be connected to other exchanges. You will be able to trade on Binance and other exchanges, using the Jarvis interface. This will help us to drive our user acquisition and also to increase our brand awareness.   Moreover, we will leverage a lot from our communities and network (you can check the bio of our founders) and an unique user acquisition strategy.   And anyway, the market is big enough (and still growing) to be shared. And we do know that we have our place in this changing digital world.   We do not do another exchange. We do create a new experience.",False

We do hope that Sony will lend Venom to have a movie with the Deadpool and Venom  But to go back to Jarvis,  the story behind the name Jarvis is actually linked to Jarvis AI, yes  Before to fall into the blockchain space, Jarvis was a trading platform. We will tell you the whole story soon, it is worth to know it ! It was an afternoon, while we were developing the first prototype of Jarvis (by this time, a trading platform for Forex traders), we implemented a voice recognition feature within the application : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=The09nzQMEE.  After that, a team member suggested to call the software Jarvis. As some team members had just came back from Greece, and the name Jarvis sounded like a Greek name, we have all said : ""Oh yes ! Let's do this it sounds like a Greek hero"". We realized few days after that actually the developer proposed the name Jarvis in reference of J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man.   We have kept the name Jarvis, because we do see AI as the new UI. Asking Jarvis to ""open BTC H4 chart"", ""send 20 euros in BTC to @Bob"" or ""show ICO calendar"", is cooler than the usual navigation menu. Isn't it ?  AI can really change the way we do interact with software.",False
