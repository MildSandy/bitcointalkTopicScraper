Zeex has no competition in the direct crypto to product model.  With regards to indirect competition, TenX and similar companies use a friction-heavy model that requires conversion to fiat currency, and charges users considerable fees. The Zeex protocol allows users to convert crypto directly to products and services with no fiat and no fees by exchanging cryptocurrency directly for gift cards.  In addition, Zeex has the advantage of existing backing and networks, and are therefore ready to roll on day one.  Finally, Zeex is also completely decentralised, allowing for anonymity and privacy.

The unscrupulous behaviour in question in generally double spending.  If you're using Ethereum, the period in which a transaction is reversible is about 10 minutes (6 confirmations).  After that it's impossible to recover funds, so the Zeex protocol holds a deposit or stake for the duration of the risk period (10 minutes with ETH, about an hour with BTC) equal to the risked amount.  For example, if you want to buy $100 of Amazon credit, you would need to deposit $100 in ZIX and then pay $100 in ZIX or ETH.  After 10 minutes, your deposit is usable again for whatever you'd like.  If you don't want to or can't stake a large amount but need to make a large purchase, you can do so in sequential transactions.  Say you want to buy $1000 of Amazon credit but you've only got $1100.  Simply tell the system to buy the credit sequentially, and in about an hour and a half you'll have your $1000 in Amazon and $100 ZIX deposit back!  The thing is, because the transaction amount is always equal to the pledged amount, it's simply not profitable to double spend anything, it would just even out really. ",False

The ZIX token serves several important purposes, without which our protocol could not function:    - ZIX acts as a login to the system, allowing users to buy and sell corporate currencies (gift cards).    - ZIX can of course be used as a payment, but it can also be used to reserve various amounts of high demand corporate currencies, so you can be sure that you get some of it. For example, if there's an awesome discount like 20% off Amazon gift cards, you might wanna reserve that! The more ZIX you own, the more priority you get for these high demand offers.  - ZIX also acts as a deposit within the smart contract to prevent fraud or double spending.

Even in the face of public scrutiny, an initially poor reputation and severe volatility, cryptocurrency, the most popular use case for blockchain tech, remains a prized emerging phenomenon. This is partially a result of the unparalleled security that blockchain technology brings to transactions.  Distributed ledger technology provides a complete public record of all transactions, something that prevents lost funds and fraudulent transfers. Fiat currency does not provide this assurance, often at considerable cost to users. Even when used digitally, there is no public reference available to determine where money went – allowing many vectors for theft.

On the other, it frees corporate currency from its ties to individual holders, making it as easy to transfer between holders as cryptocurrency with the same safety and transparency. The Zeex platform includes an elegant frontend, a blockchain-based and fully transparent backend, and a digital wallet to effortlessly store and manage all the user’s tradable units. The frontend provides the user clear and intuitive access to the broad catalogue of corporate currencies from top brands, the cryptocurrency units they have available to spend, and their ZIX tokens, which hinge the two types of currency together and allow users to pivot smoothly and easily from one to the other. Zeex allows users to buy and sell their corporate currency and — finally — to spend their cryptocurrency  so it actually means that it's going from one kind of currency to another.",False

I'm sure there are many crypto-enthusiasts such as yourself that are wondering the same thing. The first thing you do as a user is open the app, select which corporate currency you want to buy and then pay instantly with ZIX or another cryptocurrency. Behind the scenes, the ZIX tokens are held in escrow (briefly) in order to confer benefits like priority and discounts, and the transactions occur within our smart contracts. Once the transaction happens (you won’t even notice a lag time in the app!) you’ll just see that it has been confirmed and then receive the code for your corporate currency immediately, which you can spend right away on whatever you want. You can even do this inside the store! Say you’re in Sainsbury’s buying groceries and want to pay with Ether. While you’re in line waiting for all the ordinary folks to pay with fiat currency, hop on the app and in 3 taps the cashier can scan your phone and you’re out the door.  Hope this helps ",False
