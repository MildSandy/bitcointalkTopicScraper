CanYa is going to be decentralized fully in future according to their roadmap. If you will pay with fiat you will have more fees to pay. That's why CanYaCoin will become valuable in future.  Quote from: slavonicpl on December 18, 2017, 08:32:28 AM Quote from: hollybit on December 18, 2017, 08:14:09 AM Quote from: slavonicpl on December 18, 2017, 07:58:01 AM Quote from: hollybit on December 18, 2017, 07:38:17 AM As far as I understand, all the funds received by the platform for purchasing subscriptions and commissions will be sent to the so-called ""Asset contract"". And why not direct them directly to those areas that you will develop?  Because the functional of the asset contract is much greater. In addition, not all tokens received by CanYA for paid services will be retained. I know that some of them will be burned and artificially stimulated the growth of the value of the token. However, the other two shares, for me, are spent on very vague goals. So still incredibly transparent. 34% are automatically destroyed immediately. 33% are sent to the platform itself, that is, for maintenance, promotion and others are needed. Another 33% are sent to pay rewards for all bounty programs.  Omg. First of all you are not aware how it works. Which bounty programs?  Please read it before you reply to somebody else. You are disinforming people and this making confusion https://canya.io/assets/docs/WhitePaper.pdf - section 4.4  Asset contract is not working like that. Rewards pool is not bounty programs. Reward pool is to incentivize users to use platform.  CanYa processes two forms of revenue: a 1% flat transaction fee and a freemium subscription model for providers. Both proceeds will be collected as CanYaCoins and will be sent to an Asset Contract. The Asset Contract will accumulate the crypto and split them in accordance with the publicly-viewable proportions in the smart contract and dispense them monthly. 30% will be sent to the Rewards Pool, 30% will be sent to the CanYa for platform maintenance and development, 30% will be burnt, and 10% will be sent to the Charity Pool.",False

I'm wondering if the hard-cap ICO is close? There is no clear answer on that from any token , usually they are not announcing even hard cap is reached  What do you mean? Don't desinform people. Everything is available on website with funds raised bar to track in real time. You didn't even visit website but answering people questions, why?  Quote from: bittcrypt on December 07, 2017, 01:04:54 PM Hello. I still have time to buy tokens on Pre-sale?  Unfortunetely pre-sale is finished. But you can still join the crowdsale and get 20% bonus + 5% referal bonus if you have the code.

This is one of features that will be implemented in the future, the ability for users to list services they need completed and for service providers to view a list of services that they could complete!  Quote from: Immer on November 25, 2017, 08:41:32 AM Good afternoon. I’ve read a lot about your project, it has proved itself to be quite good in Australia. But you used a third-party company to make payments. How can you use this mechanism when working with the global market?  Cryptocurrency! By using cryptocurrency payments we can create borderless, instant payments. Currently we work with a third party for AUD payments, this will of course continue to be a feature on our platform and we want to implement as many fiat payment channels as possible going forward.  Quote from: energycrypt on November 25, 2017, 08:44:02 AM It is written that services with hourly payment prevail on your platform in your WP. In this case, can I hire staff for a full-fledged remote job, concluding with them only a smart contract rather than a standard contract? Yup! You could effectively create an entire group of developers, designers and content creators on CanYa. Having all of their payments in escrow with smart contracts!  Quote from: rocketbit48 on November 25, 2017, 08:48:27 AM According to official information, one of the criteria for automatic evaluation of performers is the ""citation frequency"". What is it, and why do you consider this indicator to be important? There's no mention of ""citation frequency"" in our whitepaper but citation frequency likely refers to the number of previous services either the user or service provider has been involved with. So the number of references each user has - Basically referring to reputation.  Quote from: Dasengineer on November 25, 2017, 09:21:39 AM My review of CanYa ICO.  If you mind to read.

So assuming everything goes well we have a single trustless hedged escrow smart contract that deals with payment. If there's a disagreement this gets escalated to a second smart contract, where the two parties can discuss and try to come to a resolution by themselves (say for example accepting 50% of initial payment for a worse than expected service.  Finally there's a third level of dispute resolution where a CanYa employee (Or a third party for later scaling) investigates the case to asses the evidence and make a judgement call. This will require serious scaling as the platform gets more and more transactions, however there's no way around this (Until we get super duper amazing AI solutions longer term  ). As a services marketplace offering everything from graphic design to smart contract deployment to plumbing to dog walking there's no way to automate the dispute resolution at the highest level.

The CanYa App was soft launched first in Darwin (AUS) then major cities across Australia - We've had almost 20% month-on-month user growth since the launch of the CanYa platform. Over 1000 jobs have been processed since our soft launch we're sure that with an international push we'll see fantastic numbers come out of CanYa.  Quote from: silvestar on October 28, 2017, 03:50:47 PM This is what I understand; to ensure that the money of crypto money and / or shoppers is not affected by any price fluctuations while waiting in the Intermediary Institution. So you buy goods from e-bay and you give 1 BTC. Until you will receive the goods, and then you will approve it and the money will be transferred from the pool to the seller, the btc currency may down from 6000 dollar to 3000 dollar. I understand that they are trying to ease this fluctuation and facilitate shopping with crypto. Great question, so the basics of this is explained above - It's basically though our trusted hedged escrow contact.

Quote from: Hullo on October 30, 2017, 09:20:10 AM Just out of curiosity one question appeared in my mind seeing you wrote real working product and same time you are planning to go for ICO. If you have a working product which is for $2 trillions then why do you need to collect money ? Why don't you think product will make its place by its own based on functionalities and potential. Good question Hullo! So there's a few different reasons for an ICO:  1. Although we already have a working product our product is currently only fully functional in Australia. Although this is an awesome start we want global adoption! In order to make our app fully functional in every county we need global payment channels - this can be achieved in two ways, the first is to get fiat on/off ramps in every currency, this means banks in every country and a huge wall of paperwork. The second is to adopt cryptocurrency to make instant global transfers possible with ease. CanYa wants to take both approaches, getting fiat on/off ramps where available as well as having cryptocurrency as a payment method. Doing both of these things - Fiat on/off ramps + Cryptocurrencies takes a heap of time and money.  2. Building a trustless system - Although we already have a working app it's fully centralized, this means users must trust CanYa. This isn't inherently a bad thing, especially because we have no nefarious intentions, however with any centralized system we're making ourselves a target by being centralized.  3. Community building! CanYa is a peer to peer marketplace, the more people we have in our community the further the CanYa message is spread - the more services providers and users on the platform. An ICO allows us to create a large and switched-on cryptocurrency following that will help spread CanYa to every corner of the world!  There are a few more awesome upsides to an ICO but I'm currently sitting at Devcon3 and time has huge value here!  Quote from: BobAlex on October 30, 2017, 09:59:45 AM only accept ETH? Correct!

Unlike most ICO's we already have a working product, high user growth and an experienced team - We soft launched our initial product in Australia late last year where we had extraordinary growth with zero marketing. Now we're conducting an ICO to fund expansion into the international market and to start CanYa’s journey to becoming a completely decentralized peer to peer marketplace of services.    CanYa’s Decentralisation Roadmap https://i.imgur.com/nDXA0Mi.jpg  Our decentralisation roadmap sets out a realistic plan - Unlike other projects that set impossible goals of decentralised technology CanYa understands that the technology we are building on is still in it’s infancy. However, we’ve planned for the future, creating a roadmap that plans to adopt every piece of decentralised technology we can, IPFS, state channels, decentralised token exchanges – Any new features Ethereum offers will be utilized to their fullest by the CanYa platform.    https://i.imgur.com/oHsbbSB.jpg   CanYa was committed to building a working platform before launching an ICO – That’s why our centralized app can already be downloaded.

CanYa completely removes the risk via the Hedged Escrow Contract. This is done though the use of a stable token - We have announcements regarding a gold backed token partner coming soon . Our hedged escrow system ensures that when a user books a service at an agreed upon price, it will remain static throughout the transaction, to ensure $100 in is $100 out.  Our hedged escrow contract can only receive CAN tokens, users can pay with any cryptocurrency (or fiat denomination) but this deposit is instantly transferred into CAN tokens using a centralized exchange partner or a decentralised token exchange. These CAN tokens are then sent into our escrow contract where the value of these tokens is hedged against the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Not only does our escrow contract provide continual CAN demand, it also creates price stability for the volatility of cryptocurrency. This is hugely important for a services dApp as many services could take an extended amount of time.   Asset Contract and user cashback https://i.imgur.com/nbIpsDD.png  Fees are collected (in the providers chosen currency) they are converted into CAN tokens and then deposited into the Asset Contract. The Asset contract receives CAN tokens from both our flat 1% transaction fee and monthly subscription payment - they are sent to a smart contract which distributes the tokens.  The most notable part of our Reward Pool is the user cashback, when a user makes a payment to a service provider on our platform they receive a percentage of their payment as a cash back. The exact percentage will vary depending on the amount of CAN tokens in the rewards pool at any time – But at release of our platform users will receive a 5% cashback whenever payment is made to a service provider.

In the last 40 years since the invention and democratization of the internet, use has grown radi-cally. Some estimates indicate that as many as 4 billion unique individuals are online. Yes - bil-lion with a B. In other words, more than half of the world’s total population.  This sort of cataclysmic adoption has also been paired with exploding opportunity through online services. The internet has morphed from a simple information sharing platform into a comprehensive entity for nearly everything. E-commerce has particularly come into its own, with sales totally nearly 10% of gross US transactions. Since 2008, this rate of online transactions has been increasing, even during the midst of the global financial crisis.  In this new gig economy, corporations like Upwork, Fiverr and Etsy have sought to connect freelancer workers and artists with employers, while Ikea made headlines by acquiring Gig economy company TaskRabbit, which provides handymen to assist with various manual labor tasks. These connections show that the world is fast moving toward a gig economy structure, with as many as 34% of all American workers functioning in this capacity.  While these companies represent a significant change in how employment online fuctions, they are the first generation of such portals, and are showing considerable signs of stress. CanYa, an Australian blockchain-based platform, plans to be the online marketplace to replace sites like Upwork and Fiverr.  CanYa is a decentralized online marketplace where service providers can connect with customers and send and receive payment via cryptocurrency. The blockchain platform permits sellers to interact with employers directly--a truly peer to peer (P2P) experience, unlike the veiled systems at Upwork and others.  https://coinidol.com/canya-freelance-market/",False

Regarding national policy, Australia has been pretty proactive and has just come out with a list of different ICO types according to legislation http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/digital-transformation/initial-coin-offerings/ - We're not worried compared to many other nations!

Users and service providers can have full control over the currencies they want to pay in and get paid in, this is only possible though the utility of the CAN token. All payments get converted into CAN tokens, then sent to our hedged escrow contract (Explained above or in our whitepaper) - This ensures that the volatility of cryptocurrency doesn't effect the service providers payment amount.  In terms of the advantages of holding CAN: 1. CAN tokens can be used to pay for real world services 2. CAN tokens are the only accepted form of payment for our premium listing service - Meaning if you want to be at the top of our provider list you must spend CAN 3. Most importantly is our continuous CAN demand model. Our hedged escrow contract demands CAN tokens to function, therefore as users grow > the number of CAN tokens required by the contract grows > CAN token demand grows  A full blog outlining CanYaCoin's value proposition can be found here: https://blog.canya.com.au/2017/10/01/why-participate-in-the-canya-ico-the-can-coin/",False
