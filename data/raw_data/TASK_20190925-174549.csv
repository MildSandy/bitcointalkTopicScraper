I always have wondered why recruitment agencies and head hunter meanly look for someone who has done a job for ages and would consider it a challenge to do the same (for a little higher salary maybe) for another employer. Also HR (in my 40 years of experience) is more interested in skills than passion (although they would never admit that). I see that the young people today are really different than 25 years ago. They are more interested in employing themselves and doing the things they like, then do a boring job with the promise that after a long time, they will be rewarded by real interesting work/positions/payment. And most jobs are changing so quickly that focusing on skills seems more and more non effective. So all together the shift towards competences means more motivation, better results for the employer and better use of human assets. So, I support this project.",False
