We truly are a big group with multiple partnerships in different industries. That being said, our group/partners all operate differently and mostly independently providing different services to different markets. INGOT Coin was born and created because our team saw the need for the IC Ecosystem and the need to bridge the markets. Furthermore one of our core components is the ICO Accelerator and in order to excel and provide the best services in that particular component we must go through the process ourselves. It is a lot easier and more beneficial to teach someone to go through the process when you have done it before rather than not experiencing it. We also believe that ICO funding will be the new of fund raising as it has proven and will further prove to be faster, less costly and with less restrictions and that is why we are choosing to adopt it.",False
