During Pre-ICO stage it’s suggested 1,400,000 tokens for sale (0,175% of emission as a whole and 0,7% of the amount of the public sale). Starting discount is 50% (0.0009 ETH)   We are building comprehensive financial and business MGBank platform (codenamed Tokamak) to drastically expand blockchain and cryptocurrencies from a sandbox to the real world. Today practical use of cryptocurrencies is prevented by a number of factors: high cost of transactions; the long confirmation of transactions; extreme volatility; the absence of standardization; lack of a convenient and functional API.  The solution for these key problems demands the evolution of the basic ideas of cryptocurrencies. Cryptosphere needs a diverse infrastructure and expansion of the scope of use of crypto-assets and blockchain application. It is necessary to consolidate the segmental parts and provide a synergistic effect. Our Tokamak platform realizes this kind of evolution.  The project aims at providing the participants of the market with the blockchain instruments of decreasing the costs, increasing the speed and convenience of financial and business operations, expanding the use of products and services of participants, increasing profits. As a part of evolution we designed the concept of Cryptopair - MGCoin and MGCash. This approach provides the stable course of cryptocurrency on the one hand, and the opportunity to invest on the other hand. Wherein, the high speed of transactions and their low cost are realized.  Another important part of platform is Personal capitalization -  the mechanism of the automatic determination of the credit or other rating of a user, based on the data of their financial transactions and various other information. This will let the users to get loans at minimum rates fast, to provide priority services, pay later service, interest-free installments and other benefits. It also provides for the accumulation of non-financial reviews (from stores, hotels, employers, colleagues, resorts, friends, etc.) in order to capitalize them.  Also the platform provides built-in subsystem of P2P lending. Today P2P platforms are among the fastest growing segment in the financial services space. The meeting of a creditor and a borrower happens on the online platform, where they conclude an agreement. Not only private individuals can act as creditors, but also institutional investors. The advantage of P2P lending over traditional bank crediting is the high speed of bargains, getting credit by the individual, not interesting for banks, more profitable conditions both for a borrower and an investor. Tokamak provides functionality for performing P2P lending transactions in various currencies both without security and on security of crypto and traditional assets.  Other key features of platform are: providing payment transactions (including API for social networks, messengers, games, etc.); multicurrency (both fiat and crypto currencies); smart account; digital wallet; third-party services; smart contracts; electronic workflows; business services; private community; financial marketplace (including bonds, shares, loans, insurances, etc); KYC provider and so on.",False

Therefore, the data in the blockchain is stored in encrypted form and unauthorized users will not be able to read them.  The important part of the platform is the subsystem of account management. According to the legislation of many countries it’s necessary to obtain the information about the identity and address of the customers. This procedure is known as «KYC» (Know Your Customer). KYC is important because it helps to ensure that the application and other details are real. There have been instances of fraud and siphoning off of money from accounts. By ensuring the identity of individuals, it would help to prevent fraud. The Know Your Customer practice has been in vogue for many years now. In these latter days the use of biometrics (face and voice recognition, finger print, etc.) is inculcated. Also, customers will be given the opportunity to confirm transactions through independent channels (for example, by SMS).

Market remittance is rather interesting, but not demonstrating an attractive growth dynamics nowadays. Nevertheless, this segment is extremely interesting when designing a complex financial platform, because it lets not only earn money by means of remittance, but provide the promotion of other platform services, enlarge customer base. On the other hand, the availability of range of services, their strong correlation and capitalization of a person, based upon the transactions carried out or other data must become an important factor for the customers when choosing a financial provider.  As it stated above, the cost of a remittance is a key factor for a customer. That’s why the cost decline of such a remittance is a key to success. The most evident way of the cost decline is the set –off of oncoming transfers. In fact only the sum, showing the difference between incoming and outgoing payments in the specific channel, crosses the border in this case. However, this scheme has a limited potential, because the volumes of incoming and outgoing payments often differ much. This gap can be compensated due to the expansion of the capital traffic by means of supply of additional financial services. So, a good effect is reached by the combination of remittance and P2P lending. But even in this case the necessary balance can be not always reached. We see the decision in the including B2B money transfers in the whole process",False

Can you introduce yourself and your role in MGBank? •   I’m Evgenii, a businessman, economist and blockchain enthusiast whose mission in life is to increase inefficiencies in business and financial services. I have more than 15 years of successful business experience. I developed my first program (a game) at the age of 6 years and I wrote 5 books about SQL. I am the CEO and founder of MGBank. A key focus of my role is to develop project concepts, analyze market trends and manage the team.  2.   What is MGBank? •   The Main Global Bank (MGBank) is a complex of services and API platforms (codenamed Tokamak), organizational institutions and necessary infrastructure. The core of the platform will provide blockchain engine and the basic API for separate services – users’ authorization (including KYC), payments, clearing, smart contracts, a stock exchange, workflow, the check and bill reference, taxation issues, currency exchange, etc.  3.   What do you see as the main opportunities for development of the project? •   Both the financial segment as a whole and the blockchain especially have a huge potential. But the wide expansion of blockchain is constrained by a number of factors: high cost of transactions and their long confirmation, extreme volatility, lack of a convenient and functional API, etc. We believe that the key to the success is resolving these issues and providing multipurpose engine for widespread cryptocurrencies and blockchain in everyday business and operations. Therefore we have developed the concept of CryptoPair – the freely traded cryptocurrency MGCoin and the settlement cryptocurrency MGCash, which has a rigid regulation of the exchange rate with the regard to the basket of fiat currencies. All this ensures its low volatility. The funds from the sale of MGCash will be accumulated in the reserve fund and serve as a provision of MGCash and buy-back.  4.   What are the advantages of the project? •   The platform build on scalable and fast blockchain engine. We plan that platform will provide lower commission of financial transactions for all participants. But the most important thing is the synergistic effect of combining different business and financial services on common platform. Thus, we can offer customers a comprehensive financial engine. We intend to provide financial API for different segments of digital world – games, messengers, social networks, various sites and mobile apps, etc. Our goal is that our services will be used to carry out transactions in as many areas as possible. And therefore we are ready offer the best condition for customers.  5.   In brief, what are the facts that make the MGBank team able to carry out the roadmap in full? •   Key team members have programming experience of 10-15 years. Some members have more than 10 years of work in the banking sector, including experience in the Central Bank. Our team also possesses competences in lending and providing business services. And all key players have successful experience in the implementation of many commercial projects.  6.   Don't you think it's too big a project for one team? •   Of course, this is really a big project. But we believe that a small project in the future will have little chance of success. Customers will prefer a single comprehensive platform, rather than using a variety of independent services for money transfer, invoicing, planning, lending, calculating tax, etc. So our project is so complex. And we are sure that our team will do it.  7.   What is your strategy for dealing with competitors? •   We intend to actively involve third-party developers to integrate their successful services into the platform ecosystem. They will receive additional customers and a source of income, while the platform will increase competitiveness, revenue and market share. This approach will stimulate the development of new and integration of existing services for our customers.  8.   Can you share details about the ICO? •   Our pre-sale ICO ends on July 20, 2018 and our main sale ICO starts on August 20, 2018.  9.   What is the utility of the MGBank token? •   MGBank token holders share the profit of MGBank and provide access to services of platform. After emission of cryptocurrency MGCoin the tokens will be changed into MGCoin.  10.   How do you see the relationship between the cryptosphere and the regulators develop in the future? •    I am sure that regulation and pressure from the state authorities will increase as technology spreads. Therefore in the long term the project should take into account the interests of the state – taxes, combating illegal incomes, preventing the financing of terrorism, protection of rights, etc. Therefore the project concept assumes active cooperation with state bodies. We believe this approach will minimize the risks for the project on the part of regulators.  11.   How do you see the future of the cryptocurrencies? •   I think that 2-3 global and possibly several national cryptocurrencies will remain in use. Users need universal tools that are recognized by all market participants and ensure the execution of necessary transactions. No one needs several kinds of Internet network, mail or ftp protocol. Success will have those currencies that will provide the maximum coverage and provide the best services.  12.   What the most important services of platform? •   The key features of platform are P2P lending, Personal capitalization, payments, financial marketplace, multicurrency (both fiat and crypto currencies), KYC provider, smart account, digital wallet, third-party services, smart contracts, cryptopair, electronic workflows, etc. More detail in WhitePaper Book 1.  13.   Would you like to add further information? •   The technologies must provide the additional benefits for the clients, such as the decline of expenses, the enlargement of the customers’ base, the increase of conversion and the quantity of the goods being purchased, gaining additional sources of profit and so on. And our project provides a way to this. Therefore, we are confident of its success. I think you should join us!  For more information please visit: https://mainglobalbank.com",False
