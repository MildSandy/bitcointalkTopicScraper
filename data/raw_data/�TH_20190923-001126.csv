Chinese, Russian and Korean translators are the most welcome as the language barrier seems the most significant here but other translation are welcome too!  You don't have to be a qualified translator to perform the task, all you need to have are writing skills so that you can provide a correct, fluent-to-read text for speakers of your language.    How to translate:  Go to the Dether website. Register to get access to translation module. If your language is not present on the list, please send a PM to Seccour or ask us in the Dether Slack channel and we will add it to the project. Translation is divided to subpages, which means that some content needs to be translated multiple times but you can do it fast by selecting existing translations from the memory. Once finished, it is recommended to proofread the translation (voting). If there's only one person for a language, we can do without it, however.

This is Abdelhamid, cofounder at Dether, the world's first Dapp that enables anyone on Earth to buy ether using cash and spend it at physical stores.  Dether is powered by Ethereum smart contracts and available on any smartphone.  Our mission is very simple: break barriers to Ethereum adoption! Buying ether is currently a long and difficult process. It takes time and costs money. Central institutions still play a major role. More than 2 billion adults remain excluded from Ethereum by being unbanked. And the last mile issue has yet to be solved.  That's the reason why we are launching a fully peer-to-peer and decentralized solution.  We're a team of 7 Blockchain and Ethereum passionnates. We're working on an Alpha that will come out this summer.  We just opened our Slack to our community, please join us in participating in the next killer app for Ethereum mass adoption!  http://dether.io http://slack.dether.io   And for more information, here is our Introducing Blogpost: https://medium.com/@DETHER/introducing-dether-enabling-anyone-on-earth-to-buy-ether-with-cash-and-spend-it-at-physical-stores-fe23ad6084c4  Cheers!",False

We are launching the translation of our website. We want to encourage as many people as possible to participate in the joint effort to translate the website.  The launch of our site dether.io has been a great success and we thank you! Let's make it even more awesome by widening the target audience! Chinese, Russian and Korean translators are the most welcome as the language barrier seems the most significant here but other translation are welcome too!  You don't have to be a qualified translator to perform the task, all you need to have are writing skills so that you can provide a correct, fluent-to-read text for speakers of your language.    How to translate:  Go to the Dether website. Register to get access to translation module. If your language is not present on the list, please send a PM to Seccour or ask us in the Dether Slack channel and we will add it to the project. Translation is divided to subpages, which means that some content needs to be translated multiple times but you can do it fast by selecting existing translations from the memory. Once finished, it is recommended to proofread the translation (voting). If there's only one person for a language, we can do without it, however. If you have any questions regarding crowdin, the best way to address them is via crowdin or our slack, where you can contact us as a project owner.     Thank you everybody to be a part of this adventure !   EDIT: Don't ask to reserve any translation or for any bounties regarding website translation. If you want to help at the website translation, please do using the instructions written above. But if you are here exclusively for the bounties, you can go away.",False
