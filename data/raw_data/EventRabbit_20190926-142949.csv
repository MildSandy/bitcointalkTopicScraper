Eventrabbt is Africa's first blockchain solution for events!   EventRabbt is a decentralized event payment system, listing and Livestream platform, to increase user engagement and simplify ticketing and marketing processes. The listing and live streaming will be available on Android, iOS and web platform, while the payment system is based on smart contract technology powered by the ethereum blockchain.  Events happen all around the world! Millions of people across the world are hindered attending due to location barriers and a high cost of travelling. For those who can afford, it's quite a big deal when it comes to expensive currency conversion. Most people end up spending more than 200 times the amount due to currency conversions.  Eventrabbt primarily solves these problems, by providing event live streaming platform where someone in Nigeria can participate in events happening in Denmark at his/her convenience. And most importantly, without paying extravagant fees, with equal currency value anywhere around the world using the eventrabbt token (EVRT).  Event organizers can now increase revenue by targeting larger audience all around the world and still keep making money off their concluded Livestream video even after 3 years or more. Event attendees wonâ€™t have to worry about currency conversion, fees, the speed of transaction or location.   Presale starts: May 20th. ICO starts: July 28th.
