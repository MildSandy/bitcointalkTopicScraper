Lots of different countries involved and most of the team are former DJs/producers. Angelo Recca: Co-Founder/CEO from Italy. LinkedIn says he has been CEO of this cloud storage company SpazioRC since 2012. Spazio has only one employee listed on LinkedIn and the twitter only has 340 followers and hasn’t been active since Novemebr 2017. Rino Ticli: Co-Founder. The only work history listed is “DeeJay” since 2002. He doesn’t seem to be a very popular DJ/producer, either. He’s had Twitter since 2012 yet only has 800 followers that give him zero love or retweets. Julian Anghelin: EMEA Manager. Despite typing a long and vague description of his skills, the only work history he has listed is as a publications guy for Royal Caribbean Cruises for ten months in 2016. Giovanni Melfi: CTO and Blockchain Developer. Out of the 12 team members, he is the only developer. And it looks like he has no work history to brag about. He did describe himself on LinkedIn as follows:” Passionate about cryptocurrencies and blockchain, 2 languages speaker. Coming from an experience in software engineering and a passion for software development with some programming languages such as PHP. I participated in some group work on the robotic system, on linux programming and on StartUp Manager, and I think these experiences are the most important for professional growth.” The website goes on to list 19 international DJs/producers that are supposed to be a part of BitSong. However, after checking all of them, only a couple ever mention BitSong. No mentions of the token sale. The most popular is a guy named Tadeo, who gained almost 300,000 Twitter followers for being on an MTV reality show. He does not mention the BitSong crowdsale on his twitter. Nicola Fasano is a DJ with 16,000 followers on Twitter. Mossel is a DJ with 10,000 followers but doesn’t mention Bitsong ICO  Verdict We usually don’t do analysis on projects that already had their pre-sale. However, after seeing these ratings, it seemed like our opinion was needed. These high scores are out of line. The only explanation is that the reviews were done a few months ago, before the bad news bears arrived to spoil everyone’s shill fest. Nobody here expects YouTube, Spotify and record companies to just step aside while smart contract/blockchain projects move in. Said blockchain projects needs to be extra special with an extra special team in order to even stand a chance of competing. Based on team inexperience and lack of MVP alone, this gets an unfavorable rating.  Risks     The team is not experienced at all in business or blockchain. -1     It doesn’t look like they will come close at all to reaching the hard cap. They have a large team and payroll. It’s going to take a long time for both BitSong and Ethereum to work properly. There’s a strong chance they run out of money by then -1     No MVP, only one blockchain developer listed on their team, plus many other small things that lead us to believe they might not be really trying to build this thing. -1     GitHub is not active at all. This supports the above theory. -1     Competition. The author has reviewed 4 different blockchain music ICOsin the last year. He ranks this one 3/4. -1  Growth Potential     Ambitious roadmap on page 15 of the whitepaper. +1     One of these blockchain music projects is going to be popular. BitSong has an outsiders chance. +1     The crowdsale will run for three months, ending in November. Perhaps the market will be bullish by then. +2     They make a really bold claim on their site about having 177,404 users. When asked who these users are, the reply was, “177,404 users interacted with our bot and registered in our wallet.” This is kinda hard to believe, but if true those type numbers will definitely help them scale. +3  Disposition It’s just way too good to be true. The silver lining is that we’ve seen several projects succeed in the past with this same strategy. A brilliant whitepaper idea with no MVP, and an untested team. However, in today’s paranoid market, most investors are now needing evidence of work, not just a whitepaper and a dream. +2/10",False

They finance it with their own money, contact a record label in the hope that they are interested in the song, investing and publishing it to get the most sales.  This all takes many months before outcomes can be achieved .  Often however, this does not happen, as the artist does not have the necessary funds to create a music video, because he does not have the right contacts, and because the record label (given the huge amount of songs they receive) rarely invests their time and effort into the song.  An artist can often find they have spent substancial time and funds without gains or revenue.

The idea was born precisely because both Angelo and Rino agreed that the music industry suffers (again) because of some problems. Problems that the blockchain can eliminate!  This is how BitSong was born, a project that allows the music artist to be paid directly in BTSG (almost in real time) and therefore no longer has to stick to the rules of record companies and wait a long time to see if the song has had many sales or less.  BitSong will work as follows: there will be 3 important figures - The user, who will be the one who will listen to music from any device; - The artist, who will produce the song (and does not want to rely on record companies) - The advertiser who will sponsor on our platform through a simple tool (facebook ads style) where he can tag his campaign.  Why is BitSong already enjoying great success? The advertiser will be the fuel of the platform, thanks to our listeners, will be able to promote their business (local or online) and save both on commission costs and on the price per listen (CPL) as it is he who decides the price. Subsequently, the price will suffer a kind of auction because according to the number of advertisers for that tagging the price will rise or fall (a kind of internal exchange advertiser).  For example: if there is a lot of demand for a specific rating (location, age, genre, gender or other), the advertiser, if he wants to get more plays, has to raise his price.  Later BitSong will hold 10% of the amount spent by the advertiser while the remaining 90% will be divided (based on an internal algorithm) between the artist and the listener. Thus, the artist will have every intention of promoting our platform to promote his piece. The user with the accumulated tokens, can decide whether to withdraw them and then sell them to the market, or make donations to the artist who produced the song, can also use our tokens to buy the album.  The artist can also use our tokens to promote his song or decide to put them on the market.  In a first phase, a beta version of our app will be put online to verify the user experience. After the appropriate modifications, we will begin the creation of our own blockchain. BitSong has received huge success in these days and has more than 82,000 users, soon (thanks to the sponsorships that will start and also thanks to new partnerships) we will reach 250,000 registered users.  🔉 NO ADMIN WILL CONTACT YOU PERSONALLY ON TELEGRAM 🔉 NO ADMIN WILL CONTACT YOU IN PRIVATE ON TELEGRAM FOR DONATIONS. 🔉 ANY COMMUNICATION IS GOING TO BE THROUGH MAIL hello@bitsong.io",False

Regarding the difference between BitSong and Voise, well there are some of them: Bitsong is totally different from Voise project because our idea is totally different from theirs, we also want to incorporate advertisers who practically do the advertising on our platform and share the profits with others. Despite this, they did not provide a donation system, they did not provide a sponsorship system. That is a project that has been stagnating for years while instead we will be online very soon.

As https://medium.com/@BitSongOfficial Says :  In the last days our development team has worked hard to update the BitSong bot. Due to the excessive number of users we had to recreate the entire infrastructure.  The number of tokens released during the first airdrop is around 370,000 BTSG.  The new airdrop will start tomorrow 2/16/2018 at 2PM UTC and the first 24 hours will be exclusively reserved for WHITELIST SUBSCRIBERS. If you are not registered yet, you will have time to do so until 02:00 PM UTC, 2/16/2018 on the official website of our platform https://bitsong.io, in the “Subscribe for updates”  For each new member, the system will give a number of tokens (currently it is a random formula from 20 to 40), while for each registered referral you will receive a number of tokens (random formula from 5 to 20). Your old referral remains active and UNCHANGED.  By connecting to the BitSong bot and clicking on “My Wallet” you can find “Wallet”, “Airdrop”, “Referral”:  Wallet we mean the number of tokens available for withdraw; Airdrop we mean the tokens received during the airdrop; Referral means the total generated by referrals. We remind you that for the token referrals, to be valid, the user sent by you must subscribe to our BitSong platform and enter the code obtained through the Bot “Claim my token”, in case you have lost the code, connect to our bot https://bitsong.io click on “Join our Airdrop” than click “Claim my token”  The number of tokens made available for the airdrop is 10,000,000 BTSG, equivalent to about $ 470,000 (500 ETH). At present the price is 1 ETH = 20,000 BTSG (twenty thousand) Keep in touch through our official website, blog and official twitter account and we remind you that for any questions you can contact us through our official chat, available on the site of the main platform of BitSong.

The number of $BTSG Tokens we provide for the Airdrop is 10,000,000 BTSG, equivalent to almost $ 470,000 (500 ETH).  We remind those who have already participated in the initial phase of the Airdrop that although the infrastructure of the platform has been completely recreated, all the data of the initial phase have been imported to the new Bot, and therefore your old referral remains active and unchanged.  Since we are making 10 million Tokens available, which is a quite high number and we have managed to improve our infrastructure a lot, now capable of sustaining very high turnout, we have decided to open directly today for all users and not just for the whitelist subscribers.  We remind you also that for the token referrals, to be valid, the user sent by you must subscribe to our BitSong platform and enter the code obtained through the Bot “Claim my token”, in case you have lost the code, connect to our bot https://bitsong.io click on “Join our Airdrop” than click “Claim my token”  After the final phase of the airdrop we will proceed to the PRE-ICO, after which we will pass to the ICO. The official dates will be announced later. In a couple of days the web wallet will be available online, from where you can check the remaining tokens, the airdrop and the ICO.  Why is it important to have BitSong Tokens? Because they will be used on our platform as a payment tool.  Follow us through our official website, blog and official twitter account for the next steps.

BitSong is a project dedicated to musicians and listeners, to solve one of the major problems related to the music world. Problems that a musician who wants to emerge knows very well.  From today you will produce your song, the advertiser will upload his advertisement and the user will listen to the songs from any device. For each advertisement listened, the artist and the listener will get up to 90% of the profits invested by the advertiser. You can also receive donations from your fans for your next album.  Project Vision  Our vision is to create a new revolutionary brand linked to music streaming that is unlike any other platforms. BitSong will generate profit for the artist and the users who listens to their songs while creating a money saving opportunity for advertisers.  Our goal is to be present on any Smart TV equipped with Chromecast,through Smartphone App Stores[/b], on any personal computer through a web interface or software and finally on any car equipped with a Smart Radio.  Now you are paid!  The current music streaming companies are like intermediaries between advertisers and producers. We want to upset the musical world thanks to the blockchain technology.  The user will be paid for the ""User Attention"", the producer will receive earnings in real time, the advertiser will be able to optimize the campaign after viewing the reports.  The technology of the blockchain is advancing fast bringing with it new improvements applicable to daily use. For this reason we decided to found BitSong, the first decentralized music streaming platform.   Features  Upload - Upload new songs and create your own music channel. Sell - Sell your songs, listen to them and get donations. Donate - Support the artist by making a donation through the $BTSG tokens Earn - Earn $BTSG token during your plays Listen - Listen to your songs on any TV, Smartphone or PC Sponsor - Sponsor your business or your songs in full autonomy.
