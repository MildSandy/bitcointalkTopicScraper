From this we can conclude that the process of identifying users will be carried out in several stages, which will protect personal data from offenders. First of all, the development can be applied in the following areas of the financial market:  - Banking activity; - Insurance; - Crediting; - Digital payment systems; - Financial web applications. The process of user identification will be carried out using special protocols that were created in advance.  However, this is not all that the Usechain project wants to achieve. His plans also include the creation of a decentralized exchange, since the main competitors have already acquired them. It will be used for the internal sale of tokens. If the project succeeds in translating this idea into reality, the world will be credited with adding another convenient decentralized exchange, which is currently lacking in the industry. In addition, participants of the new exchange will be able to perform financial transactions in a safe mode, since previously each user will have to undergo a complex identification system, which was described above. This digital platform will be a convenient place for the development of ICO projects, since at the next stage they will immediately be able to conduct trading operations.
