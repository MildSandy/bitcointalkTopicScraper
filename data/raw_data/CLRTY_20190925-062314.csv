The Clarity platform is designed to be a one-stop shop for small business owners worldwide, giving them complete access to, and control over, their data. It will also provide analytics, benchmarking, file sharing, third-party verification and access to early-stage funding or investment that has previously only been available to larger businesses.  Clarity founder Luke Smith said: ""The Crypto industry is growing up fast, becoming mainstream and Jersey is now well placed to take advantage. We have been delighted with the interaction between Carey Olsen, the JFSC and Helm Trust, which has allowed us to focus on the sale of our Tokens and ultimately the delivery of our very exciting Project.”  Carey Olsen partner Chris Griffin, who spearheads the firm's burgeoning digital assets practice, led the team advising Clarity, and was assisted by associates Joseph Barker-Willis and Filip Kwilinski.  Mr Griffin said: ""Despite challenging times in the ICO space, the Clarity Project launch demonstrates that innovative businesses can still harness the token sale route to reach market.""  https://www.careyolsen.com/news-and-deals/carey-olsen-advises-clarity-launch-jersey-ico",True

It provides a clear plan of action to be taken before, during and after a disaster.  A disaster could be man made or a natural occurrence. A disaster recovery plan is designed to allow your business to get back on its feet as quickly as possible. In terms of managing risks to your business, a disaster cannot be eliminated from your risk register. You cannot prevent a disaster from occurring but you can manage your business through it.  The first step in creating a disaster recovery plan is to make a list of all the office jobs / tasks that would have to be relocated to an alternate location so the business can continue to run. Identify the most critical roles and create a list of the areas that should be prioritised in order to ensure that the business can continue to run during a crisis.  The next step is to identify alternative office space. This could be a serviced office at a nearby location that can be up and running in a matter of hours. You don’t need to rent this space right now. Instead, you should just identify a number of alternatives that could be up and running quickly, if needed.  You should ensure that your business has sufficient insurance and budget available to handle a disaster situation. For example, if your office was wiped out due to a fire, you would need to have a budget available to purchase necessary office equipment, computers, etc. to get your business back up and running as quickly as possible.  Most businesses are highly dependent on I.T. You should have your servers and systems backed up at a secondary data site. This data site should be accessible in a disaster situation so that your business can continue to function.  Finally, you should document a list of key personnel and their contact details. In the event of a disaster, they should be contacted in order to make alternative arrangements for the business.",True

If you’re on the fence about joining the #ClarityCommunity and want someone else’s perspective who isn’t part of the team (!), have a read of Jamie’s reasoning behind why he got involved, and what he thinks of us and our vision.  If this inspires you, please get in touch on info@clarityproject.io or join our telegram channel: t.me/theCLRTYproject  What do I think of the Clarity project? The Clarity project came on my radar when I was at Accountex, I went to a Hubdoc after party where I met Steven Briginshaw. I’d come across Steven before through the network that we were in. We were networking in the same circles. Steven started talking to me about blockchain and what the possibilities were with blockchain, and started talking to me about the Clarity project, and what he was trying to do there.  It just blew my mind really. It blew my mind as to what was possible with blockchain technology, and also how Clarity fitted within that. That’s what got me excited. The fact that it’s all about building a better business, a better life, and a better world meant that the business has purpose. It’s linked very much with B1G1, which is something that I’m very passionate about, and giving back to the world, which is absolutely amazing.  https://clarityproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/1_wYQ_OLA3CadYWwqcOl6GgA.jpg Jamie Selby with the Clarity team at #BlockchainLive, London 2018  Paul Dunn and Masami are leaders in that area. It’s a fantastic thing, and to think about the impact that could have not just on the business community from Clarity, the knock-on effect that that would then have with other blockchain projects, other ICO projects that will see what Clarity are doing, and hopefully get inspired to do the same.  I thought, “This is something that I’ve got to get involved with.” Well, not just got to get involved, I HAVE to get involved with this. This is amazing. What the Clarity project does for the business community, or is going to do for the business community, and as the platform evolves it’s going to be a game changer.  That information sitting on the blockchain, with smart contracts, with the ability for businesses to have access to financial dashboards and then for financial institutions to then be able to access that information via the financial dashboards, via smart contracts, and, again, the information being on the blockchain is just mind blowing. It is going to be such a game changer for small businesses worldwide really.  As the platform just gets leveraged and pushed out more and more, and, again, evolves as a business, I think Clarity are just touching the surface as to what they can actually do. I think they can do so much more than what they’re planning to do in their Whitepaper.  I don’t admit to understanding all of it, but the fact that your information will be accessible by financial institutions to go, “Well, actually these businesses already prequalify for funding. We can see their financial information. They’re meeting all our financial KPIs,” that’s going to give additional funding into the small business world, which will be absolutely epic.  Again, I can see the business evolving into a machine. I know they’ve got a very unique client acquisition strategy, which I quite like. I think going to the accountants and acquiring clients en masse is going to be huge for the Clarity project. I think that’s really going to create a lot of demand for the Clarity platform.  I love the name. I love everything that they’re about. Aynsley and Steven I’ve been following for a while. Aynsley’s run an award-winning practice, so has Steven. I’ve co-authored a book with Luke Smith who’s also part of the team. It’s just an amazing project. I don’t know how else to put it. It’s a fantastic project. You need to get involved with something like this.  You either get involved or you get left behind. That’s the way I see it. There is always a change curve. You can either be in front of the change curve or at the end of the change curve. It’s up to you. Hopefully that answers that question. Basically it’s amazing.  Why have I got involved with the Clarity Project? Well, I think it’s one of those things in life when I’d just sold my accountancy practice. I’d just met Steven. Everything just seemed to fit in line, and just fell into place, almost like it was fate. I’m a great believer of you create your own opportunities, but sometimes when opportunities land on your lap that just light you up, they connect with you on every level.  On a business level I completely get what they’re trying to do. On a global level, the global impacts that they could create with the Clarity platform, I just think, “Wow. This could create millions and millions and millions of giving impacts.” These micro giving impacts could be days worth of water, could be meals for the day, could be vitamins, could be dog vaccinations. The opportunities are endless.  Focusing on the 17 UN sustainability goals will be amazing. It’s something we’ve all got to be aware of as business owners that more and more people are asking to get involved with businesses that have a purpose other than just making profits.  I think the team are very well known in the accountancy world. They’ve been known to create success, and I just see this amazing future for the Clarity. They’re at the front of this curve. Yes, they’re going to make mistakes. Yes, they’re going to have things that they might roll out on their platform that might not work as well as we think. They’re at the start of this journey.  In two, three, four years time the Clarity platform will be a major, major player within the accountancy world. Get involved with the Clarity project as soon as you can, because if you don’t you’re going to miss out. You’re going to miss out on an opportunity of a lifetime.  Yes, the crypto market is on a bit of a low. We’re in November 2018, and the crypto world has taken a massive, massive hit. Like anything, you look at the internet back in the 90s and where that was, it went through the same thing. It had this massive growth curve, went on a massive loss curve. It’s not going to work. The internet’s not going to go mass.   Everyone was like saying, “It doesn’t work. It’s not a good idea, blah blah blah blah blah,” and then lo and behold I don’t know how many people are online now, but there’s said to be even more next year and the year after that, and the year after that, and the year after that, which is just mind blowing. I just love everything about the Clarity project.  I love the team. I love what they’re trying to do. I love the fact that they have that purpose. Being an accountant myself I see how their platform is answering a huge problem. I also see how it’s going to help accountants start to use cryptocurrencies, and that’s where the Clarity coin will become, I don’t know, I’d like to think it’d become a mainstream currency within the small business world.  The Clarity platform is a gateway for them to get users and get people using the currency. The more people using the currency, the more people that are subscribing to the platform, the more people then trading in that currency. The opportunities are literally endless. We’re only on the cusp of the start of this journey that is just going to be absolutely epic on huge proportions.  I’m really excited to be a part of the Clarity Project and to be an early investor. I’m hugely excited. To be quite frank, I don’t care whether the money is lost, because ultimately sometimes you just have to follow your heart. With this project, I certainly followed my heart because it’s a project close to my heart.  With the giving impacts that they’re going to create and just looking at the sustainability. I love the team. I love everything that they represent, and I think they’re going to go on to bigger and better things.  Watch out, the Clarity project is coming. It’s here to stay.",True

We want to empower entrepreneurs to change the world!  Clarity is the global business advisory platform empowering small business owners.  Small business is BIG business Small business owners are the backbone of the global economy. There are 168m small businesses around the world representing 95% of all business, with 30m in the US and 5.7m in the UK alone. Their success drives employment and growth, builds communities and creates a more stable economy.  Business is complex However small business owners are not achieving their true potential and are suffering on all sides. Business is complex and getting even more so! Business owners are working harder and longer for smaller returns and they earn less now than when they were employed. 60% fail within 5 years and only 1 in 10 last more than 10 years.  Technology isn’t helping. Entrepreneurs are drowning in information and starving for knowledge. Competition is rife and there’s a massive downward pressure on pricing. Automation and consolidation are transforming, and in some cases decimating, whole industries! Governments and financial institutions are paying lip service but aren’t really helping, and the large corporate machines are aggressive in dictating their terms of business and payments.  The Clarity platform The Clarity project is creating a platform, powered by artificial intelligence and blockchain, that will allow small business owners to take back control:  control of their data and incentives for sharing it with whom they want, when they want; control over their decisions and decision making ability; and, consequently control over their future.  We want to empower small business owners to make better business decisions using data analytics and performance improvement insights to drive performance and growth.  We also want them to enable them access to the right type of funding and investment that suits their particular needs at the best time for them and their business.  Finally, our platform will help small business owners create a business that works. Using our unique (and digital) business improvement programme, they will be able to store all their financial and non-financial data, IP, systems, processes and procedures etc in various wallets as part of a secure data room. They will be able to share this data, with whom they want, when they want. We’ll even reward them for doing so! Ultimately, if a small business owner is looking for funding, investment or to sell, our platform will make it easier to do so by increasing trust and driving down the cost of due diligence and legal fees, on all sides!  What about accountants and advisers? As compliance becomes commoditised, it’s advise or die for accounting firms!  Accountants are suffering many of the same problems as small business owners; competition, downward pressure on pricing, staffing and technological and regulatory updates.  Making added value and proactivity a reality, our platform will act as an aggregator combining many existing apps in one place with blockchain being the differentiator. We will provide accountants with a scalable business advisory solution that enables many of their team to deliver outstanding service, replace lost compliance revenue and the opportunity to become a true trusted advisor or the firm of the future.  UN Global Goals As an organisation, we support the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). If achieved, the 17 Global Goals would mean an end to extreme poverty, inequality and climate change by 2030. When Sir Richard Branson was at the launch of the SDGs, he said it was the first time that a world body recognised that is was entrepreneurs and businesses that would change the world and not governments.  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*AyRRsHGczT2Wyyny  However, we are three years in, and nowhere near where we need to be. Lise Kingo of the UN at SDG Annual Forum on 17 July 2018 observed that what we need is, “for businesses everywhere to step up and contribute the expertise, innovation and investments needed to turn aspirations into reality. The private sector is the fuel that can accelerate sustainable development at the local level. We need everyone to make the Global Goals, local business.”  And that why we do what we do, in partnership with the groundbreaking giving organisation, B1G1 (Buy1Give1) Business For Good.  Our vision The Clarity project is huge and our vision is even bigger. We see a future where Clarity is the one-stop shop for Small Business and the CLRTY token becomes the token of choice for small business owners (and their advisers) worldwide!  We see a future that supports business (and a world) without boundaries! Upcoming token sale (ICO) Our upcoming token sale (ICO) starts at the end of October/early November and there are massive rewards for those who get in early! You will be able to whitelist soon, in advance of the sale, putting yourself at the front of the queue.

Clarity is aiming to take some of the burden out of the funding and loan space for start up businesses by helping them keep better track of the profit and growth models, allowing other larger investors to find their way into these great start ups. Being a small business owner himself, Arcane Bear knows it's rare that people are there to help you launch, so the more people that do, the better!!

Whilst there is a lot of change occurring in the accounting industry, and the pace of change is increasing, there are some constants. In their separate firms, all four founders have been at the forefront of the industry’s technological advances and have provided businesses with underlying security amongst the tech evolution.  The majority of small business owners are passionate people and provide a good product, however having never been taught business or financial theory, they do not know exactly where their business is and how they can achieve their objectives.  A satnav alone is not enough. Clients always want to discuss exactly where they are now; the possible destinations they could achieve, and all the pros and cons of the various options they have to get there. The relationship between accounts and business will become ever more key as technology improves and so much more of what is going on in the business becomes visible.  The accounting profession is being disrupted because so much of the generic labour can be automated, outsourced or offshored. People are already employing qualified accountants in the Philippines to reduce costs for clients and using new technologies to automate processes even more.  The biggest players in our industry are QuickBooks and Xero. These two giants are growing their user numbers very fast and have huge reserves of cash to constantly improve their products. Right now, the use of artificial intelligence is primed to be included to accurately post transactions in a company’s books.  Blockchain is a very exciting innovation and we are already seeing the shoots of big and great ideas coming to our industry. For example, Ledgerium is a business creating a “triple-entry” bookkeeping system where transactions between two companies are posted in both their books and a separate single ledger. Another start-up, Evident Proof, is using blockchain to publicly verify the validity of contracts saving huge amounts of confusion and cost in the process.  We ourselves are founders of a blockchain built software platform; The Clarity Project. We’ve received consent from the Jersey Financial Services Commission and are currently raising the money to build our platform and acquire customers through our own digital currency.  This currency is really just a digitally transferable gift voucher for our future services and we already have token holders from all over the world buying CLRTY tokens at a massive discount in comparison to what they will be worth when our platform goes live in Q3 2019. Token holders will either be able to use the tokens themselves, or they will be able to sell them back to our customers through our website at a later date.  So, whilst huge technological advances will cause a “Blockbuster” or “Kodak” style collapse of many accountancy practices, our business model of innovation and embracing of technology means we will be protected and focus on our goal of working with clients through technological change in order to provide an ever better satnav for their business.

Effective leadership techniques have evolved over the last few decades and the way that managers interface with their teams has become more focused on getting the most out of people through coaching. Compared to a more directive style, a manager who uses a coaching style tends to foster an environment of collaboration and more open communication.  Build a confident team Coaching helps to identify the strengths and weaknesses of your team members. A coach who builds on each team member’s strengths and weaknesses can help to create a more confident team. If your team members are confident, they are more likely to push harder and go above and beyond what is expected of them.  Employee Engagement If your team members feel like they are working on repetitive, menial tasks, they will tend to feel less engaged. The best managers coach their teams through new experiences so that they can learn. Employees tend to feel more engaged if they are trusted with new projects and are more productive as a result.  Active listening Managers who adopt a coaching style tend to listen actively. They try to understand things from the perspective of their team members. Employees tend to respond positively to this and can be more motivated as a result.  Millennials Millennials have become a larger segment of the workforce and they tend to respond well to a coaching style of leadership. Millennials tend to welcome feedback and regular dialogue regarding learning and development. They want to be coached and developed rather than managed.  The founding team of the Clarity project have worked with, advised and consulted for small businesses for over 20 years. The Clarity platform will encompass all of the expertise that they have collected over the decades in a one-stop-shop for SMEs.

For growing businesses, cash flow is also a constant battle. The vast majority of small business owners are not earning the profits that they deserve, and they don’t know how to change. We want to give every small business owner around the world clarity so they can create a better business for themselves, a better life for their family and team, and ultimately contribute towards creating a better world.    Clarity for Small Businesses  Clarity is a single platform where small business owners can securely store all their financial and business data, such as staff contracts, bank loan agreements, insurance details, health and safety reports and so on. In fact any business document can be stored in a logical wallet system. When a user uploads their documentation or data we will be harnessing the power of blockchain to verify all of the data. Key ratios can then be mapped and charted, giving the business owner valuable insights into their business.  Clarity for Instistitutional Investors  Institutional investors, who would normally shy away from small-cap investments, will be attracted by the low due diligence fees associated with investing in the platform’s top performers. Prospective investors can then put in a request to view all the data they require. Investors will also benefit from more accurate, complete and up to date data, leading to better and more profitable investment decisions.  Clarity for Token Sale  As a part of the Clarity journey we will be holding a Token Sale, creating 240 million Clarity tokens and selling 220 Million tokens to the public that can be used to purchase services from the Clarity platform. The Token Sale is expected to start early July. This Token Sale will have a tiered pricing structure, allowing us to reward those who purchase tokens early on into the process.

The B1G1 Community holds a special significance with our founders as the vision of the Clarity project was born at the B1G1 meet in Birmingham last year. This community is certainly like no other, and the same goes for the annual conferences. The theme for the three days was JOY and this was definitely evident throughout the jam packed schedule. Aynsley, Steve, Luke and Julie all threw themselves whole heartedly into the activities that Paul and Masami orchestrated, as did the other 110 speakers, mentors and influencers at the conference.  Day one started on a very tuneful note, and the morning sessions were all met with rapturous applause and support – a notion that was maintained throughout the whole conference. No-one was ever sat still for very long as all members were carted off to the stunning ‘Gardens by the Bay’ in the afternoon, followed by a very poignant session from the Human Library. Listening to the real life stories of the ‘Human Books’ really highlighted the reason why we are all striving to create a giving nation that helps the those more vulnerable than us. The Giving Auction rounded off the first evening, with all proceeds going to four important charities, one of which was FreeToShine, a charity that Aynsley is proud to be on the advising board for.  Day two brought more inspiring talks, including Steve’s keynote on ‘Better Business, Better Life and Better World’. Steve really drew out all the core elements from the B1G1 book, and showed us how we can bring collaboration into our every day lives. We have uploaded a recording of this on our IGTV channel, follow @theclrtyproject to watch Steve on stage. Aynsley then delivered a really moving keynote, using the ‘my intent’ CLRTY bracelets as the centre point of reference. Aynsley gave everyone time to look back on the past few days and asked us to pinpoint the one word that defines how you live your life. It was a brilliant way to close the conference and a great opportunity to reflect. Day two ended with the glamorous awards dinner where Aynsley picked up the HABIT award for Tayabali Tomlin. It was a fantastic evening, and wonderful to celebrate with all the nominees and witness all the hard work that everyone’s businesses have been putting in behind the scenes. Team Clarity donated 50,000 CLRTY tokens as a special auction item at the end of the gala dinner which was snapped up early on. This was a great way for us to give back to the B1G1 community.  Saturday was another beautiful day and those who opted in were able to tour round the B1G1 offices and see where all the magic and big ideas sprout from! The tour finished up in the 1880 members club for a delicious three course meal and a round up from Paul and Masami themselves. Dinner was full to the brim with joy and the feedback from the whole group was truly heart-warming. Even though the conference had come to an end, the whole B1G1 experience was epitomised by one of the members over dinner saying that “the best thing about B1G1 is that there is no ending as our story continues to grow and grow”. Everyone who becomes part of this story and journey gets impacted in unimaginable ways. B1G1 is a community where you don’t have to explain yourself, and where your nationality becomes humanity.  It was incredible to be a part of the Singapore chapter in the B1G1 story, and the whole #CLRTY team look forward to what’s in store for the next conference in Hanoi 2020.  https://www.clarityproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Image-from-iOS-34.jpg",True

We did manage to sneak in a team building day at Universal Studios, which was a really fun day. All team members were sufficiently soaked by the Jurassic Park Rapids, so we’ll conclude it was a success! We started week two with a quick team swap as founders Julie and Luke returned to #CLRTY HQ in Jersey, and the lovely team from FundingTec joined Aynsley, Steve and Amy for Trescon’s World Blockchain Summit, Singapore Edition.  Day one was media central. Steve and Aynsley spent the morning in interviews and Q&A’s doing a fantastic job of explaining the project to a new network. It was great to see the Clarity brand was recognised within the community and that people were interested in hearing about our development in person as they had been following our progress on social media. Increase in brand awareness is really encouraging for us as a startup and we were certainly grateful for the FundingTec squad as the Clarity stand was always full with delegates! This conference was very well connected with over 500 delegates attending including investors, influencers and reporters. So it was a perfect opportunity for the whole team to chat with such an engaged group of people and get feedback on our platform. In addition, there were some very interesting fellow exhibitors at the event, representing a number of exchanges, so we took away a lot of really helpful information ahead of our upcoming public token sale in August.  On the second day we were really pleased that the footfall remained as busy as day one, particularly as Aynsley was speaking on the MainStage in the afternoon. It was also brilliant to hear that a lot of the talks in the morning were highlighting how Blockchain can be a catalyst for change, as this lead nicely into Aynsley’s keynote on Blockchain: A Force for Good. Aynsley’s talk was well received and sparked a few more conversations on our link with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Having been at the B1G1 Conference the week before, the whole team were freshly enthused about supporting the Global Goals through the Clarity project.  We finished day two competing in the StartUp World Cup Pitch, where Aynsley and Steve only had 6 minutes to explain the whole project vision to the judging panel.  All of the judges asked us some insightful questions from which we learnt a lot. The Startup World Cup Competition competitors covered a wide range of topics, it must have been really difficult to compare the projects against each other. Within the group, the Clarity project seemed to be one of the newest startups which is perhaps why we didn’t come away with first prize, but as always it was a great learning experience with good comments to takeaway and build on.  As always, the Clarity team throw themselves into each conference 100% so we were ready to get back home and recuperate before taking on the challenges of a new week. Singapore was, and is, an awesome place and it is safe to say that the idea of a Clarity Singapore office was thrown about more than once!  https://www.clarityproject.io/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Image-from-iOS-42.jpg",True

Yes definitely if you want to find some more information how the token will grow over time we have listed how the token will evolve in our whitepaper.  Once the token sale is complete and the platform is built we will be offering a purchase program for all token holders.  Here is how it is going to work :  Once the Clarity platform is up and running, we will be offering a purchase of Clarity tokens. These tokens will be used to supply users who are purchasing Clarity tokens from the Clarity platform.  If the token holder consents, an associated group company may elect to buy back Clarity Tokens from token holders at a price of 70% of the current market value. At stage 1 of the Clarity platform going live, the Clarity token market value will start at 0.00790514 ETH, at the current rate. In no circumstances does a token holder have a right to demand the redemption 15 or repurchase of their Clarity Token(s)  The purchase scheme will work on a first come, first served basis and will be based on the token usage.  Also, if deemed prudent, we could burn the tokens that we purchase, in addition to our burning of tokens upon usage, to further reduce the supply.  So if you purchase early in the token sale we will purchase your tokens back for more than you have bought them for.
