Sascha absconded, leaving debts behind.  The CryptoHunt ICO didn't reach the soft cap. Due to limitations on Ethereum transactions and a preference for a pull over a push model (i.e. it's more secure to have people request their own refund than to try forcing a refund by sending to everyone), you need to manually activate a refund for your address.

However, it's become clear to us that our intended softcap of 10 million will not be reached by the end of the ICO period. Through this process, we’ve learned a ton from both the community and our private investor considerations. With this in mind, we have decided to make some changes to improve the structure and timeline of the ICO.  📡 To be clear, Crypto Hunt is not going anywhere! 📡  What has changed? First off, we have received funds from private investors, which enables us to lower both the softcap and the hardcap:  ⚠️Softcap is now $5,000,000 ⚠️Hardcap is now $10,000,000  What does this mean for those of you who have already invested? After the ICO completes on March 15th, your contributions will be fully refunded, you just need to manually activate a refund for your address. Here's a step by step guide: http://bit.ly/2FTJSND  What are the changes to the ICO structure? We are going to launch a pre-sale, and the timeline of the entire ICO has changed. Early investors will be able to buy-in during this newly instated pre-sale, broken up into 3 phases:  Phase 1: 30% bonus from March 15th - April 15th Phase 2: 20% bonus from April 15th - May 15th Phase 3: 10% bonus from May 15th - June 15th  ❓How do I sign up to be an early investor to receive the bonus? Register/Login to your personal Crypto Hunt portal from the website https://cryptohuntgame.com where it says “ Join ICO”,  and contribute to the ETH address you’ll see in the user panel. PLEASE NOTE: Each investor in the pre-sale will receive their CH tokens within 24 hours from the purchase timestamp, and will be fully released.  ❕Contribute ONLY from the following wallets (other will not receive CH tokens): MyEtherWallet (no download needed) MetaMask (Firefox and Chrome browser addon) Mist (Desktop) Parity (Desktop) imToken (iPhone) imToken (Android)  🔊The new ICO crowdsale date is now scheduled for June 15th - July 15th!  THANK YOU: More than 5,000 of you have downloaded our Crypto Hunt demo in less than 20 days. This speaks to the amazing community, and we cannot thank you all enough for your interest, dedication, and contributions to Crypto Hunt! It goes to show that we are building something incredibly special here.  Exchange Announcement: Lastly, we want to leave you with some incredible news. Crypto Hunt now has 3 confirmed exchanges which we will formally announce on June 15th. We will be listing CH on these exchanges on July 16th, which is the day after the completion of the ICO. The demo will remain in the Google Play Store and Apple Store until we replace it with the full version come July.",False

Such a question, can I play anywhere in the world where there is cellular communication? If I collect all the chests in the nearest radius, will they reappear?  The chests will be manually placed in the bigger cities of the world (cities with population over 50.000). That way we will avoid problems with placing chests out of reach (like Pokemon Go did when they placed creatures automatically). The chests will reappear after certain period of time. It would be silly for a chest to not appear again after someone collects it, wouldn't it? That way the game would end when all chests are collected.",False

At the beginning of the game you will meet Professor Crypto who will guide you through the entire game, make you learn some cool facts, and reward you for playing. Professor Crypto will give you hints, set puzzles, and will ask you to find some cool objects. To reward your knowledge and effort, you will get other relevant items and Crypto Hunt (CH) tokens.  Let us give you an example: Professor Crypto gives you your first puzzle question: A  telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly. Patented In 1876, by Alexander Graham Bell. At this point you should know the answer is a telephone. Now, you need to put on your comfortable walking shoes and start exploring your own town searching for the right treasure chest hidden in your city. There are going to be numerous chests with random items, but only the telephone will take you to the next level.  When you have found one, you will have to give it to Professor Crypto. At this point he will give you a hint of the exact location of the treasure: An open public space commonly found in the heart of a traditional town used for community gatherings. You should have realized that the answer is the public square. So now you have to head over to the square to collect your new items, your next puzzle, and your Crypto Hunt tokens.  Throughout the entire game you will see different treasure chests, safes, and lockers that are protected by passwords, locked by different keys, numeric pads, fingerprint locks… and all of them protected by some sort of guard (dragons, leprechauns, ghosts…) that you need to get rid of to reach your precious coins.  But … beware of traps to stop you and thieves that will do everything to get hold of your treasure.   WHAT IS CH TOKEN?  Crypto Hunt is not just a game, it is also a crypto currency. It is an asset you can store to gain more value in the future; trade for thousands of other crypto currencies; withdraw at 99% of ATM's worldwide; or just spend it in every store, restaurant ... Crypto Hunt token (CH) is a ERC20 Ethereum based token.   WHAT IS AUGMENTED REALITY?  Augmented reality (AR) is a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are ""augmented"" by computer-generated or extracted real-world sensory input such as sound, video, graphics, haptics or GPS data. It is related to a more general concept called computer-mediated reality, in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. Augmented reality enhances one’s current perception of reality, whereas, in contrast, virtual reality replaces the real world with a simulated one.   ABOUT ICO (updated info)!

Presale: Phase 1: 30% bonus from March 15th - April 15th Phase 2: 20% bonus from April 15th - May 15th Phase 3: 10% bonus from May 15th - June 15th   What can I do to participate in the ICO? Obtain some Ether and fill the KYC form. You can get Ether on popular exchanges like Bitstamp.net, Coinbase.com, or bitfalls.com.  How do I sign up to be an early investor to receive the bonus? Register/Login to your personal Crypto Hunt portal from the website where it says 'KYC/ICO Login', then fill out the KYC process and contribute to the ETH address you'll see in the user panel.  On which platforms will the demo be playable? Android and iOS.  How can I cash my tokens out? Look for any crypto exchange listing our token (CoinMarketCap will help with that). Starting in 2018 we'll have Visa card support as well.  What is the entrance cost for the game? The game is free to play.  What about scaling? Cryptokitties - a game about collecting digital unique kittens - clogged the Ethereum network with transactions and slowed everyone's experience down.  What if this happens again? Or even worse - what if this game gets slowed down by another game? That's impossible.  Why? Because we only use the blockchain when needed. As players collect coins, we only initiate a transaction in these scenarios: When players want to withdraw to their wallet (only possible after 100 coins have been collected). When players encounter a unique in-game item which needs to be represented on the blockchain for its uniqueness. When players send CH tokens to each other. When players make in-game purchases with CH tokens. Everything else happens in regular databases on regular (but optimized and powerful) servers, functioning just like a normal, fast, well built blockchain-free game. No blockchain scaling issues possible!  Will there be a KYC (know-your-customer) procedure? Yes, to reduce the possibility of manipulation with sybil-attacks (by essentially having multiple-accounts).  Is there a maximum investment amount per person? Yes, the investment amount in the whitelist phase of the ICO will be capped at only 15 Eth per person. The remaining tokens will be sold in a public crowdsale which won't have per-account limits.  How will the game remain sustainable in terms of continuous payouts? We secured enough tokens for the following 3 years of distribution: and $1M in fiat for the buyback program.  How are you planning to increase or maintain the token's value? The $1M will be invested into the initial buy-back program. We've secured enough funds to maintain this approach for three years, and we're also committed to give 80% of all income from sponsors and partners back to its players. The company will only ever keep 13,5% of all profits.  When will the ICO be taking place? From March 15th to July 15th.  How much can I earn? The more you play the more you earn. There is no limit on how much you can earn. Each location will give you 1 CH and defeating a boss will give you 10 CH. Additionally, you'll be able to sell the special items you find in the game.  When and where will the tokens be listed? Which exchanges will support it? We will be listing CH on 3 exchanges on July 16th, which is the day after the completion of the ICO.  Can the tokens be used for something other than trading it on an exchange? Yes, you can purchase in-game items, abilities, and customizations with it. The prices of these items will dynamically adjust to reflect the tokens availability and value.  Does the CH team plan to issue their own debit card? We're in discussions about that with some payment providers. We're still not sure whether we'll be going with our own solution or implementing CH on top of an existing one.  Can I only hold my token in the game? No, you can hold them on any Ethereum address or exchange. It's just like any other Ethereum token and can even be put on a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet or a piece of paper.  Can I lose the token in the game? Yes, there are some ways to lose them. Long periods of inactivity are one way for that to happen. We'll detail the ways to lose them and to protect yourself against this loss in future discussions.  Is there a bounty system and if so, for what? We are the first game to reward you for cheating in the game or hacking it. For every discovered model of cheating, we reward you with an appropriate amount of tokens, depending on the severity of the bug. Every new idea you suggest and which we end up implementing will also reward you.  Are there any restrictions regarding participation in the ICO? You must be over 18 years old. Someone else (e.g. a parent) may participate for you if you're a minor. There are no location restrictions.  When will the KYC process start? It will last from March 15th until July 15th.  Why KYC? For preventing multi-account manipulation and stopping minors from signing up on their own.  When will the tokens from the ICO be released? Tokens will be distributed within 24 hours.  How many tokens can I win during the demo? You can score up to 1000 tokens during the demo. They will count towards your ICO investment as a 10% bonus on your investment in the crowdsale.",False
