Long story short ""there's gonna be great things coming, only it will be in the next 6 weeks - wait, let's do 8 - wait, 12 weeks should do - etc etc"". The catch is that in all the time they require (which tends to be way beyond their initial expectations), the context in which they operate can also change, and thus reducing the innovative edge they would have normally benefited from. I think HBT investors have learnt to take timelines with a pinch of salt, and overall there are currenltly more negative drivers to the token price than positives. By the way even though I expect HBT to go down in price short-mid term, I think it will eventually moon once the ecosystem is set into place as there are few teams in the cryptos panorama who display the same level of competence and integrity at the same time.

Team working marvelous & exceptional on project, check out telegram chat room.  well, Hubii Network building their own exchange. i am interested in this project. The Guy ""LASSE"" he informed me about Hubii Team Work.  Hubii Team built more things in five months> 1: they have built hybrid decentralized exchange. 2: A content distributer platform. 3: A scaling solution to ethereum. 4: Hubii Core  we will be see One interesting thing more ""Striim"" in coming weeks. If you want to learn more about ""Striim"".  Yes the project is actually excellent, and also about your point 3 do remember striim will not only be an ethereum scaling solution, but much more than that (Jacobo on telegram said it will be a protocol). Which is pretty much ready.",False

I have a very good feeling about Striim... And Cobra you make a great point: with only raiden out there Striim will shine...  ""We foresee striim will begin to be spoken about in the same breath as Raiden and Plasma."" - Jacobo Toll Messia, founder of Hubii  Jacobo: We faced what seemed to be opportunities but soon became handicaps. This meant that we either had to reduce our roadmap considerably and do what just other companies do (that is, building products that will not scale due to the current status of the industry) or, alternatively, push the needle and innovate. That was a tough call as we knew we could get into risky waters but upon serious analysis and consideration we made the bold move of going for it as we believe we could do it in a fraction of the time than others claim.  Hi Jan. I cannot and will not comment on what others are doing or how they are doing it as I thinkt hey should speak for themselves . However I will say that we did not find a suitable solution which is production ready. That implies, actively and passively, that most of the ongoing products being built today are either not possible to implement or will have phenomenal scaling issues which will immediately make them cumbersome to use and not fit for commercial purposes.  I don't want to think of us as pioneers of anything but instead that this is pure engineering. And something I have personally found over the last few months working in the Blockchain industry is a lack of engineering understanding. That is, simply put, how to build systems. Thus, we don't see ourselves of pioneers per se. We do see ourselves though as a group of well rounded engineers with a good understanding of the tools we use and how to architect products and, furthermore, we have had phenomenal guidance regarding the key building blocks of the ethereum blockchain. That has helped us to do a lot into what others might consider a record time. But when we speak about ""time"" it really gets relative . What I mean by that is that building something like this in 5 months might be fast for some people while for others might not necessarily be.  Regarding a bear market and trust, I think it is irrelevant to this conversation as trust is there or it isn't and it should not be adhered to the market going well or not. Why? Because we will do our work irrespective of the market conditions; we did it when Bitcoin was at $20K and we are doing it now when is at $7K.  Regarding your comment about the winners, well, that is ought to be seen. You have been a strong supporter of our community,  HBT and the team and you know that we have never hyped anything and, although we have suffered some delays due to - what is now - some very obvious reasons we like to focus on our work and deliver. When we do, we think that this protocol will be helpful and used. As a minimum, we do have a current business -hubii - which is in serious need of it.  We are not considering inception right now as when you focus on building such a solution you need to put 100% into it and avoid distractions. The team has been laser focused and will remain until we deliver, which is not far away.  HBT will still have the same role and will be used the same way as documented. We are now building a new product which, if successful will provide phenomenal results to all of us. That was not on the white paper either and we see it as a massive opportunity.  Well, the exchange within hubii core will be powered by striim so we will be eating our own dog food. Literally. 😂  Hopefully. Note that we are all up for building an ecosystem and helping others and so get help when needed. A healthy quid pro quo always helps the industry in every aspect.  Everything is about to be seen over the next few weeks. Our focus is on striim so we can deliver first hubii core with our exchange; it will be the best test where we have to eat our own dog food.  The repository is, right now, private. We have indicated we will make it public once we release the open source version of the wallet.  Striim is the protocol that, for example, hubii core will run on.  Striim will be powering first hubii core.  We will present all details, yes. So far, and the easiest way to comprehend how it will help us, striim will be used in hubii core as the tech on which we are building the exchange (to perform trades in a way the TPS is very large) and also it will be used to perform payments (which will help us to perform, for example, p2p payments from content distributors to content owners).  hubii core will be the very first commercial application using striim 🙂 We will first deploy striim and then deploy hubii core whereby the exchange will be using stirim. We are of the humble opinion people will find it good and powerful.  We use their API's and we do not interact with the companies themselves, no. Yes, we are planning on deploying hubii core's code as open source. We will probably want to have it in tip top shape before we make the entire code public. Also keep in mind it will be a good code sample for others to look at in terms of how to implement striim 😉  The platform per se is made out of two elements; striim and then hubii core. Striim is the protocol and hubii core is the wallet + exchange. Both will be released in May.  Marketing will start in May. I can promise that 🙂 I can even say our marketing will not only have crypto in mind but also mainstream media.  Jan, apologies on late reply but we are having a very hectic morning. The talk yesterday happened as I was invited to, what is called, the Nordic Media Days by an organization we are part of. The Media City Bergen; it is a cluster of Media companies from the region.  The talk was about one of the multiple initiatives we have going on and that, strictly speaking, we decided not to share yet with the world following the same principle we have sticked to; not sounding like we want to create noise without anything tangible.  Since November last year, as many of you know, we have been speaking with the Global Editors Network, GEN. We have been invited to the GEN Summit which we will attend to at the end of May in Lisbon. We will also be part of a panel discussion and, furthermore, we will have two workshops; one about micropayments (striim) and one about fact checking (hubii mind).  In that regard, hubii mind, we have had many discussions with GEN the last few months and we decided we would work together building a fact checking platform to be used through the European Elections 2019 to identify fake news being produced.  The talk yesterday was about that. So, we can now openly say that we aim at being an instrumental player fighting the fake news problem.  We have not yet fully engaged in the development of the platform because, as you can imagine, striim has end up taking most of our time.  We will focus on hubii mind during the summer.  Most likely we will provide more details about hubii film once we have had the event.  We will provide details about striim but I don't think that tomorrow given we have this event going on.  We have a lot to disclose about striim as it is not just ""another state channels"" implementation but instead an entire protocol and, as such, many things will have to be understood to take the most out of it (for those who will want to build tools on top of it).  We will start writing about it next week.  Jan: My (unofficial) calculations based on the information from the medium blog post: 120bn over 10y equals 12bn every year or 1bn striim tokens air-dropped every month. With 50% distributed to HBT holders this equals 500mn striim tokens to be air-dropped to HBT holders directly. With roughly 31.8mn total HBT tokens, every HBT holder should receive ~15.72 striim tokens for every 1 HBT per month.  Jacobo: Thank you @daniel9921 Note our solution is a hybrid; processing onchain and offchain. The 15 tps we talk about is purely circumstancial and not to be associated with the current limit of the Ethereum blockchain. We will explain over time the sauce that makes striim powerful as it comes down to a list of individual features that we use.  All those combined turns striim into a truly unique protocol.  bubba: xrp is at 1,500 tps. nano at 7ktps. i have read that to achieve higher scalability, other coins have needed to sacrifice some other pretty desired security features. im curious to see sort of a feature comparison vs other chains  Jacobo: @lmd4150 it is paramount to comprehend what others package inside their ""tps"".  We go from end to end.  Thank you Jan ! 🙂 Yes. The number of projects wanting to go through our platform is considerably large. That is why we will use Ian as the gate keeper who will curate those projects. We have good things coming up and we will deliver in all fronts! 😉  All tokens created from the projects will indeed be added to hubii core and immediately available for trading.  Thank you for that note. Yes, we are building an ecosystem of products that feed each other. Striim is the underlying protocol that will make things possible such as trading, micro payments, providing liquidity, etc  Fran, thanks for your message. We did have a Global partnership with Telefonica a few years back; we worked together on the FirefoxOS platform. We did have a very close relationship as they did work together with the TCL/Alcatel team.  I have been in contact through the last few months with them and they are aware of what we are doing.  Once we open up striim for potential partners to test it (we have a large list of companies that we have been in contact with re: striim) I will connect with them in more detail.  >""Will you actively market striim to other crypto projects in the weeks and months ahead? ""  100%  >""Will the migrated partners (such as bdnews24/ Telenor et al) also rely on the striim token?"" We will speak in a lot of detail about striim as there are a few elements to get your head around to truly comprehend the extent of the work we have done. It is not yet another ethereum scaling solution but, instead, a full blown out protocol with very clear purposes and ambitions.  But, yes, we have built striim with (among many) the intention to enable micro payments within our platform. And migrating those partners is something very high up on our agenda among other moves we are taking now.   I think there's no need to further comment..... invest savagely..",False

I've also got full confidence in their technical capabilities judging on the level of conversation going on in their telegram concerning the technical specs and also the overall openness. Also Hubii COO Mark Briscombe (https://www.linkedin.com/in/markbriscombe/) not only has been consultant of Omisego back in the crucial ICO stage but has a solid background with Telenor, and Jacobo has made it very clear that the partnership with Telenor (third highest market cap listed company on the Norwegian stock exchange) will also be a strong determinant in the use of Striim. This will possibly jumpstart Striim even ahead of Raiden.  Quote from: cjl1984 on May 23, 2018, 04:43:08 AM Hubii Network what is the project team doing? There are not many exchanges. As investors wait too long, they have no patience to wait. https://forkdelta.github.io/#!/trade/HBT-ETH and https://idex.market/eth/hbt is where it can be traded at the moment (also I think radarrelay) however Hubii will lauch its own decentralized exchange Hubii Core this month, but from what Jacobo said they also applied for listing on some exchanges. They still have heaps of unspent funds and that's a given, but as someone said before I honestly don't know whether paying a hefty fee for listing on binance would be worth it.",False

Yes, the chairman of our advisory board brought us to PRISA and our value proposition went down extremely well; what we offer is unique from many different perspectives as it solves a set of very important (and well known) problems.  We are in this for the long haul; our intention is to bring a set of key multibillion dollar public companies into Blockchain and I can comfortably say we are succeeding so far. We have more partnerships to be announced when the timing is correct. We are not speculating but, instead, aligning our comms and the other large set of efforts we are working on.

Isn't the trend in video content produced by individuals/small groups, going towards being free to the end user with content producers earning their income through adverts & product placement/promotion & influencing?  If so, isn't a decentralised Youtube like LBRY, specifically targeted at video content, which offers greater transparency, profit share and no blocking of producers for political reasons/other (Vs. YouTube) likely to be more successful for individuals/small producers and their consumers than a 'content marketplace'?  Also your content marketplace would be partly targetted towards distributors too and seeks to cover all content such as music/news/other. Wouldn't this be less appealing to consumers than a decentralised YouTube/ITunes/Reuters platform which focus specifically on consumers & a specific content type?  If so, it seems to me Hubii Network will likely appeal mostly to larger distributors & content producers which is a smaller segment of the stated market and one that gains less benefit from blockchain+decentralisation. The larger distributors and producers may actually not be able to be associated with a marketplace which has no content subject restrictions. As a result you would have to have content subject restrictions which defeats a key USP of decentralisation.  I'm only challenging as Hubii seems potentially undervalued and I've only just watched the video not read the whitepaper.  If not already, perhaps you could consider creating a consumer facing decentralised YouTube competitor which utilises your broader content marketplace on the backend, similar to what Hubii.com appears to be for news. Anyway good luck, I will try to learn more about it.",False

To celebrate the commitment shown already, Hubii Network’s parent company, Hubii AS, has decided to guarantee the success of the token sale by buying the number of outstanding sales tokens needed to ensure that the minimum funding cap of 18,000,000 HBT. This will ensure that the network will be built and the project will commence.  We have received a lot of positive feedback from the community and potential new partnerships are in the making — two things that encouraged us to continue with the project the way we envisioned it all along: transparent, decentralised and with focus on the community.  In that spirit, the tokens purchased by Hubii will be locked up for 36 months, released in monthly stipends. The tokens for the first 12 months will not be released until month 13.  As a way of showing our gratitude and appreciation for the tremendous support we have seen so far in the community we have decided to send a token of appreciation back to the community: Upon closing of the Token Sale we will immediately airdrop a 5% bonus (e.g. if you bought 10 ETH of HBT you will get the equivalent to 10.5 ETH worth of HBT) to everybody who joined the sale before block number 4,223,780. This is our thanks to those that decided early on to believe in Hubii Network and support our approach.

This is our thinking:  Integrity and transparency are at the core of how we we want to operate Hubii — both at the personal and the business level. We followed simple rules of engagement throughout the ICO: our script was honest, open, clear and concise.  When the opportunity to engage with the great boxer Floyd Mayweather was presented to us, we took a step back and paused for a few hours. We wanted to evaluate the upsides and possible downsides.  We wanted to know how could we leverage working with someone of the caliber of Mayweather and yet be in sync with the message we have been sending across.  When we discussed this with Mayweather’s team it soon became clear to us that both sides understood the potential Blockchain can unleash and how a solution like Hubii Network could be used in the near future to stream sports events as big as the $1B fight which takes place on Saturday. Sport is a giant percentage of all content consumed. We want to make sure athletes and sports fans know we will include them in our solution and we want distributors to understand that we are planning a build a solution that covers all aspects of our lives - quality news, sports, arts, music, film, you name it!  Floyd and his team understood.  Moving forward comes down to delivering and building Hubii Network and let it unleash new opportunities for us all. We need supporters to do so.",False

THANK YOU TO ALL!  Zeppelin Solutions Hubii Smart Token Audit can be found here.   Hubii's mission is to create the new leading Ethereum-based decentralised content marketplace where creators and rightsholders can meet distribution networks and reach content buyers directly, all while having total confidence in maintaining the integrity of their rights through the use of smart contracts.  Making use of smart contracts will allow Hubii Network to fix fundamental points in the content industry and apply mechanisms never seen before in the market. All this will be delivered whilst having full transparency, accountability and security over the transactions using a new cryptocurrency, Hubiits (HBT).  The goal is for the entire Hubii Network to be open source and decentralised in nature.  Kickstarting and catalysing this marketplace is Hubii's existing distribution network reaching out to over 50 million people daily. Hubii also has latent agreements on distribution partnerships which can reach up to 800M users.   Key Platform Features Content agnostic; will support text, still images, audio and video. Backed by leading VCs and industry influencers from the news, music and video space. Two sided marketplace dynamics. Catalysed buyer-side liquidity in the new Hubii Network by injecting Hubii's existing content distribution network. Digital Rights Management (optional), content ingestion and distribution. Open Source platform, secured by Ethereum's protocol. Existing business with global partnerships reaching to 50M users daily. ERC20 Token, HBT, a token with multiple platform utilities.   HBT Token Utility Removing exchange rate risk; Market for hedging and providing futures contracts to provide stable currencies. Stakers will effectively be able to earn an interest rate for their liquidity provision. Verification of content rights in Hubii smart contracts; Incentivised verification of intellectual property rights by token holder staking their tokens. Transparency; The native currency creates ability to provide participants total transparency of content analytics.   Content Creators' Existing Pain Points and the Hubii Network Solutions Content creators often do not get sufficiently rewarded for their work. : Using smart contracts they can decide how much they want for their content. Once content is distributed and published creators often lose control over their work. : Hubii Network provides full accountability and control over the content's lifetime. Dealing with many distributors adds complexity to the content sale process. : Hubii Network is a one-stop shop to hundreds of distributors and millions of users. Creators have a lack of insight into the consumer's interactions with their content. : Consumer profiling and forecasting tools will be provided to content creators.

You are correct - this is an ambitious project. We intend to disrupt how content is traded and consumed proper, changing the market dynamics for ever. We’ve set a minimum of 5M USD in ETH in funding for being able to develop the network. That will let us develop some minimum viable products, but we will probably need to seek more conventional vc funding routes later in that case. The token sale and creation is a one time event. Our current roadmap in the whitepaper takes into account 40M USD raised through the token sale. That will let us really accelerate development properly and create further value for the network as quickly as possible.",False

The team already has a certain business and knowledge in this market. They decided to go into another business model. But the connections remained (after all, proxy services are provided for 50 million customers), the potential of the market is enormous if  create a decentralized platform for the entire chain from the content creator to the content consumer. Collect 5 million dollars will not be difficult. But, of course, it is desirable to perform several iterations of 5 million as planned.",False
