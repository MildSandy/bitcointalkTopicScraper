As we work through these issues and enhance the functionality of the dapp, the website will still be available for any gaps in the functionality of the dapp. https://medium.com/@Lunyr/lunyr-dev-update-orbiter-has-landed-download-now-f5e94f6f81fd",False

Welcome all Lunyrians! The next evolution of Lunyr, the blockchain-based knowledge sharing platform, has begun. Our statistics show the rate of article creation is growing rapidly. Each month, we will introduce major upgrades to the platform. Lunyr’s team size is growing, and development will continue throughout the Open Beta.  The next step is to iterate until the platform aligns almost perfectly with the needs and expectations of writers, peer reviewers, readers, and advertisers. Right now, the experience for each type of user is rudimentary. A lot of resources, features, communication and designs are still missing. We’ve divided the Open Beta into 3 Phases:  Phase 1: Writers and Peer Reviewers Phase 2: Readers Phase 3: Advertisers  Every phase is designed with one goal in mind. Achieve product-market fit. As the Open Beta phase progresses we will get closer and closer to the future of knowledge sharing.  Other Updates  A few frontend issues surfaced during the launch, but we have addressed the majority of them. Users should not view the Lunyr Open Beta as the final destination but rather as a project in constant a state of evolution.  https://medium.com/lunyr/lunyr-dev-update-february-7-2018-the-next-evolution-of-lunyr-begins-451774665c60",False

With numerous changes coming up in the business world, major industries in the world have embraced cryptocurrency as the future. Throughout 2017, Bitcoin alongside other cryptocurrencies took the world by storm. Blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, impacted the world equally. Blockchain involves carrying identical copies of a transaction ledger throughout a network. Therefore, members of the network access the same entries through their computers. Here is a look at some of the industries that are being revolutionized by blockchain technology.  Finance Blockchain has undoubtedly changed how the world operates. In 2015, OMX Group and Nasdaq joined Chain, a blockchain startup,to test the trading of shares in the Nasdaq private market. Blockchain increased the accuracy of trading while reducing the settlement process. Blockchain also sped up payments especially across borders while reducing the cost significantly. Additionally, Blockchain has brought about smart contracts where commercial transactions and agreements can be conducted automatically. Blockchain technologies have not only increased efficiency but also reduced the operational costs for many businesses. In addition to digital currencies such as Bitcoin, businesses can operate across borders without challenges. “Blockchain has so much potential… there are thousands of blockchain use cases.” Chris Huls, Rabobank  Knowledge Sharing  As noted earlier, blockchain technology is quickly expanding beyond bitcoin through the concept of decentralization. What may ultimately occur is that peer-to-peer protocols, rather than companies, will disrupt major web services created in the last decade. Centralized systems represent single points of failure controlled by central authorities. Individuals relying on these systems must trust that authorities will not abuse their power to forward self-serving agendas. Yet, resisting the temptation to abuse power is difficult in practice for even the most respected authorities. Knowledge sharing is one domain in which decentralization will disrupt existing web services. There are various blockchain-based platforms that seek to reinvent the knowledge sharing space, and one such platform is the Lunyr platform. The Lunyr platform is built on top of Ethereum and is therefore decentralized, censorship-resistant, and autonomous. No single point of failure exists. No central authority or middle man owns or can corrupt the information. The rules in which people interact with the knowledge base and with one another are mutually agreed upon and enforced through smart contracts, which are publicly verifiable on the blockchain. Through the Lunyr API, decentralized applications will be able to tap into the knowledge base and grab accurate data on real world events and information. This leads to immediate benefits for Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications.  Ethereum enables the creation of app tokens, which can be used in an incentive system to replace intermediaries. In Lunyr’s system, tokens play a key role in providing economic incentives so that the rational behavior of individuals results in a common good. Contributors are rewarded for their work and are incentivized to continue increasing the value of the ecosystem.",False

Google places websites with trustworthy, accurate and user-centric content above others. The peer reviewed QA process (thanks to Wikipedia) is proven to work; but Google still needs to trust the website, and Lunyr will need to build authority over time.  When certain web pages grow in popularity and trust (i.e. a page about the different types of goat breeds), they gather backlinks from other reputable websites (backlinks work as a sort of voting system), and they will start climbing in the Google rankings - ultimately bringing in more traffic, more ad clicks and more LUN tokens for content contributors.

We are excited to announce that the Open Beta is set to launch on January 30, 2018. The Open Beta launch will represent a revolutionary breakthrough in the future of knowledge sharing. As we begin to establish the knowledge base, pretty soon the Lunyr API will come to fruition, which will allow developers to use the knowledge base as a backbone to create next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more.  The reward system will be released at the same time as the Open Beta. Writers will begin earning rewards for creating content, which will increase the readership on the Lunyr platform. In the early stages, Lunyr will serve as the go-to resource for reliable, easy-to-read and factual information about current and upcoming crypto projects. Once we grow a solid community of readers, we will aim to expand into other domains of knowledge including but not limited to innovative, bleeding edge topics in Finance, Law, Investment, Science, and Technology.  After the Open Beta, Lunyr articles will begin showing up in search engines globally. This includes Google, Baidu, Bing, and Yahoo. We are currently developing multiple language support (Chinese, Korean, Japanese, German, Russian, etc.) to achieve Lunyr’s goal of becoming a global censorship-resistant, decentralized knowledge base. Improving SEO and search relevance is on the roadmap.  Now that Lunyr will become completely functional, there will be a tremendous increase in marketing and branding for the next several months to drive readers and writers onto the platform.  https://medium.com/lunyr/the-road-ahead-e38f98cb3bb7",False

On behalf of all the investors, I wish to ask you a few questions and ask you for an urgent reply thereto. Please bear in mind that many of us invested our resources in LUNYR and we have every right to be informed about what is going on.  Here are our questions:  1/ Why is there no information from you on both Slack and on forum bitcointalk?  - when compared with all the communications of the GOLEM team, one can honestly conclude that you are doing nothing whatsoever.  From the very outset, the GOLEM team have been highly active. They have conducted communication on SLACK and on bitcointalk, or even by means of presentations on YOUTUBE. Their communication continues to date - which resulted in an increase in the GOLEM price – a considerable one. Sadly, you ignore us and only keep showing us screen prints of the SO CALLED work you do, that is specifically, screen prints of the website LUNYR. However, they are simply screen prints which anyone can actually generate in less than an hour pretending to be engrossed in work.  2/ Can you show us any film from your office?  3/ Can you provide any proof of your work?  4/ Will you be able to meet the deadline of the release of version ALPHA of the software for the testers?  Please try to understand that if you do not earn our trust now, there will be undoubtedly no more trust in the future. It is incomprehensible why you are spoiling everything right at the very beginning.  You raised millions of dollars in ICO – and now what? Silence? Laconic answers? Virtually no contact with us?  In view of the above, we expect a direct response from you and a substantial improvement of your image. But most of all, we are keenly awaiting a proof of your work, proof that you are really doing it. Screen prints do not mean anything, as they may be easily faked.",False

In fact, it doesn't have to be a scam, just that the project failed and the VC feels like he was screwed... call the lawyers  Crypto doesn't offer anything like that. They could run away with your cash so fast, and then what? Cry? Ain't no lawyer going to bail you out  There is a substantial risk investing in crypto projects. The development team should understand this and provide more communication to ease the fears.  Understandable, the price is where its at because people don't feel comfortable investing in the project, its that simple. I won't lye, I've got over 1k lun sitting in my ETH wallet and I'm getting a little nervous with how things are progressing.

It's always weak hands it's never someone taking in and securing gains and making them elsewhere...  I sold a bunch of TRST at .19 and bought back at .13---iy wasn't weak hands it was a gut feeling that the coin is only pumping due to speculation...which 95% of them are.  There are millions and even BILLIONS to be made by the average person with the foresight, but to call someone who disagrees with the hodling out of fear itll continue to rise is just foolish.  How come everytime someone takes in gains all the followers just shout weak hands!? Almost none of the alts today are being traded on fundamentals...so if they're weak hands then you're foolish hands...your foolish hands will likely make you more long term money but what I've seen with active trading for my friends and I, one could make at least 20% higher than just hodling, and that 20% can be a huge difference when you get up there.  Can't judge someone for being logical and taking secured gains to be used elsewhete, or return to the proje t at a lower price point. I was a hodler of ETH and it worked out well but I never thought the person selling it to me for $10 was a fool...he could've bought at .30 so a burger today is worth two tomorrow 🤓  For all I know the ""weak hands"" that sold me my first wth at like $7 turned all their profits into NEMcoins and we all know how well that turned out for early believers!",False

It's definitely possible that Lunyr might be pumped along with the other alts, but you never know. Also, it seems like Ethereum-based tokens track the price in a weird mix of ETH and BTC, so if both of those go up a lot, it is possible that Lunyr may increase in price too, especially if the team is able to show some early wins to the investors. Otherwise, it is best to set and forget this token, and just wait for the actual product rollout and launch for everyone.

This partnership represents a major step forward for our vision of creating a next generation world knowledge base that anyone can access.  “This is a very exciting project for us at Airbitz. Lunyr has an exceptional team and they have a vision that is both highly useful and ideologically exciting for those of us in the blockchain space. Knowledge and information is power. We think everyone in the world should be able to easily access and contribute to reliable, accurate information while at the same time being able to secure their own personal information and value while doing it. The partnership between Lunyr and Airbitz is an example of where technology is heading. Decentralized, open, secure, and liberating.” — Paul Puey, Airbitz, CEO  The user experience of managing private keys in Ethereum makes it difficult for a mainstream audience to adopt the platform. To solve this problem, we’ve teamed up with Airbitz, which has been working on a decentralized, secure, peer-to-peer synchronized, cryptographic key management system since 2014. With Airbitz, Lunyr users will have the ability to login and manage their accounts through a traditional username and password experience while maintaining a high level of cryptographic security. Users remain in full control of their private keys.

What are your plans for the funds you received from the ICO?  Sure, I know you already broke down how the funds will be used in this post:  Quote from: ICOcountdown.com on March 08, 2017, 04:53:09 PM [ Initial LUN Supply Distribution     Funding Usage Breakdown       But I believe investors have the right to know more than just simply, %'s.  Unless you start sharing more information about how you would use these funds, and also propose an incentive to get work done without getting cash upfront, as proposed in my post above, this looks like an obvious money grab to me.  Right now, you have ZERO product, and you're selling a DREAM. Nothing more than that. Do you have any platform to demo or for us to beta/alpha test? Why not? By now, as a business trying to get investment, how do you not have any product? Do you try getting investments based on pipe dreams and pipe dreams alone?  Why do you need to pay such a high sum, 15% to ""Founders, employees, and advisors""? What constitutes ""Research & Development"", or ""Benefits"", or ""Operations"", or ""Legal""?  Also, how can we confirm that the Smart Contract does exactly what you say it's supposed to do, like refund in the case of not meeting the minimum sum?",False

Having more knowledge does obviously offer the better edge (considering the price is stationary) if you're thinking of this as a future profitable venture but that edge is moot if eth hits $75 (and Lun remains at 44) now it's like the DAO 1.5 eth scenario.  obviously, for people who believe in the project for the LONG term don't really care about price, they care about the message and the idea, but we all know that's not the ICO game for 75%+ of investors. You understand risk/reward obviously, you don't sound uneducated (like myself), so the person investing with the least information stands to lose the most, or reap the highest gains.  I guess my point was, and we ALL know this or we're lying, you know how the ICO scene works for MOST people. So obviously the Lunyr ICO seems like it's structured to offer incentive for people to wait for more information, but with the way crypto's work, and have worked for a while, ETH could go much higher in a night...we in the US never fully know what Korea is going to be buying...and vice versa. So for everyone who thought 'hey ETH is remaining stable, I'll get in later when I have time' might find themselves getting 44 LUN for $100 or more, while many people like to take the better safe than sorry approach, countless people have gotten straight up stupid gains by betting on more than just evolving project valuation, because then you'll be in before the majority of investors realize the project is undervalued.  You bet big, you can win big...but hopefully (for them) no one is planning on getting LUNYR in a week and sees ETH hit a steady 60 or 70 or more by Weds...   Like I said I agree with the waiting factor being the reward itself for gaining more knowledge...but I think you're playing too rational in an industry that has proven time and time again that it will remain illogical longer than you'll remain solvent...that is if you're trying to play it instead of just hodling....big, intuitive bets followed with months of hodling is what made me and many others nice nice modest gains in value, and I suspect will continue to at least while this industry is the wild west of tech  Quote from: Mr.Ease on April 02, 2017, 12:58:48 AM Crowd sale is looking good.. few days in and already over 9K eth, almost 40% of min without early investor bonus.

I panicked when I first bought BTC and thought I lost like $300 in MAID (I know...the what, 15 yr old project?) when I sent it to a hard wallet.  I got it back with some help from a more knowledgeable person, and I think you could easily figure this out if you were to calmly do the same.  The nature of this scene is not for the non-tech-savvy. It's why I didn't buy into BTC at $20, and it's why I didn't buy into ETH at .30---that's partially why people make such big gains when they pick the 'future tech' because you got in when only 1500-5000 people know about it...then it gets ONE good mention on national news...and boom the non-tech people (which I basically am too) go and buy their first coins, but in way larger numbers than 1500-5000.....",False

I suspect a majority of the funds will be raised in the last day or so.   this is the only thing I'm thinking would make it hard to succeed, and if they just alter any ratios now (LUN/ETH) it might cause some friction.  I at first thought damn why didn't I wait in case eth drops, but now I'm really thinking ETH is going to go much higher. As soon as mainstream adoption/speculation occurs these coins can hit 300 no prob because it's nothing to most people interested in new technology/ventures. You think about it many 'coins' only had like 900 people or 2000 people that the networks consist of, and thats when they're under a penny or whatever.  TL:DR I wouldn't bet on ETH staying stable or crashing for more than a day. I think ETH is gaining mainstream space, and while it still might be a minute before it shoots (if it didn't already  ) I now think kinda firmly that ETH will hit 300 easily if it doesn't have some sort of fatal error exposed. Everyone brings up the DAO but those people are also apparently afraid to learn and improve their mistakes.  If this project succeeds then I think all those who invested early will be happy they did so, because I've heard 'normal' blue collar people talking about bitcoin and ether now...I'm diversified into many tokens but asap when I get some more work irl I'm getting ether with the checks",False

If you invest later, you have more knowledge. The first day investor cannot know as much as the last day investor. For example, you may think LUN is worthy of an investment at a valuation of $10 million. It makes sense then to wait till the last moment to invest, as you know more about the project valuation then than on the first day. If it's already more, then you can skip the investment. It is not a hope of waiting for ETH to crash, because I suspect most people already hold ETH.

I was around 15 when wikipedia was first being used by students, and I can think of countless times our dumb asses would alter articles for fun.  Having incentive would allow everyone to feel it was ""worth it"" more and let alone the fact that ads aren't bad (s) there I said it! One person said ""wikipedia with ads? Why would I want that?""

Didn't they say it's no bonus just the min/max til it's over?  Quote from: Cryptorials on March 29, 2017, 04:30:05 PM   Yes of course you're right, its not very difficult really.  I actually do have at least a vague understanding of what is happening in each step, and I've done similar things before - at least this time I used myetherwallet so I didn't have the hassle of trying to sync the chain, which I remember being a very long thing even quite soon after Ethereum launched.  But I still find it frustrating just how user-unfriendly Ethereum is. Its not enjoyable to use, for me, and as you say it puts a lot of people off which I think will be a problem both for Ethereum itself and potentially for projects using it if they don't manage to hide that in the background.  I agree I thought of this last night, the real hurdle is getting NORMAL everyday cash (or worse credit) lovers to be able to use this...I think that might be partially what 'Status' is planning to do...making a user-friendly mobile ethereum network? I've got analysis paralysis so badly these past few weeks but I think that's correct. I think it's actually FAIRLY intuitive (as an amateur computer person...like very amateur) but it bugs semi-frequently which can also then make people think the whole things freaking broken. I even got the 'Wrong Password' like 3 times today but since I know now my phrases are without doubt correct, I just kept spamming it until it unlocked and sent.  With the chain issue I did some extensive searching and the best method I found (worked for me until last like 200k blocks which took for freaking ever) was deleting the chain data I believe, and letting it restart...it like turbo'd through 1.8 mil or whateve the number was until the last few hundredK blocks.     btw is anyone watching the contract balance in real time?!?! haha I don't think they're gonna have a problem meeting their minimum lets just say",False

Most likely starting with any data from wikipedia that is verified, and going from there.  Contributors get the tokens (basically proof of credit in the contract) as incentive for contributing and peer reviewing...  Many, many hurdles from how do you know a contributor is knowledgeable (accredited does NOT necessarily mean they have a respectful grasp of any topic) to the network effect....but the network effect will be easily solved if they get the project really moving, and their team and pre-project is so well-worked and professional that I can almost guarantee it's not a scam. Not that anyone said it was, but that's a huge caveat with ICO's you know?  This one has (to me) 0% chance of being scam...that said it's much harder to gauge the potential success...especially when the tokens are started off ~$1.00!!!  I think it has YUUUUGE potential though as do many others...the future of this planet is blockchain or a derivative and anything that can be verified and incentivized through BC tech will be eventually. super exciting, kinda the potential missing link to getting 'true' information listed...because you get incentive!!",False

Lunyr builds upon the philosophy of Wikipedia and invents a next generation knowledge base on the Ethereum blockchain. Arnold Pham, the cofounder of Lunyr explains, “Lunyr can be thought of as the knowledge layer of Ethereum, driven by consensus and economic incentives, for creating next generation decentralized applications.” The long-term vision of Lunyr is to develop a knowledge base API which developers can use to create next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more. The Lunyr API holds promise for significantly changing existing business models and creating new ones. The Ethereum blockchain currently has no knowledge of the real world, yet most useful applications require real world information. Through the Lunyr API, decentralized applications will be able to tap into the knowledge base and grab accurate data on real world events and information.Read more",False

What is Lunyr? Lunyr (pronounced “lunar”) is an Ethereum-based decentralized crowdsourced encyclopedia which rewards users with app tokens for peer-reviewing and contributing information. We aim to be the starting point of the internet for finding reliable, accurate information. Our long-term vision is to develop a knowledge base API that developers can use to create next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more.   What are Lunyr tokens (LUN)? LUN are used to place ads on the platform. They function as part of the incentive system to drive contribution, peer review, and dispute and quality resolution. LUN follow the ERC20 token standard. They are currently listed on Binance, Bittrex, and other major exchanges.   What is the total supply of LUN? LUN are not mineable and have a fixed total supply of 2,703,356.   Lunyr in the News                  The Team   The Lunyr team consists of serial entrepreneurs, technical leaders, and successful advisors. Each core team member has cofounded at least one startup. All together, the team possesses the capabilities to not only build the project, but also create and grow a viable business. The leadership team actively contributes to the Ethereum community and organizes the second largest Ethereum meetup in Silicon Valley.       Arnold Pham | CEO, Cofounder   Arnold cofounded Leandigest Inc., a Silicon Valley-based tech startup, as CEO.

Before entrepreneurship, Andrew worked as a Project Manager, and later, Account Executive at Oracle where he closed the largest ever hardware deal for their small-medium business division. He holds a B.S. in Computer Science from University of California, Los Angeles and an MBA from University of California, Davis.       Christopher Smith | CTO, Cofounder   Christopher was the Cofounder CTO of BitMesh, a decentralized platform that enables users to share their internet connections. He has developed algorithms for Internet of Things and Deep Learning applications. Christopher possesses over seven years of experience as a software engineer.

Market   A strategic component of the Lunyr platform is its advertising system, which allows for the purchase of advertising on the platform using Lunyr tokens (“LUN”). Although the Lunyr platform is unique in its design, decentralization, and vision, it can be compared to Wikipedia.   Wikipedia today ranks as the sixth most visited site in the world according to Alexa rankings. It attracts 470 million unique visitors who view over 19 billion pages per month. Estimating the amount of advertising revenue Wikipedia could generate if it allowed advertising on its pages provides clues to the potential demand for LUN:   In 2006, Jason Calcanis, the cofounder of Weblogs, Inc, which was acquired by AOL, published an article about Wikipedia estimating an annual advertising revenue potential of $100MM. In 2008, BusinessInsider.com performed an analysis of Wikipedia and arrived at an annual advertising revenue potential of $350MM. In 2011, Vincent Juhel published a thesis about Wikipedia for HEC Paris, and arrived at an annual advertising revenue potential of $1.6 billion dollars.      Vision   We will initially focus on fine-tuning the system to improve accuracy, increase content, and grow readership. Once the knowledge base matures, we will attract a wider audience by encouraging contributions of near real-time data on world events and translations in multiple languages. Ultimately, Lunyr intends to establish its brand globally as a reliable, accurate decentralized knowledge base.   Taking it a step further, we will grow the ecosystem by developing an API that will attract developers. This Lunyr API will allow developers to use the knowledge base as a backbone for creating next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more.   Lunyr API The Lunyr API holds promise for significantly changing existing business models and creating new ones. The Ethereum blockchain currently has no knowledge of the real world, yet most useful applications require real world information. Through the Lunyr API, decentralized applications will be able to tap into the knowledge base and grab accurate data on real world events and information. This leads to immediate benefits for Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality applications.   Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence projects similar to Siri or Amazon Echo are enhanced with the Lunyr API. When users ask fact-based questions, the decentralized application can dig through the Lunyr knowledge base and provide users with reliable, accurate answers.   Virtual Reality The Lunyr API will enhance the intimate and visceral experience of interactive virtual worlds. Imagine putting on a virtual reality headset that lets you experience walking on the surface of Mars. As you walk along the cold, red-dusted ground, information about key landmarks and giant dust storms appear. All of this information is drawn from the knowledge base.   Augmented Reality The Lunyr API can be the foundation for learning-based applications in Augmented Reality. Imagine you are at the beach on a sunny day and you see beautiful flowers by the seashore. You want to know what they are so you put on augmented reality glasses, which will identify the flowers, tap into the knowledge base, and give you all the information you need to satisfy your curiosity.
