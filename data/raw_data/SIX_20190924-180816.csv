Over 60% of their income is currently being stripped off to the middlemen. For an example, if their revenue is 100$, they would only receive 40$ since the middleman, such as payment processor, application platform or marketplace, took the big chunk out of their income. Also, each platform usually contains a token that can only be utilized on their respective platform, thus making it virtually impossible to transfer the token to different platforms. These tokens also usually do not hold any monetary value so they cannot be used in a typical financial transaction.  SIX network is one of the first ICO projects that focused on solving problems for over 100 millions creative workers around the world to help them lead a better life. SIX network is formed by the group of companies that own leading creative platforms in South East Asia. These companies are comprised of Ookbee U, a joint venture between Tencent and Ookbee, Computerlogy, a company expert in technology and big data, and YDM from South-Korea. There are over 10m creative workers and 85 million USD revenue circulated on our platforms combined monthly and we have the plan to replace SIX token as a medium of our future.  SIX network started ICO process in March 2018 and sold out all of its tokens in May 2018. In June 2018, we continued to roll out our Strategy & Vision to solidify the confidence of our investors. One of our goals is to become the first platform in the world to change the perception of Blockchain technology from difficult to use and interact to become the technology that is easily applied and applicable in our daily life for creative workers and normal users.  Growing with partners and communities  In today’s world, we can’t ignore the fact that the trend of application development is to use API system acting as a bridge to connect other applications to the platform. At SIX network, we have one of the best team of developers that are expert in API development in the country. We hope to develop our infrastructure to become Blockchain-as-a-service. This year, we are developing SDK for our partners and developers to use via our infrastructure through our API system. This way partners can use “Pay with SIX” system that is integrated with our API, making their integration as easy and seamless as possible.  Alliance with Strongest Partners  Mr. Vatchara, Co-CEO of SIX network, said:  “SIX network has formed a partnership and co-invested in Chomchob, which is a platform that collected points/tokens from different providers and converts into over 200,000 products and services in Thailand. When we are fully SIX Token to Chomchob platform, SIX is developing its token utility to enable purchase of products and services in our daily life such as exchanging the tokens as a money coupon in fast food restaurant to purchase the foods.”  read more on : https://six.network SIX network community : https://t.me/SIXNetwork",False

SIX.network uses blockchain technology and smart contract functionality to reinvent the digital economy by building a better infrastructure through SIX Digital Asset Wallet, Decentralized Financial Services, and Wallet-to-Wallet (W2W) Decentralized Commerce. With this economic infrastructure, SIX can create an ecosystem that is transparent, fair, secured, and efficient for all stakeholders in the digital and creative economy.  Why should we develop SIX ? What do we solve ? In today’s digital and creative industries with over 10-million creative workers, there are fundamental problems among payment processors, gateways, and financial institutions versus creative platforms, content providers and audiences in the supply chain, including high financial transaction fee. Moreover, the digital asset and virtual money (platform-generated token) are not valued by financial institution and unable to be exchanged to other platforms.  Our story SIX.network is originated from one of the largest digital media startup groups in Korea and Thailand, OOKBEE U Company Limited and Yello Digital Marketing Global PTE LTD. The alliance aims to create a more transparent, fair, secured, and efficient ecosystem for all stakeholders in the digital and creative economies.  What is the cost of each SIX token? What currency do you accept? Token Main Sale Price : 1 SIX = USD 0.10 We accept Ethereum(ETH) and Stellar Lumen(XLM).  I am an US citizen. Can I participate in the ICO? SIX.network is a worldwide ICO and open to everyone. However, Civils in the jurisdiction of the US, China, and Singapore are not able to join this ICO contribution according to the laws. Apologize for inconvenience this may cause.  What is the Hard cap, Soft cap and what is the total token supply? A soft cap and hard cap are fundraising goals. A hard cap is the absolute upper limit a team will take. Whereas, a soft cap is more speculative. A soft cap is typically a lower limit, more like how much a team is aiming to raise.  According to our number, our Soft cap is 15,000,000 USD and Hard cap is 42,905,579 USD. There is a total if 1 billion SIX tokens supply.  Is there a minimum contribution stake? Yes, minimum of contribution is 1,000 SIX tokens. For example, cost of 1,000 SIX token is 3,000 THB and currently 1 ETH is 14,500 THB. So the minimum of contribution is 0.2 ETH.  Pre-Sale ICO Dates : April 03, 2018 ICO Sale Dates : Right after the public pre-sale ends ICO Sale End : May 31, 2018 or allocated tokens are sold out    INTRODUCTION VDO | WHITEPAPER | WEBSITE | FACEBOOK | TELEGRAM  Proceed to ICO: CLICK",False
