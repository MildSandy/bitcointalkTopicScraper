However, since we will be a cross platform application, you can also watch our content on the Google Cardboard, the PlayStation VR, as well as the Samsung Gear VR for cellphone users. If you are a PC user, we would definitely recommend using the Oculus Rift.  You just have to download the concertVR app, purchase a code via standard payment systems or cryptocurrencies and you can enjoy their favorite concert, wearing any VR glasses. Alternatively, you can also watch the concert via other devices like your PC, laptop, smartphone or tablet.

While the music industry has been booming over the last couple of decades, several problems with attending concerts spring up: only a limited number of tickets is available (and those are sometimes sold out within minutes!), and not all fans can travel to the concert venue due to distance, work schedule or ticket price. ConcertVR will radically change this by providing music fans with comparable streaming quality to that of live performances! With the concertVR app on your smartphone, PC or tablet and a VR-headset you will be able to enjoy your favourite artists’ songs both live, and on demand at any time! What’s more, you’ll have the option to choose between three different perspectives to make the most of your experiences, the middle of the crowd, the front row, and even on stage next to your favorite artist! Additional features like 1-1 performances as well as backstage coverage and social media integration will enhance them even more.  Based on our blockchain solution which which ensures secure and transparent transactions, concertVR will reduce costs and the risk of hackers' interference, creating a win-win situation for the music industry as well as for the music fan. All data will be stored on a decentralized cloud based data bank which will be held on the net in blockchain nodes.  No user data will be stored on concertVR servers or sold to third party companies.     Token Design:  CVT is designed as a standard utility token, running on ethereum, and will be used as  cryptocurrency for purchasing concertVR services -  alongside with bitcoin, ethereum and traditional (fiat) payment methods.  As a closed ecosystem, concertVR will only mint 400.000.000 tokens. The unsold amount of tokens left after the ICO will be burnt to promote deflation. The coin's value will depend on the number of customers. Since the music industry has been prospering in the last 2 decades, the revenue from live concerts looks promising. This, and the fact that demand for VR products is constantly growing, concertVR stands a high chance of success. And tokens are expected to rise in value as demand for the platform increases.   The Roadmap:    Token Allocation and Distribution:   The product:  Enjoy real concerts in Virtual Reality – in real time or on demand at a time of your choice Once purchased, enjoy your content across any platform – on your smartphone, VR glasses, browser or SmartTV Choose from different camera perspectives, where you want to experience the concert from Search different categories and find your favorite artists and acts Buy individual songs or entire concerts simply by in-app purchase Enter a coupon code and enjoy selected content for free Let your friends know which concert you are watching via social media Experience their reactions in real time in the app Invite friends directly during the concert and chat with them  Our Team:  Sebastian Deyle - CEO  Andreas Knuffmann - Co-Founder and CCO  Frank Zahn - Head of Development & CDO  Robert Clemens - Development  Stefan Schulz - Executive Board Advisor  Jan Mewes - Artist Acquisition  Dennis Weidner - Advertisement & Community Management   Our Advisors:  Giovanni Cicivelli - Financial Advisor  Winheller Law Firm - Legal  Maik Fahldieck - Development Advisor  Jonas Lempa - Development Advisor  Thilo Richter - Crypto-expert  Jan Bollmeyer - Crypto-expert  Julia Hennings -  HR Board Advisor  Important Links:  Telegram Facebook Twitter Youtube Instagram Reddit",False
