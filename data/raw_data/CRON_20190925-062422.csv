The usage of the micro-service architecture (MSA) gives the opportunity of using different technological stacks needed for the tasks of a particular micro-service. The main technological stacks that we use include Java languages (for the business logic), C ++ (for high-loaded channels), Go (for working with allocated environments), besides, we are also planning to use such programming languages as PHP, Ruby-on -Rails and Javascript. The user interface is formed using the HTML5 stack and the ReactJS framework. For mobile apps, Java (for Android) and ObjectiveC (for iOS) are used. For desktop apps and integration with blockchain, C ++ and Java are used, for Windows - C #. For the database, open source databases are used. In future, the source code will be placed in GitHub. The complete Continuous Integration- Testing-Deployment chain is configured for the immediate release.",False

The usage of the micro-service architecture (MSA) gives the opportunity of using different technological stacks needed for the tasks of a particular micro-service. The main technological stacks that we use include Java languages (for the business logic), C ++ (for high-loaded channels), Go (for working with allocated environments), besides, we are also planning to use such programming languages as PHP, Ruby-on -Rails and Javascript. The user interface is formed using the HTML5 stack and the ReactJS framework. For mobile apps, Java (for Android) and ObjectiveC (for iOS) are used. For desktop apps and integration with blockchain, C ++ and Java are used, for Windows - C #. For the database, open source databases are used. In future, the source code will be placed in GitHub.

To ensure the interests of project investors are addressed and to expedite the growth of the price of the CRON token, the following measures are proposed: The commission fees are charged in CRON tokens, which will ensure a constant growth of the tokens demand; The tokens can be used to finance margin trading in the exchange; 50% of tokens collected for internal services will be destroyed on a monthly basis*; 30% of the collected commissions will be sent to support and develop the project; 20% of commissions will be sent to maintain the exchange liquidity of the token.  * - the tokens will be burned by transferring coins to the address of a special smart contract guaranteeing the impossibility of their recovery. This will allow to generate a deflation model of the token economics, a permanent decrease in the number of tokens with an increase in the volume of services provided will ensure a proportionate increase in their price.  When it'll be a fully functioning system?   Release of the first version of the fully-operated ecosystem CRYPTOCEAN planned on November 30, 2018   So you're planning to start partnership with all the banks so we can use any ATM??   We're going to constantly widen our partner network to make our services as comfortable for the clients as possible. We have already signed some agreements with Russian banks and those located in EU.   When you actually plan to start issuing crypto cards?   We plan to launch the alpha version of cryptocurrency cards later in July.  What is the minimum investment for the ico?   The minimum on Pre-ICO is 100 USD \ 10.000 CRON.   In which countries  your partner banks issuers of cards?   We are working closely with Germany, Estonia and Russia. This means that we are preparing the issue of cards for Russia, and German and Estonian cards will be available around the world with logical restrictions (Iran, China, Singapore and other countries where crypto-currencies are not regulated or banned). In addition, we are aimed at expanding the scope of our cards and after the launch of European and Russian history, we will switch to other promising markets - Japan, Korea, Asia in general.

To ensure the interests of project investors are addressed and to expedite the growth of the price of the CRON token, the following measures are proposed: The commission fees are charged in CRON tokens, which will ensure a constant growth of the tokens demand; The tokens can be used to finance margin trading in the exchange; 50% of tokens collected for internal services will be destroyed on a monthly basis*; 30% of the collected commissions will be sent to support and develop the project; 20% of commissions will be sent to maintain the exchange liquidity of the token.  * - the tokens will be burned by transferring coins to the address of a special smart contract guaranteeing the impossibility of their recovery. This will allow to generate a deflation model of the token economics, a permanent decrease in the number of tokens with an increase in the volume of services provided will ensure a proportionate increase in their price.",False

Regulation: The majority of crypto exchanges do not operate fully legally. It means that they may disappear at any moment and there will be nobody to bring claims to. It has happened before. We are aiming at making our business fully legal and regulated which will allow our clients to be sure that we are rendering legally safe long-term services. Simplicity: Cryptocean will provide you with one account for the fiat funds and cryptocurrencies, which means that you will not need to open separate accounts in banks and crypto exchanges.

This will allow to generate a deflation model of the token economics, a permanent decrease in the number of tokens with an increase in the volume of services provided will ensure a proportionate increase in their price.",False

We create not only services for end customers, but also an ecosystem for connecting exchanges, payment services, banks, offering their services, and using the opportunity to place their bids. At the same time, all participants in the system are identified by KYC and conduct transactions in the legal field.    Customer benefits: mobile application, a plastic card with binding to any crypto currency, the ability to safely store crypto currency, fast and cheap money transfers.    The benefits of partners (fintech services) will receive a stream of orders, and if the partner wants to increase this flow - it reduces the commission, which allows the partner to get more customers.    As a result, everyone wins, both users of the system and financial services. First of all you, as a potential client and investor.

Escrow accounts allow to make protected transactions between two or more parties with the independent confirmation from the agent ensuring compliance with the terms of the transaction. CRYPTOCEAN acts simultaneously as an intermediary agent that guarantees the fulfillment of the terms of the transaction, and as a payment system that provides funds transfers. The service is provided together with partners - banks and payment systems. Within the framework of the service, it is envisaged to carry out traditional bilateral transactions on the exchange of the cryptocurrency or the exchange of the cryptocurrency for the non-cash fiat money. The service guarantees that upon completion of the transaction, both parties will exchange funds, or receive their funds back, if one of the parties fails to comply with the terms of the transaction. The presence of partner banks in the chain makes it possible to conduct more complex transactions in which cash in the fiat, bank cells, shares, precious metal bars and any other types of assets with which partner banks operate can be involved.",False

Our service is different from competitors that offer for example plastic crypto cards or wallets services. We create not only services for end customers, but also an ecosystem for connecting exchanges, payment services, banks, offering their services, and using the opportunity to place their bids. At the same time, all participants in the system are identified by KYC and conduct transactions in the legal field.   Customer benefits: mobile application, a plastic card with binding to any crypto currency, the ability to safely store crypto currency, fast and cheap money transfers.   The benefits of partners (fintech services) will receive a stream of orders, and if the partner wants to increase this flow - it reduces the commission, which allows the partner to get more customers.   As a result, everyone wins, both users of the system and financial services. First of all you, as a potential client and investor.

Our service is different from competitors that offer for example plastic crypto cards or wallets services. We create not only services for end customers, but also an ecosystem for connecting exchanges, payment services, banks, offering their services, and using the opportunity to place their bids. At the same time, all participants in the system are identified by KYC and conduct transactions in the legal field.  Customer benefits: mobile application, a plastic card with binding to any crypto currency, the ability to safely store crypto currency, fast and cheap money transfers.  The benefits of partners (fintech services) will receive a stream of orders, and if the partner wants to increase this flow - it reduces the commission, which allows the partner to get more customers.  As a result, everyone wins, both users of the system and financial services. First of all you, as a potential client and investor. Under this link, you can learn more about the benefits and opportunities that the ecosystem participants receive.    On the question of who are your competitors? we will respond simply. We do not have competitors, we have partners.

Our partners are payment systems and finteh projects, for example, in white paper you can see some of them, with some we finish paper formalities and add information within 5-10 days.    Such projects as Paymon (crypto-currency wallet and messenger), CWP - this team developed a hardware USB-based computer on the basis of which we are preparing to launch our cold wallet.

Our service is different from competitors that offer for example plastic crypto cards or wallets services. We create not only services for end customers, but also an ecosystem for connecting exchanges,  payment services, banks, offering their services, and using the opportunity to place their bids.  At the same time, all participants in the system are identified by KYC and conduct transactions in the legal field.  Customer benefits: mobile application, a plastic card with binding to any crypto currency, the ability to safely store crypto currency, fast and cheap money transfers.   The benefits of partners (fintech services) will receive a stream of orders, and if the partner wants to increase this flow - it reduces the commission, which allows the partner to get more customers.  As a result, everyone wins, both users of the system and financial services. First of all you, as a potential client and investor. Under this link, you can learn more about the benefits and opportunities that the ecosystem participants receive. On the question of who are your competitors? we will respond simply.

The users can make transfers of the cryptocurrency to the external crypto wallets, the fiat to the external accounts and the payment systems accounts. Also, the service can accept transfers of cryptocurrencies and the fiat from external services to the users' wallets. Internal transfers of the cryptocurrency and the fiat (under simple conditions), are carried out without commissions. External transfers may include a commission from both the service and the external payment systems. In the process of the transfer, funds can be automatically converted from one cryptocurrency into another or into fiat money at the internal (profitable) exchange rate.  The conversion of any of the TOP-100 main cryptocurrencies is carried out for. The automatic trading on crypto-exchanges provides getting the most favorable exchange rate and minimal commission for its users. Conversion can be carried out as a separate transaction - at the user's request, instantly while performing other transactions within the CRYPTOCEAN platform, for example, in the process of paying for goods or services.  The user can specify either a certain cryptocurrency or a wallet from which the funds for conversion will be withdrawn, as well as the group of ryptocurrencies, priorities, limits and withdrawal strategy. For example, first – to use up one cryptocurrency, then to switch to another, or to write off gradually in predetermined proportions).  When converting the fiat into cryptocurrencies and the cryptocurrency to the fiat, partner banks are involved. It is from their accounts that the fiat funds are received and credited. Both sides act in compliance with KYC & AML procedures occurs in accordance with the requirements of the legislation of those jurisdictions in which they operate.  Non-cash exchange of the fiat and the cryptocurrency may be carried out anywhere in the world with the access to the Internet and the bank account. For cash exchange, you will need to contact the bank's branch office or use an ATM and a crypto-card issued in partnership with CRYPTOCEAN.

In addition, if necessary, the service will protect the user from illegal tracking of wallet addresses and transactions, introducing the concept of confidential proxy-wallets, according to which an attacker will not be able to track the address of the sender of funds.  Another useful option is the opportunity to analyze payments and transfers, as well as to group accounts and wallets of counteragents. This will make it easy and convenient to find wallets and payment details for the next payment, view the history of transactions by time and counteragent. In addition, the user will be able to view and analyze the statistics of operations in different sections.  The keys to the wallets can be stored either by the user or by the service. To carry out automatic operations, upon the request of the service the confirmation will be required. For the convenience of users, it is possible to separate wallets: into those which keys are stored by the user, and those that are controlled by the service using a multi-signature.  The user can generate additional access keys to the wallet and add the option of managing them by the CRYPTOCEAN service and at any time the user may recall them back. The service guarantees the removal of user keys from their databases. However, in the latter case, the responsibility for storing the keys is entirely user’s.  The service offers a key deposit service, then the key is stored in a special secure database, without connecting to the Internet, access to which is possible only within the framework of a multi-step key recovery procedure (this function is not provided for transactions, it is only for the maximum security and safety of funds of the client/heirs).  With the help of the service, multifactor identification and confirmation of operations are configured - by entering the code received via an SMS, a mobile application or biometrics (fingerprint). The level of identification can be tuned for individual wallets or their groups depending on the established limits for the operations being conducted.  In the service it is possible to specify cryptocurrencies and wallets from which the funds will be debited in the automatic conversion to the fiat, the priority of keeping the cryptocurrency, the conversion strategy (for example, at first spend one, then another, or gradually write off from different ones).",False

Regulation: The majority of crypto exchanges do not operate fully legally. It means that they may disappear at any moment and there will be nobody to bring claims to. It has happenned before. We are aiming at making our business fully legal and regulated which will allow our clients to be sure that we are rendering legally safe long-term services. Simplicity: Cryptocean will provide you with one account for the fiat funds and cryptocurrencies, which means that you will not need to open separate accounts in banks and crypto exchanges.",False

You will need to spend considerable amount on marketing and to actually reach more people until you hit the hardcap. It is also easier for the team to raise the 10 mil in stages rather than a single sale. However in the whitepaper (page 30) it is mentioned that there are three stages to the sale: the private pre-ico which is done. public pre-ico and the main ico. where did you see the lightcap? maybe it is the private pre-ico,False

Customer benefits: mobile application, a plastic card with binding to any crypto currency, the ability to safely store crypto currency, fast and cheap money transfers.  The benefits of partners (fintech services) will receive a stream of orders, and if the partner wants to increase this flow - it reduces the commission, which allows the partner to get more customers.

With the help of crypto cards, you can pay for goods and services, receive cash in ATMs.  The user's funds can be stored in one or several cryptocurrencies. When paying or withdrawing money from the account, a choice of crypto currencies is made in accordance with the priorities indicated by the user and the the most favorable exchange rate.  Crypto cards are issued jointly with partner banks, which provide accounts to service customers. Banks provide legality of operations and execution of KYC & AML procedures, but they only work with fiat currencies.  As a result of integrating banking services into CRYPTOCEAN, it is possible to automatically exchange any cryptocurrencies for fiat money in the user's multicurrency crypto wallet. Using the service while converting the cryptocurrency makes the commission lower due to the choice of the best method of exchange. From the point of view of the bank, the client only works with fiat money. All crypto-exchange transactions are handled on the side and under the CRYPTOCEAN license.  Checking the balance and operations on the card as well as transfers and payments can be done using the service interface - web, mobile and PC app. The bank carries out payments via Visa, MasterCard, UnionPay or similar payment systems.
