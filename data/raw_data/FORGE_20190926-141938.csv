Every person who has an access to the Internet with static IP-address can join ForgeCDN network and earn crypto tokens for transferring and caching data.      Significantly cheaper costs  In order to run ForgeCDN we don't have to build and maintain a huge network of powerful high-priced servers, as well as to keep large team of costly system administrators. This makes our prices very competitive   Coverage of distant regions  Nodes of the system (PCs and laptops of forgeminers) are located everywhere and its number can reach dozens of thousands of units. Our core system treats the nodes as homogeneous environment and transfers content from central Internet backbones to distant regions instantly   Balancing and fault tolerance  The system's core constantly monitors the connected workers and if one goes off, redistributes the load among the rest. In case one hub fails, all workers and end users get redirected to the nearest hub. This makes DDoS attacks impossible   Bottomless cache  The number of the networkworkers is unlimited, therefore potential volume of cache in  ForgeCDN is also unlimited (unlike the classic CDNs). This positively affects the speed of content delivery   Performance of the nodes  The most demanded content is placed into RAM, while less demanded is stored on hard drive - this increases the speed of content delivery and reduce depreciation of hardware of forgeminers. At the same time ForgeCDN software is optimized not to overload forgeminer's CPU and allows to use the computer for other tasks   AI ‚Äî Artificial Intelligence  The system's core is constantly learning to implements the most efficient solutions for content distribution between the nodes and hubs basing on 36 parameters: location, channel bandwidth, volume of data cached in RAM, CPU load, content size, and others   Content encryption  All content cached in ForgeCDN network is encrypted with symmetrical algorithm AES-128, protecting clients from unauthorized access and illegal content   Blockchain and smart contract  Mutual settlements between clients, forgeminers and our support team are carried out through smart-contract and FORGE cryptocurrency. This allows to protects all participants from possible unscrupulous and fraudulent actions     Network members and forgeminers install special software called Worker that allows them to get connected to regional hub of the system's core. When end user sends a query to client's website, the request is redirected to the most suitable forgeminer. The end user instantly receives the data, while this data get cached in transitional nodes. Thus the content spreads over the ForgeCDN network while speed of access increases. The algorithm of machine learning records the results of each delivery and uses this data to optimize the next operations, as well as to calculate the reward    Our links  Website: http://forgecdn.io Whitepaper: http://forgecdn.io/whitepaper Email: info@forgecdn.io Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/4gcdn Telegram: https://telegram.me/ForgeCDN Twitter: https://twitter.com/ForgeCDN Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/forgecdn Medium: https://medium.com/@forgecdn   Bounty Campaign",False

Much more information is needed such as; unlike actual mining which is affected by difficulty, will you set a static profit reward, a percentage of company revenue as reward...?  if the 'network difficulty is low' (abundance of capacity) and the exchange rate is high, how would that affect the amount of Forge you distribute as payment?",False
