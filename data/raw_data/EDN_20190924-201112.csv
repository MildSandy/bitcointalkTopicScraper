Employees that are also residents get free housing, food and competitive salaries. Just like with a traditional corporation if someone is being laid off they will have a period to make arrangements.  If they are being fired as in they did something illegal, dangerous or harmful to the company then they would be asked to leave relatively quickly.  That being said it's the reason why we have invested so many resources into the EDEN Distributed Network. It is our method of recruiting the best talent. Before ever being invited to live in the City of EDEN we invite people to come on temporary stays and on trial runs.  Living and working together are all very different things. So making sure that the entire team and environment is compatible with the potential recruit and vice versa is extremely important to us.

We agree! EDEN stands for Engineering Design & Entrepreneurship in Nature.

After sleeping on it Beta didn't seem right so we brain stormed again.  I Googled ""synonyms for paradise"" and Eden was one of the synonyms.

That was very meaningful to me and the team. I honestly don't think we are the first to think up these concepts but we're just doing it. We risked our own money and avoided doing a token sale until we actually built something.  You can review our smart contract and token on Github - https://github.com/cityofeden/EDEN-smart-contracts  Here's a quick overview: Add open source solutions to posted technical and creative bounties on projects in Blockchain, Aerospace, Med & Bio Tech and Renewables. Technical contributions are published as open source and remain open and available for others to use at no cost. Verified contributions will be rewarded with EDN Tokens. Submit new projects and build teams around them to collaborate and execute on projects. As you achieve more within your project you and your team level up and earn more EDN tokens. Gain access to perform peer review on the blockchain. Validate contributions in the EDEN Distributed Network and get rewarded in EDN tokens. Higher level EDN token holders gain higher levels of access and invitations to exclusive events, trips and short term stays to the City of EDEN and eventually permanent residency where you earn competitive salaries, live for free with top amenities and services and work on high level projects with access to bleeding edge research and development facilities. EDN Tokens can be used to purchase products and services from EDEN Companies. See all EDEN companies, products and services here.",False

Different bounties and challenges yield different EDN rewards and different levels and badges amplify your earning potential.  So earning EDN tokens and gaining access to abilities like publishing your own bounties within your own projects with your own assembled team are both project specific and individual specific.  The concept is to remove the barrier completely for a potential solution to emerge.,False
