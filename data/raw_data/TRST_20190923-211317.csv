It is a fundraising platform that enables accountability to be built-in to the grant making and funding of public goods/ non-profit/ open source initiatives.  Conditional contribution, or the ability to fund aspirational goals with the condition of being refunded if the goal is not met, is a vital missing piece in the puzzle of funding for a diverse array of projects.  We are looking for passionate campaign creators to create campaigns and market them to their friends, family, online communities. The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate the power of conditional, milestone based fundraising and the power of CryptoUnlocked.

At the peak of the bubble their crypto stash from the ICO would've been worth around $70M. At today's prices they should have at least $10M left. • Despite that they say they are experiencing financial difficulties. • The team refuses to show financial details to TRST investors.  As for the development: • The only ""product"" they made is a web page, directory of charities, and a donate button for each of them: https://spring.wetrust.io • TRST token functionality has still not been developed. • More of that TRST token itself never meant to have any functionality inside the product although during ICO they called it fuel, but since it is not ever consumed, using the term ""fuel"" to describe the token was incredibly misleading. • The team did not follow their roadmap released in 2018 https://blog.wetrust.io/the-road-ahead-for-wetrust-f53e8ca898df • Around ICO time they had some dispute with one of the founders, Ron Merom, with whom they still have a lawsuit until this day. No further details are known. • They ban users in their Telegram group for asking inconvenient questions. • Their updates are so vague and corporate speak is in almost every message about their ""mission for financial inclusion"" etc etc. But no actual details or development plans.",False

I have to agree with you on some facts, indeed they raised a lot of money and they should cash out some back in the days, if they experience financial issues in this bear market is their fault as they didn't know how to manage the funds raised in their ICO.  Anyway even if they have held the funds raised, as you said, they should have enough funds to continue the development of their product/s. This is not an excuse.  Regarding the roadmap targets, I don't care about it too much, many projects out there miss their deadlines too often so I won't have many expectations (regarding deadlines) from any roadmap out there.  About the dispute between founders, I didn't know, but this is a bad thing for the project, looking at Tezos for example.

The reason we chose charities is because they are generally the most trustworthy of the groups (out of charities, crowdfunders, ICO projects, personal projects), and they are the largest in market size. They can't quite ""fail"" like the other groups.  The concept is to apply a mechanism where funds are not fully released but rather over several milestones. For example, if I want to build a new device and raise funding for it and I set the goal at 1M, the funds would not be immediately released but released and locked over a series of milestones or timeframes. At any given time, the investors into this project can vote (essentially a vote of no-confidence), where the remaining funds are sent back. There are many scenarios where this can work out, and it is essentially a form of a ""DAICO"" but for all projects.  It can also apply to charities, which is why we targeted this direction. Millions of dollars from charities are wasted each year on marketing and branding, because people only want to donate to charities that they can trust. By implementing a system of accountability, there can be charities that don't want to waste money on marketing / branding , and instead focus on their goals, knowing that their funding will be released if they stick to their original vision.",False

Today is something similar to back then. The coins seemed abandoned and zero trading in the exchanges. Usually the dev just disappears.

Paying in ETH for you help. $50/ week/ campaign.  APPLY FOR TWITTER HERE APPLY FOR DISCORD & TELEGRAM HERE   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  INTRODUCTION WeTrust is launching a new platform called WeTrust Spring that will help individuals and organizations create campaigns for various causes that they are passionate about. The platform was inspired from our first product - the Trusted Lending Circles (TLC) where individuals contributed crypto-currency at a pre-determined interval and a ruleset chose a winner each round and disbursed them the month. We are proud that the product was released successfully and is live on the Ethereum main-net. The difference between the Spring Platform and that of the TLC is that Spring allows users to collect funds from many, allow those to accumulate, and finally disburse funds once all requirements have been made.  Our goal is to have both individuals and organizations create campaigns for causes they believe in and allow contributors to participate in a seamless, fun and engaging way. We are looking for supporters who will help evangelize our mission and help spread the word to those who want to use their crypto-currencies for good. Currently, this campaign will be for TWITTER, TELEGRAM AND DISCORD. We may add additional platforms to this or expand the campaign, but for now this bounty will only be here.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  TWITTER Please apply here if you would like to be a Twitter influencer.

Firstly the issue that wetrust plans to solve i.e. replacing of chit funds/hui in countries like india/china requires educating people about computers and blockchain technology to the basic minimum. Most people who are unbanked are because they lack formal education, are not employed in good sectors and thus have to go for chit funds to get banking loans. Wetrust fails miserably in it. Right now it is best for the people who are very much banked and have access to all the funds if they want. It is solutionism at its worst. I held a bag of wetrust tokens thinking it will solve the purpose for which they mentioned the potential markets of india and china but even after a year it has gone nowhere. They make it extremely difficult for the people who dont have banking accounts since buying trst tokens for the platform require having ethereum wallets or trst tokens on exchanges. There is a higher probability of world coming to end before people having knowledge of computers learning about exchanges, blockchain, apps of wetrust etc. and how the lending circles will work. They dont have boots on the ground and that is why potential partnerships with local vendors was required. Partnerships with banks is not an option and i don't see any good response or questions in the AMA. Lending already is a competitive environment which we can see from ethlend, lendoit and various others pouring in the market. I had posted multiple concerns in the telegram group but sadly i didn't get any response other than Eli telling that they will respond as soon as they wake up. I am finally getting out of it (selling my tokens) until they have rectified their issues and bring out a product which actually has a usecase.

One of the most undervalued projects if you ask me.  How would you describe the main pillars of the company?  The main pillars of our company are transparency, team, and thoughtfulness (a.k.a. the three T’s).  “Transparency” is a core focus for us, as we try to be very open and accessible to all of our community members. We host regular bi-weekly AMAs to ensure that our community has answers to all of their most urgent questions around what we’re developing here at WeTrust. These are typically handled by our CEO, George Li, or senior members of our Product and Marketing teams. We find this degree of open communication to be imperative for any company- and especially true for those raising a token crowdsale.  “Team” comes from our focus on ensuring that all team members here are actively informed on what other team members are working on. We host regular morning standups for each team member to share about what they’re working on that day- which provides an excellent opportunity for other team members to identify where they may be able to assist. When team members aren’t communicating enough internally, productivity tends to suffer.  “Thoughtfulness” stems from our genuine desire to help provide stable financial solutions for those who need it most- the global unbanked and underbanked communities. We’re a social good company, first and foremost. Ensuring that the products we build will make an impact — either indirectly by enabling developers, or directly by helping consumers utilize better financial tools. As we release our Trusted Lending Circles product onto the Main Ethereum Network tomorrow (1.18.18), user feedback will be invaluable as we continue to focus on adding value to this fast evolving ecosystem.  https://medium.com/@cryptorand/interview-with-wetrust-team-trst-ad60de8884c7",False

The price drops due to one and only one reason, is people trying to get out as soon as they get their token which happens because either these people are bounty seekers and they don't see value of a particular coin but just making some btc/eth and converting back to fiat which they can actually live with and those people who got some bonus like 30 percent , 20 percent and are happy with such confirmed gains.

My name is Damo (real name Damien Michael Nichols). I've been helping out with community engagement on the WeTrust slack. The team asked me to come keep you guys company. It's been ages since I've been on bitcointalk. Now I remember why lol. The FUD is real, y'all, wow.  Anyway, I'm the first member of the team with some marketing experience and though I'm only part time for now I'm happy to hang out and try to keep you guys up to date. The rest of the team is focused on building products that will create real value for us TRST hodlers, seriously. I try not to use that awful, patronizing marketer voice, so don't be surprised if I talk to you like we're just two people having a conversation (novel, I know).  I appreciate everyone that's expressed confidence in the project and patience from the team. It's coming along nicely and we expect the ROSCA app to be shipped before the end of 2017. We've got some new hires coming in that should speed up the process and are still in search of 2-3 more Front End devs. Check out our job listings at www.wetrust.workable.com  Gotta run for now but I'll be back this evening to dig into the archives and respond to a bunch of legit questions and some obnoxious accusations.   P.S. Do some of these FUDsters remind anyone else of the Louis CK sketch ""Everything is Awesome and Nobody's Happy"", or is it just me?  https://youtu.be/q8LaT5Iiwo4?t=1m57s  P.S.S. I'm using Patrick's handle b/c I was having issues logging in with my own. You may see me start posting under BitDamo or CryptoDamo or some such in the future.  P.S.S.S. Slack is still the best way to stay in touch with us, and a much better medium for conversation (though we're considering migrating to another platform thanks to the phishing attack waves).

I <3 your handle.  I really am glad to be here gang. I'm gonna try not to blow smoke up your butts. Like I said the team is crankin on the ROSCA app, which is really the technical foundation for pretty much anything else we want to build. Accounts + contributions + escrow + distribution = the basics of pretty much any financial instrument, so once we've got that we can get really creative really quickly. In the meantime there's much to figure out re: market fit, MVP feature set, brand identity, marketing strategy, and a ton more.  It's exciting and the sky's the limit but it really can't be rushed.  @shanto, happy to put my fellow hodlers at ease!  @dzarmush, dude where you been?! No roadmap update just yet, but we do expect the ROSCA app to be out before end of 2017. We'll have plenty more updates and it should get a lot more interesting in the run up to launching the app.  @finestream & @alonzo ewing, I don't like tracking token value in BTC bc it's so volatile. Pretty sure TRST is at about 2x or 3x from ICO price against the dollar. I know a bunch of us have no intention of trading back for fiat but I think it's the fairer pair to price track with at this time.  @FiNaLize you my favorite heckler lol. I hope the community straightened you out that there's no new ICO. The survey is re: a potential product to facilitate safer, easier, more secure group-ICO purchases. Yes, we spent a little time exploring the breadth of possibilities. Now we're back to laser focus on finishing the ROSCA app for the aforementioned reasons. They've got a few folks like me thinking in the background on the creative side while they crank out the initial crowdsale promise.  Hope this helps guys.

Perhaps the time is approaching when more and more  investors will be thinking in terms of fiat as more and more new people coming into the space who are not attached to Bitcoin so emotionally as to fiat.  Only hard-core bitcoiners who believe in long term Bitcoin price growth still will be measuring alts in BTC as the only reason they get into alts is to accumulate more Bitcoin.  Over the time we should see less and less volatility in alts and less parabolic moves in alt/btc pairs, assuming Bitcoin will continue to grow in price .In other words-diminishing gains and non violent charts in terms of Bitcoin and growing volatility in terms of  fiat.Every shitcoin will be capable of reaching  $1 and projects with strong  fundamentals as WeTrust $10(just arbitrary numbers to support the case ).But that doesn't mean biger gains rather inflation as average ICO fiat price will continue to go up regardless of number of ICO participants.

The example you are talking about is called a bidding ROSCA (there is also a lottery ROSCA which is a bit different). In this case some people will end with more than they invested (we can call them the savers) and some with less (we can call them the borrowers). The incentive for the borrowers to participate in a bidding ROSCA is an early access to funds, similar to a loan you can get from a bank , but often with a lower interest rate. A borrower will get the pot in the one early rounds of the ROSCA, after winning it by bidding lower than the others. The difference between his bid and total funds in the pot is divided between all the ROSCA participants and at the end is calculated as part of the interest the borrowers pay and the savers earn (which is of course different for each participant).

Here are my answers, let me know if you need more info: 1. ROSCA is a zero-sum game financial organization. The participants can choose if they want a bidding or a lottery ROSCA. In a bidding ROSCA is chosen, some participants will pay interests for usually receiving the funds early (they are the borrowers) and some will get the interest and will usually will get the funds later (the savers). These interests are between the users. Also, the foreperson (one of the users) can determine what fee he/she would like to take for facilitating the ROSCA. This is for the foreperson to decide and for the participants to agree. At this point, WeTrust don't charge fees for using the ROSCA platform. In the future, we are planning to charge small fees for ROSCAs larger than 5 people.  2. TRST holders will not get paid for shares. Our plan, subjected to changes, is for TRST holders to be able to pay the fees with TRSTs and be quoted lowers fees than with other coins.  Regards, Mivsam for WeTrust.",False

As a result, we are delaying the distribution 24 hours and are urging with one final reminder:  If you have provided a receiving address from ANY exchange (e.g., Coinbase, Poloniex, Kraken), this will NOT work for the distribution and your tokens will likely get “stranded”.  If you have provided a receiving address from any wallet provider that does NOT provide universal support for ERC20 tokens, this may also result in your tokens getting “stranded”.  In either case (or if you provided an incorrect address for any other reason), please reply to this email immediately at support@wetrust.io to clear out your receiving address field. We will be performing the distribution around Tuesday April 18 evening UTC, after which no further changes will be possible for those who have provided a receiving address.  If you ask us to clear your receiving address, you won’t partake in the first distribution and you will receive an email after completion of the 1st distribution (likely, tomorrow Tuesday evening April 18, 2017 PDT) informing that you may provide a receiving address for the second TRST distribution (in about a week). In the meantime, two popular wallets you may consider include: Ethereum’s official wallet Mist, that you can download from the official site, and MyEtherWallet which is one of the quickest to set up. You might want to search for other ERC20 compliant wallets, but remember to perform careful research as WeTrust simply has no control over, and cannot be responsible for the tokens once you receive them.

To compensate for that, all participants in these campaigns will get a bonus of 12% of their total stakes, earned during the first 9 weeks (for example, if Ruth’s total stakes for 9 weeks are 400 stakes for signature campaign, she now has 448 with the bonus). In a couple of days you will receive an email with your FINAL stakes.  We remind you that some of the participants were removed or banned from the campaigns. If your account is marked in red, clicking on the timestamp or the bitcointalk handle you should see a comment popping up, explaining the reason for the red mark.  Reasons to be removed / banned from the Signature campaign include, but not restricted to:  1. Spamming 2. Failing to post at all for 3 weeks in a row. 3. Broken link 4.

Many of the things we take for granted in the modern world like loans, savings, and insurance, are only possible because of trust, and the blockchain is no different. In order for these types of services to work on the blockchain, there needs to be a token to compensate people who are providing a role as a trusted third party.

Most importantly, TRST is an ERC20 token so make sure you choose an ERC20 compliant wallet.  When you choose your wallet, remember to perform careful research as WeTrust simply has no control over, and cannot be responsible for the tokens once you receive them. Unfortunately, WeTrust cannot approve any specific wallet vendor, because we cannot check the compatibility, security, and reliability of third party products.  Now, having said that, two popular wallets are Ethereum’s official Mist wallet, which can be found on the official site, and MyEtherWallet which is known to be quick to set up.  For additional questions, feel free to join our slack channel and find out how other advanced users are choosing to store their Trustcoin.  Thanks for your support!",False

In the meantime, we request that you enter the receiving address to which your Trustcoin will be sent, as soon as possible. We also recommend enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Learn more about adding your receiving address and 2FA in our blog post.  Bounty participants, please see special instructions at the bottom of this message.  Here is WeTrust’s plan for Trustcoin distribution:   - Collect participants’ Ethereum addresses starting today.  - Once the crowdsale ends, give participants another 48 to 72 hours to enter the receiving addresses and make sure their final TRST amounts, displayed on the dashboard, are correct.  - Fix any issues raised, and run a few more tests and validations, to make sure the TRST amounts are correct and that the distribution process will execute as planned.  - Freeze any changes of the receiving addresses for the last 12 hours or so before the first distribution takes place (to prevent malicious activity).  - Deploy the TRST token contract (the source code of which you can see here) and transfer TRST to all participants that have entered their email address and provided their receiving address.  - Publicly announce the final mainnet contract address.  - Receive a final confirmation from escrows before the crowdsale funds are released to WeTrust.  - Continue to follow up with crowdsale participants who did not provide a receiving address in time for the first distribution.  - Work really hard on improving financial inclusion!  To get updates on this plan, please follow us at our Slack channel.  If you don’t manage to enter your receiving address before our initial distribution process begins, don’t worry. We’ll be performing a few rounds of mainnet distributions in the next few weeks to make sure that as many people as possible get their Trustcoins.

When serving customers outside the crypto-fan community, it is crucial to make the product as accessible as possible to everyone. One important hurdle to overcome is that ROSCA (aka Trusted Lending Circle) participants should be able to work with the currency they use on a day to day basis. Just like a Russian user probably wouldn’t want to run a ROSCA using USD and a Canadian user wouldn’t want to run a ROSCA using the British Pounds, in a similar way both of them would prefer not to use ETH as the currency of the ROSCA. Doing so will let them keep clear of any currency fluctuation risks associated with using any currency other than the one they deal with on a daily basis.  Supporting ERC20 opens the door to using stablecoins with WeTrust ROSCAs. What are stablecoins? These are cryptocoins that are guaranteed to track the value of real world goods and currencies, e.g., Digix’s DGD (tracking real-world gold), Tether’s USDT (tracking USD), Consensys’s StabL and Maker’s Dai (both tracking several coins in their own way).

As a signature campaign operator you will ultimately be held responsible for the quality of posts of users bearing your signature advertisement and you will need to monitor your users closely or it will be quickly abused. If you are running a campaign and it becomes blatantly obvious to Staff that you are doing little to nothing to stop spam on your campaign you will be issued a PM warning by a Global Moderator that you need to make immediate improvements to curb low-quality posts. You will have 7 days to remove low-quality posters and respond to the message detailing what you are going to do to make changes to your campaign to reduce the amount of spam. If improvements are not noticeable within 21 days of that and Staff do not believe you are doing enough to prevent low quality posts your signatures will be blacklisted from the forum by an Admin and you will no longer be permitted to advertise here in such a way. The Staff and Admins do not want to have to do this but it's a last resort in an attempt to clean up the forum as signature campaigns cannot continue to operate here in such a lazy way as it is not fair that others have to go through pages of drivel to find anything of substance nor should Staff be left to clean up the mess you are paying people to make.",False

However with the latest ETH/BTC move the 63000+ ETH are worth 1650BTC so in fact over 2000BTC were raised based on current value.  This also has an implication on individual investors: i for example contributed a certain BTC number + X amount of ETH when it was worth 0.0142. With ETH now being 0.0260, the actual BTC's that I invested are actually larger based on the above.  Are you going to calculate this, and adjust the final number of TRST based on the rate at the last day of the sale? or how?  In other words: since the donated ETH is in escrow and is going to be converted to BTC, it seems fair that the total amount is adjusted based on the exchange rate at the end of the crowdsale to reach a final BTC figure for the crowdsale, and adjust the ratio for all contributors.

All the investors on first and first week (90% of contributors to your crowdsale) will get significantly lower conversion rate to BTC due to current ETH Price. i.e. about 0.015 btc/eth, even though you guys have ETH still, not BTC converted at that rate on that day. Hence, lower trust coins relative to the current ETH price.  It was also my understanding that ETH would be converted to BTC on that day but ETH was not converted to BTC because no access to the funds yet.    Here's a hypothetical scenario (presenting extreme case): if ETH value dropped to 0.0001 btc/eth, would the project have been continued even though the paper BTC was over 1000 btc, but real value was much below 1000 btc?

Here at WeTrust, we believe that the blockchain can be used for social good. As a demonstration of our commitment to that mission, we recently organized a Trusted Charity Circle (inspired by Trusted Lending Circles) on the WeTrust platform. Here’s how it works:  1. During each week of the Charity Circle, each member will contribute 5 Ether into the pool 2. One member of the group will be selected at random as the winner of the Ether pool each week, with no member winning the pot more than once 3. The recipient of the funds for that week then donates the proceeds to a charity of their choice 4. Over the course of the 5 week period, every week each person ends up contributing 25 Ether to the charity of their choice  The purpose of taking these actions above, is to demonstrate for the first time that the WeTrust Platform is capable of supporting similar use cases where participants collaborate transparently as a group in a financial endeavor, contributes tokens, and receives tokens distributed back to them over time, without the need for a trusted third party. One can imagine all the new ways application developers will use these improved capabilities to build decentralized applications.  We’re very lucky to have some major movers and shakers in the blockchain world generously agreeing to participate in our Trusted Charity Circle.

However, to thwart bad actors, WeTrust will have four deterrents:  1. Reputation risk/ Reviews: ROSCA groups will be limited to ""trusted associates"" - family, friends, co-workers, fraternal groups, and professional/ religious organizations. Defaulting on payments could mean social shame and loss of reputation amongst an individual's closest associates. The idea is that for ROSCAs with small enough dollar amount commitments, reputation risk will be sufficient enough to keep participants honest. Reviews may also be left by other members to show how they felt about any participant.  2. Legal risk: ROSCA formation will allow trusted associates to e-sign and bind each other to a legal contract which requires faithful adherence and payment to the ROSCA. Defaulting on payments and stealing could mean legal repercussions. Legal recourse will only be used if individuals are participating in a ""high-stakes"" ROSCA and legal action would be worthwhile. I've spoken to our legal advisor and she believes it will be possible to create auto-populating templates that will be tailored to each person's ROSCA terms.  3. Collateral risk: Collateral commitments may be required prior to joining a ROSCA. The collateral will be entered into a smart contract which will surrender the property to the ROSCA group if the ROSCA agreement is breached. Collateral can be liquid-cash like assets like Bitcoin or even less liquid assets such as auto/ home titles. Our system will benefit significantly from the ability to accept less liquid assets, since the majority of middle classes’ net worth is locked in real estate. Collateral would allow capital to be used more efficiently.  4. Smart contract bounty (self-enforcement): If a ROSCA participant violates the terms of the ROSCA, the ROSCA group may start a “Bounty” on the retrieval of funds. If the funds are retrieved, the “Bounty” is paid out to the person who enforces the terms of the ROSCA.  These deterrent options will be on an ""opt-in"" basis and participants will be able to choose the level of security they want.",False

Where do I find the address I need to contribute to? Every participant will be given unique Bitcoin and Ethereum addresses once they sign in to wetrust.io/crowdsale after the crowdsale begins at midnight UTC on March 1st. Do not contribute to any address given to you by anyone else, only use the addresses assigned to you on wetrust.io.  Can I pay in coins other than Bitcoin or Ether? Yes, you can pay with other coins supported by Shapeshift.io by setting the destination address on Shapeshift to either your Bitcoin or Ethereum addresses, depending on which currency you are converting to.  Will my Trustcoins (TRST) be credited to me instantly? No, Trustcoins are calculated as a percentage of the overall contributions; and as such, we won’t know anyone’s exact balance until the crowdsale is over. You will see an automatically refreshing balance on the dashboard as contributions roll in. Expect it to decrease as more contributions come through, so don’t be alarmed to see that the number will start high and get smaller as the crowdsale proceeds.  When will I get my Trustcoin (TRST)? We’re still finalizing the details of the distribution process, but Trustcoin will be handed out some time after the crowdsale has completed. Part of the task of our escrow signees is to hold us accountable for the complete and correct distribution of Trustcoin.  How do you know where to send the Trustcoin? We will be asking participants to enter the Ethereum address with which they wish to receive Trustcoin on their profile (at wetrust.io/crowdsale) at some point during or after the crowdsale.  Can I send BTC/ETH/Alts from an exchange like Poloniex or a smart contract? Yes, as long as the funds go to one of your unique addresses on the dashboard, it doesn’t matter where they come from.  How are the ETH/Alts converted to BTC when measuring the completion percentage? For ETH/BTC, we’re using three sources to gather ratio information: Poloniex, CoinMarketCap and Cryptocompare. We take the median ratio given by these sources at the time of your transaction. For altcoins, we’re using Shapeshift.io to perform the conversion and spot rates will be determine from them. There will be a Shapeshift link on the dashboard, which will open a page with your crowdfund Ethereum address set to the destination on Shapeshift. We’re using Ether here, since Bitcoin transactions could take a long time to confirm.  Will Two Factor Authentication (2FA) be enabled on the WeTrust ICO website? WeTrust will have 2FA enabled prior to the Token Distribution process to ensure all funds are safe and there is proper integrity within our system. 2FA will be required to be enabled prior to the token distribution.

My general conclusion is neutral. I’m positive about the team, product plan and product strategy. But information is lacking and recent major changes and the design choices regarding the token sale structure does imply a focus on short-term thinking and not a focused and well thought out long-term plan.  I would change my conclusion to positive if relevant information is shared regarding the first four points above, and if the team committed to a staged release of funds. For example, a third of the funds are immediately released to the team and when the team needs more funds token holders are given the right to vote against the release of another third of the funds.  Update: I’ve shared this evaluation with the team around 24 hours before publishing, to give them a chance to comment and correct any errors and oversights on my side. I got news on several updates that are not yet publicly shared regarding the go-to-market strategy, project focus in case it does not reach the full financing and relating to a staged release of funds.

(excerpt) Project: WeTrust  The main tagline from the website is: A platform for Trusted Lending Circles, powered by people and blockchain.  The slightly longer explanation from the whitepaper is: WeTrust is a collaborative savings, lending and insurance platform that is autonomous, agnostic, frictionless, and decentralized. WeTrust utilizes the Ethereum blockchain to create a full-stack alternative financial system that leverages existing social capital and trust networks, eliminating the need for a “trusted third party”, allowing for lower fees, improved incentive structures, decentralized risks, allowing a greater amount of capital to reside among the participants, and ultimately improving financial inclusion on a global scale.  Personally I find the concept very interesting. The goal is to build a platform with increasingly complex alternative financial and insurance products. The first product being developed is an application for Trusted Lending Circles (aka Rotating and Saving Credit Association/ROSCA).  They have a website at www.wetrust.io, a blog at medium.com/wetrust-blog and there is a proof-of-concept available on rosca.wetrust.io. To hear the Founder's talk more about the project in their own words, watch the CoinFund's Hangout or listen to the Blockchannel's podcast with them.

Reputation risk/ Reviews: ROSCA groups will be limited to ""trusted associates"" - family, friends, co-workers, fraternal groups, and professional/ religious organizations. Defaulting on payments could mean social shame and loss of reputation amongst an individual's closest associates. The idea is that for ROSCAs with small enough dollar amount commitments, reputation risk will be sufficient enough to keep participants honest. Reviews may also be left by other members to show how they felt about any participant.  2. Legal risk: ROSCA formation will allow trusted associates to e-sign and bind each other to a legal contract which requires faithful adherence and payment to the ROSCA. Defaulting on payments and stealing could mean legal repercussions. Legal recourse will only be used if individuals are participating in a ""high-stakes"" ROSCA and legal action would be worthwhile. I've spoken to our legal advisor and she believes it will be possible to create auto-populating templates that will be tailored to each person's ROSCA terms.  3. Collateral risk: Collateral commitments may be required prior to joining a ROSCA. The collateral will be entered into a smart contract which will surrender the property to the ROSCA group if the ROSCA agreement is breached. Collateral can be liquid-cash like assets like Bitcoin or even less liquid assets such as auto/ home titles. Our system will benefit significantly from the ability to accept less liquid assets, since the majority of middle classes’ net worth is locked in real estate. Collateral would allow capital to be used more efficiently.  4. Smart contract bounty (self-enforcement): If a ROSCA participant violates the terms of the ROSCA, the ROSCA group may start a “Bounty” on the retrieval of funds. If the funds are retrieved, the “Bounty” is paid out to the person who enforces the terms of the ROSCA.   These deterrent options will be on an ""opt-in"" basis and participants will be able to choose the level of security they want.",False

Based on your feedback and an internal review of our budgeting and roadmap, we have made an update to the minimum and maximum funding levels, which we believe will improve our ability to deliver a better product for the community. The new minimum is 1000BTC, and new maximum is 6000BTC.  Here's why: Our initial budgeting for a floor of 1500 BTC was done when BTC was valued at $720, and with the recent increase in price, combined with feedback from our supporters, we have decided to update the minimum to reflect these changes. We have taken these considerations to heart, and after much deliberation, have decided to lower the minimum funding “floor” to 1,000 BTC.    In parallel, after a detailed examination of our budgeting needs and product goals for the next few years, we have also decided to lower the maximum funding “cap” to 6,000 BTC.  We don’t want our supporters to provide funds we don’t need for our development goals, and we want them to be confident that any funds raised in the crowdsale will go towards furthering our core mission.  For a detailed breakdown of our budget going forward, click here for our Medium post of our cost breakdown.  We truly appreciate the knowledge and passion our community brings to our project, and we encourage everyone to share their thoughts and ideas as our project grows and evolves! I'm sure you will have many questions, and we will be happy to address them. Thank you for your continued support. Help spread the word!  Yours in financial inclusion,   The WeTrust Team",False

If you were already approved in dark green in the confirmation spreadsheet, we will count your posts, otherwise 3 moderators per language.  *500 posts per person will be counted. The 200 first posts will get 5 stakes per post. The rest 300 posts will get 1 stake per post.  *All translations need to be finished before March 10th.  *Whitepaper and Slide Deck shares stay the same, no change.  *As mentioned is a previous post - If your name is not marked already in dark green and you would like to translate, please contact me first.

Quote from: AWildKeccakAppears on February 05, 2017, 12:24:22 AM I'm trying to understand the economics behind the TRST coin and why one should invest early. So I assume that each ROSCO unit will be putting funds into the contract that's somehow denominated by crypto. How does activity of a ROSCO affect the price of TRST? I'm assuming they're not required to buy and hold ROSCO to use the app, but there's some user friendly way to transfer funds in a local currency to whatever is managed by the app. Is TRST then being bought from the market at market rates? If some kind of pegged token is used, is that bypassing the TRST token altogether?  Why is TRST token attractive for crowdsale participants?

It's been hectic. I hope you understand.  Q: Why is TRST token attractive for crowdsale participants? There will only be 100M Trustcoins (TRST) in existence and no more will be created after the crowdsale. The coin will be essential for our trusted lending circles (aka, ROSCAs) to function (as all fees will be quoted in terms of Trustcoin). Future features that will be developed out from the trusted lending circles will also require Trustcoins as their ""fuel""/ collateral. Does this help? Let me know if you have any questions - we're currently working on a nicely written blog post that goes into high detail about our coin to help the general audience.

I'm not an expert in Inchain, however, our approach is to digitize a saving approach used by 1 billion people through something called ROSCA (definitely check this video out). ROSCAs today are used only people who trust each other in real life, and provide both Economic Security AND Opportunity. It represents a form of Insurance and Credit, where interest stays within local community. There's no need for “trusted third party” intermediaries. Default rates are also lower than what  banks observe. Despite the benefits, it is not without shortcomings. ROSCAs have challenges with scaling (most of these organizations don't grow beyond a small circle of trust due to logistics), challenges with dealing with  accounting, potential fraud, etc... This is where our platform comes in to provide better transparency, safeguards, use of 'trust inference' based on social graph -- all of which will ultimately amplify the strengths of social capital and reputation based networks, while addressing their weaknesses. regarding your question about minimum raise: we are currently debating the minimum internally, but are thinking it might be 1,500 BTC. We'll have a number published in the first post of this thread soon. tldr; we are digitizing ROSCAs, which are a resilient and proven form of simple insurance, as a way to bootstrap trusted networks, build a social graph, and eventually build out additional products such as credit identity, trusted lending, and more sophisticated forms of mutual insurance.    Would love to hear more on your view of our approach toward mutual-insurance!    @malcovixeffect: Stablecoins have the transactional qualities of cryptocurrencies and are critical for widespread adoption as they are pegged one to one with fiat currencies and resistant to day-to-day volatility. Our end goal is to have users be able to use our platform without having to understand the underlying complexity. Several stablecoins that are under development or are in active usage, including MakerDAI, String Labs Phi, and Tether. Colu and Waves Platform are also working on various initiatives that enable the support of digital tokens that are linked to fiat value.  What are your thoughts on our view of stablecoins?    @electronicash: What do you think is a more appropriate cap value for our crowdsale? The funds raised are not used for underwriting insurance policies, but creating the platform that would enable individuals to create their own mutual-insurance groups in the form of ROSCAs. (definitely check this video out which explains the simple yet elegant way in which people are able to access both credit and insurance through this mechanism of what is essentially a time-shifting of payments within a group in order to deal with economic uncertainty).

Reputation risk/ Reviews: ROSCA groups will be limited to ""trusted associates"" - family, friends, co-workers, fraternal groups, and professional/ religious organizations. Defaulting on payments could mean social shame and loss of reputation amongst an individual's closest associates. The idea is that for ROSCAs with small enough dollar amount commitments, reputation risk will be sufficient enough to keep participants honest. Reviews may also be left by other members to show how they felt about any participant.  2. Legal risk: ROSCA formation will allow trusted associates to e-sign and bind each other to a legal contract which requires faithful adherence and payment to the ROSCA. Defaulting on payments and stealing could mean legal repercussions. Legal recourse will only be used if individuals are participating in a ""high-stakes"" ROSCA and legal action would be worthwhile. I've spoken to our legal advisor and she believes it will be possible to create auto-populating templates that will be tailored to each person's ROSCA terms.  3. Collateral risk: Collateral commitments may be required prior to joining a ROSCA. The collateral will be entered into a smart contract which will surrender the property to the ROSCA group if the ROSCA agreement is breached. Collateral can be liquid-cash like assets like Bitcoin or even less liquid assets such as auto/ home titles. Our system will benefit significantly from the ability to accept less liquid assets, since the majority of middle classes’ net worth is locked in real estate. Collateral would allow capital to be used more efficiently.  4. Smart contract bounty (self-enforcement): If a ROSCA participant violates the terms of the ROSCA, the ROSCA group may start a “Bounty” on the retrieval of funds. If the funds are retrieved, the “Bounty” is paid out to the person who enforces the terms of the ROSCA.  These deterrent options will be on an ""opt-in"" basis and participants will be able to choose the level of security they want. These ideas are not fixed and are still subject to change. We're working on implementing numbers one and two currently.",False

The crowdsale will be hosted on our main website.  3. ...another token crowdsale which is run on Ethereum Blockchain, investor buy the token from Ethereum wallet so your token will be automatically on our Ethereum wallet? We're going to have an escrow with prominent folks in the crypto-community (we're still sorting out these logistics) and they'll serve as signees. Funds will only be released once all our crowdsale participants receive their coins.  4. How much token will provided on crowdsale? 100 Million Trustcoins (TRST) will be issued once the crowdsale is concluded. Of the 100 Million Trustcoins: 80 Million Trustcoins will be sold to the token sale participants 10 Million Trustcoins will be kept for the founding team 9 Million Trustcoins will be used to future expenses, marketing, additional team members 1 Million Trustcoins will be used for token sale bounties",False
