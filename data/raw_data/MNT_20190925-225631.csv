So in conclusion, it would only make sense to peg the prices in the store to dollar value. But what would be the incentive to use the store then? Please evaluate a bit and correct me if I got something totally wrong here. All the good to you!  ",False

The online store integration will allow us three options at the outset (and the same will apply to other retailers adopting Monartis payments, via Shopify from the beginning and then from the additional e-commerce platforms over time). Those options are essentially:  1. Set pricing in MNT 2. Peg the price directly to another currency (eg the dollar, as you mention) 3. Peg the price directly to another currency (eg the dollar) and then apply a price modification  In the case of our initial store, we envisage using option 3. So to take how that will work in practice:  Product A might be priced at $50. We will perform the conversion into MNT and then discount, allowing us to shown an MNT price against the dollar price.  So, to take a hypothetical example, product A might cost the buyer $50 (in fiat), but only $45 (in MNT).  That pricing structure allows us to encourage use of MNT from the beginning, which is important for two reasons:  1. We want the currency to be in use. Offering discounts in our own store is one means of encouraging spending. 2. We want transactions flowing through our store from the outset. That's important for demonstrating to other retailers that the integration is successful and that consumers are willing to spending via MNT in a digital store  We hope that answers your question, but do feel free to ask for any further clarification that you might require.",False

This cleared things up and makes sense to me. But you will still have to adapt prices in MNT if the value goes up or down right? I mean for example if product A is listed for $45 in MNT (lets say this would be 20 MNT) and one day later 1 MNT shoots up to $10 each, so you would have to adjust the pricing to 4,5 MNT for product A am I right? Nobody would buy product A anymore for 20 MNT because it would be equal to $200.",False

In answer to what you are asking here: yes, it will be possible for prices to be updated dynamically, based upon MNT fluctuations. There are effectively two available models for such changes:  1. Using live data, allowing immediate pricing updates to be performed at the time of the user search 2. Scheduled updates. For example, we (or another retailer) might choose to update pricing hourly  The right model for an individual retailer is likely to depend upon their own preferences and the level of price volatility. If the price is particularly volatile at the outset, for example, then it's likely that live rates might be seen as providing the best option.",False

The online store is being constructed using an existing platform (Shopify), with a custom integration. We took the decision to follow such an approach after some deliberation. We ultimately decided not to build a bespoke platform for a number of reasons:  1. The resource requirement in developing such an approach would have been considerably greater. 2. There were already a number of existing platforms that could already meet the requirement for the construction of an online store. We opted to proceed with Shopify, but there were other platforms available that could have worked too. 3. Perhaps most importantly, if we'd created a bespoke system, then we'd have been faced with attempting to persuade retailers to use that system too.  That 3rd point is critical. Since most retail partners will already have online stores running on existing e-commerce platforms, we believed that it was important that we should be able to integrate with those stores, rather than seeking to persuade retailers to overhaul their systems. Realistically, such persuasion would have been very difficult. By opting for Shopify, we have the means to offer rapid integration with numerous online stores worldwide.  We believe that represents the best approach and we're pleased to see that the project is being rated highly by those who are carrying out assessments.",False
