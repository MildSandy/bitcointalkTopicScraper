Over the period the balance on his wallet changed from 55 thousand to 96.65 thousand coins, which at the current rate is almost equivalent to a billion dollars. The funniest thing is that there are even those who considered it to be a secret conspiracy. And what`s the conspiracy? Isn`t it logical, having a positive view on the bitcoin course, to buy it during its fall? There are always those who sell, those who buy and those who are hysterical. Meanwhile, the news of this week is encouraging. For example, J.P.Morgan predict that by the middle of the year bitcoin will start beating price records again. By the way, have you heard anything about the full copy of the first cryptocurrency on Ethereum`s blockchain? It’s amazing, but the 0xBitcoin token has been really launched with all the ensuing consequences — halving once in four years, the PoW algorithm, the issue of 21 million coins.

It is quite possible that after the hard fork, it will break into the TOP 10.

At the time of transfer of the order, he checked with a courier the first and last four digits of the 16-digit transaction, which confirmed the fact of payment. If he didn`t provide those data, the food would be destroyed.

Who would ever have thought. Cryptocurrency analyst Nick Colas of Datatrek Research says: there is a direct dependence of the bitcoin rate on the trends of the world’s largest search engine. So, last December, when we all were watching the excitement around the first cryptocurrency, the number of web search queries on the bitcoin topic and the creation of wallets was very high. It was due to the high interest and desire to invest. The BTC rate confirmed this interest. After the release of negative news, the activity of searching of these queries in the first month of the year decreased sharply, and the rate fell to $ 10,000 per coin. Colas believes that now we need to expect positive news, which will spur the growth in the number of users supporting the upward trend. The same considerations were expressed by the expert Christopher Burniske from ARK Invest. He believes that the pair BTC / USD correlates directly with the trends of Google’s queries, and called this phenomenon “the enchanted circle of Satoshi.” Also a popular search phrase “buy bitcoins with a credit card,” arouses interest. It reflects the willingness of the Internet community to raise borrowed funds for investing in bitcoin.

The first step will be the creation of identity cards “TangleID”, which will store all the necessary information for interaction with government authorities, including data on citizen`s health. This initiative is primarily related to the need to eliminate the risks of personal data`s theft and fraud of votes. “TangleID” is planned to be made in the size of a palm and, among other things, equipped with sensors that show the actual state of the environment, such as humidity, temperature and pollution levels. It isn`t reported yet on the further steps of the implementation of blockchain into the megacity`s life, but on all grounds the project is very ambitious. We hope that the experiment will be successful, and innovations will go beyond the boundaries of one settlement. Similar experiments are held not only in Taipei, but each place has its features. Now it is difficult to say exactly where the technological thought will go further, it remains only to watch and wait for the results. Let’s get some popcorn!

There he plays an employee of the postal company FedEx. In the plot the plane the character is on in his line of work, crashes, and Chuck, our character`s name, is on a desert island. Because of the loneliness and melancholy, if you remember, he begins to talk with the ball, seeing him as the only friend and companion in this difficult life situation. He even gives him the name Wilson. And how he cried when the ball was blown into the ocean … This prologue leads to the fact that if the action of the film took place not in 1995–2000, but now, the character of Hanks could have long conversations with Wilson on the introduction of blockchain technology in the work of the company FedEx. The modernization was the result of the accession of one of the largest transport companies to the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). According to the industry publication FreightWaves, the in the frameworks of the alliance the organization is testing several developments, including integration of blockchain technologies into their daily operations. According to Dale Christie, Vice President for Strategic Planning and Analysis, the program has already been launched to store data needed to resolve disputes. Its purpose is to identify information for a permanent ledger, which is required for convenient facilitation of disputes between customers and the company. Christie believes that blockchain is a perspective technology which is able to simplify the data exchange process. And Kevin Humphreys, FedEx IT Senior Vice President, expressed the same optimistic thoughts, adding that the innovations will make it more convenient to track parcels not only while they are at the company’s disposal, but before and after. That’s really interesting! The conversation between Chuck and Wilson could have been long and interesting, as blockchain is chasm of possibilities, just like any technological breakthrough!

This also includes business accounts on the GDAX exchange, in particular accounts whose operations for selling cryptocurrency for cash exceeded the thresholds. At the same time, the platform’s employees explain, the innovation concerns only those who received digital money in exchange for the provision of goods or services, and does not affect miners or persons who transferred personal funds. Social networks are seething with discontent. The main complaints are that users were not notified beforehand about such measures, and their data was passed to the tax authorities. In addition, ostensibly, the received documents indicate amounts that exceed the actual ones. The discontent is understandable, but, no matter how sad it may seem, this development was predictable and inevitable. The state does not tolerate the movement of money “out in the left field.” Last week same news came from India. In Russia, the authorities are trying to curb the law regulating cryptocurrencies, which will entail taxation. Now China is not ready to work out an unambiguous policy on this issue.

The startup was called “Leci Gou” or “Pet Chain”. Recall, CryptoKitties appeared last year and became a headache for the developers of the blockchain Ethereum, since with the launch the cryptocurrency network began to experience overloads, which significantly increased the transaction time. Whose blockchain will be use by “Leci Gou” is not known yet. Already now, the site of the project presents different types of puppies, each has its own cost and rarity. It is assumed that users will buy and develop pets, exchange them, and all such operations will be reflected in the project’s blockchain. The authors of the project are their own search system`s specialists, who among others take part in the development of projects of the Hyperledger consortium. Already now, any logged in user can get one crypto-puppy and 1000 points for trading operations using them. The whole story with CryptoKitties and Leci Gou reminds a fun toy from the 90s, that was called Tamagotchi. It was an electronic gadget, where a digital pet lived. It had to be looked after, fed, and if the care of a pet was improper, it died. It is interesting that now it has taken a completely different form, and digital pets are sold for very serious money.

Surely, in childhood everyone with some thrill read or watched films about pirates and treasure hunt, imagining being adventurers! And you know what? Someone’s old dreams come true! The complexity of prospecting is the disparity of historical data, point-wise deep-sea studies and inaccurate calculations. At the bottom of the World Ocean there are about three million vessels containing good valued trillion dollars (according to UNESCO). The most interesting places with a high probability of finding objects are the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea basin and the “Golden Triangle of Treasures.” The main idea of the project is the following: the system Deep Learning developed by the company allows you to recognize underwater objects with an accuracy of 98%. The data of the autonomous scanning of a seabed is sent to a consort from specially designed unmanned underwater vehicles called gliders made with the introduction of artificial intelligence technology. All information will be transmitted and stored on blockchain. The end product will be lots with the goods` coordinates, which are planned to be sold from the auction. Thus, in addition to own benefit, it will provide an extra inflow of money into the crypto industry. As we see, the company plans to engage only in research activities. It`s understandable, as organizing the lifting of something from the bottom of the sea is the matter that requires completely different capital investments and skills.

In the state of New York, the United States, the authorities are planning to start an ambitious project to re-equip an abandoned smeltery in the village of Massena to a huge mining farm, where they will install no less than 180.000 (one hundred and eighty thousand !!!) miners, and the target cryptocurrency will be bitcoin. The location of the project`s implementation is due to the availability of cheap electricity supplied from a nearby hydroelectric plant. The output power will reach 15 MW. The volume of investments is about $ 165 million. In addition to the business component, an important factor for initiators is 150 workplaces made during the implementation of the plan. These are security personnel, IT specialists, service staff, electricians, whose average annual salary will be $ 46.000. The implementation period is two years. 75 employees will be hired in 2018, 75 — in 2019. We may be wrong, but perhaps this project will launch the largest cryptocurrency farm in the world. It is pleasant to understand that a relatively new industry is beginning to affect the society providing people with jobs in places where there may not be enough ones. There are a lot of videos on YouTube showing large cryptoplants for currencies mining, but they announce the number of 3.000 miners. OK, 5.000. And here they have 180.000!

And this is quite understandable. The team of the international project Mining Now systematically overcame three collapses of cryptocurrency in a row. The developed plan allows moving forward, accurately fulfilling all the inferred financial obligations for investors and partners. On February 8, the total cost of purchased equipment for mining amounted to about 3.1 million euros. The total power consumption reached 945 kW. Today the technical capabilities of our project allowed increasing the generation to 1.27 bitcoins a day. It`s enough to say that over the past period of 2018, the price of MNW token increased from 9.2 to 9.6 euros. At the beginning of this year, the unit yield of the digital asset was 57.33%, as on February 1 it was 51.33%. It’s easy to see that the business model of the international Mining Now project allows you to hedge against sharp fluctuations in the cryptocurrency cost in the market. The price of our tokens is set based on the average monthly return of 3%. Accordingly, even in the case of financial jumps of bitcoin, MNW tokens continue work to improve the financial well-being of each investor and partner. Frankly speaking, the general panic in the cuprocurrency market to some extent affects the growth of the price of our tokens. They`re growing a little bit slower, but do not become cheaper. Therefore, the estimated amount of payments for February will be 34 euro cents per a token, which is 3.54% of its value. And now the main thing.Even though bitcoin is falling down, MNW token does not really care. The declared amount of the February payment is equivalent to its value of 11.33 euros. Conclusion — it`s even more interesting to invest in our project now than in the period of growth of cryptocurrency. Do not miss your chance not to get lost in the crypto-ocean. Let`s mine together!

A representative of Dash Core Group took the statement with indignation, assuring that 20% is an absurd figure, which has no evidence. Nevertheless, we can see the tendency when alcoins start catching up with the first cryptocurrency, and the reasons for this can be explained by a high commission for transactions and workload of the network, a sharp correction of the exchange rate. And the statistics confirms this: in March 2017 the share of bitcoin in the capitalization of the market was fluctuating at the level of 70%, and today it is 35% — a two times fall.

Moreover, there was an expression for hidden mining — cryptojacking. However, there are Internet resources offering to share with them the extra resources of your computer in exchange for any additional benefits or part of the profit. For example, Salon, an American news portal, offers its visitors in exchange for a spare resource of their computer not to display ads on the site, which distracts from reading articles. There is an assumption that in this way the owners want to mine cryptocurrency. In the official explanation they talk about using extra power for starting with technology of blockchain to analysis of signals from space. Admit it, the formulation is very vague and questionable. In the pop-up window on the site pops up the inscription: “We use ads so that our site and content remains free for you.” There are a lot of questions that have no answers. For example, how much time does a person need to spend on a news portal so that he is so annoyed by ads and agrees to certain terms? Or how many ads are there on the site so that they drive you mad? Of course, there are trash — sites where a page is full of banners, but it is unlikely that Salon refers to one of them, as the media writes about it.

After all, the fund is aimed at a long-term perspective of its activities, since cryptocurrencies are a young and rapidly developing industry. Marketing director of the fund and silver medalist of the Olympic Games Gordy Sheer explained this step by the fact that speed and risk are characteristic for luge. They are usual for cryptocurrencies too. Depending on the size of the fund, the team plans to apply the bitcoin logo to advertising products, uniform and even sleighs.

Meanwhile, the world famous Mark Zuckerberg, creator of Facebook, who, according to many, Durov borrowed the idea of VK from, set himself another goal. So, since 2009, the extraordinary billionaire has been puzzling himself for personal achievements: whether to run over the reporting period (a year) 365 miles, read 25 books, learn Mandarin dialect of the Chinese language and so on. He is such a zealot! For 2018 Zuckerberg has planned to immerse himself in technologies of encryption and cryptocurrency to approach the fact his social network would become less centralized. According to Mark`s opinion, which he expressed on his profile, initially people saw new technologies as a decentralizing force that transferred all control over them. However, over time those innovations became ways of centralization, enabling the government to monitor users. This state of affairs is caused by instability and discord in society. Cryptocurrency and encryption technologies should help to return control to users, writes Zuckerberg. At first glance, the idea seems really ambitious and even pretty dangerous, because the founder of Facebook declares a desire to openly go against the system in the broadest sense of the word (the state apparatus, intelligence agencies, etc.). But who knows what these geniuses have in mind? By the way, Pavel Durov has a similar attitude to this problem. Suffice it to recall last year’s scandals, when he refused to provide personal data of Telegram users to Russian intelligence agencies.

Thus, world-famous industrial giants Pfizer, Amgen and Sanofi announced their intention to develop a single blockchain platform, which will reduce the time and costs for bringing a new product to the market. Now the full cycle of development and testing of a new drug takes about 6-7 years, and this despite the fact that only 10% of them are successful. The costs of research, bureaucratic procedures and bringing of a safe medication for sale are on average 2.6 billion US dollars, which is too much even for monsters like Pfizer and Amgen. The conceived blockchain project will allow, in addition to reducing costs, to increase the percentage of success at the output. For example, now access to data of potential research participants is difficult, as they are attributed to various medical institutions. The innovation will unite them into a common base, which will simplify the formation of focus groups. In addition, it will combine data on new products and facilitate relationships with regulatory authorities. In general, the idea is very ambitious and necessary. Expecting that medicines for a final customer will become cheaper, of course is not worth it, as pharmacology is one of the greediest sectors of the economy. However, as an example of the fact that blockchain is changing the approach to business and competition, the news is encouraging. And the fact that the percentage of the success of the drugs under study can ultimately lead to long-awaited ways to treat cancer, AIDS and many incurable diseases at the moment, gives hope to millions of people in need. In February 12, in Orlando, Florida, the project is planned to be discussed within the framework of the Blockchain for clinical trials, where representatives of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are expected to attend.

The age of the digital photo, when according to statistics, in a minute as many pictures are taken, as for the entire 19th century, has come. After all, almost everyone has got a camera on his cellphone today, not taking into account special gadgets. However, it was not so long ago they took pictures on films, carried them to Kodak-Express and sent them to printing. For sure, for many Kodak has remained in memory since that time. Meanwhile, Eastman Kodak Company, a well-known US manufacturer of photographic equipment and supplies, in partnership with WENN Digital intends to release its own KODAKCoin cryptocurrency. The ICO start is scheduled in January 31st, 2018. According to their idea, an encrypted database will be made, where all photos will be assigned an identification number that attaches them to their authors. When an image is used for commercial purposes, its author will get a reward in KODAKCoin. Of course, the system will work on a blockchain technology. According to Jeff Clarke, Kodak CEO, this will help the photographers` community cope with problems that until now seemed unsolvable. Most likely, he meant the fact that on the Internet copyrights are often infringed. After the release of the news, Kodak shares soared by 120% Recall that Eastman Kodak Company was founded in 1881 by a manufacturer Henry Strong and a bank employee George Eastman.

UK resident Max Dovey invented a device called spirometer which measures the volume of air breathed and breathed out. This data is subsequently hashed, transferred to a computer and gets into a common blockchain. Each breath involves a certain number of computational operations, and the importance is not only the quantity, but also the frequency. Thus, the opportunity of mining Monero is given. Now spirometer does not allow to get a noticeable amount of cryptocurrency. So, for a year of testing, about 500 million computing operations were carried out, which led to the appearance of a currency equivalent to only one dollar. However, Dovey pursued a different objective – to show alternative mining, which is important because of the increasingly growing and frightening energy consumption of this industry. Recall, we have already written about a suit for mining, which uses the heat released by a human body. Perhaps time will pass and there will be a certain technological solution that will most effectively use the resources of our daily life, which we do not use at all in a period of time. And each of us can generate a certain amount of money which may be enough to provide for life. And since every inhabitant of the planet will emit money, the world economy can change beyond recognition, the value of human life will increase, the balance between rich and poor will become more fair. However, now we are far away from it. Although twenty years ago we could not imagine all that we are talking about.

The domain name is an abbreviation of Bitcoin on many institutional trading platforms, which makes it so desirable. And the thing is that the current owner of the domain XBT Holding SA, together with a subsidiary company Webzilla, was accused of involvement in the theft of the data of Democratic Party of the United States, among which was the interrogation of Donald Trump. A year ago, Buzzfeed released a material based on the data provided by a group of researchers Fusion GPS, which unveiled the precedent. The article, in particular, reported that the former CEO of XBT, Alexei Gubarev, acted in the interests of the Federal Security Service of Russia. Of course, the organization entered into a lawsuit, where it challenged the accusation. Proceedings are still ongoing. According to Gubarev, because of that the company is forced to re-brand, as it suffered from significant reputational damage. To participate in the auction, you have to make a deposit of $ 10,000 or 0.5 BTC. And the product really is interesting! We can assume that this is a good investment.

The team of the international project MiningNow, which is being implemented by a Bulgarian company AA! LAB, hastens to inform you that our general mining continues to develop consistently and successfully. Let us tell you some results of organizational and production activities achieved in 2017. The strategic partner of our project was the largest aluminum producer United Company RUSAL. In the nearest future, on the basis of one of the plants located in the village of Nadvoitsy (Republic of Karelia) a data processing center will be built. As part of an agreement between the United Company RUSAL and the Bulgarian company AA! LAB, this center is planned to be equipped with 5000 computing units, servers and workstations. Estimated power consumption of installed equipment is expected to be 6 megawatts. Already today the technical capabilities of the MiningNow project include 250 miners of the s9 model, 50 L3+ miners, 150 6*1070 miners and 50 6*580 miners. In money equivalent, this amounts to 1,890,000, 00 euros. The total power consumption of this technical equipment in January 2018 has been over 600 kW, which allows, converting into the most popular cryptocurrency, to generate approximately 1,25 biticoin every day. It is important to note that only the capacities that were built with the help of brought investments are mentioned above, taking no account of the equipment that was available to the MiningNow project at the starting stage. Interest in the project does not decrease. Just during the Christmas holidays (from December the 25th 2017 to January the 8th 2018) investments in our general mining increased by another 196 577,00 euros. Meanwhile, the international MiningNow project is already being implemented in Bulgaria and Russia, the other day the generating capacities are going to be increased due to the equipment installed in Kazakhstan. Today the stages of Pre-Sale and Pre-ICO completed with positive dynamics.

When most industry workers think how to tune cooling up effectively, that is, overcome this problem, others use an unconventional approach. Namely, they apply the invention of the use of the generated energy and obtaining an additional profit from it. We have already heard that houses are heated with it, but today we are going to talk about more nonstandard solutions. Bruce Hardy, an entrepreneur from Canada, manages mining stations in the Rural Municipality of St. Francois Xavier, Manitoba. The equipment is installed in a building with an area of about 20,000 square feet, and works primarily to mine bitcoin. Chinese investors and Australian researchers inspired the businessman to the experiment. The produced heat circulates throughout the building, it is used for growing plants and fish. The water which fish live in, eventually saturates with nitrates, and later is used to water plants of lettuce, basil and barley as a fertilizer. Hardy states these actions are easily performed at a touch of a button remotely. The idea is interesting and correct from the point of view of effective energy consumption. It is expected that in the course time such projects will appear more and more, as the realization that the value in the process of mining can be not only the cryptocurrency itself, but also by-products, will come. For example, heat. This can lead to an increase in the profitability of the industry and reduce the harm to the environment.

So, we are giving a few high-profile incidents that leaked to the press. Here are some of them: Last month in Moscow in the cafe “Batoni” a man gave money in different currencies equivalent to 23 million Russian rubles to potential bitcoin sellers. After receiving the cash, the swindlers left the place not fulfilling their obligations. Again in Moscow, another incident deprived an entrepreneur 15 million Russian rubles . With a broker he came to the company’s office located in Cherkassy Lane, which offered to buy cryptocurrency. Then, six or eight people entered the room, they said that the broker was actually a fraudster, and, under the threat of physical punishment, took him away, capturing all the money to an unknown direction. And a popular Russian rock band guitarist`s son did not even go anywhere. He just found a seller on the Internet and transferred him 2 million rubles. As you have already found out, nothing was transferred to his bitcoin wallet. Let`s talk about other places. For example, in Ukraine, not everything is that great as well. They tried to steal 15 bitcoins  that belonged to a Kharkov web designer. Criminals broke into his house, where, threatening with a knife, they were persuading him to transfer all available cryptocurrency to their wallet. Apparently, the guy somehow deceived the unexpected visitors. However, apparently, the robbers did not get anything, because later the poor fellow received threatening calls. Of course he asked law enforcement agencies for help. If you think that such cases occur only in the post-Soviet space, then you are very wrong! Here, the United States of America. Threatening with a gun, a gangster dragged a victim into a minibus, took a cellphone and cryptocurrency cold wallet away, and made an attempt to transfer ethereum equivalent to 1.8 million US dollars to his account. By lucky coincidence, the miserable millionaire was able to break free and call the police. These are just a few examples, in fact there are obviously more of them.

Everything is still ahead!  January 13, 2018 a significant event in the cryptocurrency world happened — the number of mined bitcoins exceeded 16,8 million, which is 80% of the total issue. As you know, the number of these cryptocoins is limited to 21 million units, and the question arises: what’s next? We hasten to reassure you: until the moment when the last bitcoin appears will happen in more than 100 years. According to approximate calculations, this will happen in 2140. How come? After all, in January 3, 2009 the first unit was generated and 50 bitcoins were issued, where the mining marathon started from. Nine years have passed, and 4/5 of the total amount has been mined. Does it mean that the production of one — fifth will take one hundred and twenty years? Strange as it may seem, but yes. We do not exclude that there will be some new technologies that will give us the opportunity to make it faster, but the meaning lies in the details. Namely, in the complexity of mining. And it is growing, really growing. At the dawn of mining it was faster, more profitable and easier to mine bitcoin. Over time, the requirements and demands for equipment rose, energy consumption did too and the world public is worried about the impending shortage of electricity. At the same time, against the backdrop of increased costs, the reward for mining a block decreased fourfold. Initially, it was 50 BTC, then it was followed by two halvings. Until 2020, the remuneration is 12.5 bitcoins, then it will be 6.25. As we can see, mining is becoming more difficult, and the profitability is falling, especially taking into account that among other things, there are commissions for transactions that are only growing. Everything will end up with the fact that only industrial mining giants will mine bitcoin, since those who are smaller, won`t be able to reach profitability.

A huge figure … However, Swiss analysts have their own opinion on this matter. They consider the forecasting of a linear increase in energy consumption to be incorrect due to the fact that more and more companies are focusing their efforts on the use of alternative energy sources. And this makes mining more profitable, besides it creates competitive advantages in the market. Despite the nervous atmosphere among ecologists and environmentalists, the holding’s specialists insist that the situation does not even threaten energy or ecological Armageddon.

The challenge was accepted. A PhD student Sander Wuyts and his small team did what they first believed to be impossible. To increase the probability of solving the problem, they even held a “small hackathon”. In the initial data there was a description on how to claim the bitcoin, a drawing by James Joyce, the logo of the European Bioinformatics Institute, and few other things. The winner says that after his deed his consciousness has changed, and new horizons for research have opened. The received prize Sander Wuyts will use to fund his scientific work, and, of course, to reward those who helped him to crack the code. It’s funny that at the time of the challenge`s announcement the cost of one coin was at the level of 329 US dollars, and the prize was received already at the rate of 11 000 USD.

At the end of the transaction, money is credited to the original client account, where they can be withdrawn. The system assumes monitoring of external data at exchange rates for setting the optimal rate. Suspicious transactions will be monitored and blocked automatically.

LAB is a European company that implements an international project Mining Now. We are engaged in industrial mining, and this allows us to carry out a successful crowdfunding, to guarantee the MNW token value`s growth and accordingly a stable profit for our investors. Thus, comparing the Mining Now project with cloud mining is fundamentally wrong. There`re fundamental differences between us. As evidence, the administration of the project gives five serious points that will help dispel leisured conjectures. 1. Industrial mining provides high profitability. ROI is carried out by monthly payments of at least 36%, in the future it is planned to bring this figure to 66%. In addition, it should be taken into account that the growth in the cost of the MNW token for the first year will be 180%. It is easy to calculate that the total profit for this period will be up to 245% of the initial investment. 2. Participation in industrial mining is a high degree of reliability and economic security. An investor purchases MNW tokens, which actually makes him a co-owner of the computing capacities of the Mining Now project. At the same time, monthly payments are provided at a rate of 3% of the current value of MNW tokens and have a predisposition to growth. 3. The participants in our project get an opportunity to receive payments in rubles (Russia, withholding personal income tax), in euros (European countries), in cryptocurrency (for everybody). The choice is left to each investor at will. 4. The project of Mining Now is characterized by transparency in the formation of income and clarity in calculations. Distribution is based on the principle – 30% to holders of MNW tokens, the rest is directed to increase generating capacities. Since the number of our tokens is strictly defined, as the generation increases, payments to investors also do, exceeding the targeted 3%. 5. Industrial mining, in contrast to the cloud one, doesn`t rent equipment, but has its own generating capacities. That`s why the MNW tokens, unlike the cloud analogues, have collateral in the form of material assets. And each investor can use the right of repurchase at any time by selling the MNW tokens belonging to him at the nominal value to the project`s administration.

Thus, the rapid reaction force Uttar Pradesh (STF) arrested the initiator of the criminal organization Mohd Azhad in Lucknow. Through fake accounts on cryptocurrencies` exchanges scammers negotiated with potential buyers of bitcoins on transactions, clients were required to make a bank transfer of fiats to accounts, as it was later revealed, opened with fake documents. In order to win trust, they made operations with small amounts, but when it came to big transactions, buyers didn`t receive their bitcoins. The scheme was revealed after a statement about suspicious activity in the STF of an entrepreneur Pankaj Garg. This story can play a cruel joke with the further fate of cryptocurrency in India, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has repeatedly expressed its concerns about its use. Whether this episode will be the impetus to tighten the laws regulating digital currencies in India is not known yet. Recall that, for example, China has taken the path to a complete ban on ICO and shut down all the country’s cryptocurrencies` exchanges.

Unbelievable, but true: the total cryptocurrency market capitalization has taken a half-trillion-dollar mark! Last month it was literally half less. Such a grandiose jump was achieved mainly due to the growth of Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin rates. For example, for yesterday the latter one showed a rate growth more than 60%. We`ll see what happens next. The other day, futures for the first cryptocurrency on the Chicago exchange were launched, and several companies immediately applied for their launch.

Many analysts think that it is the bubble that will certainly burst sooner or later. We cannot unequivocally assert the opposite, but I would like to believe that they are mistaken, since this whole story has that romantic spirit of freedom, which is lacking in the traditional economic model.

Of course, state authorities don`t really like the aspect. They are annoyed that the money run the guard, and officials are trying in every possible way to fight with it by enacting laws, prohibiting and threatening with persecution. Their main point is that cryptocurrency can be used to finance terrorism and criminal business. The question arises: where did the negative thinking come from? After all, similar criminal acts are performed with fiat money. Scientific and technological progress has reached a level where, by having certain knowledge and skills, that are accessible to everyone, a person can improve the level and quality of life regardless of the state.

Many respond to this question positively, and thus voluntarily give access to the capacities of their devices, and receive a nominal game currency for that. Service`s owners get real tokens. This story often refers to Magi coins (XMG) mining, which is not the most popular one (market capitalization is 3.3 million dollars).

And everything would be fine if there were not the circumstance a gadget is wear working in the mining mode.

According to them, contrary to common sense, programs are freely available on Google Play. Another expert, Sergey Nikitin from Group-IB, notes that at the moment miner programs are forbidden to be spread on official application stores.

It got to the point that if a year ago it was possible to move painlessly thousands of Satoshis from wallet to wallet, now it is inadvisable to send such amounts, because they will be “eaten” by the commission in a greater or lesser degree. Social networks and DarkNet are boiling with furious messages saying that with the equivalent of $ 100, the transfer fee is $ 20. It is clear that when it comes to an operation of 10 million, this amount does not look critical. But what shall we do when it is about micropayments? It turns out that bitcoin ceases to be a means of calculation, but is increasingly suitable for storing and multiplying funds. And how shall we deal with small and medium-sized investors? The lion’s share of their modest savings will be bitten off at the first attempt to move them somewhere. Experts do not give any clear comments on the perspectives for solving this problem. Against the backdrop of low transaction costs in Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash, the main cryptocurrency is becoming more elitist and available to more affluent investors.

First, the company announced its intention to accept donations in several cryptocurrencies. The reason for this decision is the fact that the non-profit organization Freedom of the Press Foundation, which stands at the threshold of protecting the free press, notified WikiLeaks about the termination of mediation between donors, who transfer using Visa, MasterCard and PayPal payment systems, and the organization. Thus, the resource-exposer is in the “banking blockade”, and cryptocurrencies in this situation are very useful. The second news was very amusing, once again proving that Assange is a real troll. It’s safe to say that there is not a single person interested in technology and cryptocurrency news who would not have heard of the CryptoKitties project that had created a cork in the Ethereum blockchain. As it turned out, those guys also have not ignore this fun. The thing is that the first couple of crypto-kittens, named Mr. and Mrs. WikiLeaks, the company presented to US President Donald Trump, as well as a former US Secretary of the USA and a presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The organization did not forget to remind Trump that the kitten costs several thousand dollars and that it must be officially registered, after which the gift will become federal property and will pass from a president to a president.

We firmly assure you that you have no reason for any concern about the sharp drop in the bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies rates. The MiningNow team has built a stable and reliable counting system, and all our investors are sufficiently protected against external threats. The MNW tokens, unlike many analogues bound to the bitcoin rate at the ICO stage, are denominated in euros. Accordingly, the financial stability of the project depends more on the volatility of this fiat in the short term. Or on the rate of cryptocurrency which we mine in the long term. The fact that any cryptocurrency is growing in time, has become a well-known. And at the ICO stage in the MiningNow project a program is implemented, in case of investments in cryptocurrency and its growth relative to the euro, additional MNW tokens are added. We inform you that such additional payment will take place in February 28, 2018. We confirm to all investors, who trusted us with their cryptocurrency, that their financial investments are not at risk, and moreover they guarantee additional income in two months.

According to Marcus Triher, the head of Ripple, this corridor is not only fast, but also safe. Europe uses a platform of British Santander. It is noted that the corridor uses a perfect blockchain, and the operation now takes less than 9 seconds.  Let`s recall that an attempt to connect Europe and the States has already been made in the cooperation of Ripple and the Swedish bank SEB. The corridor will be managed by a special unit of AmEx.

There are many opinions on the future of the first cryptocurrency. Some people believe that the price for a bitcoin should not exceed one hundred US dollars, others that it will reach 400,000 dollars for one coin.  Meanwhile, in Zimbabwe the exchange rate reached 14,000, which is explained by the coup d’état that took place last week.

Bitcoin has recently been in the highlight of the world media. At the weekend, it updated the price record, exceeding over 9.000 dollars for a coin.  Against the backdrop of its price the Chainalysis project`s study hurts psyche even more. It announced that from 2.78 million to 3.79 million bitcoins have disappeared from the turnover forever. Among mentioned reasons, there are erroneous transactions, loss of wallets` passwords, etc. At today’s rate, it is $ 25-35 billion.  The company says that due to the powerful growth of bitcoin prices, coin holders are becoming more attentive to their assets. Nevertheless, the amount of the cryptocoins that potentially fall out of the turnover will only grow. The project does not specify the methodology of the study, but it is known that Europol and the US Internal Revenue Service apply to their services.  It is not entirely clear whether the coins kept on CoolWallets were taken into account in the study. But anyway, the scale of losses is impressive.

Yesterday, it was reported that a former employee of SpaceX project, Sakhil Gupta, has every reason to believe that bitcoin was created by the legendary innovator and engineer Ilon Mask. Admit it, this would be quite expected and logical, considering all the merits of this outstanding personality! Today Ilon disproved this supposition on his Twitter. He said that his friend had once transferred a bitcoin to him, but the fate of the money is unknown to Mask. By the way, talking about the fate of cryptocoins. Without exaggeration, the heartbreaking story happened to a resident of Newport, Rhode Island, USA, James Howells. In 2009 he mined 7500 bitcoins at home. The laptop which the bitcoins were kept on broke down and he got rid of it, saving only its hard drive. After a while, forgetting about the presence of cryptocurrency on the HDD, he simply threw it away. A spokeswoman of the city council in Newport said that even if someone finds a treasure lost by the poor fellow, it will certainly be returned to the owner. The attitude of local authorities is worthy of respect, isn`t it?

Rusal, the biggest aluminum producer outside China, is partnering with a cryptocurrency miner to help to bring new life to one of its struggling smelters in northern Russia. Rusal is building a data center at its Nadvoitsy smelter, which it will charge firms to use for IT services such as data analysis and machine learning, according to a statement. Bulgaria-based AA!LAB, founded by Russian businessman Alexey Zenkov, is working to create industrial capacity for cryptocurrency mining and is the first partner in the project. The data center will bring new revenue to the smelter, which is running at half its capacity after Rusal shuttered unprofitable production a few years ago amid weaker aluminum prices and a global glut. The site is attractive to IT firms as the cold climate means less energy is need to keep machinery cool, while companies also have access to cheap electricity from En+ Group Plc’s nearby hydropower station which supplies the smelter. Rusal’s billionaire owner Oleg Deripaska has been eyeing opportunity in cryptocurrencies for several years and En+, which he also controls, started a data center in Siberia earlier this year. Digital currencies have become a hot topic lately, with bitcoin this week surging above $11,000 for the first time.

The first phase of the data center will consist of 5,000 computing units, servers and workstations, and the equipment will require 6 megawatts of power. The producer has also allocated about 5 hectares (12 acres) of vacant area at the site for the future needs of the data center, Alexey Arnautov, Rusal’s director for new projects, said in the statement.

Let’s say you do not know what mining is, but you really want to do it. After all, it is fashionable and they say it is profitable. However, there is one trouble – you are not a millionaire who is ready to invest in a tempting business a lot of money. And you know the price of every single earned penny. What to do?  There are several options. You have got the right to choose. The easiest way is home mining To enter the market, you will need to buy an ASIC-miner or a farm on video cards. By the way, if you have got the appropriate skills and knowledge, you can try to make a farm yourself. And then you place ASIC-miner in your apartment. Yes, this will lead to a constant noise and a large consumption of electricity. However, don`t count on a big electricity power because after all the household electrical wirings are not intended for a continuous load. From a technical point of view, the ASIC-miner consumes about 1 kW. Continuous work of five devices like that at your home threatens to turn into burned wiring or even a fire. And instead of an expected profit it will have to be content with serious repair.  Let`s say that the state of internal wiring in an apartment allows you to earn crypto currency with the help of several ASIC-miners. This does not exclude their possible breakdown, since ASIC-miners are rather capricious. And if you build a farm on video cards, then the risks of unsuccessful assembly, complexity of tuning, instability of work are great. By the way, although the manufacturers of video cards give a three-year warranty, are not really ready to change the video cards that were used for mining.  The payback period of the most affordable miners for domestic use is rather small. This is about 10, at the peak – 15% per month. However, expecting maximum profit constantly is reckless, as there are more miners, and the complexity of extraction regulates the profitability.  For example, the cost of any coin is increasing, the profitability of its extraction is increasing. This will lead to an increase in complexity that will compensate the process of obtaining a crypto currency. It is more reasonable to expect a monthly return of 10%. Then it is necessary to deduct the cost of electricity, which will reduce the financial indicator by a quarter. As a result, it will be approximately 7.5%. The minimum amount of investments for home mining starts USD 2000. It is easy to verify that the payback period of such a miner will be at least a year. A year is a lot. And technical breakdowns? And the collapse of specific currencies on the market?  In addition, such mining requires a constant attention. It is necessary to monitor constantly which currencies are more interesting for mining at the moment, and then sell them on the market, transfer them to other crypto-currencies or to fiat currencies (ordinary money). It’s troublesome.  We admit that home mining is not a business. It is useful to understand the fundamentals of blockchain technologies, to enter the market from the very beginning, starting with a generation. It is not an accident that home mining is considered to be just a smooth entrance to trading. It is possible that you will not even be able to pay off the material investments, but you will be able to get a large amount of knowledge. And to achieve financial success, the beginner will need more serious investments – starting with USD 10000. One of the alternatives to this is a cloud mining.  And here you are – on the cloud … Cloud mining is much more attractive than a home one. This is an online service that provides an opportunity to buy some of the computing power. Mostly they sell you a certain amount of services. It is measured by a number of decisions per a second, in mHash or kHash, depending on crypto currency. It is not excluded that you will be asked to buy one or more of the miners entirely. But let’s digress from maths. The advantage of cloud mining is that you quickly enter the market. A working minor starts to earn crypto currency virtually right after its payment. However, there are nuances. There is no certainty that your money is really invested in an existing computing power. Absolute opacity of the Internet service makes you wonder if you have become a hostage of a financial pyramid? And really – who are they, the owners of the company? Where are the processing power? How are they served?  Representatives of the Internet service are virtual, as well as the cloud mining. You deposit money on your account from your credit card, and in return you receive a proportional amount of computing power. Or you do not… At first you can risk a small amount. For example, you can get a computing power at USD 150. In a couple of months if you do not receive a notification that due to an increased complexity of mining, the purchased capacity is unprofitable and is closing, then consider you are lucky.  However, there are really favorable offers on the market. Let`s say there are projects which offer participants a 10-15% and higher profit per month. Alas, this is a clear scam and no one is going to fulfill your financial obligations.  But we are not going to think badly about everyone. After all, there are long-running cloud-hosting companies that are known to many market participants. Here a payback period of your investments in the purchase of computing capacities is 10-15 months. Nevertheless, cloud mining is interesting. It has got an easy entry on the market and a low level of investment. The main thing is not to get on a scam-project or not to get bogged down in a financial pyramid. You can get even more crypto currency if you are engaged in industrial mining… Is it time to become an industrialist? If home mining is for amateurs, then this is for professionals. A big amount of miners requires a production area which is provided with a large electrical power, since it is needed to install some expensive computer equipment and an appropriate cooling system.  Cooling is one of the most fundamental principles of such mining. All the power of computers is allocated to heat. Using air conditioners is too expensive, because they also consume electricity, comparable to the power of the mining equipment. The minimum entrance to this level of business is 50 kW and about the same number of different types of miners. Plus, there is a cost of renting production facilities, maintenance staff and physical security. The cost of consumed electricity can be reduced by replacing air conditioners with a flow-through ventilation system. If you understand how to do it. Being engaged in industrial mining makes sense if you invest in it USD 100.000-120.000. However, this is no longer a domestic production of the crypto currency, but a real business. It maintains its authenticity.  At home level, you can use the Internet exchanger, withdrawing money to your bank card. In industrial mining, it is required to ensure a good sale of a produced currency at the exchange and to develop a mechanism for transferring these funds to fiat currencies. And serious problems can arise here. Financial monitoring is almost certainly going to become interested in the origins of the appearance of money from the sale of crypto currency. Moreover, in some countries this concept is not clearly defined by the current legislation.  Industrial mining will require you to have some deep theoretical knowledge and practical skills. You can`t ensure proper diversification of business without them. You will not be able to pay back multidirectional equipment and ensure the generation of different currencies. It is necessary to receive information about possible fluctuations on the market timely based on technological innovations and legislative initiatives. And still, it is impossible to insure yourself from failures on crypto market, both in terms of the depreciation of a particular currency, and with the increasing complexity of its extraction. Some time ago, for example, market participants actively purchased equipment for generating currency Dash. The payback period of such projects was only one month. But a sharp increase in the number of miners soon led to the fact that Dash mining became hundreds of times more difficult.  Today the payback of industrial mining of this crypto currency has already amounted to 4-5 months, without taking into account the cost of electricity. The profitability of Dash mining is still very high – about 25-30% per month, however, it decreases every day. You shouldn`t wait for miracles from industrial mining. The yield that you can get will be no more than 15% per month. This is certainly a very good indicator. And high risks … You can still become a millionaire, albeit not so fast. If you stop on industrial mining through ICO.  Tokens game is more profitable than a risky business Strangely enough but participation in one of the under construction industrial mining projects through the ICO is the best option for those who want to mine successfully. The main thing is not to get on any scam-project, which does not involve any implementation, but only collects your money. Or a very real project that is not able to meet financial obligations because of a weak legal or organizational component. Therefore, when choosing a particular project, it is important to pay attention to a reliability of information about it. Where is the company registered on behalf of which ICO is conducted? How exactly is it supposed to make a profit – in a crypto currency or a fiat? Is it possible to convert them? Are miners described in a proper way in this project? Is a profit distribution model the same as it is declared? What taxes do you have to pay if the payments are made in a fiat currency?  For example, on a web – site What to Mine you can find out how profitable it is to obtain this or that crypto currency. It is also important to know whether the withdrawal of your funds from the project, if it is necessary, is provided through the sale of tokens. The construction of a farm, even from scratch, doesn`t take longer than three months. And if the receipt of profits is provided once a year, then it makes sense to think how reasonable it is to participate in such a project. The principal indicator for you is the increase in a cost of tokens that you get to participate in the business. After all, after deduction of costs, industrial mining through ICO brings only 5% of monthly income or 60% per annum. And that’s all.  A greater profitability can be obtained by increasing a value of assets – tokens. It is regarded as an important financial tool in our Mining Now community! In addition to the guaranteed monthly income, which is targeted at 3%, each investor receives a profit from investing in development of computing power. This increase leads to an avalanche effect and, accordingly, to the increase in a cost of the tokens that you own. Even the most modest forecasts show that this figure reaches an average of 100-140% per year. Totally you will definitely be able to earn 36% per annum from mining and 100% from the growth of tokens. But most importantly, what will you stay with if you decide to leave the business? You will have real money because you will sell your tokens on the exchange to another user or to the Mining Now community!  Finally, to enter the market through participation in industrial mining through ICO is possible starting with USD 20-50. This is much cheaper than a domestic production of crypto currency. As for the expected benefits, it has already been mentioned above. Welcome to our Mining Now community!

The deputy has information that representatives of 16 countries will participate in the event, including Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, Singapore, the United States and others. “We, as representatives of Bulgaria in the field of mining, are interested in visiting such a meeting,” Aleksei Zenkov comments, the founder and project manager of Mining Now. “The main generating capacities of the project are now located exactly in Russia because of the low cost of electricity. And it is understandable that interaction with the legislative superior bodies contribute us, miners, to the understanding of the rules of the game which will be established by the Russian state.” As the organizers of the first world meeting consider, it promises to become interesting. In particular, because Russia has already formed a sufficient number of structures that deal with blocking technologies and mining. Two months ago the Cryptocurrencies and blockchain association was established. German Klimenko, President Vladimir Putin for the Internet issued councilor, was at the origin of it. It would be more correct to call the Mining Now project, which identifies itself as a Bulgarian one, international. After all, it mines cryptocurrency in the territory of Bulgaria, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. According to its founder and CEO Aleksei Zenkov, communication with colleagues in the blockchain field and State Duma deputies will allow discussing the creation of the favorable legal framework and the most advanced legislation which will help to attract developers to Russian jurisdiction. “This, in turn, will lead to the effective use of spare electricity on the market, and perhaps even the receipt of some preferences for the miners who work legally in Russia,” the head of the international Mining Now project says.

The signal to this has been recently given by the President Vladimir Putin. How did the miners, who have been already producing cryptocurrency in the country, react to the position of the head of the state? The opinion of those who advocate the legalization of this sphere has been voiced by the founder and project manager of Mining Now. Let`s recall that Vladimir Putin said he knows about the negative attitude of the Central Bank to admission of cryptocurrencies to the Russian market. However, he added, basing on the international experience, that it is necessary to build a regulatory environment that will systematize relations in this sphere and “not to build up unnecessary barriers”. After that Nikolay Nikiforov, the Minister of Telecom and Mass Communications of the Russian Federation, announced the possible release of a new domestic currency – the cryptoruble. Meanwhile, the heads of state authorities have already begun to set up mining centers in regions. It is known, at least, that high – capacity farms will appear in the Leningrad Region and in Udmurtia. Kremlin instructed the Russian government to legally make the regulation of the currency market by July 2018. According to Alexander Svinin, a representative of the government of Udmurtia, the implementation of the project in the field of mining, which is planned to be carried out in cooperation with China, “will bring to investments, create additional jobs and receive a stable income from the sale of electricity.” At the same time, the chairman of the Expert Council for digital economy and blockchaining at the State Duma’s specialized committee Artem Koltsov does not exclude that mining will be actively represented in the Leningrad Region, where the governor intends to launch a farm using resources of the Leningrad Nuclear Power Plant. According to the experts, the most likely scenario of the state regulation is an establishment of the cryptoruble and the introduction of a mining tax. Aleksei Zenkov, the founder and project manager of Mining Now, considers the appearance of the cryptoruble as a reasonable step and agrees that regulation of this market will not go anywhere. “Cryptoruble will play a positive role if its task is to ensure entry and exit into the sphere of crypto market, transfer from cryptocurrencies to the fiat ones. In this case citizens will have the opportunity to exchange money legally, for example, paying 13 percent of income. A transparent tax scheme would bring to business representatives` notice to this market, even large ones,” he said. The Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia has already revealed an interest in money laundering with the help of cryptocurrencies. And the will to legalize the proceeds that are obtained by criminal means, is growing. Anton Siluanov, the Minister of Finance of Russia, takes digital means of payment ambiguously, considering the cryptocurrency “just surrogate money.” Proceeding from this attitude to the mining, the participants of the crypto market share the position of Vladimir Putin about the need to build a regulatory environment. “We are for a fair honest cryptoruble,” Zenkov concludes. – Already today, we provide an opportunity for people to receive income in the form of fiat currencies (ordinary money) through a local representation of Mining Now in Russia with the payment of income tax. This gives them the opportunity to participate in the cryptotrade legally and not to have slanting looks from law enforcement and fiscal authorities.”  Find out more info about project here (RU) (ENG)  Join us on media:  Facebook  YouTube  VK  Twitter  Medium(RU)  Medium(ENG)  LinkedIn",False

Yesterday bitcoin was precisely nine years old. On the 3th of October, 2008 a protocol and a principle of operation of a principally new payment system was published by a person or a group of people who were hiding behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamato. As Aleksei Zenkov, the founder and project manager of Mining Now, notes, the success of bitcoin largely depends on its defense – now the cost of hacking is estimated by experts at USD 50 billion. However, two months passed between the release of the first file and the release of the first bitcoin. The peer-to-peer payment system, which has got a reliable cryptographic protection, started functioning fully in January 3, 2009 – 50 bitcoins came out to conquer the world. And its latest version appeared relatively recently – in June 18, 2017. In September of the same year the first exchange of bitcoins to a fiat currency was made (US dollars), and in May 2010 the first goods were purchased for cryptocurrency. They were two delivered pizzas. Today, taking the bitcoin rate of exchange into account, this purchase would cost USD 65,563,500. “Bitcoin is by far the most famous currency on cryptomarket,” Aleksei Zenkov says, the founder and project manager of Mining Now. – But pay attention to such currencies as etherium. This is not even a currency, but a technological platform which more and more solutions are being built on, both for business and the state interests. ” Indeed, buddy bitcoin, which no one can block even temporarily, except for an owner of a cryptocurrency, is no longer available from the graphical interface and is not complete in Turing, in contrast to new blockchain systems that came to replace it. According to Aleksei Zenkov, today cryptocurrencies have got an exceptional reliability. “Despite numerous attempts, hackers have never managed to crack any serious blockchain network. The only thing that could be done to intruders was to steal keys of users` wallets. However, this is already a question to the users or to the exchanges that issued the keys of the access codes. If we talk about the cost of hacking of a bitcoin network, now it is estimated at half the cost of its capitalization, that is, at least $ 50 billion,” the project manager of Mining Now states.

However, if in Russia they just begin studying the basics of technological revolution, the UK is already ready to help Ukraine to introduce blochchain for using it during elections.

The Danish party Liberal Alliance which used the technology of the distributed registry to carry out their elections in one of the suburbs of Copenhagen, became innovators. In the case of Kiev’s consent, they will receive blochchain, which will ensure the highest level of data protection and guarantees of election procedures.

This is just 10 months of 2017 damage that was inflicted on the Russian.  The reason for the financial losses lies in the absence of state regulation in the ICO sphere, Russian Cryptocurrency and blockchaining association (RCBA) state. In addition, about 3.5 billion rubles, according to Klimenko, did not enter the federal budget in the form of taxes. The attitude of Russian officials towards the development of cryptomarket is fundamentally different from the position taken by the authorities of Vietnam, Indonesia, Lebanon and China. In these countries, the circulation of digital currencies is strictly limited, or even prohibited. Australia, for example, has the same attitude as Russia does. The central bank of the “green continent” demonstrate understanding that blockchain enters into everyday life. Tony Richards, the head of the department of payment policy of the Reserve Bank, admits that the blockchain system can be used, both in the financial sector and in other sectors of the economy. In 2018, a new payment platform (NPP) is expected to be started in Australia. Payments will be processed in the Reserve Bank. This platform is potentially compatible with blockchaining. Let`s recall that Alexei Zenkov, the founder and head of the international project Mining Now is convinced: in Russia, state regulation in the ICO sphere and the creation of a national digital currency – a cryptoruble, can lead to the fact that citizens will have a legal opportunity to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat ones by paying an income tax. He notes that this is how Mining Now is working today. RCBA calculated the damage to the domestic economy building on the information on ICO of Russian citizens conducted during 2017 in foreign jurisdictions.

Now the basis of the financial system is the US dollar. However, a constant printing of fiat money can disperse inflationary processes until a complete collapse. Reed sees a salvation of mankind in the development of cryptocurrencies as the only alternative to fiats. He will prove his opinion by saying that blockchain is a decentralization and the absence of any state control, and the value of cryptocurrency is regulated solely by the balance of supply and demand. Perhaps, cryptocurrency is a natural evolution of fiat money, and when a real formula of exchange will be found, banknotes will sink into oblivion. Jim Read’s view on the future of fiats is shared by Alexei Zenkov, the founder and head of the international project Mining Now. He notes that the rules of blockchain game cannot be changed without the approval of the majority of the community, and all decisions can be made only on the basis of consensus – the agreement of half of the participants in the generating capacities. “You cannot change the rules of new coins generating,” Zenkov explains. – The most illustrative example is the network of bitcoins, where the number of coins is initially limited, which excludes any possibility of inflation. Unlike usual currencies, where the only issuer is the state, which at any time is able to make any amount of fiat. ” However, the leader of the project Mining Now notices that both cryptocurrencies and fiat ones are not confirmed by any tangible asset, e.g. by gold. Nevertheless, the first ones are supported by a demand. And since in the majority of cryptocurrencies a number of coins is limited, it guarantees a steady demand and, as a consequence, a rush increase in the exchange rate. “Undoubtedly, it cannot be said that the existing cryptocurrencies will save humanity from the financial apocalypse. After all, today the 15 largest mining pools control 90 percent of the generation capacity in the network of bitcoins. And this creates a danger for the idea of decentralization of cryptocurrency, – Alexei Zenkov shares his views. – We will observe one of the stages of the struggle for the future of blockchain already in November 16th, when a new hardfork of bitcoin is planned. However, the technology of blockchain can really become the basis of the financial system in the future, and any of newly created cryptocurrencies will take on itself functions of a reserve world currency, replacing the US dollar.”  Find out more info about project here (RU) (ENG)  Join us on media:  Facebook  YouTube  VK  Twitter  Medium(RU)  Medium(ENG)  LinkedIn",False

What is the reason for this? After the cancellation of the Segwit2x’s hardfork, chaos had started at the currency market, which led to a rush drop in bitcoin price below $ 6,000, despite the fact that it was recently close to $ 8,000. The situation with Bitcoin Cash is reverse — the price per unit has reached 2800 dollars.  The totality of these circumstances led to the fact that Bitcoin Cash mining was three times more profitable than bitcoin, and miners switched to blockchain of the first one. For a short time, Bitcoin Cash hashrate for the first time since its appearance exceeded the hashrate of bitcoin. After a short time, the situation returned to the usual course, when, after recalculating the complexity, it became again more profitable to mine bitcoin, what miners reacted to and returned the power back to its original position. Nevertheless, the first bell has rung. Despite the fact that bitcoin won this time, we can see that the network of the most popular cryptocurrency is not the most reliable, and that miners are ready to change to a blockchain that is more profitable. The appearance of 100,000 transactions in the bitcoin network at the time of the fall of the hashrate, which created a traffic jam in the network, gave an extra reason to Bitcoin Cash supporters to talk about its recognition as true.

Right after the cancellation of SegWit2X’s hardfork, a large group bitPico announced that, no matter what, they`ll do it themselves. Today, the information that the bitPico had abandoned their intentions appeared. They explain the decision by the fact that there is no unity in the community, and those who need large blocks can always switch to Bitcoin Cash mining.  In the meantime, cryptocurrency exchange Yobit start running auctions with SegWit2X tokens until hardfork. Does this mean that it`s really going to happen? This is a big question.  Let us recall that the hardfork cancellation caused chaos on the cryptocurrency market, the volatility of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash exchange rate is very high.

This was reported by Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets.  The purpose of this restriction is to exclude the possibility of capital laundering. At the same time, from his statement it is not entirely clear if it will be possible to invest this amount in one ICO or the total investment in all projects of one individual should not exceed it.  It is clear that the Duma members are thinking of people, and ultimately this will refer to a small amount of citizens. Ways to bypass this restriction immediately come to mind. For example, it will be possible to register children and old people to participation. However, the only question is: why? If an economically active Russian has got spare funds, which he wants to invest in startups, why should he be interfered? Wouldn`t it be more correct to develop ways of regulation and taxation, so that everyone would stay with his owns?  And how will they control this? For example, someone decided to invest their Ethereums, who would stop him?  It seems that deputies` loud speeches about blochchain and cryptocurrencies mean that they do not even know what they really are.

They explained that by saying they were generally disappointed in this cryptocurrency, transactions were slow, wallets were unstable, and that in general BTG mining was a waste of time. Everything would be fine, but the pool users who mined tokens using it, will get nothing. And this is not the only scandal over the young cryptocurrency. Today it has become known that the pool btgmine.org introduced a hidden commission 0,5% for the use of the resource. It was transferred directly to a personal wallet of one of the developers, Martin Kuvandzhiev. It also had to close.  Meanwhile, since its launch, Bitcoin Gold rate has increased by 20% on average, which is about $ 153 per unit.
