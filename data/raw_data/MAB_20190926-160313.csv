We are convinced that our new blockchain application will make the real estate market more transparent and cheaper. Not only the purchase and financing, but also the development and management of these real estate properties.    Mortgage and old-fashioned banks At present, when it comes to real estate financing, we are still largely depending on old-fashioned banks that charge high fees and have a vague acceptance policy.  Our new crypto currency, MarbCoin, together with our application, should help to reduce the costs of this form of financing. Smart contracts should increase acceptance for a loan because of a faster understanding of financial possibilities.  Lack of transparency Often, investments in real estate are not always fully transparent. What exactly is being invested in? Who exactly will become the owner? What are the exact costs of the complete investment and financing? Has the property already been rented out? And if so, to who is it rented and on what terms? With our application this information can be retrieved both beforehand and afterwards at the touch of a button.    Usage examples Below are some examples of how our blockchain and application can be used. The blockchain application is still under development and in the future we will continue to work on the application to add more functions.  Financing of real estate If financing is required to acquire a home or commercial property, a smart contract can be created. All data of the object and the financing details are entered in the blockchain.   Purchase and sale of residential and commercial property With the application, a house can be offered for sale and others can immediately place a bid.  Property management and rentals Our application makes the property management and rentals much simpler and more transparent.  Investing in real estate Investing in real estate is becoming much more transparent due to the public nature of the blockchain.  Click here for more detailed examples.   Any question? Please let us know, we will try to response asap.    Website   Whitepaper | FAQ | Partner program",False
