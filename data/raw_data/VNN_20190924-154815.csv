What the attacker can do:  Do not confirm other people's blocks, confirming only their own. In the case of bitcoin, this also means getting all the new bitcoins that are being emitted.

Mining does not require expensive equipment. The complexity of computation does not grow with time, thanks to the completely different architecture of Blockchain.Issue, mining of new VNN coins, as well as processing power of the blockchain, are provided by software packages of emission pools, which are assigned official domain names. At the start, the estimated profitability is 2.5 VNN (50 ‚Ç¨) per day or 1500 ‚Ç¨ per month. The emission program is designed to produce 100 million VNN coins for 50 years. In total, no more than 2583 accounts are to be allowed for miners. This limitation is necessary so that the reward of the miners does not decrease with time.

The hacker took about 250,000 coins with a value of $15,000. According to other sources, the attacker made away with $1 million. Privacy-focused cryptocurrency Verge has been compromised.   The announced version in the media is officially this: the hacker used several bugs in the Verge code in order to mine enough new blocks on the distributed Verge registry. As a result, it was virtually possible to control all blocks of the network Verge.   The attack on the Verge network was not the only news in recent days, which to some extent shocked the crypto community. An unknown malicious miner managed to carry out a 51% attack on the Bitcoin Gold network (BTG) last week. Bitcoin Gold director of communications Edward Iskra said that the malicious minor used the exploit to steal funds from cryptocurrency exchanges.   ‚ÄòAs with our Blockchain Ventureon, we have foreseen similar scenarios as in the case of the attack on the Verge and Bitcoin Gold networks. For example, if we assume that at least one of our pools has been attacked and even hacked, then with the earliest synchronization, the blockchain will simply turn it off until further clarification. This will happen not later than at the formation of a new block, in the interval from 1 second to 3 minutes‚Äô, emphasized Anton Sobor, CEO of the Blockchain Ventureon.

And what do you need to implement in a real business?      Anton Sobor, co-founder of Blockchain Ventureon, touched on the topic of using blockchain in real business.  Noting that now Blokchein largely exists exclusively for its own sake.  The speaker told about the achievements of his company: the capacity of Ventureon is three thousand times higher than that of bitcoin, and it can carry out from 32 thousand transactions per second.  Confirmation time - up to 3 seconds, the link is the algorithm of consensus developed by Ventureon specialists themselves, Proof-of-FreePower.    Each transaction is confirmed by a cluster of 8 pools, the block closes and confirms the most unloaded, so-called, on-duty pool.  In the algorithm there are two feedback loops, thus the blockchain becomes self-learning.  In total, it is planned to allow 2583 pools, while each of them is equal and it does not matter which server it is on.    The pool is essentially a special software, which is put on a dedicated server.  There is no need for farms, video cards, there will be enough computer or even afterwards a smartphone.  Also fixed fee pool holder - each pool receives 2.5 coins per day.  On the basis of the company's blockchain, it will be possible to conduct ICO, crowdinvesting, and token-saels, but even more conveniently and more securely than on existing platforms.  The Ventureon blockchain has its own notary and arbitration.   The presence of trustees from the blockchain, who are authorized to certify some transactions and smart contracts, will get a trusted status in a particular operation.  Arbitration is also necessary to resolve disputed issues like stealing coins or failure to comply with the terms of a smart contract.  By an unlimited number of arbitrators, they can decide to burn coins in the wallet of the attacker and re-issue back to the wallet of the affected party, if there is evidence.  And all this is possible without holding a hard fork.    In addition, there is the opportunity to register your company virtually, immediately in the blockchain.  The notary anonymously checks all the data, makes a conclusion - and for a couple of hours it is possible to register your company and start working as a virtual legal entity. There is also a designer of smart contracts, thanks to which a person without knowledge in programming can create his own smart contract.    At the same time, Ventureon plans to issue not crypto-, but electronic currency on the blockchain with a license from regulators and other advantages.  Tests were carried out with the exchange of coins VNN on Ethereum, Bitcoin and back, as well as direct withdrawal from the block to the card.   In Ventureon there is a system of recognition of types of wallets.  By prefix in the address it will be possible to understand this verified wallet of the user, the purse of the notary or, for example, the address of the Emission Pool owner.  In addition, there will also exist collective wallets, which several people will have access to.    In the wallet it will be possible to store all kinds of crypto-currencies that are connected to Ventureon by means of locks.  The speaker separately noted the security system of users with an emergency password.  If the wallet holder is forced to pay, he can enter the emergency password.  The money will go, but the system will mark the amount and after a while the coins can be returned back.  In addition, it will be possible to conduct atomic swaps without currency withdrawal to the exchange.  This enables you to trade without transferring your funds to the exchange, which increases the safety of their storage.

Our priorities remain unchanged: to provide the most convenient and understandable blockchain for users, taking into account all wishes and experience. Our product is being tested at the development stage from all, as they say, angles and sides‚Äô, said Igor Brikov, the leading IT developer of the Blockchain Ventureon project.   Each VNN coin is divided into 10,000 parts. The minimum unit of account in the blockchain (ttVNN) is 0.0001 VNN.   Types of coins In circulation, there will be 6 types of coins. All coins have a unique identifier starting with the letter M. Like the addresses, they will have letter prefixes that determine the status of the coin. This will greatly accelerate the identification and understanding of what kind of coin it is, and what role it has.   For example: D - ordinary coin, unit of account VNN, C - coin of credit obligation, I - investment coin, P- probably stolen coin, S - stolen coin, B - burnt coin.   Let us consider the letter prefixes on practical examples, which will allow us to understand how this works. For example, take the status of one hundred millionth coin in the blockchain:   example 1   MD: 5rgvK1FXK9MarC6ASCuDWVwSubsAKZDL7 Status: the basic unit of account in the blockchain. Issue: issued by emission pools. The amount is limited by the system smart contract. A total of 100 million such coins can be issued. It can also be issued arbitrarily by the Arbitrage to replace burned coins.     example 2   MC: 5rgvK1FXK9MarC6ASCuDWVwSubsAKZDL7 Status: a coin of a credit obligation. The nominal value is 1: 1 to the base coin. Used for lending to VNN network members. Issue, limitations: issued by Notaries in an amount equal to the amount of the assessment of collateral.     example 3   MI: 5rgvK1FXK9MarC6ASCuDWVwSubsAKZDL7 Status: an investment coin is used, as the name implies, for investing in projects. The nominal value is 1: 1 to the base coin. Issue, limitations: it is issued by projects independently under the supervision of the Notary.   example 4   MP: 5rgvK1FXK9MarC6ASCuDWVwSubsAKZDL7 Status: this designation is given to the base coin in case of using the emergency password when generating a transaction. Issue: not subject to issue. Limitations: despite the nominal value of 1: 1 to the base coin, circulation is limited. These coins are kept under careful watch; their path is monitored and recorded. The decision to change the status of such a coin is made by the Arbitrators following the investigation of the reasons for using the emergency password. It is possible to return to the basic status or to assign stolen status after the investigation.   example 5   MS: 5rgvK1FXK9MarC6ASCuDWVwSubsAKZDL7 Status: this status is assigned to the Arbitrators in the event of a decision to recognize the transaction as fraudulent or committed with criminal intent. Issue: not subject to issue. Limitations: the coin is withdrawn from circulation and subject to burning. Replacement to the base one is intended to be made according to an arbitration decision.   example 6   MB: 5rgvK1FXK9MarC6ASCuDWVwSubsAKZDL7 Status: burned coin. Issue: not subject to issue. Limitations: can not participate in circulation.   It is important to know In Ventureon note that in the VNN wallets you can always see which coins and what status you have in possession. This will allow you to navigate in all processes inside the wallet as transparent as possible.

Therefore, we decided to write detailed material on this topic and are ready to explain the basic principles of work and tasks, whose solution is assigned to the pools of our blockchain, ""said Igor Brikov, the leading IT developer of the Blockchain Ventureon project.  Let's start with the hierarchy of the system   ""It is necessary and sufficient (N&S)"" - this is the principle we were guided in the design of the blockchain.  And that's what happened.  The whole hierarchy of the system is constructed of three components: 1. Ventureon blockchain 2. The emission pool (EP) - the currency issue (mining) occurs here 3. User's wallet  The tasks of the Ventureon blockchain emission pools  Based on the same principle of N&S, we decided on the tasks facing the emission pools, which have to: 1. Accept the transaction from the user's wallet 2. Process the transaction 3. Ensure the transfer of the transaction to the blockchain 4. Accept the transaction processing result from the blockchain 5. Send  to the user's wallet the transaction processing result 6. Ensure the filling of blocks with transactions 7. Ensure the consensus and synchronization of the blockchain  8. Ensure the storage of the whole blockchain  9.Ensure the issue of coins VNN  10  Ensure that the VNN course is maintained in the specified safe range  Importantly!These 10 items, if we speak quite simply,  it is a system smart contract.   Min and max working configuration Blockchain Ventureon  Next, we decided on the minimum and maximum working configuration of the blockchain.  A range of 32 to 2583 emission pools was obtained (Further - EP).  It should be noted that there is nothing more in the blockchain.  However, a little later, there will be several servers for the infrastructure (for example, the server of atomic swaps), but they do not have anything to do with the blockchain.  So, the main conclusion: the Ventureon blockchain consists only of emission pools (EP)!  Architecture peculiarities as a factor   With such a blockchain architecture, a critical parameter affecting the throughput and speed of transaction confirmation is the time it takes for the request to go through the network from one EP to another, rather than the computing power of the farms or ""asiks"".  Due to this, there is no need to experience megawatts of electricity in mega-, giga- and terahashes, and the EP owners stay out of competition.  The required high network speeds can only be provided by dedicated or virtual servers, rather than by ISP channels, so there is no question of home placement.  So, each EP has its own address assigned to it (for example, https://0000.vnn.money - https://2583.vnn.money), IP-address, purse in the system and the owner (or owners)  this EP.  The owner has the right to choose the location of his server and the tariff plan that ensures the efficiency of the pool.  We, from our part, provide software and auto-update EP.  Some restrictions 1. One person can not own more than 25 EPs 2. One country can not have more than 250 EPs 3. Each EP purse must have a irreducible minimum balance of 50 VNN  Let's summarize and add to the above said   - Emission pool is the basic unit, ensuring the functioning of the Blockchain  Ventureon.Without EP blockchain does not work!   - 32 EPs are the minimal working configuration of the blockchain. Only  EPs  are the source of VNN coin issue.  VNN coins are not issued and are not released into circulation  - the EP operates only on a dedicated or virtual server  - The server's lease payment is substantially lower than the payment for electricity consumed by the mining farm or ""asik"".  - The quantity of EPs is strictly limited by the system smart contract and can be  increased only when the network is overloaded, by the common decision of the owners of pools with mandatory approval of the Notary - By purchasing EP, the owner gets it for life use. - Closer to the launch of the blockchain, we will help all EP owners in the choice of servers and installation of software  - the EP issues VNN when it is turned on and running.  This is the only thing that you need to monitor and control as the owner of the pool.  The rest will be made by a system smart contract - EPs are of two types:  - Basic, with a daily emission of 2.5 VNN - Light, with a daily emission of 1 VNN - EP will pay off itself  an average of 200 days from the date of purchase at the current cost of VNN equal  20 euros - The term of the full VNN issue is about 50 years  - the EP can be alienated only by the decision of the owner, confirmed by the Notary Ventureon, or by the decision of the same Notary in case of a systematic shutdown of the EP for more than 90 days. https://vnn.money/single_news.php?id=27",False

The main changes are devoted to eliminating the ""risks associated with virtual currencies"" by taking measures to reduce anonymity for both trading in cryptocurrency and for cryptocurrency transactions.  Suppliers of exchange services between virtual currency and fiat , as well as wallet`s service providers for cryptocurrency, will be required to identify suspicious activities.  The Directive states that the authorities should be able to control the use of crypto-currency through these platforms, and national financial investigating institutions should have access to information that allows them to link crypto-addresses with the identifiers of their owners.  At the same time, the EU Council states that ""virtual currencies should not be confused with electronic money."" Undoubtedly, electronic money differs significantly from cryptocurrency at least in that the issue of electronic money is possible only by those who received indulgence (in the form of a license or other authorization document).  The issuer undergoes a thorough check by the regulator before issuing its money, while anybody who has mastered the knowledge of blockchain programming can create his own crypto.  The state inevitably had to come to the necessity of strict control over the circulation of the cryptocurrency, because the anonymity of transactions is a great temptation to withdraw large  amounts of real money out of the sight  of the  state.  As an example, the recent news about the huge sums that the yakuza did deduced through cryptocurrencies.    In this regard, the decision of the Ventureon team to turn to the issue of electronic money on the basis of blockchain technologies looks extremely balanced, including a legal point of view.  After all, the tightening, which was mentioned earlier, will not affect electronic money, and, consequently, VNN owners will be able to freely use their electronic money, without fear of close scrutiny by the controlling bodies. https://clck.ru/DQBtW",False

Experts are pointing out what to look for, what questions to ask representatives of the project, visiting the office, etc. And what is the result? Almost every day the news is full of information about new multi-million (!) scams. I open the site of one of those ICO's and see that everything was done according to anti-scam experts recommendations: beautiful design, detailed White Paper, serious and honest faces of the team members, even the office can be touched, and the money is gone along with the serious and honest ones. Less painful, but an unpleasant option is when you invested money in ICO, waited for the promised fairy profit, but the SEC or any other authorities raided; the ICO folded up, the money, happily, returned, but unfortunately, without income. However, for the time that the money were and worked in the project the investor could have already earned something. Time and nerves are wasted. And if before investing you had got professional legal or financial analysts advice, you might even be in the red. Moreover, there are already expert opinions that individual cryptocurrencies have all signs of an unregistered issue of securities. That already implies very serious risks not only for the founders of the projects, but also for the holders of these cryptocurrencies. At the same time, there are less risky options for investing with a sufficiently high profit. Moreover, the coins you buy have their coverage; they are not subject to the terrible term ""volatility."" They can be mined without electricity costs and environmental damage. Ventureon, with its Blockchain, has minimized the risks of investors, avoiding the fashionable ICO. Analyzing the experience of cryptocurrency‚Äôs highs and lows, it was decided to issue digital money with the appropriate license; it is a new look at mining. The conclusion is that if you want to invest in something and not to worry about whether your money will be lost, buy mining pools from Blockchain Ventureon.

Today we talk about the launch of blockchain in a minimal test configuration on 8 pools.  As IT-developer of Blockchain Ventureon Igor Brikov said, it took place the successful launch of the blockchain in a minimal test configuration on 8 pools.  When testing, two e-wallets emulators were deployed to the lock-up, and the first test transactions were conducted with the participation of a full cluster of pools.  ""During the start of blockchain on eight pools  the declared characteristics were completely confirmed: throughput of more than 34 thousand transactions per second, that is a little higher than the calculated value, and time for confirmation of transaction fits into the interval to three seconds,"" -  told us Igor.

To ensure the regulation of business in the block system, the Notaries / Arbitrators system is included. To integrate with real business, the UDNA (Unit of Demand Notes Accounting) is used, later converted into the digital currency VNN. Maximum capacity with Blockchain Ventureon:  Convenient - corpuscular transactions are direct trans-currency peer-to-peer transactions of cryptocurrencies between third-party blockchains, which will make exchanges and large storage facilities an obsolete solution. Fast - The transaction confirmation time is tens of milliseconds. Reliabe - DDoS protection is implemented through deep decentralization, which makes it's break-in economically impractical. High bandwidth - 32,768 transactions per second - with scalability. Legality- There is no conflict with the legislation regulating transactions with securities (issue, circulation) in all countries where there is no ban on mining and circulation of crypto-currencies. Documentary evidence of the origin of income upon request with preservation of anonymity.    Easy launching of Unitsales - constructor for transcurrency smart contracts based on Blockchain Ventureon with no need for programming. Necessary for business - Notary, establishment of cross-border crypto-companies, loans, pledges, identity confirmation and everything necessary for the development of big business. Beneficial for miners - using server software (dedicated or virtual) makes VNN mining the most economical and environmentally-friendly of existing ones. The income of the miners will remain high due to their limited number in the system. Beneficial for VNN-wallets owners - Payment of commission at the expense of the initiator of the transaction, the recipient or consolidated.    Eco-friendly mining without the use of expensive equipment.  Using server software for mining allows you to save on the purchase of expensive equipment and electricity. Save the environment!  Demo version of the pool - https://00000.vnn.money  Mining is provided by server-based mining pools. A typical, specialized software complex is installed on a dedicated or virtual server. Pools are assigned official domain names. Mining of cryptocurrency which is backed by real assets. The estimated yield is 2.5 VNN (‚Ç¨50) per day, payback from 20 to 220 days. A limited number of miners - it's planning to admit to mining only 2583 accounts Progressing cost of mining pools: the fewer vacant domains, the higher the price. The current price can be found in the store https://vnn.cash      The market value of projects grows as they start and develop, and the cost of VNN increases accordingly. All deposits in VNN will be insured by First Venture Insurance, and, in case of failure, are fully compensated. Capitalization of the first portfolio of projects is expected at the turn of ‚Ç¨2 billion. The guarantor is the venture fund Hypercube Ventures.  The official web-site of the fund: https://hypercube.fund     The lack of control and responsibility does not allow to integrate blockchain and real business. We consider the notary to be the solution to this problem.  With such a function, it becomes possible:  To establish cross-border companies; To carry out transactions with real assets (real estate, transport, etc.); To be credited and give out loans in cryptocurrencies (with securitization, credit history check and other attributes).  The notary allows organizing and registering cross-border companies, identify the organizers of these companies, the organizers of ICO, the creditors and borrowers. Upon that, private information is available only to the notary, thus the principle of anonymity is not violated.  The notary will work only on a voluntary basis. Open and accessible information will only be the result of a notarial check. The investors who expressed an appropriate desire and own VNN UDNA are able to become notaries. Each action of a notary is paid at his own rates and is confirmed by a blockchain.    This new feature will solve the problem of crypto assets embezzlement. The arbitration makes decision on blocking the stolen coins, destroying them and issuing new ones in favor of the injured party when providing evidence of hacking and embezzlement.  Disputes are considered by three, five, seven Arbitrators from among Notaries. The decision of the Arbitration is final and obligatory for the blockchain.  At the initial stage, 33 Notaries / Arbitrators are required, no more than two per country. The required balance on the Notary / Arbitrator account is 100 VNN, which are frozen on the notary account. A notary / arbitrator undertakes to work for at least one year, otherwise the balance is not returned.    Hold - the opportunity to freeze funds for the period indicated by the sender Escrow guarantor service - a third person who freezes funds before the contract is executed Filing a claim - a notice to the Arbitrators to deal with wallet theft, non-fulfillment of contractual obligations, etc. Different types of wallets (for ordinary users and trusted ones, including collective ones) with preservation of anonymity Protection - funds defreezing on the sender's command Main and emergency passwords to the wallet. The emergency password reports to the system that the user makes the transfer under duress. The transfer will pass, but all coins will be under close observation and tracking Built-in information and advertising block and messenger with information encryption depending on the access level (miner, Arbiter, Notary, user)        We accept the suggestions to add new features to Blockchain Ventureon, which will benefit the users and help develop the technology.
