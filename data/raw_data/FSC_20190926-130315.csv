New info!,"https://i.imgur.com/XEcbMcy.jpg We welcome Fissacoin. The cryptocurrency for music events!  It all started with the desire to make paying at an event easier, faster and more secure. Untill now the majority of festivals or events have used plastic coins. In the current digital era such an old-fashioned method is outdated. Our wish was to make it digital.  Throughout the exploration of the market we stumbled upon many rules and regulations and a conservative approach towards digital transactions with real fiat money. Then we discovered and studied blockchain technology. We consider blockchain technology as safer and more secure and thanks to a more liberal implementation it's ideal for the event industry.  At Fissacoin, our mission is to root out hard plastic coins! We are the coolest digital payment system on the planet. We'll setup the greatest global network for party people, with fun and innovative content and experiences.  At Fissacoin, we get people celebrating. We fuel the even industry conversation. We'll use our reputation not only to make this product work but also to support upcoming events and broaden our network to include a variety of parties as well as a wide range of partners. And of course, developing is at the heart of everything we do. We are the technical insider bringing audiences the safest digital payment service for events.
