The remittance fees in the Ethereum network, for example, are regulated in a special way so that they are always low regardless of the price of the Ethereum. This makes it possible to oer lower fees, even when compared to the mobile money technology (for example, M-PESA charges a fiat fee of $0.40 for P2P remittances and a withdrawal fee of $0.33 for withdrawals under $33), especially if there is no need for an instant execution of the transaction. In the event of increasing the transaction confirmation time to five minutes, the fee is significantly reduced.

Challenge 1 According to the McKinsey Global Institute report 19, for the free functioning of the  remittance system both within and outside a country, there is a strong need for the absence of restrictions on part of the financial regulator of that particular country (the central bank), along with the availability of open markets.  Solution The technological advantage of the Blockchain network solutions lies in the fact that they do not require a representation in a country, or the availability of a legal framework for their presence in order to function as a means of payment in that country. Restrictions in the form of a ban will create a black market for other electronic payment means, which is likely to complicate their use, but will not stop it completely. Technologically, a blockchain solution can only be banned by completely banning network communications at the transport level. Such advantages of that technology provide a huge potential for creating open markets without borders.  Challenge 2 The McKinsey report states that for banking services to function properly, a large amount of digital infrastructure and user identification tools are needed.  Solution Similar to mobile money systems, usage of the existing hardware base is proposed. Smartphones with a fingerprint scanner and a camera provide both Internet access for carrying out transactions of various types and possibility for user’s biometric identification. In fact, this paradigm shift addresses the problem of user access to traditional banking services not by building new offices in inaccessible/sparsely-populated areas but by bringing banking services to the user’s mobile phones.  Challenge 3 The McKinsey report further points out that users have to choose a solution that exists in the market but would be more expensive and will not be cross-border. To respond to these challenges, users need to be provided with: 1. Lower money remittance fees than what compatible services oer. 2. As low volatility as possible of the means of payment. 3. Simplicity of conversion into other means of payment and B2C interaction, which implies: - Wide network of existing agents capable of cashing out a payment tool or, conversely, accepting cash in exchange for electronic money (more convenient to handle and/or to transport) Bank4YOU Group plans to develop the business in the countries with already formed market of mobile money, hence the expenses connected with creation of dealer and agency networks won’t incur. - Possibility of automatically converting one payment tool into another means of payment – mobile money and fiat electronic money. - Possibility of buying/selling goods and services using a means of payment - Micro-crediting system  Since that problem is the most complicated and comprehensive of all mentioned, the following section is devoted to its solution mechanisms, which also describes the design of the proposed system.",False

This will reduce fees for transactions for Bank4You Group’s customers.   Quote What financial instruments do you use for performing money transactions?  Mobile Money Remittance System (MMRS) is an innovative electronic payment system, which enables safe execution of cross-border mobile money transfer between countries with the possibility to withdraw funds in local currency using products of the local mobile operator (such as mobile money and mobile airtime).  Bank4YOU Group believes mobile money remittances should be fast, convenient, and safe.  With implementation of private blockchain we will create unique and discreet system with an inner currency Mobile Money Remittance (MMR), which operates transactions between clients and settles deals between partners in individual countries.  The main component of the MMRS is a system of tokens tied to local currencies of the countries of system user’s countries, which enables fast, reliable and cheap remittance of values across the borders of states and continents. Operating such tokens makes it possible to increase the user trust in the system providing the simplest and the most understandable mechanism for converting fiat currencies into electronic ones. The issue of tokens occurs only on condition of the fiat money being brought into the system, which is intended to ensure the stability of the exchange rate.

They will provide fast and cheap validation of transactions made by other network members. It is assumed that as the popularity of the system grows, mobile operators will have an economic incentive for placing the peer-to-peer nodes of the system in their data centers. This can significantly reduce the transaction costs associated with money circulation. In order for participating peers to be convinced of the unfalsifiable nature of the data inside the private Blockchain system, it is proposed to record reference points into the public Blockchain systems (Bitcoin, Ethereum). Any member of the system will therefore be able to verify at any time the data stored in the system.
