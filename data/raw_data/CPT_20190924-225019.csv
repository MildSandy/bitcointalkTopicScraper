The crypto market has indefinately weakened. After the hype swapped out of the crypto scene itself last autumn the percentage of fake ICOs has grown, spam and scam have grown bigger and thus investors became more aware and less trustful.  We are aware that due to lacking security, the scene is suffering, since too many ICOs simply vanquished with the money collected.  As a consequence the crypto market hype came to an utter end and now it seems to need a way to restore trust.  Our ambition was and still is to create a software that makes crowdsourcing more secure, transparent, easier to manage and more trustworthy, resulting in higher loans for workers and lower wages for employers. The costs were aimed to be gathered through the ITS.  Due to the bad market situation CrowdPrecision will not have the ITS run at this time. We'll rather develope a running system able to provide our ambition on private investments.  If we ever, at a later time, run an ITS, anyone who earned a bounty through our campaign will still be on our list of beneficials.  We thank all supporters for their efforts and hope for a better future for the crypto market.  Thomas Tran-Gia and the CrowdPrecision Team",False

CrowdPrecision has decided to freeze its ITS for now.  The crypto market has indefinately weakened. After the hype swapped out of the crypto scene itself last autumn the percentage of fake ICOs has grown, spam and scam have grown bigger and thus investors became more aware and less trustful.  We are aware that due to lacking security, the scene is suffering, since too many ICOs simply vanquished with the money collected.  As a consequence the crypto market hype came to an utter end and now it seems to need a way to restore trust.  Our ambition was and still is to create a software that makes crowdsourcing more secure, transparent, easier to manage and more trustworthy, resulting in higher loans for workers and lower wages for employers. The costs were aimed to be gathered through the ITS.  Due to the bad market situation CrowdPrecision will not have the ITS run at this time. We'll rather develope a running system able to provide our ambition on private investments.  If we ever, at a later time, run an ITS, anyone who earned a bounty through our campaign will still be on our list of beneficials.  We thank all supporters for their efforts and hope for a better future for the crypto market.

The CrowdPrecision platform lets users build up reputation that helps employers and service providers establish trustworthy cooperation.  CrowdPrecision tackles two of the most significant challenges in current Crowdsourcing applications - quality control of the work submitted and fast and cost-effective payment mechanisms.  Due to the large number and the anonymity of the huge group of Crowdsourcing workers, it is often difficult to identify the skill set of individual workers and to track down workers with deliberately malicious behavior, a factor which often leads to a great waste of time and money by all parties involved (employers, workers and platform providers).  To address those problems, CrowdPrecision uses Ethereum-based smart contracts between employers and workers. By issuing CrowdPrecision Tokens (CPT), CrowdPrecision provides a complete ledger of a user’s Crowdsourcing history – whether as employer or worker – and makes it available across multiple Crowdsourcing platforms. Therefore, it features:  Transparent and straightforward display of a worker’s qualifications and diligence for an easy distinction between high and low quality workers. Track record of a worker transferable across multiple Crowdsourcing marketplaces. Facilitated identification of fair employers through their payout profile.  We decided against a solely decentralized platform. Our experiences show that there are always cases that can not be clarified automatically. Therefore, our platform has a group of experts who serve as a point of arbitration and take into account both, the interests of employees and employers in a neutral way.  The introduction of CPT enables all Crowdsourcing parties to build up a trust-based marketplace system which considerably reduces the overhead of quality control mechanisms and qualification tests. Consequently, the CrowdPrecision marketplace offers higher quality results at lower costs and at a faster pace.  Various members of CrowdPrecision have worked for established Crowdsourcing platforms, such as Microworkers.com and are experienced in dealing with all aspects of today‘s Crowdsourcing technology, including efficient workflow design, process and cheat detection, and quality enhancement techniques. With this experience, the team is well aware of Crowdsourcing‘s customer needs. This is reflected in the CrowdPrecision concept that a certain level of administration is required to guarantee quality of modern Crowdsourcing.  Token Utility/Function:  The primary purpose of the Crowdprecision Token (CPT) is to enable the connection between employers and employees across geographical and administrative borders. With this respect, it especially helps employees from developing countries that lack an extensive bank infrastructure to access the global labor market. Like in all crowdsourcing platforms, the reputation of the participants is of great importance for Crowdprecision. To this end, the amount of CPT tokens will also be used as one factor to estimate the holder's credibility on the Crowdprecision platform. Finally, the token will additionally enable the holder to access advanced dispute resolution mechanisms in cases of disagreements between employers and employees  Our Partner:    We have a partnership with Microworkers.com, it is one of the largest microtasking crowdsourcing platforms, with an international workforce of over one million. It started operations in 2009 and supports various types of tasks, such as consumer surveys, tagging and categorization of content, data extraction and enrichment, and individual self-service.
