To be listed on CMC: 1) Your project and CMC owners are hand-shaking friends making profit (read article in google for proofs) OR 2) You have 150.000$ volume (and this number raises and raises only)  We are not 1) and not 2) either. Also, we cannot artificially generate fake-trades because of several reasons: 1) Unclaimed tokens are burnt, team tokens are on hold till 2019 so we cannot make 150k fake-trades 2) SEC restricts any exchange speculations and our hands are tied by law 3) SEC is not allow us to contact and ask for listings on exchanges as well which prevents the natural way of making 150k volume  However, even with these restrictions we did a good job and obtained lots of independent support. People are applied and voting for Qchain to be listed on a few smaller independent exchanges; we also did everything possible in a frame of the laws and send information about Qchain on most legit CMC-like websites. There should not be monopoly in blockchain economics, isn't it, so why everyone is talking about CMC and top exchanges only?  We also did not forget to develop the project and, luckily, obtained a right to represent NEMcubator; it gives additional opportunities but more responsibility as well.     Devs. comment: Hey everyone, just chiming in to respond to the recent concerns/accusations on BTT. The team has been hard at work on Qchain this entire time. This can be seen from the continuous updates, community engagement, and meetings with investors and other companies.  With respect to dev updates, we have done extensive work over the past few months on our back-end codebase for the marketplace and interacting with the NEM and ETH blockchains. You can't have a functioning marketplace product, especially one based on multiple blockchains, without first having a strong back-end codebase. We have recently brought on @yaotsai17 to help expand and polish the current front end and integrate it with back-end componenets.  Please keep in mind that we are also developing Qchain as a network and community within the broader blockchain ecosystem. This includes work on integrating a full blockchain authentication option and our marketplace host system for enhancing the unique utility of our tokens and the decentralization of the network, among other things. All things considered, we have made significant progress and are continuing to do so. As always, thanks for all the support and interest!",False

Honestly guys, this is getting really frustrating. I supposed that one of the issues with doing an ICO and why ICO's are dying out is that the goals of people who participate in the ICO are very different from the long term goals of people who are actually trying to build a product.  Morgan, make the correspondence public if you must, but I have never been able to guarantee token value or to comment on speculation. I cannot control the moving goalposts that CoinMarketCap sets with regards to listing. I cannot control the behavior of exchanges who take money and then do not deliver on promises.  Some of these numbers are quite exaggerated, as well. EQC has not declined that much. The market is still recovering; many other things have tanked. XEM itself, other legitimate blockchain projects have not recovered their market cap.  I'm sorry you guys feel this way, but calling us a scam is completely unwarranted. Ok, we have competitors, cool. Where is their functional product that actually works and is industry ready? People have told us numerous times how our competitors already have an identical copy to our product that works, etc. I've not seen anything that is fully functional already that entirely aligns with our pitch deck yet, though. How many projects funded by ICO's many times the size of our raise have a functional product? Very few. We've continued updating our front-end, we've updated our website, and we've updated our pitch deck. We've continued helping to organize events in California, such as this one in conjunction with NEM Foundation: https://www.meetup.com/So-Cal-Blockchain/events/249894696/. If we were such an obvious scam, we would have been long vetted by these more powerful folks and been kept from working together with them.  Losing money sucks completely, yes. I'm really sorry for that. But also, we're not living like kings. The market crash has not been kind to us, either. I haven't taken a salary from the ICO even to prioritize my employees while working brutal, dog-hard hours to move this project along. Obviously, we've made mistakes. We haven't been perfect.  The crypto scene is just incredibly mentally unhealthy. I wish you guys the best. Please consider taking a break from this and taking a deep breath as we are all diving into an ever deeper hole of craziness, anxiety, and frustration. I've made massive personal financial, family, and time sacrifices to pursue this project and I am really doing all I can do right now.

Traders who wants to buy tokens tens of times lower than they were sold on ICO, those can easily meet own demand for the IDEX right now. The price is formed from the supply and demand. There are sellers, but there are no buyers. Do you know why there are no buyers? Because there is no finished product, about which the team says.  Look, there are two variants of the scenario.  First. Tokens will start trading to larger exchangies and a lot of token owners will them to sell. Thus, will get dropping the price is lower than there is now on the IDEX. Many traders are too lazy to register for IDEX, but trust me on the big exchange, they will sell their tokens for a pittance. Because there is no product.  Second scenario. The team will do what is stated in the road map. The second quarter? The third? Ok! Maybe a third. But after I and other traders will see that the project is a worker neither I nor anyone will want to sell tokens for a pittance. But buyers as advertisers will immediately appear.

The FAQ page is up on their website https://qchain.co/FAQ  General  What is Qchain?    What are branded custom content and influencer marketing? How does Qchain fit in?  Our marketplace product is occasionally misconstrued as competing with Google AdSense. Our marketplace product is not focused on general display advertising, but instead prioritizes native advertising: forms of advertising that actively involve content creators and publishers. Branded content is original content created by content publishers in collaboration with advertisers. The content is sometimes about the advertising company or their product, but other times, can just be an entertaining piece of content that advertisers decided to fund to build up goodwill with an audience or define their branding.  Branded content can range from written posts (e.g. sponsored posts in The New York Times) to podcasts and videos, to parties or stunts executed in collaboration between a digital publisher and an advertiser. Qchain aims to help publishers that are already reliant on native ads ‚Äî such as Vox, Gizmodo, and The Atlantic ‚Äî as well as blogs that may wish to host native advertisements but are under-serviced in the current ad environment.   Influencer marketing consists of paying personalities, celebrities, and other prominent individuals for endorsements. We will focus on targeting Youtube, Twitch, and Snapchat influencer marketing on our platform. Advertisers will be able to easily toggle the kind of advertising they are looking to purchase on the marketplace.  What are Qchain‚Äôs utility tokens?  We have two tokens, one for each blockchain technology that Qchain interfaces with. The ERC20-compliant Ethereum-based token is Ethereum Qchain (EQC), and our custom mosaic, NEM-based token is XEM Qchain (XQC). As Ethereum and NEM are both respected and rapidly maturing blockchains, we want to give our users the flexibility to choose between two next-generation technologies.  How does an Advertiser or Publisher use the Qchain tokens?  Each blockchain will have its own Qchain utility token: the EQC token for Ethereum, and the XQC token for NEM. The tokens are a critical component of product functionality and are the resources used to participate in Qchain application services. In the marketplace, tokens are transferred from advertiser to publisher, e.g. an advertiser purchases pieces of sponsored content on a publisher's blog.  Do you compete with Facebook and Google? Why would someone use Qchain instead of them?  No. Qchain is specifically for native ads/sponsored content (e.g. an article on a travel blog paid for by American Airlines), sponsorships (e.g. athlete sponsorships, such as a company placement on an MMA fighter‚Äôs shorts), and influencer marketing (e.g. an Instagram celebrity posting about a beauty product). We are not focused on traditional display advertising, and will therefore not compete with Facebook or Google.  What kind of advertisers will actually adopt this technology?  Initially, we will be looking at tech-savvy companies and tech-savvy websites with loyal followings. People who are aware of blockchain technologies will be the first ones trying this, and these blockchain enthusiasts will be more aware of differences in Ethereum and NEM. They will be more familiar with the general underlying tech and have their preferences.  Will Qchain be easy to use?  YES! There is no need to download a separate application, web browser extension, or other resource. All functionality is provided through our web app. Qchain's user-facing components are optimized for efficient day-to-day usage, while all the heavy lifting is executed fairly and transparently across the decentralized back-end.  When will Qchain be released for public use?  Qchain‚Äôs products will be released in multiple stages, with extensive testing and user feedback at each stage. Our demo is currently available at: https://beta-dev.qchain.co/  Out of curiosity, why the name Qchain? What does the Q stand for?  We wanted to go with a name that was simple and descriptive. We initially thought of naming the company Clickchain, but there are too many ""Click"" names in ad products, so we thought of going with Qlickchain. Then we decided Qlickchain was too long, and truncated it to Qchain.  The nice thing about having a general Q is that one can pretend the Q stands for something else. Some members of the team pretend it actually stands for Quetzalcoatl or Quixotic.  What are your long term plans?  We are building a marketing platform right now, but resulting from our experiences of building this platform, we also have plans to create off-chain solutions to more general blockchain issues, such as transaction disputes and private chain ‚Äúanchoring‚Äù on public blockchains in the future.  Do you have information about Qchain in {insert language here}?  For our international communities, we have social channels and discussion groups in Russian, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean. If you'd like to provide community management help or translation services in a particular language, let us know.

This was done because of specific international fund and group interest that appeared right before the originally intended end of the crowdsale.

It was done because we had an opportunity to secure the hiring of additional devs and increase development runway.  Wally Xie (Qchain.co), [06.12.17 04:20] Also, to add, this extension is really targeted. We won‚Äôt be maintaining bounties, we won‚Äôt be running major campaigns as we have been doing during the phase of the main ICO, so you all won‚Äôt have to worry about a large influx of people being wooed in. We‚Äôre really extending this as a courtesy to our Telegram community as we wait on these other parties.  Wally Xie (Qchain.co), [06.12.17 05:02] The main crowdsale through the dashboard is now closed. Thanks for the support, everybody! We provided as good service as we could offer.  Wally Xie (Qchain.co), [06.12.17 05:03] For people who contributed, I hope the process worked alright for you guys! We‚Äôll be low-profile continuing the manual crowdsale as mentioned, but then will be returning to focus more on product development. Been itching to get back towards that.  Wally Xie (Qchain.co), [06.12.17 05:07] To date, we‚Äôve raised 10.1 BTC, 600 ETH, and 1.7 mill XEM during the pre-sale and main crowdsale. Final numbers will be reported after the 29th.",False

We are developing a native ads/sponsored content marketplace that will allow advertisers and companies (can be in-house marketing departments of retailers, for example) to transact in sponsored content from one singular, convenient interface. We stand alone as a collaborative sales platform for native advertising and sponsored content in the blockchain space.  Native advertising and sponsored content are becoming more and more of a hot growth area, as traditional web display advertising has continued to gradually decline in effectiveness. Conversion and click through rates for display ads are quite anemic in this day and age. Meanwhile, native advertising is seeing a lot more success with respect to the all important metric of conversions; conversions are more important than clicks and impressions, as they mean actual revenue and sales, and a much much harder to spoof by definition. See the following links for more information about native advertising:  http://www.businessinsider.com/programmatic-ad-buying-declining-native-advertising-increases-2017-7  https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/ad-industry-insiders-are-connected-to-a-fraud-scheme-that?utm_term=.bwdN3larq#.he0zWoXkQ  https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2017/05/24/10-ways-to-protect-advertisers-from-growing-ad-fraud-problems/#1cd066e601a6 (cost per conversion is better article)  http://www.businessinsider.com/native-advertising-is-the-future-of-internet-marketing-strategy-2016-5  So, what are problems with native advertising? For one, the present process of buying native ad units is incredibly complicated and inefficient. Content publishers need to have large sales teams to cold call companies to advertise on their sites. Advertisers need to task account executives to individually navigate to websites and find contact info on those websites to reach out. Another problem is that native advertising presently does not adhere to a set of standards, which is confusing to both advertisers and consumers:  https://medium.com/the-qchain-blog/nem-meets-native-how-qchains-tech-will-enrich-digital-advertising-cd8dbfba3c8f  Qchain‚Äôs direct buy native marketplace can disrupt the process of buying and selling advertising, and gives a central point from which native ad standards can be applied and enforced.  Our target clients are both advertising agencies and retailers, along with content publishing networks such as Buzzfeed, Vox, and Univision/Gizmodo-media.  We aim to have a production ready product built up from our existing demo by Q2 2018, and then, to build a sales team to immediately start targeting the business of smaller-scale content publishers, such as individual blogs, ranging up to larger publishers, like Buzzfeed and the New York Times.  We feel that we have a very solid idea here that has been confirmed by our discussions with ad industry and content publishing professionals. We just need investment to rapidly build up our dev team to be able to turn around the production-ready and battle-tested product quickly. Should we obtain sufficient funds for development, we foresee positive revenue in about 2 years from ad industry native spend. We aim to keep our team lean, efficient, and small to get to positive revenue more quickly. And then, we are targeting an exit to an ad tech or marketing form within 3 - 5 years of the company‚Äôs creation.  Read our piece about integrating this marketplace with NEM, https://medium.com/the-qchain-blog/nem-meets-native-how-qchains-tech-will-enrich-digital-advertising-cd8dbfba3c8f, and the piece featuring us in Bitcoin Magazine, https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/native-advertising-roadmap/, for further information.",False

Of course SEC couldn't just close their eyes on many attempts of projects raise  certain amount of money (often this amount exceeds 5-10 million $) and not to comply with their promises. Thats why to ensure Qchain clients KYC (know-your-clients) policy was adopted. Its also mentioned in the article that it was a brilliant move also because ""it was a necessary sacrifice to make long-term legitimacy and the safe development of Qchain in the U.S."" More than that and the most important part of the article is that  Qchain Ceo Wally Xie highlights that they have already demonstrated product  and don't just feed people with promises to establish product ""as soon as possible"".

A appearance of whales guarantees investors that the project has a high value and good prospects for development. Whales are business angels project their availability is extremely important.  To understand this, one must understand the logic of the whale-why he invests in the project. I will explain by the points:  First, the appearance of the whale guarantees us that the project will collect the necessary capitalization to start implementing the plans specified in a WP.  Secondly, such a large investor will not invest in some kind of incomprehensible product. After all, the project itself can not guarantee return of investments. The project does not, for example, have large collateral in the form of real estate or any other objects of value. Accordingly, how can a large investor return money? Yes, practically neither as. Therefore, before making a serious investment, the whale will study the project much better than either of us will be able to do it. The whale will know all the insides that are generally possible and not known in the wide circles. And only after he is confident in the project he will give money. Why can we believe that the whale is not mistaken in its calculations? The answer is simple - big money does not come to the hands of stupid people.  Thirdly, the whale can afford to finance the project at any time if it is required and if this money is really critical for the continuation of the project.  Fourthly, the whale invests in the project for profit. He will not extract his investments (sell tokens) in the early stages of growth. The rate of return of large investors is so high that it will take years before it is achieved. So the whale will never be a seller until the project is implemented. This is very important for a stable price increase, because the whale has a really large share in the project. It is possible that the whale will never send its tokens to the market at all, but will receive profit within the project.  Fifth, whales actively participate in the management of the invested companies. In addition to finance, they bring to the company the most valuable contribution - their experience and managerial skills, which is usually not enough for companies in the initial stages, as well as their connections. Many entrepreneurs say that the knowledge and experience of business angels are more important to them than their money.  Therefore, from the foregoing, if will appear a large investor at Qchain, it will be a very good thing for minority investors.",False

Indeed, many of them are becoming cheaper relative to the price of a ICO. However, the Qchain - it seems to me is not at this case. I can justify my position as it is already accepted here on points    To begin, I'll list the parameters by which many are interested in the Qchain:  1. High degree of readiness. The demo version is already in the public domain and anyone can test it. Projects that could boast of this almost was not. Everyone was asked to invest in simple promises from a WP, and then they gave news once a month that they were still working on the project and the price was smoothly rolling down.  2. Competent detailed-worked business model. It is very important. What the Qchain offers is not just a good idea, this is so natural process of development of the advertising market, that I will boldly call his child of competitive market  )). After all, this idea came to mind later or earlier, but the Qchain was the first who suggested it. This is th same thing that Steve Jobs did once with the phone, Qchain will do in the advertising business.  3. Have you noticed this fact? Command of the Qchain is so cool and so confident that they do not even spend money on advertising!  You exclaim ""WHAT? They are crazy? How did they intend to attract an investor? ""    And I will answer you, they are so effective that they are advertised for free:  - Nem - BitcoinMagazine - Nasdaq  Why do they write about their enthusiastic reviews about the Qchain? Yes, everything is simple! For the last months this is the most thought out project at the start. He stands out against the background of his working idea. I want here again to refer to item number 2.And in a team with Lon Wong himself!  OK. I went through KYC specifically to invest in the Qchain. Yes, ask me if I sell you my tokens below the ICO price? ))))))) I find it funny.  And that is not all. In mid-November in California, as we know, a conference will be held where usually the business angels come together. According to the team's reports in the telegram, it is absolutely clear that the Qchain is preparing a large presentation. And I think that after it, the Qchain will early collect the necessary capitalization and close the ICO.  PS ""Projects that could not boast of this practically were not."" - I'm sorry, I just think that I tried to mislead a reader. Yes! Such a project was relatively recently. And I also participated in it. It was called COSS. And there was a working beta version. And if you still doubt that such projects to enter a exchange market tokens are becoming more expensive, here is a graph:    Despite the fact that recently the price has decreased, like all tokens, it was never priced below at ICO. And I managed to fix the triple profit not expecting a long time.",False

To answer questions about our overlap with BAT, we are focused on making entirely different products. BAT is focused more on building their Brave browser and their BAT browser plugin; as of now, ads are blocked by default on Brave browser, and users can directly tip content publishers with BAT.  We are focused on creating a direct buy marketplace for sponsored content that allows companies and agencies to purchase available native ad spaces from content publishers, and then pay out to those publishers by conversion rate.  At this point, Qchain would also like to announce out ICO Lottery. Here are the details for the lottery:  All existing and future ICO participants who participated by sending contributions via Zerion's interface at qchain.co/crowdsale will automatically be entered in our crowdsale lottery for EQC and XQC tokens. For every contribution of 0.1 ETH, you will receive a ""ticket"" for a drawing for EQC jackpots shortly before the conclusion of the ICO, and for every contribution of 100 XEM, you will receive a ""ticket"" for a drawing of XQC jackpots shortly before the conclusion of the ICO.  The EQC and XQC lotteries will be performed separately. The jackpots for both EQC and XQC are as follows: 1st place EQC: 1,000,000 EQC 2nd place EQC: 500,000 EQC 3rd place EQC: 250,000 EQC 1st place XQC: 1,000,000 XQC 2nd place XQC: 500,000 XQC 3rd place XQC: 250,000 XQC  For example, if you contribute 1.05 ETH, you will receive 10 EQC Lottery tickets. If you contribute 230 XEM, you will receive 2 XQC Lottery tickets. Pre-sale participants are not eligible for participation in the ICO lottery because of their existing discounts.",False

We seek to leverage the strengths of both NEM and Ethereum to fulfill our long-term vision of becoming a comprehensive marketing and advertising platform that is secure, reliable, scalable, and decentralized.  We have launched a demo for the first piece of the platform, Qchain Advertising, which is an application focused on connecting digital advertisers and content publishers through an advanced direct buy marketplace. We are also in the process of developing our second application, Qchain Surveys, which will provide an enterprise paid survey service for marketers, pollsters, and academics to inform their research. We will add applications in the future as we see fit to fill out the platform and fulfill or aims of building an entire end-to-end ecosystem for digital marketers and advertisers who want to run their whole workflow on blockchain technology.    To fund the continued development of the platform, we at Qchain are pleased to announce an open crowdsale for our two tokens that will service the Ethereum and NEM back-ends of the Qchain plattform. The tokens consist of the Ethereum-based and ERC20-compliant Ethereum Qchain (EQC) token, and the NEM-based XEM Qchain (XQC) mosaic. The crowdsale will begin October 24th, 2017 and will end by December 5th, 2017. To participate in our crowdsale, visit www.qchain.co/crowdsale and create an account on the forthcoming interface powered by our partner, Zerion.     ADVERTISING APPLICATION  There will be three agents interacting within our advertising application ecosystem: advertisers, publishers, and hosts. Within the Qchain ad network, hosts replace a centralized man-in-the-middle agent (such as Google) that exerts singular control over content, policies, and payment. Our host mechanism democratizes these functions across a decentralized network of nodes that confirm the terms chosen and agreed upon by advertisers and publishers via distributed consensus. This unique and innovative model enables thorough decentralization across all of the major functions of our platform, better protects against fraud and censorship, and improves scalability by not relying on a central party for distribution and verification of content and confirmation of transactions. Additionally, this maintains the privacy and accuracy of data on our platform, improving the quality of subsequent analytics. For our initial rollout, advertisers and publishers will connect with each other through our advanced augmented direct buy marketplace, which you can preview in our demo. We will implement programmatic marketing features and services to complement our direct buy marketplace in the future. We illustrate our plan for the creation and execution our advertising application in greater detail in its white paper and a forthcoming technical prospectus that will elaborate on the application‚Äôs coding and engineering. The creation of the direct buy marketplace will be a step towards a goal of creating a robust demand side platform for advertisers.         QCHAIN DSP  The Qchain demand side platform (DSP) will be a significant expansion of our direct buy application. The first rollout of the Qchain DSP will resemble traditional DSPs in structure and reliable function for advertisers looking to purchase ad units from content creators. We will facilitate the offering and auctioning of not only website display ads, but also video, podcast, native, and mobile app units with the use of our tokens.  Issues of trust, transparency, and openness have long hounded traditional DSPs. Hence, we will differentiate ourselves from traditional DSPs by offering dramatically increased transparency to our users that is made possible by the deployment of our infrastructure on blockchain technology, which allows for the public ledgering of advertiser and publisher and supply side platform (SSP) transactions. Transactions will be openly documented and easily searchable, such that advertisers can have a clear sense of how their advertising spending is being partitioned, and publishers can see easily track the fees and costs that were deducted to result in their final payout. The accessibility of a public ledger will also allow for easier detection and policing of ad fraud instances by third parties.   PAID SURVEY APPLICATION  The intention of our paid survey application is to enable marketers, pollsters, academics, A/B  testers, and other survey makers to quickly and securely obtain participant data to inform their research, predictions, and decisions by easily and smoothly opening up their surveys to college students, homemakers, and anyone looking for supplementary income. Researchers will enjoy similar advantages as advertisers do in our advertising application: they will be able to maintain control of their funds without transferring their control to a central agent. Furthermore, they will not have to go through a lengthy approval process and will be able to submit studies immediately after their registration. Participants will be able to receive immediate payout of EQC or XQC to their own wallets, following verification of their survey completion. This is in drastic contrast to most major paid survey sites presently, where participants must meet a high threshold of earnings from surveys before they are able to withdraw. Even worse, these thresholds are often filled with many caveats that prevent withdrawal, resulting in a massive waste of time for users.      PERSONAL DATA MARKETPLACE AND MANAGEMENT APPLICATION              The Qchain Personal Data Management and Marketplace (PDMM) application will revolutionize how everyday Internet users and marketing and advertising firms transfer and interact with user data. The application will give Internet users the ability to tokenize and permissionize their own data online, transforming the concept of digital data ownership and essentially allowing users to serve as their own data brokers. Users will be able sell data that they are comfortable with sharing via instantaneous auctions to marketing and advertising firms. Meanwhile, marketing and advertising companies will benefit from having access to an ethical avenue for purchasing and collecting data that users have openly shared. Furthermore, advertisers and marketers will be able to save costs by reducing the need for middlemen data management platforms (DMPs) to harvest and acquire second and third-party data at the behest of those companies. In short, the PDMM application will provide mutual benefit for Internet users and marketing and advertising companies. Functionality for the PDMM application will be integrated with our paid survey and DSP advertising applications.             The crowdsale web-page is located at www.qchain.co/crowdsale For the EQC portion of the crowdsale, only Ether (ETH) will be accepted. For the XQC portion of the crowdsale, only XEM will be accepted.       Donations will be sent to two multisignature wallet addresses, one for ETH donations and one for XEM donations. A hard cap maximum of 75,000,000 EQC and 75,000,000 XQC tokens will be sold for each crowdsale, representing 60% of the respective supply for each token. This equates to a hard cap of 18750 ETH for the ETH portion of the crowdsale and 18750000 for the XEM portion of the crowdsale. The amount of EQC or XQC tokens ultimately sold will represent 60% of the total respective EQC or XQC supply. There will be a 15% token bonus for participating within the first three days of the crowdsale, a 7.5% token bonus for the following week (seven days), and a 4% bonus for the next ten days thereafter. The crowdsale will last 42 days, or until the entire token supplies are exhausted, whichever occurs first. Tokens will be created prior to the commencement of the main crowdsale. Tokens will be transferred in real-time to contributor accounts after their contribution is received. Untransferred tokens from the initial supply not purchased during the crowdsale will be burned. The minimum threshold to be met for the ETH portion of the crowdsale is 1000 ETH. The minimum threshold to be met for the XEM portion of the crowdsale is 100,000 XEM. The XQC to XEM exchange rate will be at 4 XQC per 1 XEM. The EQC to ETH exchange rate will be at 4000 EQC per 1 ETH. The  code  for  the  crowdsale  will  undergo  testing  and  audit  by  the  Ethereum  smart contract development firm Zerion and core NEM developers before launch to ensure the security and integrity of the code. Resident from the US state of New York and countries sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) will be blocked from participation in the crowdsale interface. The OFAC-sanctioned countries to be IP-banned are as follows:  the disputed Crimean region, Cuba, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.                                           When is the crowdsale, and how long will it last?  The crowdsale will begin on October 24th at approximately 9:00 PM GMT, and continue for the following 42 days before ending on December 5th at 9:00 PM GMT.   Where and how can I buy your tokens?  A directory of the main website will be created at qchain.co/crowdsale with instructions for participating in the token launch once dates have been announced.  Contributors will be directed to two multisignature wallet addresses: one for ETH purchases and one for XEM purchases.  For the EQC portion of the crowdsale, only Ether (ETH) will be accepted, and for the XQC portion of the crowdsale, only XEM will be accepted. Tokens will be created before the crowdsale and transferred to contributors after their ETH or XEM contribution.  You will first need to have your own personal account/wallet for ETH and NEM. Then, you go onto an exchange and buy ETH or NEM, and transfer that to your personal account/wallet.  During the crowdsale, you buy EQC with ETH, and buy XQC with XEM. Send ETH and XEM from your personal wallet to our designated addresses, and you will get EQC and XQC back, respectively.  We are also now giving contributors the option of purchasing EQC or XQC with Bitcoin. If you would like to contribute with Bitcoin, please indicate your interest by filling out the following Google form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdBH_9NZUW6XEvKHB3nYAzdFMpZ1N14kA3MgZ9x-zxizdPmDQ/viewform   When will I receive my tokens?  EQC and XQC tokens will be created before the crowdsale and sent in real-time as contributions are received. Tokens corresponding to pre-sale contributions will be sent as soon as possible, but their sending may be delayed for several days after the beginning of the crowdsale, as pre-sale transactions are being manually processed.   What are the regional restrictions for participating in the crowdsale?  For legal safety, IP addresses from the U.S. state of New York and from countries or regions comprehensively sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) will be blacklisted from accessing the crowdsale interface. As such, residents from New York State and OFAC-sanctioned countries or regions will not be allowed to participate in the crowdsale.  At the time of this writing, very few countries and regions are comprehensively sanctioned by OFAC.  The scope of OFAC sanctions programs can change at any time, and new sanctions programs can be created without prior warning, so we cannot say whether a given country or region will have OFAC sanctions at the time of the crowdsale. A list of active sanctions programs, details concerning their scope, and links for more resources can be found at the U.S. Department of the Treasury's website.  For now, the IP addresses from the following comprehensively sanctioned countries and regions will be blocked from participating in the crowdsale: the Crimean region of Ukraine, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria.   How many tokens will be available for purchase?  A static maximum amount of 125,000,000 tokens will exist for each blockchain after the Ethereum token and NEM mosiac crowdsale, such that there will be a total maximum of 125,000,000 tokens. Sixty percent of these will be sold in the crowdsale, which is 75,000,000 tokens for each blockchain.   Will the crowdsale be secure?  Our code has been extensively tested and security audited by Zerion, leading developers of blockchain technology. Zerion itself will contract third party auditors to review their code.   How will funds from the crowdsale be used?  The majority of funds, approximately 80%, will be used for product development, workforce expansion and compensation, and physical company costs. 10% will be used for marketing and legal expenses, and the final 10% will be held as a contingency reserve. These figures are based on current estimates and may change as needed.   Are the crowdsale funds being kept in a way that ensures community trust and accountability?   We here at Qchain are 100% committed to conducting our crowdsale in a fair and ethical manner.  For token holder security, ETH and XEM funds will be held in escrowed 5-of-6 multisignature wallets, and two accounts of each wallet will be controlled by a third party. Our ETH crowdsale auditor, Zerion, will hold two of the accounts in the ETH 5-of-6 multisignature wallet. For the NEM multisignature wallet, two of the accounts will be held by distinguished members of the NEM community, Kailin and the NEM Foundation Vice President Jeff McDonald.  This gives crowdsale contributors robust protection, and it compels Qchain to be transparent with the 3rd parties and the cryptocurrency community. As a final measure of accountability, Qchain is US-based. Any donor can have confidence in contributing to the crowdsale.
