This is the first announcement in this forum, we are beginners at Bitcointalk, but in any case, we are ready to answer any of your questions. Sincerely, Blockchain Agro Trading  So, the announcement: BATT - the first crypto-currency for the agricultural sector  Whitepaper / Website/ GitHub / OnePager /  The ""Blockchain AgroTrading"" team presents the BATT token - the first real mechanism for grain trade and proposes to enter the digital future of the multibillion grain market together with us.  WHAT IS BATT  BATT is the first token for the agricultural sector, based on the concept of smart-contracts for grain trading, allowing tokenize the real sector of the agrarian economy.  WHAT DIFFERENTIATES USES OF BATT FROM TRADITIONAL GRAIN TRADE  Today farmer, selling grain, gets a little money, and the final buyer pays too much. The concept of BATT allows us to surpass traditional agro-trading by reducing the costs that arise from the chain of intermediaries who buy grain from small and medium-sized farms and sell it further, increasing the cost at each stage. Using BATT tokens, farmers will be able to earn more, and buyers and producers will be able to save colossal money anywhere in the world, regardless of their geographic location HOW DOES BATT WORK AND WHAT OBJECTIVES DOES IT SOLVE  BATT is a combination of physical technologies, real goods and digital blockchain technologies, based on the smart-contract of the Etherium. Each stage from the acceptance of grain crops to the storage and sending of grain to the end user passes under the supervision of sensors controlling the main grain quality indicators, all processes fix in the blockchain, and the participants (farmers, custodians and buyers) pay for services with BATT tokens that are easily converted in fiat money.  WHY IS BATT ATTRACTIVE FOR INVESTORS  Entering to the multibillion grain market will be the first step in way of tokenization of the real sector of the agrarian industry economy, which grows with the needs of the world's population. The number of BATT tokens is limited, which means that the value of the token will only increase over time, ensuring stable liquidity for all participants in the turnover of BATT.
