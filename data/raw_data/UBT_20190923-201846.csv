Thank you for your question.  Our working prototype connects our own SAP system (we are in the great situation to run our own complete and full installation with full development rights) with Ethereum smart contracts. Our smart adapter concept can be seen as a ""plugin"" concept, both abstracting from the technical channel of connection (e.g. SAP IDoc, RFC, but also SOAP, REST or FTP-Listener) and from the conntent (in SAP e.g. Orders01). So of course, other ERPs and off-chain systems can and will be connected as well. The existing client portfolio is about 90% using SAP, and this is also where our main company history is built on, besides Microsoft Technologies. Microsoft Dynamics NAV so naturally is another ERP we are facing.",False

We strive to announce some great partnerships soon.",False
