Also, I'm a decentralization supporter and a music fan. I've been following closely since then - proof is I'm still here. So this counts as a disclaimer for what I am about to say.  Honestly, if the publication of such important and essential information about an urgent swap after a hack depends on the personal life and schedule of one single person, I really ask myself how this project could become something big in the future.

You have stood with us in good and rough times, and your amazing moral and financial contribution to our product is what keeps us motivated all the time.  Today we once again ask you to stand with us in the face of a minor roadblock. In many of previous blog-posts, we had promised our community that we’ll have VOISE tokens listed on a top five exchange this exchange was OKEX, a Belize-based virtual currency exchange. Our promise was derived from a business commitment made by the OKEX team which, as we thought, was going to be executed in February.  We need to inform our valued community that the deal between Voise and OKEX met a dead end only recently, after multiple delays on the part of the OKEX team, we took over the project and during the negotiations the exchange changed the parameters for listing the Voise token. We feel they should have honored the original contract, despite any current policy changes.  We do not mean to put the OKEX team in a bad light but their refusal to list us after they agreed to list us, has gone over our heads. We have asked them for a proper explanation on the matter, but we haven’t received any concrete response yet. Which is why, we have decided to redirect our resources to get listed on other exchanges and we will revisit OKEX when we meet their new requirements that they have imposed on us and other projects. This is not isolated to Voise, from our understanding other projects are having similar listing issues.  We are hell-bent towards getting our tokens listed on exchanges, an listing suggestions can be sent to Brandon Diamond. This blogpost is an effort to stay transparent with you our community the voice of voise, and to ensure you all that we are committed to everyone’s success. We Continue to add voise tokens to other exchanges, Cryptowolf being the most recent: https://cryptowolf.eu/  Moving forward there will be more exchanges onboarded. We hope this clarifies some of the questions that surrounded the OKEX listing.

Typically, crypto projects come out with Android apps awhile before iOS so I imagine the iOS app is still a long ways off but progress is always good.  Can anyone explain the difference between Voise and Musicoin? They seem to be almost identical. Even their marketcaps are nearly the same.  I think Musicoin's advantage is offering free streaming and plans for their currency to be used as payments for merchandise and other things besides streaming and downloading songs. I'm not sure if the way they plan to fund the free streaming is sustainable. They're project has been around for longer.  Voise allows users to pay in fiat which I think is a big advantage. It enables people to try out the platform without having to worry about cryptocurrency. Once they are interested, then they might consider the cryptocurrency aspect more.   These are the only real differences I noticed. Is there more to Voise that I missed?",False

However, I think the decision to allow paying in fiat is a winning choice. The token economy is a niche, and it will take some time before it can go mainstream.

There might be a few projects that have made some gains, but most everything is down.  The main reason everything is down is with bad news from South Korea about them shutting down cryptocoin exchanges  And I'm sure the bad press about quite a bit of money getting stolen from a Japanese exchange added to it  If you notice, VOISE got quite a bit of attention just before the first Alpha launch, then it sold off back down to where it started from just before the buying in happened.  Then a month later it got hit with another wave and it went just over 17 times it's value at the bottom, but this time the sell off wasn't just VOISE alone, it was all cryptos across the board, so the influence wasn't just on VOISE alone, it's the entire cryptocoin world that got hit. All you have to do is check out coinmarketcap.com and look at all the charts, they all mirror each other, and that mirror is down, everything is down.  Which is the best time to buy in if your planning on seeing your investment grow.  The markets will always fluctuate, it's just how it goes.  VOISE is here to stay, just as many other cryptos will be here by mid summer and again will still be around by this time next year.

I agree, you can temporarially remove the solicitor and if it continues, then perminantly remove them.  But a mere mention of another music venue or a shared link to one in my mind is nothing to worry about.  I already know VOISE is going to be the best music exchange on the planet, I'm not to concerned about the other venues being discussed, you can even jump in and tell them to go fuck them selves, it's all part of the experience.",False

On that same Experience111 article, there are a number of people that have made mention of being banned for simply challenging the community with questions of concern.  For example, Experience111 wrote;  ""Are they actually doing that? I was banned from the Telegram for asking if the tech team of the alleged exchange gave a reason why they had to delay the listing so I wouldn't know...""  then vjunior60 mentions the problem about volunteers being a big to ban crazy, quoted below;  ""They went over this a few times tbf. They stated multiple times that they had to wait for the exchange to tell what went wrong and they finally stated btw what did end up happening. Some of the volunteers are getting a little too ban crazy, but andre the main guy is against banning and is going over with them about their behavior.""  Then again, ChikunShaman starts his input with;  ""I got Banned for asking solid questions also""  So, it seems to me that it's not just about keeping it clean, that they are banning people based on there own prejudices. This to me is not the way to handle the community. If we are to have a truly free and open discussion then we need to have debate, we cannot just shut everyone out because they go asking questions about the project.  I agree with jlawn on this, you can't just erase or ban everyone because you don't like what they have to say, it really does create a fake community.  I think d-ovo-p missed the point on this one completely, it has nothing to do with keeping it clean only  Perhaps they should have 2 community channels, one for people that want to have no real experience, and another for people that want to see it all.

To quote niggold's reply;  ""Opus claims it's the world's first decentralized music platform, and yet if you check out the old VOISE symbol VSM before the 1:1000 split on coinmarketcap.com https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/voise/ you can see that it was listed on JUNE 23, 2017, whereas Opus was listed on Aug 29, 2017 two months after VOISE, not before.""  Makes me wonder how Opus can lay claim to being the first decentralized music platform when they where added to coinmarketcap.com 2 months after VOISE, seems to me they got to work after they found out about VOISE.  Also very valid reassurance;  ""VOISE is also being successfully traded with good volume on 5 exchanges  Livecoin.net hitbtc.com cryptopia.co.nz bit-z.com coinexchange.io  VOISE has delivered on there announcements to be added to new exchanges in the past, with 5 now and another top 5 exchange on the way I'm not worried when they say they will be adding new exchanges in the future.""  I couldn't agree more, they have not failed to deliver in the past, why should anyone doubt them now, they have always delivered.  ""This sort of noisy behavior by Experience111 is a good reminder of everyones right to privacy, VOISE could make use of the VOISE masternodes to have anonymous transactions similar to DASH or PIVX to keep the artists earnings private from the publics viewing eyes.""  That is a great idea, VOISE should make the transactions untraceable, keeping not only the artists earnings, but others balances private as well. Just the fact that the author Experience111 of the article is sticking his noise where it doesn't belong is exactly why they should ad this feature to the VOISE platform.

We can build VOISE to be a strong free market music exchange with great creativity, both in the artists and in the developers that excess the VOISE network regardless of existing venues.  Obviously if it's someone flooding the channel with advertisements, I could see this being acceptable for removal.  But a mere discussion or mention or even a reference link to a song on youtube in my opinion is part of the discussion.

It's a circle, when the artists make money for selling their work it only helps everyone.  I disagree with your negative remarks, we can always use more performers, more talent to keep us all entertained.  Further more, VOISE is not just a stream only music exchange as is outlined in the white paper, you are not restricted to using the VOISE platform to listen to the music, which means that you will be able to get a copy of the music to listen to it with a music player that you like.  Free market and freedom to listen to the music you purchased freely!  Not sure about music quality at this time, that's a step further, but thinking flac would be nice, lossless for certain.",False

With masternodes, token holders will soon be able to access extra services and generate additional revenue, while the 50 million token burn should see an immediate impact on demand, resulting from a total supply decreasing by about 8%.  Music sharing innovator Voise announced these major developments in its latest round of updates aimed specifically at enhancing its potential as a revenue-centric platform with ever-increasing value for its native digital currency, the VOISE token. Since launching its alpha version in October, Voise has not stopped delivering new achievements, forming significant new partnerships that serve to strengthen its reputation as a serious player in the music industry and blockchain sphere. At the same time, Voise has not lost sight of its supportive community and token holders, whom it regards as its most important partners.

We signed important strategic partnerships, launched a beta platform, and our VOISE token got listed on many leading crypto exchanges. We could do all only because of your continued support and trust in our ambitions.  Mobile App, Anti-Piracy System in 2018’s Bucket List  Our roadmap for the year 2018 is prepared. We are already working with beta testers to improve the functionality of our platform, which is scheduled to be finished by the end of January, 2018. This will further assist us in designing responsive versions of Voise platform for iOS and Android devices. Yes! You heard it right. Now you’ll be able to listen to your favorite artists right from the comfort of your smartphone.  Team Voise plans to release the Voise mobile application by the end of March, 2018. We have already signed up more than 600 artists for the beta launch of our mobile apps.  But wait! There is more.  We’re glad to announce that we are also adding an anti-piracy system to our platform. In the previous version, there was a risk of celebrity impersonations as everybody could upload their choice of music to the Voise platform. An anti-piracy system is thus introduce to tackle the problem. It allows only verified artists to upload music. One of the methods to attain “verified” status, is to post about Voise on their official social media channels.  New Advertising Campaign, Exchange Partnerships & More  It will be too early to reveal all the details, but our team can ensure that we are working towards building a super-solid advertising campaign for Voise, the goal of which is to attract a minimum of 3.5 million users. More about this will be updated in our future Medium posts. Stay tuned.  We are also working actively towards listing VOISE tokens on one of the top 5 exchanges listed on CoinMarketCap.com during January, 2018. VOISE trading has already been started on Cryptopia,Bit-z, HitBtc, CoinExchange and LiveCoin.  Our belief in sticking to our original roadmap, and the community’s growing trust in us has taken our value to a tropospheric level. It can be very well observed via our token’s bullish performance in the latest intraday outcomes. As you can notice, we have almost doubled our market cap (and our habit for providing timely and concrete developments could boost VOISE token’s value even more). It proves people are investing in VOISE wholeheartedly; they believe in our concept.  https://medium.com/@voisecom/dev-update-5-more-features-in-voise-platform-in-2018-8cff7432fb2e",False

Ive been invested in this project and believed in it since the beginning. But over recent weeks ive become suspicious and decided I wanted answers. So I sent this on the telegram group.  Nick: I've been in this for a while but over the last two weeks some things have been bugging me. 1) Monero and Musicoin have made announcements about artists getting involved. Everytime someone brings it up with voise its avoided. Have any artists been approached? Are there any plans? 2) No mention of a coin burn on the white paper or road map but then you just decide a few weeks ago to burn 50m on xmas eve. Then you barely publicise it. Several people on here asked if it could get tweeted about so we could help you as a community push it out with retweets, but it was ignored. No public news on the burn at all today. Thats why despite the fact you're burning 50m coins today, the price is down. Down ffs. Literally every coin went up today and the coin thats burning 50m is down. WTF. 3) You say that this is an Italian company,  but everyone and everything associated with it appears to be in India. Why is that? 4) can you prove you have a partnership with Forbes ? Because I don't see any evidence. 5)You tried to get listed on binance but lost. Stating that binance were difficult to deal with and were unhelpful. Why then are polls still surfacing asking if we should try and get listed with them again? If they are a poor company with bad communication, why bother trying again? Just try someone else. Or is it just to make it look like you are doing something? 6)You say you will be the first decentralised music platform, but other compeditors are leaving you standing. Your appeal of giving 100 % of the profit sales to the artist is already being done by Musicoin.Who are already on bittrex and are racing ahead of you. Vib are also well ahead of you with the web app. Somebody said earlier, youll ""give them competition"". What like when Microsoft released the zume to compete against the Ipod ? How did work out for them? You keep telling people hodl and long term. How long ? Because musicoin and VIB are not waiting around for you to give them competition. They probably don't even consider you competition anymore.  I honestly think this coin burn was one last attempt to keep the coin alive and or for the Devs to cash out. If this coin is still around this time next year ill come back and apologise, but I honestly don't think I'll have to.  The admins completely ignored my questions and this morning came online and started slagging everyone off for being impatient.  One of the admins then said "" I can prove the messages we had with binance. I saved them"". So someone said ok, show me. I want to see. The admin dissappeared and still hasn't replied.  Ive seen on twitter and on telegram group that the project is based In Italy. Yet twice today one of the admins has said the project is in spain ?  Everyone keeps saying that the devs arent answering as its xmas and they are with their families. So why schedule a token burn for xmas eve?  Someone answered up this morning and said the marketing isn't finished yet. So why burn tokens when you haven't marketed yet ?  And finally , when they were still called VSM they claimed they already had an artist signed. Who? And whats happening with that? Because it hasn't been mentioned again since the name changed.  People can argue me or stick up for them and that's fine, but my mind has already been made up.",False

The Whitepaper is sparse with real technical details, the software is not currently existent (which was not true of Aragon, another Ethereum-based ICO).

I think whoever solves that problem first will benefit greatly in this sector!

""Don't quit your day job"" is the first advice most artists get the moment they reveal their intentions. The industry is highly competitive, opportunities are limited, producing content is tasking and putting them out is saddled with challenges.  ""Don't do it for the pay, do it for the passion"" tends to be the follow up when the artist starts encountering difficulty distributing their works or having intermediaries cut into whatever meager reward they should have been reaping.  Making a living as an artist is incredibly hard when every play boils down to distribution. Self-distribution rarely provides the artist with the necessary exposure to justify the effort, while third-party distributors will take anywhere between 15 to 40% of revenue generated by content. Factoring production cost of content, marketing, and logistics, the artist is often left with nothing to take home.  https://coinidol.com/voise-blockchain-music-artist-platform-set-for-full-alpha-launch/",False

You can try to utilize chart trends but what i've is that on an exchange like CE these are irrelevant. You can get a somewhat clearer picture with hitBTC but it won't be until we hit Bittrex or a higher volume exchange that ties in with something like tradingview that you can actually get a clearer unbiased answer. Let me reiterate the guys at VOISE have zero control over the free trading markets, asking them about price speculation is akin to asking a watch maker if he thinks the price of bananas will increase or decrease in 30 days. Most people will then ask that same person or group of people if they should buy those bananas now or wait and buy them later.

Here are the mistakes, just something that does not work. 1)90% of people simply can not register, or rather they can not receive confirmation by e-mail, I myself was able to register from 4 emails only for 1, the rest of the mail did not come to the letter and they are not the same in spam. All efforts should be aimed at solving this problem. 2)The albums tab is made inconvenient! - There is one line that you wash flipping, and the rest of the space is empty, it is better in my opinion to make a list. Screenshot - https://prnt.sc/gyub94 3)Tab GENRES one solid problemma - as seen in the screenshot - https://prnt.sc/gyucar, nothing is displayed. It's also very annoying for the empty space to the right of the scrolling ... why is it empty, and not what good background? 4)PODCASTS and RADIO not active. 5)Very little music, very, very little! 6)Not actively adding to playlists, favorites, etc. 7)http://prntscr.com/gyuh8a  The number 1, 2 is too empty space! It is necessary to add something, maybe a background. Digit 3 - when you hover over any piece, including a song pops up a little window that blocks part of the playback ...

One being the pay per song methodology of your platform. It will never pick up again. Fans of music have become accustomed to paying a small monthly fee to listen to literally every song which has been released for god knows how long. While independent/unsigned artists are more likely to host their music due to the possibility of getting paid, most will head towards platforms like Soundcloud and Bandcamp which are established and already have an active fan base who have helped in a number of success stories.  The one place I could see your idea working is in sync music. If you transfer your platform to be one in which artists can post their music and Have it pitched for commercial syncing to films, adverts, games etc I could see it as being a more viable business plan.

That's true all Altcoins are suffering, but their volumes are much higher, because people are actively buying and selling. Not many people are buying vsm.

Well if you are in the game to make money with your investment, sell high, buy low. Repeat. If you hold too long, it might keep slip to a price that's low for you resulting in loss, even if you sell. Specially new altcoins... not all altcoins survive.   Edit:  Side note to all investors of vsm, make sure that most of you move to livecoin to increase the 24h volumes.. Now the biggest volume of this coine is on Cryptopia.  If you look to Exchange rankings:  Livecoin is number 21! With max daily trade volume of 8 to 10 million usd. Cryptopia is number 44!

We think this will attract some trading volume as well of exposure of the platform itself. Cryptopia is a great option for the reasons stated above but also because it’s on the blockfolio app which most big traders use to keep track of their investments trough different exchanges. Not only we will add $VSM to cryptopia but some users were concerned with showing the voise token on coinmarketcap, so we have already contacted the coinmarketcap team to list the token there which will for sure attract some attention and possibly new users and investors.  source on medium : https://medium.com/@voiseit/voise-after-the-crowdsale-1w-q3-2017-88e639f0e020",False

Since we published the announcement, ether price has almost tripled, we'll have to ask the investors if they would agree on lowering the required amounts we can't just change them without setting up some sort of DAO voting or poll, obviously we'll always try to promote the platform but we had some ideas in mind that would require a higher amount than the minimum (at the moment of publishing our project). 600,000$ is more than enough to fully develop and promote VOISE but we didn't know 7500ETH would be worth this much, we probably should have planned what to do but we didn't and now we are sorting out what to do since we probably won't raise 7,500eth now that ether's price has raised that much. And to answer your technical question about the p2p integration, we're currently developing it using a swarm method to distribute the audio files but everything could change before releasing the decentralized clients since we plan to hire more experienced developers with the amount raised at the crowdsale.",False

That's a prealpha of what the platform will be like, currently it's only stored in our server until we publish the smart contract in a couple days, after that we'll be able to upload content through ethereum's blockchain, that's what the token is used for. Once the crowdsale starts and tokens are issued to their respective buyers, we'll release the web platform code so everyone is free to host their own node but we still have work to do specially with encryption, one of the uses of the funds will be auditing the platform's code to guarantee its security before releasing the source.  Ok, it makes me recall the video sharing project before. Music on blockchain is good idea to implement. Good luck with your development. Thanks a lot for your support!

There's no adds on VOISE, you pay once for every song and you can then listen to it as much as you want, not only with the platform's player but also every other third party player since you'll have access to the audio file, think of it more like an open and decentralized itunes.

So if you already spend some time on development im sure you have something to show working on your platform so everyone can check it. If you dont have any to show because you didnt even started yet + you are asking money for crowdsale to start launching a project its very much looks scammy to me. So that means you and your team are that much lazy and dont want to do anything without money that you want to get from people.  So here it is. We have Musicoin thats already offering a working alpha platform and with everyday ongoing development without ANY ICO and from other side we have your VOISE that didnt even started yet, didnt have anything to show, just some pictures with roadmap and programmed crowdsale contract on which people should throw money in it. Yes that looks scammy to me and with good reasons. You have nothing behind and yet you asking for money. First you should show something what you got before you get the money for development.

We acknowledge that a high consumer base of the music industry doesn't know about cryptocurrency or blockchain, that's why we plan to accept fiat currencies in the future, to attract more users and get them to care about cryptocurrency by being tolerant towards fiat currency but giving privileges to those users and artists that accept cryptocurrency as payment method we will promote its usage.  At current state, the platform itself works like a wallet, you can either transfer your funds to accelerate the purchase of content at the expense of paying double the amount of gas since it needs two transactions instead of one or sending the required amount directly to the artist, this will require you to access your wallet and manually make the transaction.  This system may be improved in the future and we are open to user suggestions, we expect the technical aspects of the platform to get better and better as the number of users, content and transactions grows and we get more feedback.    ** WHITEPAPER **      Voise would be a music streaming platform, where artists would upload music by setting a price and platform users can stream the content paying in VSM Tokens.  The price of the content is decided by the original artist who uploads the content and gets 100% of the revenue, there’s no fees besides having some ether to pay for the gas. Artists can offer a free sample of their songs so possible buyers can listen at least a part of it before making the decision of purchasing it. A 30 second sample should be enough. Artists could also offer their content for free and ask for donations. We will be happy to introduce new ways of monetizing content for artists as soon as the platform grows.     The platform itself doesn’t have a high maintenance cost so it doesn’t need to generate huge profits, some of the ways the team is going to get funds to sustain the project are:   • Promotions, artists could pay to show a song in the “Discover” section of the platform,    the VOISE team has clarified that paid promotions will be marked with a symbol to let the users know it was paid.  • An exchange fee, the internal exchange of the platform will have a fee like any other exchange.    Users are free to use any other exchange but its recommend to use the VOISE exchange for commodity and to contribute maintaining the platform.  • A fee for fiat payments, to encourage people to use cryptocurrency a fee on fiat payments will be applied.   • Radio and extras, the team will also get profits from some sections of the platform like the radio.  • Custom profiles and themes, as an artist you will be able to customize your profile with CSS themes, you’ll have to pay for those or use one of the free themes.    The VOISE team claims that the themes and customization options will be aesthetic only and won’t include any functionality.
