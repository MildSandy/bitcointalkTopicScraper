There are 19 members listed in the whitepaper, most from the Netherlands, but then they have 13 blockchain engineer/developers living in Ukraine. Boy Ramsaha i- Founder. Popular guy in the Euro Cannabis culture. Organized several international fairs around the world. 1991, founded High Life and Soft Secrets, 2 popular Cannabis magazines. Founder of Royal Queen Seeds, one of the biggest cannabis seed banks in the world, with 7 brand stores. Also owns a CBD lab in Switzerland. Has over “250 people on the payroll” of his different companies. Jan Scheele – CEO. Has spent 7 years as Partner/Director at Strabico, an event services company with 2-10 employees, in Amsterdam. 17 years as Director at Caesus, a web development site with 11-50 employees. TedTalk Netherlands host. Jack Janssen – CFO.  Current Business Controller at 4 different companies. Royal Queen Seeds, cannabis seed/oil producing company. Yuqo (30 employees), Cibdol AG (8 employees), and International Blockchain Solutions (parent company of BitCanna?) Paulo Ramos (CTO), Is the leader of the development team. Four law advisors round out the team. There isn’t too much hype around this yet, but it’s still very early. They have a lot of business and media partnerships  Verdict In order to get this project running, the team decided to create a network of allies/partners called BitCanna Alliance. BitCanna Alliance is a strategic initiative formed by leaders in the European cannabis industry. It’s currently made up of some of the most prominent seed banks and cannabis dispensary firms in Europe, serving more than 10 million unique visitors every month. There are over 20 businesses already signed on including some big players; Cibdol (a leading online CBD shop),  Zamnesia (biggest online smart and seed shop in Europe), and Royal Queen Seeds (one of the biggest global seed brands.)  Risks     The 20 team members listed in their whitepaper lack blockchain experience. However, supposedly they have a team of 13 senior developers working constantly on the project in Ukraine. “They choose to remain anonymous for their own respective reasons.” -1     There’s going to be a 10% inflation rate, which will over time work its way down to 0%, but is simply too much. -2     It won’t be fully developed until Q2 2021. If the token price crashes, which it just might because of 10% inflation, they will run out of funds. -1.5     If Cannabis gets legalized throughout the entire EU, this coin could lose its purpose. -1     No MVP, and their GitHub is not very active at all. -1     As you can see below, it isn’t exactly hard to get into the BitCanna Alliance. And it comes with only benefits to any business that signs up. It’s not like a binding long-term commitment or anything. -1  Growth Potential     The BitCanna alliance is impressive. Denmark’s Leading Online Grow Shop, leading euro CBD shop, etc.. +3     Huge, exploding billion dollar industry, and everyone wants a piece. +4     To protect the privacy of consumers, they will develop BitCanna ID where once your id is established, it will be encrypted and hashed, giving customers and sellers identity without having to give out any personal info. +2     The BitCanna Alliance are currently in Europe. The goal is to expand to the US market and even worldwide once a solid foundation has been built. +2     Passive income: Masternodes and proof of stake offer large rewards, starting out at 10% inflation.+2     They are being advised by 4 separate lawyers. +1  Disposition The cannabis blockchain competition is not very tough yet. If BitCanna has a successful ICO and mainnet launch, they will probably be the best canna crypto on the market.
