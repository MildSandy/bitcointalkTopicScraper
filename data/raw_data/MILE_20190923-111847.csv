Revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2017-2022) of 19.2% resulting in a market volume of $28.37B in 2022."" Statista.com.  SnagRide is America’s first long-distance ridesharing community that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology through Smart Contracts.     ------------------------------ SnagRide is America’s first long-distance ridesharing community that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain technology through Smart Contracts. This technology allows the SnagRide platform to easily and securely manage the lifecycle between drivers and passengers willing to travel together between cities and share the cost of the trip. At SnagRide, we recognize that there is a need for an affordable, secure and convenient long distance ridesharing alternative in the U.S. that users can use to request door-to-door pick up and drop off all across the country at the tap of a button on their smartphones. Our goal will be to provide our users an easy and secure transportation alternative between major cities that does not involve cramp seats on a slow bus, unreliable and expensive regional passenger trains, or the interminable hassle of a plane ride. ------------------------------       The SnagRide application will be available soon in the App Store and Android Play Store for download and will allow users to offer city to city rides in their vehicle for a fee. SnagRide is the first decentralized traveling ride sharing app in the world that will ensure a high level of security using AI and blockchain technology.    The SnagRide App     The SnagRide token  The MILE token will be used to pay for rides, provide rewards and discounts to riders and drivers, and for smart contract creation. Riders will be able to purchase MILE tokens on exchanges or on our platform and redeem them for rides. Drivers will be paid according to how the transaction was made. For example if a ride is booked with MILE tokens the driver would also be paid in MILE tokens. However, the driver would be paid in USD if the rider decides to pay using his debit or credit card.  We will reward loyalty because it lowers our marketing expenses. We will divide our user base into several categories depending on the total number of rides offered or booked by a given user, as well as different types of actions performed by users. These actions include events such as posting a ride, booking a ride, submitting a photo Id, proof of insurance, getting a 5 star rating and much more. By combining actions, users increase their participation in the SnagRide ridesharing community and earn reward MILE tokens that can be redeemed on the application for future transactions. Users monthly activity on SnagRide will predominantly determine their loyalty rewards. This can be compared in many ways to the mechanics of current rewards programs like Air Miles.    Market size      The roadmap     Token Distribution Information  The pre-sale will last a total of four weeks followed by a four week Crowdsale at $0.25 per SnagRide Token. Each week of the pre-sale offers a bonus in the form of a discount applied to the price per token. Each week and until the end of the pre-sale period this bonus will change to a pre-set discount. The sale will end at either when all tokens are sold or at the conclusion of the Crowdsale.  Tokens will be distributed either two weeks after all tokens are sold or at the conclusion of the public Crowdsale, nine weeks after the start of the pre-sale.
