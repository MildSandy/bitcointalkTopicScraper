We have not written for a long time, and we have accumulated a lot of news!  First, about our closed alpha testing. All those who took part successfully downloaded the application and played: they found hidden containers, opened them and received ARCUS tokens. During testing, some errors were found and corrected. Now we need more. We want to test the application on all possible phones, on different versions of Android. Therefore, we have attracted a second group of testers and offer everyone who wants to try to play ARCUS and give us feedback. And yes, we can assume that our game is the airdrop of ARCUS tokens! If you like freebies - act, download the game and get for free what others have to pay for! To play ARCUS write to any of the administrators or in the comments to this post name of your city and locations where it will be more convenient for you to search for containers (you can send coordinates, or just write a popular place in your city and we will hide our tokens there)  Secondly, we launched the sale of tokens on BiteBTC. The turnover of the exchange 10 500 000 $ per day! Now you can buy ARCUS tokens there for BTC or DOGE. Catch a reference: https://bitebtc.com/  Third, as promised, after the alpha test, we raise the price for our token! At this point in time, the price of the ARCUS token is $ 0.015. Officially, the start of the token sale will begin, as promised, on 01.11.18, and by the launch of the main stage of the token sale, we will raise the price according to White Paper. Right now, you have the last chance to redeem our coins left over from the Pre-sale at a price of $ 0.015. You can buy them on the exchanges BiteBTC or WavesDex. In addition, you can write to any of the project participants and get help in purchasing coins!  Doubt in purchase? Play!

News. Today everything information is in short and in fact!  ALREADY TOMORROW! Tomorrow the main stage of the Token sale ARCUS starts. You can buy our coins on the BiteBTC and WavesDEX exchanges for $ 0.03! For all questions please contact, we will be happy to answer your questions!  We will tell you a little about our interim results and you discard all doubts about investing in the ARCUS project!  We conducted alpha testing, which was very fascinating to the players. Although the test is over, they still continue to enter the application and look for containers, even empty ones. And this is a good result.  Now we are planning to launch the application in Kazan. To attract the attention of players, we introduce a rating system. The one who collects the most containers in the period from November 16 to January will receive an iPhone XS MAX! But this is not all bonuses! In the containers will be hidden free gifts in the form of coffee, pizza, movie tickets, etc., as well as discounts on favorite products and services. We have found advertisers who will cooperate with us and these are networks with well-known names in Kazan. If you are from Kazan, join our VKontakte group: https://vk.com/arcus_play. There will be all the news on the game.  After launching in Kazan, we will begin to expand and launch the application throughout Russia and the world!  Now to the most interesting information for investors: Now we have a large investor and several small but very lucky investors who managed to buy our tokens at a price of $ 0.01. Thanks to them, we have implemented what we have at this stage - a ready-made application that runs on Android phones above version 5.1. and which we can safely launch into work, so far in one city. After launching in Kazan, we want to expand, for that we need money! Therefore, we are holding a Token sale, which has 145 million ARCUS tokens. The price of the token will grow from $ 0.03 to $ 0.06. Read more about this in our White paper: http://ico.arcus.city/assets/arcus_wp_v2_0_en.pdf .  Why is it profitable to buy ARCUS tokens? We are in a circular dependency: to place an advertisement, an advertiser buys ARCUS tokens from the team and places them in containers. Players find ARCUS tokens and sell them on the stock exchange or ARCUS team. Since the number of tokens is limited, in the future we ourselves will buy out the tokens from the exchange in order to sell them to advertisers. Accordingly, the more players and advertisers, the greater the demand for coins, the higher their price. Advertising market, one of the richest. So now you make a decision - do you want to make money on it?  We will be happy to answer all your questions. See our updated website: https://arcus.city/ Write your comments.

Cartoon in Russian, so we attach the translation into English in text format! Enjoy!  ""One boy once fell into a parallel world, where everyone was wild and ill-bred, but since he was a novice IT engineer, he reinvented the computer there, and all the games and programs, and eventually became the king of the planet.  And the other boy was abducted by aliens, but he also knew how to program and managed to reflash the spacecraft so that he listened only to him, and flew back to earth, and brought with them the aliens for experiments. And the president himself handed him the medal, and the house by the sea, and a bicycle.  And yet, one time, one girl was sitting in the park with a book on programming, and the most beautiful boy in the world was passing by, and when he saw that she was reading, he immediately confessed to her in love, and they lived happily ever after, and all the time programmed.  A fat boy decided to write a game and was so carried away that he forgot to eat all the time, and he lost weight while writing, and then this game was sold, and he became a millionaire and a playboy.  And there was also the case when an ugly girl learned programming best of all and became the director of a huge corporation, and all the boys followed her, because there are many beautiful women, but it is difficult to find the smart ones.  And one hooligan decided to study programming simply from boredom, and he suddenly had a talent for this, and he immediately received a bunch of awards, and bought a car, and went to study at the best institute. And all his hooligan friends continued to drink beer in the yard and did not achieve anything in life.  And the other boy was so smart, that he had no one to talk to, because everything seemed to be stupid compared to him, and they wanted to put a monument to him, and to do the president, but he refused, because he was conducting an interesting project, and his terms were burning. And then he met that ugly little girl who became the director, and they immediately understood each other and spoke all night long and mostly about programming.  Or here was the case. One boy was kicked out by his wife, and he did not go to drink alcohol, as she expected, but he learned a programmer and got rich and bought a new apartment. And every time he drove past his wife's house, he laughed out loud.  And someone looked this cartoon and also decided to become a programmer, although aliens did not steal it, but he always had an interesting job for which they paid him a lot of money.  And in general, everything in the future developed very much even super.""  Have a nice day, guys! 😉",False

Boris is a little conservative, so part of his bag will necessarily will be filled the coins of this group, with a large team and support, and less likely to burst. But Boris realizes that this will not give him rapid growth, so he adds coins from other groups to his bag. 2. Altkoins, who have already proved themselves and continue to develop. Coins of this category are more volatile than Bitcoin or Ethereum, since they have a lower capitalization. They basically have a good idea and great growth potential, so Boris will add them to his portfolio, but also will not expect fast results from them. 3.

And how much do you remember? Marketers around the world are actively studying their customers, coming up with attractive offers and looking for new channels of communication so that advertising is more focused and attracts new customers.  The Internet is our friend, our enemy. With the advent of the Internet, people have access to enormous amounts of information, the ability to quickly build communications, including with people from different countries and, of course, the way to ""kill time."" According to the latest data received from GlobalWebIndex, the average Internet user today spends about 6 hours a day using devices and services, the work of which depends on the connection to the Internet. This, roughly speaking, is the third of the whole waking time. If we multiply this time by 4 billion of all Internet users, we will get a staggering figure - in 2018 we will total 1 billion years online. Advertisers use this situation and advertising on the Internet accounts for 40% of global advertising budgets. Such advertising gives many views, increases the number of subscribers, but does not provide an opportunity to calculate how many new subscribers are generated in traffic. We know how to attract live traffic directly to you! ARCUS - the future of advertising! The advertising platform in augmented reality will become interesting for users thanks to fascinating gameplay processes, and the opportunity to receive rewards for viewing advertising will increase the level of customer loyalty. Together with ARCUS, advertisers will be able to ""manage"" the client's behavior. The scheme is simple: the advertiser buys the necessary number of containers - places them near their sales points - receives live customers who search for containers and come to the ""right"" place - they get the necessary data in the advertiser's office to analyze the success of the advertising company and general statistics.  Thus, advertisers receive: 🔥 Unusual advertising (advertising in augmented reality will allocate among competitors) 🔥 Loyal customers (customers get a nice bonus in the form of tokens or parts of top-end crypto and bonus from the advertiser: discount, gift, etc.) 🔥 Clients come directly to the points of sale (the Advertiser can place containers at those points that need more advertising support) 🔥 A favorable price for a live customer! 🔥 Ability to obtain the necessary data for statistics and analysis right in the office of the advertiser.  Already in July, the alpha-version of our application will be released and we will be able to get the first performance indicators for this site, after which we will prepare the application for the release.

Now the augmented reality is known to people in many respects thanks to the beloved Snapchat, but soon the technology of augmented reality will help us in various areas of life: medicine, training, navigation, etc.  Recently, Google introduced the navigation mode in Augmented Reality in Google Maps at the I / O 2018 conference. In Google Maps, AR-navigation mode will appear, in which the user can see the hints on the route, superimposed on the images from the camera in real time. To do this, Google has developed a Visual Positioning System that combines map data, current location, Google Street View snapshots and camera image. Google Product Vice-President for AR, VR - Aparna Chennapragada does not announce the release date. It should be noted that Google is not the only ones who decided to use AR in the navigation application.  Blippar released the Augmented Reality Navigator on ARKit at the end of last year! AR City can already be downloaded from the App Store. Developers promise to develop software, adding new features. But since The application was created using ARKit, it requires an iPhone 6s / SE / iPad of 2017 or a more powerful device.  Popular in Russia free navigation application Yandex.Maps has received support for the new operating system iOS 11, and with it support for augmented reality as far back as September 2017. In version 9.6 of the program in the mode of the walking route a big blue button appeared, clicking on which you can get help in construction of the optimal route. Looks like help in the form of additional arrows showing the right direction to reach the destination. We are pleased that AR-technologies are actively developing, we support all those who are interested in this field and we will happily communicate on this topic. Recall, ARCUS will use the technology of augmented reality to engage users in the game, increasing the level of their socialization. The entire gameplay will be built on AR: it is through the application that users will find virtual containers and open them, as well as virtual advertising, quest elements and much more will be used in the application. #ARCUS  https://c.radikal.ru/c05/1805/fd/af3bcf18f5e2.png",False

ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is a new tool to attract investment in the project by issuing and selling its tokens to a wide range of investors with the subsequent goal of developing its project for the money received. Investors' interest lies in the fact that the tokens of successful projects are traded on crypto-exchange exchanges and, with the success of the company, bring a good profit. Investing in ICO is always a risky process, but for crypto investors there are many advantages. 1. Easy access of private persons to project financing Almost anyone can become an investor of the project they like, only the presence of the necessary crypto currency and basic knowledge is necessary. Often the project sites have a detailed description of how to invest their money and get tokens of this project. 2. High profitability With the success of the project, investors often receive super-profits. On the crypto-currency market there are no rare cases when in relatively short periods of time the tokens of successful projects grew in price by 1000% or more. 3. Low input threshold You can invest almost any amount, for example, the price of one ARCUS token at the stage of pre-sale = $ 0.01. Such accessibility together with high profitability certainly fuel interest in this industry.  It's tempting, is not it? But do not forget, before investing money in the project, it is important to understand it. There are many sites that help evaluate the success of the ICO. Today we will tell you about some parameters that you should pay attention to. 1. The uniqueness of the project. What problem does the project solve? How many competitors do they have? Do you think the project is necessary and will it be able to cope with the task? 2. Objectives. Carefully study the Road map of the project. Do you understand all the goals? Do not be afraid to ask questions! 3. Scalability. Simply put, how do you think, how much will this project be relevant? To what extent it can grow. 4. White paper. It is there that the project is described. Do you understand everything? Is it all concrete? If you are confronted with vague wording, it is better to ask questions to the organizers. After reading White paper you should have a full idea of the project. 5. Financial component. The organizers of the ICO should tell you why they are collecting money, and you should understand what your investments will go to and what result you want to receive. 6. The concept is a product. Not all projects go to the ICO with the finished product. And this is normal: many developments require $ 1-2 million of investments, and the creators do not have such money, but the ideology of the new product should be a must for the ideologists. Developers attracting investments to ICO, are required to explain in detail how the product will work, thereby generating profits, how successfully to compete with existing ideas. The concept should be ""licked"" and described in such a way that everything could be understood even by an uninitiated person. 7. The team. These people are responsible for the implementation of the project. Read about them more, if you want, get acquainted - this will help you understand how responsible they are about implementing the project and assess their skills.  We are the ARCUS team. We will be pleased if you study our project, evaluate it and write your comments in the comments.

The violent growth of bitcoin cost in the end of 2017 caused many people who consider crypto-currencies a ""soap bubble"" to reconsider their point of view and start studying this topic. Basically, of course, Bitcoin is seen as an attractive object for investment: some time ago it was possible to buy it for hundreds of dollars, now it costs thousands, and in the near future it can quite reach the level of tens of thousands. Accordingly, anyone who has time to acquire bitcoin before the next jump in value will naturally increase its capital. Nevertheless, against the background of the growing popularity of bitcoin, we should not forget that in this case we are talking about the crypto currency. That is, it is about currency. And the main function of currency - used for payments for goods and services. Can the crypto currency officially become the payment system of the future?  In fact, despite the fact that bitcoin is trying to involve the whole world in one way or the other, it's too early to talk about its mass introduction into the everyday life of people. As of today, there are two most significant obstacles: • Low level of confidence in the crypto currency of the population • Lack of legislative base Both obstacles are closely related. As soon as the crypto currency is officially recognized in this or that country, the level of confidence in it will increase. At the same time, governments will be ready to recognize the crypto currency only when a significant number of people within the country trust the crypto currency and actively use it.  However, already now a growing number of companies around the world are starting to take bitcoin as payment for purchases, and against this background, cryptoeconomy enthusiasts often say that bitcoin will challenge the usual payment instruments and become one with cash and payment cards. Innovations are always perceived with caution! Remember how recently people did not trust plastic cards, and now systems that accept payment by cashless settlement are in every store! This fact gives grounds to assume that the crypto currency may well become an official means of payment! In addition, more and more countries are thinking about legalizing crypto-currencies. To date, the crypto currency has been recognized and legalized in: the USA, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, Estonia, Denmark, South Korea, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland. A number of countries are thinking of taking bitlock as a new legal digital currency or not, namely: Russia, Japan, Belgium, Colombia, Czech Republic, Germany, New Zealand, Israel, Ukraine, France, Croatia, Belgium, Poland, Hong Kong, Slovenia, Turkey, Singapore, Switzerland, Spain and many others. There are also countries that have banned the bitcoins: China, Bangladesh, Iceland, Lebanon, Vietnam, Thailand, Bolivia, Ecuador, Kyrgyzstan, Indonesia. The funniest thing is that in some of these countries, despite all the prohibitions, there are data centers renting capacities for cloud mining and not only.  We believe that the future is for the crypto currency! And you?  https://a.radikal.ru/a17/1805/ec/9df87814284b.jpg",False

I would like to start with the executive director of ARCUS.CITY - Lev Eidinov.  https://a.radikal.ru/a32/1804/52/8d52ed82b57f.jpg  Lev Eidinov is a designer, author of Internet concepts of things and augmented reality. Lev has experience in creating a design studio and an advertising agency. Since 2003 he worked as a graphic designer and since 2010 - as an art director. Author of the master classes ""Practical typography. Work on mistakes ""(2013) and"" How to sell design ""(2015). He headed the first association in Russia to create branded qr-codes ""Qr-branding.ru"" (2011-2013). Co-founder and art director of the advertising agency ""All Advert"". In 2016, Lev came up with the concept and interface of the mobile application ""Finding chips"" and decided to realize his idea. This is how the ARCUS project appeared  It is pleasant to conduct acquaintance in a dialogue format, so today we interviewed Lev Eidinov.  - Good morning, Lev. Tell us how the ""idea"" of the mobile application ""Search for chips"" was born? - Good morning. It was in 2016. Just appeared the game Pokémon Go. And, not just appeared, but literally broke into the information space. If you remember, a lot has been said and written about this game: and that it's the intrigues of special services for espionage, and a story with a not quite smart blogger who caught Pokemon in the temple. You can treat Pokémon Go differently, but this application showed one important thing. People are ready to interact with augmented reality; they do not need training and adaptation. Augmented reality itself fulfills the fundamental principle of interface design: ""The best interface is its absence."" ""Search for chips"" - a concept that offered to catch in the AR is not the Pokemon, but the chips. Inside the chips was a game currency and a promotional code from the advertiser. Having completed a simple quest, you could increase the amount of in-game currency or get an additional bonus.  - Why did you decide to link your project with the crypto currency, and not by other means of payment? - Let's draw a parallel. How many people want to catch a rare Pokemon? How much do you want a promotional code for a cup of coffee? And how many people want to find, for example, 0.1 military technical cooperation? With each example, the number of potential players increases. Last year can be safely called the year of the crypto currency: before the New Year, 35 million people would like to receive bitcoin as a gift. People are increasingly understanding the value of crypto-currency assets. So why do not we let them get this asset? In addition, the crypt replaces the in-game currency. Why should we reinvent the wheel if there are ready-made block-based solutions that allow us to create a full-fledged utility-token? Certainly, the crypto currency is the tool of the future. I do not know if they can completely replace Fiat, but sure that they will exist and have value, I am sure.  - What are the problems to solve your application? Why do you think that it is necessary in society? - We were able to make sure that AR technology"" came in ""and has a lot of applications at the moment - from projection devices in cars to surgery. And the first, who can massively monetize technology - will collect the cream. And the easiest way to monetize is advertising. How much do you, business owners, pay for a potential customer to make STA? And how much are you willing to pay for a potential customer at the door of your institution? And you, the user of the network, are not tired of constant advertising? Are you ready to receive real money for this? Yes, we are creating a new advertising channel. But not the next ""buy a link without SMS and registration"", but ""be in the right place, and we will pay."" And if the previous channels offered to visit the site, then ARCUS offers to visit LOCATION.  - Tell us about your achievements both professional and personal - I took part in a lot of projects. Some shot, some do not. I have awards of design competitions, many times I got into short-lists. My hobby is high-altitude climbing, as nothing else teaches purposefulness. From the ability to solve the necessary tasks at the right time depends on your life. I have two sons, and for their sake and for their generation, we must create an environment.  - Thank you for your openness. It was nice meeting you. Maybe you want to say something to the readers at last? - Consume less, create more. Think, analyze. Do not be afraid to look like idiots. Do so that others say: ""Why, so it was possible?"". Dream.

Today we will talk with the financial director Ilgizar Rakhmatullin.  https://a.radikal.ru/a04/1804/9f/2dcb516697d5.jpg  Ilgizar has experience in banking, he is an expert in finance, securities and project management. In the financial markets since 2004. In 2011, he founded a business representative office of the Czech plant for the production of agricultural machinery, in 2015 he founded a chocolate factory from scratch. Ilgizar is a versatile personality, he has experience in creating business processes, economic models, marketing and sales. Today we talked with Ilgizar Rakhmatullin and interviewed him.  - Good afternoon Ilgizar, it's nice that you gave us time. I would like to start with this question: When did you become interested in crypto-currencies and what was the cause of this interest? - For the first time I learned about crypto currency in the distant 2011, of course it was bitcoin. As now I remember its cost was within a few tens of dollars. My first attitude was in a negative light, I thought it was another pyramid or something like that. As an asset, I did not consider it at all, I heard news periodically every year or half a year, but also did not pay much attention. But, at the end of 2016, when the bitcoin course started to take off, it became interesting to me, what is crypto currency, blockade and what to do about it. While delving the course flew upward, but since usually in the financial markets adhered to conservative methods of trading decided not to invest, see what happens next. I bought the first crypto currency in the fall of 2017, it was Waves and Nem, and did not regret it. Deeper and deeper into the world of detachment and crypto-currencies, I began to understand that the future is behind it, but although this area is at the development stage, we will see many positive changes in the near future. These are new prospects and opportunities for different industries. In the case of crypto currency, a lot of advantages are the speed of operations, transactions are much cheaper, increase in purchasing power, attract investment, etc.  - Let's talk about ARCUS.CITY. What interested you in this project and why did you decide to become part of the ARCUS team? - We began to discuss the ARCUS project at the end of 2017. Leo suggested the idea of creating an application in augmented reality in which you can combine the process of playing and advertising. I really liked the idea, now a large number of companies are looking for opportunities to attract customers, are in constant search of new advertising channels. Having experience in start-ups, I immediately undertook to calculate the economic model and came to the conclusion that we have all the possibilities for a successful ICO. We analyzed the cost of advertising, impressions and clicks on all major advertising platforms. Analyzed the budgets of large, medium and small companies on advertising costs for their conversion and ROI. The main advantage of our project is that the advertiser can use not only the standard targeting offered by social networks or other sites, he can manage the behavior, choose at his discretion certain geolocation, conduct different events, post promotional codes, introduce any game processes and many other possibilities. Our project will be interesting to a wide range of advertisers and the cost from traditional advertising platforms will not differ much. In each project there are risks, we are trying to analyze everything to the smallest detail, so the main economic model is at the testing stage and the final version will be presented this summer. But already now we understand that the project has a huge potential, in our application we combine two rapidly developing markets, which every year will gain their potential, in addition, this is a new channel for advertising.  - Your project could pay off at the expense of advertisers, why do you conduct ICO? - Holding the ICO will allow us to collect the necessary amount for the implementation of the Arcus project, we want to provide a ready-made product for players and advertisers. ICO will expand our project beyond Russia, allow us to introduce more gaming processes into the application, for this we need to expand the staff. And yet, ICO is a great opportunity for investors to feel part of our project, to buy tokens at the lowest price, for only $ 0.01. But most importantly, holding ICO gives an opportunity to learn about the project to a large number of people and in itself is an excellent channel for promoting our application around the world!  - At the first ICO, you plan to raise $ 200,000, but to implement such a global project you need clearly larger amounts. Why this particular figure? What will investors spend on? - Yes, I agree that for our project we need an amount significantly exceeding $ 200,000. Now, according to statistics, many ICOs have only an idea and most of them either can not raise funds, or it turns out to be so-called ""scum"", and the trust of crypto-investors has significantly decreased to new projects. Therefore, we decided to hold fundraising in two stages. At the first stage we plan to create an alpha version and release it for testing, this will make sure to our investors that we are a serious company and do our work. To the main ICO we will already release a beta version and will be able to start selling to advertisers. What will $ 200,000 go to, of course, for technical support, for paying office, employees, advertising campaign, partially bounty campaign to the stage of the main ICO. These tools will significantly accelerate the creation of the application and, moreover, will show interest in our project, but in any case we will continue to implement the project, despite the results of the preliminary stage collection.  - Tell us about your achievements, both professional and personal. - My first startup was connected with agricultural machinery of a narrow direction for gardens and vineyards. I created a full-fledged representation of the Czech plant, it was possible to significantly increase brand recognition, customer loyalty and, correspondingly, increase sales times. I had to participate in various events, exhibitions and thematic conferences. We worked out various financial measures to stimulate sales, such as leasing, installments and so on. In 2015, my eye fell on the production of natural chocolate. The analysis of the market, its potential was carried out. At the end of 2015 we started production, natural, without chemistry, chocolate. They found suppliers of cocoa beans, oils. The product was tested, and focus groups were also conducted. For approval of the final recipe, as now I remember, it took 5 months, but we achieved an interesting result, and our products appealed to consumers. We carried out deliveries to specialized shops, to regional networks and constantly expanded the sale of products. The most important thing was feedback from our consumers, responsive to changes in trends and preferences. In general, I always liked to deal with financial projects, calculations, building business processes, economic models. In the financial world, I plunged into 2004, as a member of the bank. Got a lot of invaluable experience in banking. Also in 2004 he became interested in financial markets, the idea of the markets by that time was already there, but only theoretical. In 2009 he defended his diploma, the topic was connected with derivatives. In my free time I read a lot of literature from scientific articles on astronomy, quantum physics, and modern prose. I'm fond of psychology. In youth I was engaged in single combats - karate, aikido, now I also try to lead an active life.  - Thank you for your responses. We will watch your development. Maybe you want to say something to the readers at last? - Now the world is developing very quickly, especially related to crypto-currencies and blockbuster, a lot of interesting and not so many projects appear, and as I have already said a lot of ""scum"", so I recommend that you carefully study and analyze the projects when choosing. We, in turn, will be glad to receive feedback and answer any questions related to our project.  Ilgizar Rahmatullin is open for communication and will gladly answer your questions.

Has experience developing cross-platform applications. Crypto currency Oleg Rakhimov became interested in 2016, and when he first heard the idea of creating an application, ARCUS immediately joined the project. Today we interviewed Oleg Rakhimov.  - Good day Oleg. Tell me please, how are the successes with the launch of the application? - To begin with, the very development of the application began three months ago. During this time, I managed to create an MVP application, now it is in the testing phase and approval of the final design. Next, I plan to start developing a business logic server and, in parallel, continue to work on developing the application to bring everything to the alpha version.  - What is the most difficult for you in creating an application? - The first difficulty is that the Android is a multithreaded system and sometimes there can be conflicts when working with data that uses different threads. The second difficulty is geo-positioning. The sensors are known to be noisy and it is necessary to select the data filtering to obtain an acceptable result. But at the moment these stages have already been passed. There is a framework and there is no particular difficulty in creating an application, except for the lack of a good Android application tester in the team.  - You are a unique employee of ARCUS.CITY, but is it really enough for one serious programmer to launch such a serious project? - Of course, you can write everything to one, but the question arises: for what period of time will this be done? We plan to recruit a team of professionals. To speed up the process, we need a developer on the web frontend and a web backend developer. On business logic, at least one developer on Golang. Also we do not have an application for MacOS. One person is needed there. And the second, as I said, from the programmer is a bad application tester that he wrote. You can only tell the tester where there may be potential errors in testing, not more. Many times I was convinced by someone else and by my experience in this. Therefore, we need testers at least 2 people one on the second application on the web. After launching the alpha version, we will need people already for technical support - at least 4 people for a shift mode of operation. Many people can say: why so much on tech support? I will not be burning people at work. Work on technical support exhausts psychologically so that the employee should be given at least a day of rest after one day of work on technical support, in total, 2 brigades out of 2 people are obtained. You also need a system administrator on the server. As the project grows and new areas are covered, the number of specialists will increase.  - Tell us about your achievements, both professional and personal. - To begin with, I did not immediately come to the development of applications, I tried many professions, but eventually came to the conclusion that this is not mine. I was interested in computers since childhood. My father worked in the astronomical observatory and sometimes took me with him to work. There they calculated librations of the Moon and other things that were incomprehensible for me at that time on computers. The view of ""Nairi"" for me was then impressive. A car the size of a huge room with a bunch of colored lights with noise stuffing the results of calculations on paper fascinated. As a result, I came to programming, and I like doing it. Working in different spheres undoubtedly gave me a lot of experience in solving difficult problems. I have also always gotten used to getting started to the end. The ARCUS project inspires me now, I dedicate not only working days to it, but also weekends, but I'm sure it's worth it.  - Do you contribute your ideas to the project, or are you working ""according to the scenario""? - Ideas bring all the participants of the project. They are discussed and, or on their basis, an implementation strategy is developed, or they are rejected. ""The given script"" also exists - this is our Road map. Sometimes it is discussed, and it can be subject to various adjustments, but without it you can not survive in the cryptomir, it changes too quickly)))  - Thank you for your responses. We will watch your development. Maybe you want to say something to the readers at last? - I invite everyone to participate in the creation of our project together. This is also interesting - to make it possible to receive crypto currency directly on the street from the application on the phone. Let's try to do it together)  Oleg Rakhimov will be able to answer any technical question on the ARCUS project.

Today we will learn the difference between extended and virtual realities.  VR (virtual reality) is an artificially created 3D digital world that allows you to move a person anytime and anywhere. A person is immersed in a virtual environment, in helmets of virtual reality and using other special devices. This technology currently has the most powerful WOW-effect, is understandable and accessible to users. Important is the influence of the presence and sensation of immersion in another space, be it race, desert or anything that can embody the fantasy of a writer, designer and developer. Users feel the speed of the car, are afraid to fall from rocking and try to stroke the kitten in the same fictional world, perceiving it as real.  AR (augmented reality) is the technology of adding virtual information to the field of human perception, which is perceived as elements of real life. Thus, if in a virtual reality a person is in a completely digital environment that imitates the real world, then in the expanded reality the user remains in the surrounding space, but his experience is expanded by adding virtual components. You can interact with virtual objects as if they were near you. According to analysts, AR-market will surpass VR and will become one of the main technologies for three years.  The ARCUS application will use the Augmented Reality technology. Players will move around the city and, using smartphones, find virtual containers and open them. This technology allows you to be in the game in real time and directly interact with other participants. The ARCUS team is actively studying the technology of augmented reality to add additional game functions to the application. We think that this is very interesting.  And what do you think about the technology of augmented reality?",False

Yesterday we found out the differences between VR and AR technologies, and today we want to talk about the world of advertising.  Annually in the world on advertising is spent more than 600 billion dollars! Every day a person sees and hears about 1000-3000 advertisements, but pays attention only to units. How do advertisers express themselves and become visible? There are three main directions of promotion:  1. Internet promotion 2. Autonomous promotion 3. Non-standard advertising (partisan marketing)  Internet advertising is not a separate category. In today's world, it's hard to imagine a person without a smartphone in their hands. More than 35% of all advertising budgets are spent on the promotion of the Internet. By 2020, analysts predict the growth of this indicator to 50%.  No less attention deserves to be promoted offline. Advertising on media sources, outdoor advertising (billboards, poles, etc.), All newsletters that you receive are autonomous. This advertising positively affects the recognition of the brand but it often turns out that it is expensive and not very effective against the background of a general ""information noise"".  Non-standard advertising is developed individually for a particular product or service. It is created in many ways: an unusual place for advertising, a new advertising medium, an original way of transmitting information, etc. - everything that attracts the maximum number of people and causes the desire to interact with advertising, talk about it. Create your own advertising is not easy, so many marketers are constantly looking for new channels of communication with customers.  ARCUS - will help to cope with this problem! Players will themselves go to points of sale, search for virtual containers and receive the necessary information. The person receiving the bonus can immediately use it, which will increase the level of customer loyalty, as well as positively affect the traffic and conversion of advertisers.

The main idea is to place coins in containers containing some top-end crypto-currencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, Zcash and Waves). Players just need to find and take these coins! The whole process will take place in a game form. Containers are objects visible only with the help of a special application located on the streets of the city, in parks, squares, etc. The application will allow to find the container and open it. To do this, the application will run in two modes. The first mode is the Radar, which will inform about a nearby container within a certain radius of the player. The second mode is the Capture that allows to see the container and use Augmented Reality (AR) technology. Once the player finds the container and makes the capture, the coin in the container enters the internal wallet, after which it can be withdrawn to an external wallet or crypto exchange. https://arcus.city/images/scr1.png?crc=3900064661https://c.radikal.ru/c40/1803/3d/b0b2a893eacc.pnghttps://c.radikal.ru/c15/1803/b7/7cf441940e56.png  To implement the project, we have created an Arcus coin, which will also be used inside the system to buy game benefits, such as increasing the radar radius. In addition, the coin will be used by advertisers and project sponsors who will place their information in containers. The Arcus coin was released on the basis of the Waves blockchain. The project token sale is divided into two stages. The first stage is the creation of a beta version with game features, which will be available for testing in Russia, Japan, South Korea and in some countries of Europe. At this stage we plan to raise $200,000, which will significantly accelerate the implementation of our Arcus project. The funds will be distributed as follows: 1. Technical support. 2. Attraction of new employees and salaries to the staff. 3. Office expenses. 4. Advertising campaign. The implementation period of the first stage is 6–7 months, since we have already created the Prototype application and are now testing and fixing bugs. Project roadmap can be viewed on our website:www.arcus.city You can now buy the Arcus coin at the Waves DEX, the first 20,000,000 coins we sell at a price of $0.01 or equivalent in other cryptocurrency. 200,000,000 coins have been released. In the near future we plan to place the coin Arcus on several exchanges.  On our telegram-channel continues are testing the MVP version of the application! Anyone who owns the phone on Android can test the application. Subscribe to our channel: Telegram, download the MVP version and write your comments.

Advertisers pay money for displaying ads, users are willing to pay so that advertising is not. So why not pay users for viewing ads? Lev Eidinov  What is the point: we know how difficult it is to find a suitable advertising platform for attracting living people to points of sale. Our project is able to solve this problem for advertisers once and for all. Now people will see the advertisement, being directly next to the points of sales, which will significantly increase the conversion for our advertisers. What are the advantages for the players? Players will literally earn on viewing advertising. Players will use the application to search for virtual containers, view advertising and receive for this part of the top-level cryptographic currency. These funds they can transfer to their wallet and additionally dispose of them at their discretion. In addition, containers can contain bonuses and gifts from advertisers that players can also use.  Our mission is to create a unique advertising platform, interesting for both advertisers and users.  We set the following goals: 1. To create a team of like-minded people for constant development and expansion. 2. Develop an application in which advertisers can easily create their own virtual boxes (with the help of managers) with advertisements and bonuses. 3. To encourage users to get acquainted with promotional materials, rewarding them for it. 4. Create an interesting game environment for users and constantly develop in this direction (add joint missions, elements of augmented reality, etc.), 5. That any person could find a crypto currency and learn more about technology  Blockchain. 6. To unite two rapidly developing spheres: AR-technologies and crypto-currency. 7. Make the application accessible and easy to use for residents around the world.  To achieve these goals, we have developed a ""Road map"", which you can always read on our website!
