The ecosystem provides ability to cover failure of one project by success of other projects. So, failure will not make a critical financial damage to WeAre token holders. Also, this will happen because the token will still be needed for payments and making investments to other projects. - ACO is very handy for splitting funding on several rounds. - Informational and promotional support for projects.
