How can you benefit from that?  1. If you have a smartphone with any sports/health app on it, like Runkeeper, Endomondo or any other popular app, OR a wearable like Fitbit, you are producing a lot of valuable data: the kilometers you walk or run everyday, maybe you measure your heart rate, your sleeping rhythm, maybe you have a diet app and follow your diet.  2. This valuable data is now being stored with the provider of the app/wearable. They aggregate all this data, do big data analysis, use it after putting a layer of anonymity for interacting with other providers, use it for marketing etc.  3. What do you get from that? Nothing. Except that you can see yourself how many kilometers you just walked and share it on social media.  4. With Lympo you will be able to aggregate this data, get rewards for achieved healthy lifestyle goals (let's say a popular shoe producer makes a 5km running challenge for marketing purpose and offers some tokens in reward) and then also sell it and receive micropayments in LYM tokens.  5. Furthermore, companies that want to use your data and if you decide to sell it, can register your permission to access this data on blockchain. That helps them a lot in making sure that they are compliant with data protection regulations.  6. Now what can you do with these tokens? I. You can use them in the marketplace and get further products or services. II. You can invest them in the most promising health/sports/fitness startups on Lympo crowdfunding platform!",False

The other solution is developed by the former company of our advisor Dr. David Manset, Gnubila: https://www.fedehr.com/. Now, both FedEHR and HIPPA compliant AWS services are meant to be protecting electronic medical records. The information Lympo will be working with, the data from health and sports tracking apps, is not qualified to be as sensitive as medical health records, but we still prefer to use one of these solutions to make sure that in the future our users could store their medical records as well.  Our team is group of people who are hard working and want to reach the best results possible. It is not a new team gathered for this token sale only. Most of the team members have been working together for more than a year now to release www.lympo.lt, a platform to find the best personal trainer in Lithuania, currently expanding to California.

In comparison to many other blockchain for healthcare projects, Lympo does not aim to collect or store electronic medical records, because we believe that it is still too early and the technology needs to gain more trust from institutions and patients. However, we want to make sure that all of us who gather health/sports/wellness data on our phone apps or wearables, are rewarded for this valuable data we provide about ourselves.

More than 52% of smart phone users gather health-related information on their phone. In 2016 alone, mHealth app store downloads totalled 3.2 billion.  However, the users generating this data cannot aggregate, share and monetize it. Moreover, because it lacks the means to interconnect existing data, the industry cannot unlock its full potential for the benefit of all market players. The rise of mHealth applications has not yet delivered on the promise of digital technology empowering individuals and resulting in better health care and a more connected sports and wellness market. The Lympo ecosystem resolves this problem. Powered by user-generated and user-controlled fitness and wellness data, Lympo will allow the exchange of value through the introduction LYM utility tokens. Lympo‚Äôs goal is an ecosystem where data is used efficiently by all industry stakeholders and everyone is rewarded fairly. It consists of three pillars: the Lympo fitness wallet, a marketplace and the Lympo crowdfunding platform. The Lympo digital fitness wallet and user reward mechanism is at the core of the Lympo ecosystem. The wallet functions as an entry to the ecosystem and allows users to be rewarded in LYM tokens for their healthy lifestyle achievements. These tokens can be used to purchase goods and services in a marketplace starting from an existing Lympo platform uniting more than 500 fitness professionals and later expanding to a broad network of sports, wellness and health goods and services providers. Finally, LYM tokens will be used on the Lympo crowdfunding platform to invest in innovative data driven companies in the industry which will contribute to the growth of this new ecosystem.
