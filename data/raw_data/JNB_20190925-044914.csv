That telegram group is not for bounty, it's just to see the updates and the team news. It is only informative.  I also know about the link you gave, but I only asked about the bounty group that happened to this project. Everyone was excluded from the bounty group.  This is false. There has never been any Jinbi Telegram bounty group. Hi Sylon how can we receive our bounty now? we do KYC but there is no option there that we need to input our ETH address and status of KYC is still pending approval it seems our hard work and efforts was not paid off with this bounty campaign.  we are losing trust  in bounty campaign with this incident.  You only have to wait. If your KYC docs will be accepted, you will receive your bounties tokens (based on the fact you're not a cheater/fraudster).  Don't get me wrong but now i think getting information regarding bounty and the kyc issues will be more difficult, it was easy to reach out to the team on telegram but now it is not the case, what happens if our kyc happens to be rejected? Who to speak with to resolve such issues? My kyc over 1 week + is still showing pending.  What would you do if the Telegram group was still active ? You would complain but team would still reject your docs/ignore you. Stop acting like if that Telegram group was everything for Jinbi Token project.

After checking I can't find it in here.  Sylon quoted an answer from the team in the french thread  Quote from: Sylon on June 07, 2018, 08:00:04 PM Quote There are several malicious, anonymous blogs that are critical of Jinbi Token.  The reason why these blogs are anonymous is that they contain malicious falsehoods, claiming that Lars Steffensen is a convicted criminal, which is not the case.  If the author’s details were made public, they would themselves be pursued by lawyers, the police and the CPS in the UK.  Several blogs have been removed by Google in the UK but continue to be live in other territories. Joe Crawley used to work at eCommodities PLC where Lars Steffensen is an advisor.  The malicious blogs are the work of a disgruntled former investor of a hedge fund run by the Ebullio Group.  This business was successful for several years before it closed down, finally running at a loss.  This investor felt aggrieved and took their case to financial institutions, none of which could find the company or its directors at fault. Rather than move on – this incident occurred nine years ago – the malicious blogger has tried their best to destroy Lars and anyone associated with his past in any way.  The financial industry is highly regulated and of course, if these malicious allegations were true, Lars would be unable to work as he does in the UK.  Both Lars Steffensen and Joe Crawley have clean regulatory records and are regulated by both the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and the National Futures Association in the United States of America. Lars Steffensen has no involvement whatsoever with Jinbi Token.  Joe Crawley, the co-founder of Jinbi Token knows him, and Joe worked for eCommodities PLC but resigned the role in April 2018.  He also worked for Ebullio Group. It is very disappointing for Joe Crawley and the team at Jinbi Token to have to deal with these ridiculous allegations.  That said, to put it into context, the whole area of hedge funds is highly emotive and the industry is known for its strong personalities and mercurial changes in fortune experienced by its major players.  I'm not sure where this was published in the first place.  As for the rest of your comment Midguard, be so kind to do some fact checking",False

I understand where you are coming from. Nobody wants to work for free. The odds of that are greatly reduced with a project of this caliber. It is a good project and a great team. To get straight to the point: If the minimum subscription of $8mil is not raised the ICO is cancelled. Under those circumstances, as no money was taken, there is no bounty to pay. (If you find the thread wording outlining this confusing, that is unintentional).  It is important that you consider all possible outcomes. Yes…to be undersubscribed would suck. But have you considered what might happen if the offering is oversubscribed?  I think that would cause a Jinbi Token price pop to the upside post ICO which would be very gratifying.  Sometimes in life, things turn out far better than anyone dared hope! The fact is we don’t yet know for sure what will happen. However I am privy to initial metrics and I personally know some of the larger potential investors (Funds) that have made commitments. This makes me very confident that Jinbi are very much ahead of schedule and things are going very well for them (and therefore everybody involved in the bounty campaign.)  Crake  //// Actually: Sylon´s bounty post says ¨You will receive 3% of all JINBI tokens, based on your number of stakes¨, not 3% of raised funds or tokens. Thus, this means that JINBI will distribute 3% of the tokens to the bounty campaign participants (and this is not conditional on a minimum raise). This corrects what I wrote previously above. Apologies. ////",False

Hi guys. These are serious questions and deserve non pr answers.   I’ll try…   With respect to XAUR etc.   It is not my business to critique different individual approaches to collateralised crypto. And definitely not in public. There are various acceptable and creative approaches. (it is a bit like designing a derivative or an maybe an equity offering at a bank. Lots of ways work and depends a little on what you want to achieve.)   But here is root problem: How do collateralise something in a way that dampens downside volatility, yet keeps upside participation?   I don’t favor vanilla wrapping i.e. 1 unit crypto backed by 1 unit of something (say gold, but it could be copper or live hogs). This is legitimate: but it raises the question…why not just invest in the underying product? You would however dampen downside volatility if you took this derivative design approach. It is questionable that you would get any extra upside juice.   Actually: you need to figure out how to either add gold to a fixed amount of crypto or possibly subtract crypto from a fixed amount of gold on an ongoing basis. This can done in a regular way or in lumps based on some milestone (price etc.)   There are various shops trying to create crypto structures that work in this respect. And i think that various counterparties are prepared to invest considerable effort in this sector gives weight to the core idea. In fact, my own interest stems from the fact that I think huge chunks or both equity and derivative like instruments will migrate to crypto.   So. And the white paper says this clearly. Yes they have mining partners. So that physical gold stream gets added into the Jinbi Token. Essentially they are financing a certain amount of gold production. As more gold gets added you can rationally expect the token to maintain loaded upside exposure. Hence their token price predictions.    It all makes sense and I am happy to take PMs via telegram to dig hard into details. I just don’t want to go nuts here for general audience.   Thanks   Crake",False
