We wanted to have a fully working platform in order to offer a working product to the online business, e-commerce community. Also innovation is our passion so we build something never seen in crypto and buying / selling online. Then after we finish the platform we Founded the ICO OfferZone. And from there you can see in the road map how everything is coming along. We also purchase 140 bitcoin and litecoin mining machines which will launched on the Pre-sale opening date OCT 1, 2018 everyone can register for free on our OfferZone platform and bid on the 140 machines, you can win this machines by just Joining the ICO and bidding on them with your OFZ tokens.
