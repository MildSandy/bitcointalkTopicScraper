The tokens were not listed on July 1 as promised.   They sold securities.  This is fraud as I understand it.

The team advertised they have offices worldwide.  Should all of the offices go on vacation at the same time?   Does an ICO take 30M USD in investment and then go on vacation and not put a notice on its webpage?  Why did the team never respond to requests for their addresses worldwide?  Why did the team set up an in-appearance=only exchange site called tokenswap and claim they had no affiliation.  Those that sent tokens to the site were told they would get paid in several weeks.  Nobody on the Telegram group reported receiving a payment.   This site rarely works and it appears to be intemtionally non-functional as I reported the problem to them several times with no response.  Why did the team start selling a new token with the promise if you buy the token you would get work for which you would be paid?   No information about payment or work terms but you can buy more tokens.    The links from their homepage to telegram were removed at the same time the telegram groups were removed, so this not a glitch.  I looked up one of their advisors -- Allan Young of Richmond, CA.  Impressive credentials and on his webpage and you can, apparently, apply for him to be a free advisor for an ICO.  see it here http://www.techfuturesgroup.org/tech-futures-group-application/   This guy lists tokens he supports here http://www.techfuturesgroup.org/client-profiles/   notice you cannnot find KYC Legal listed.

KYC.LEGAL is holding an ICO in order to develop and implement a useful and urgently needed service for the market. There are currently no handy, simple and functioning client identification solutions on the market. We have a finished, operational application that can be downloaded and installed right now on iOS and Android. At the moment, only the first part of the project (self-verification) is up and running, but both are necessary for compliance with all KYC requirements. The second part (agent verification) will be launched in the near future. Our solution is focused exclusively on client identity verification. Our slogan is ""Quick and easy"". Making it quick and easy to receive KYC. Using our platform, user verification, from the installation of the application and registration in the system to the arrival of an agent, takes less than 30 minutes. This solution will be applicable to all kinds of different areas of business, and not only to creditors.  You can buy our tokens and become a token holder  Token KYC.LEGAL is a discount token that offers its holders numerous advantages. The main one is the opportunity to receive a 50% discount on the verification services provided by the platform for the purposes of KYC. Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region).   Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. ExampleBasic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue).Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price.",False

I'm probably putting some dumb questions below but I'm trying to understand how all this works. I've downloaded the app in my phone, verified my name and surname by taking a picture of a document and a picture of myself (I couldn't do the video recording because it kept timing out) A few questions on this: - Is this app a live or a POC? (i.e. is it running in the main ethereum network?) - According to the white paper (page 21), by the time I took the picture the data should have been stored in the blockchain, is there a way to check that in the blockchain? (for instance: getting the transaction id and checking in etherscan.io or in any test network if you are not using the main one)  Thanks",False

The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs.

KYC.LEGAL is holding an ICO in order to develop and implement a useful and urgently needed service for the market. There are currently no handy, simple and functioning client identification solutions on the market. We have a finished, operational application that can be downloaded and installed right now on iOS and Android. At the moment, only the first part of the project (self-verification) is up and running, but both are necessary for compliance with all KYC requirements. The second part (agent verification) will be launched in the near future. Our solution is focused exclusively on client identity verification. Our slogan is ""Quick and easy"". Making it quick and easy to receive KYC. Using our platform, user verification, from the installation of the application and registration in the system to the arrival of an agent, takes less than 30 minutes. This solution will be applicable to all kinds of different areas of business, and not only to creditors.  You can buy our tokens and become a token holder  Token KYC.LEGAL is a discount token that offers its holders numerous advantages. The main one is the opportunity to receive a 50% discount on the verification services provided by the platform for the purposes of KYC. Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region).   Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. ExampleBasic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue).Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price.",False

The following token concept has been developed. The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated.

When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he receives a discount and the tokenholder receives the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price.",False

The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange.",False

This is for those cases when the relevant service only requires users to independently put in their information, without any additional authentication, at the users' personal responsibility. The second part is when one of our agents goes to a convenient place of the user's choosing and confirms the information entered. Going forward, the KYC.legal checks this information against numerous databases, and the user receives the maximum level of verification and identification.  The initial information entered can be anything, even false information. However, when the order is processed we check the cardholder and the party who is paying the money. The card is issued by a bank, which performs some sort of check on its end. Potential agents also undergo a fairly in-depth verification process: utilities bills issued in their name and to their address, passport or other identification document, details of bank accounts that have been in existence for at least 45 days (this ensures another level of reliability, we do not want fly-by-night agents). We check those who will then check our clients. A document identification system will be used to check the documents submitted during user verification, and we also perform an AML check and use various other internal and external services that allow us to verify the provided documents. During the second stage of document verification, we use agents who must confirm that the person exists and that the documents indeed belong to him or her.

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs.

The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user.

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange.",False

The main one is the opportunity to receive a 50% discount on the verification services provided by the platform for the purposes of KYC. Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region).   Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue).

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange.",False

Going forward, the KYC.legal checks this information against numerous databases, and the user receives the maximum level of verification and identification.  The initial information entered can be anything, even false information. However, when the order is processed we check the cardholder and the party who is paying the money. The card is issued by a bank, which performs some sort of check on its end.

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange.",False

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange.",False

Our solution will help them to quickly and easily become verified users. We have created a product that makes it much easier to comply with client identification requirements. The product is made up of two parts: document verification through a mobile application, and verification of identity and documents with the help of a KYC.LEGAL agent.

The first part is independent self-verification. This is for those cases when the relevant service only requires users to independently put in their information, without any additional authentication, at the users' personal responsibility. The second part is when one of our agents goes to a convenient place of the user's choosing and confirms the information entered. Going forward, the KYC.legal checks this information against numerous databases, and the user receives the maximum level of verification and identification.  The initial information entered can be anything, even false information. However, when the order is processed we check the cardholder and the party who is paying the money. The card is issued by a bank, which performs some sort of check on its end. Potential agents also undergo a fairly in-depth verification process: utilities bills issued in their name and to their address, passport or other identification document, details of bank accounts that have been in existence for at least 45 days (this ensures another level of reliability, we do not want fly-by-night agents). We check those who will then check our clients. A document identification system will be used to check the documents submitted during user verification, and we also perform an AML check and use various other internal and external services that allow us to verify the provided documents. During the second stage of document verification, we use agents who must confirm that the person exists and that the documents indeed belong to him or her. It is similar to the example of receiving a credit card from a bank. The bank sends a courier who checks the recipient and his or her documents.",False

The main one is the opportunity to receive a 50% discount on the verification services provided by the platform for the purposes of KYC. Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region).   Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price.",False

The customers are the ones who initiate the KYC process. The services just lock the possible abilities of their customers until they pass the KYC. Take binance exchange for example. You can trade there without KYC, but you need to verify your account to withdraw more than 2 BTC in 24 hours. The Binance doesn't initiate KYC process. The customer sets up an application for KYC and the Binance exchange verifies him. This process sometimes takes weeks to finish. Here's where our solution comes in. With KYC.legal the verification process will take only near 30 minutes. The user sets up documents for verification and then calls the agent to come and verify him on the second stage. After that the process customer has passed the KYC. Also, in your situation, if swissborg ICO gets hacked somehow then all the data that they got from the users will on the loose, which is dangerous because it can lead to fraudulent use of customer's data. With our solution all original data is stored on the user's device, while only hash-data is sent to the services.",False

The concept of token is as follows: The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated.

The main one is the opportunity to receive a 50% discount on the verification services provided by the platform for the purposes of KYC. Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region).   Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue).

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated.

This link allow you to receive bonuses. You get 5% from your friends purchase. Let me explain how KYC.legal works. The project Token KYC.LEGAL is a utility token that offers its holders numerous advantages. The main one is the opportunity to receive a 50% discount on the verification services provided by the platform for the purposes of KYC. Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region).   Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price",False

Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he will receive a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he receives a discount and the tokenholder receives the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price.",False

The second part is when one of our agents goes to a convenient place of the user's choosing and confirms the information entered. Going forward, the KYC.legal checks this information against numerous databases, and the user receives the maximum level of verification and identification.  The initial information entered can be anything, even false information. However, when the order is processed we check the cardholder and the party who is paying the money. The card is issued by a bank, which performs some sort of check on its end. Potential agents also undergo a fairly in-depth verification process: utilities bills issued in their name and to their address, passport or other identification document, details of bank accounts that have been in existence for at least 45 days (this ensures another level of reliability, we do not want fly-by-night agents). We check those who will then check our clients. A document identification system will be used to check the documents submitted during user verification, and we also perform an AML check and use various other internal and external services that allow us to verify the provided documents. During the second stage of document verification, we use agents who must confirm that the person exists and that the documents indeed belong to him or her.

We check those who will then check our clients. A document identification system will be used to check the documents submitted during user verification, and we also perform an AML check and use various other internal and external services that allow us to verify the provided documents.

The product is made up of two parts: document verification through a mobile application, and verification of identity and documents with the help of a KYC.LEGAL agent. The entire process should take no more than 30 minutes, which is an all-time record on this market. We have a finished, functional application, which can already be downloaded and installed on both platforms android and ios.",False

Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region). Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl receive a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example: Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue). Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd (tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price.",False

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange.",False

Thank you for your question. Buy buying our tokens the person becomes a tokenholder. Tokenholder can divide the half of the verification between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he will receive a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he receives a discount and the tokenholder receives the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price.",False

KYC.LEGAL, a leading blockchain-based user verification platform, has agreed to bring its revolutionary KYC/AML compliant user verification capabilities to the project, ensuring enhanced security and increasing the confidence of professional stock exchange players in the solution. The new generation exchange will dovetail the best features of traditional exchanges with the advantages of a decentralized system, by including the institutional centralized infrastructure of traditional stock exchanges such as NASDAQ, NYSE, LSE as a node within a decentralized blockchain protocol. Qurrex is in the process of developing this secure, high-performance trading platform, which is currently available as a test version of the terminal.  As the cryptoeconomy continues to grow and develop, the issues of identity verification and KYC/AML compliance are coming to the forefront. As a leader in this area, KYC.LEGAL was the clear choice to lend its expertise to the new platform. KYC.LEGAL’s app, which offers two levels of user verification, is already up and running and available on Google Play and App Store. Its know-your-customer, anti-money laundering and fraud prevention solutions for the blockchain community will guarantee the safety and transparency of the new trading terminal.

The main one is the opportunity to receive a 50% discount on the verification services provided by the platform for the purposes of KYC. Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region).   Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue).

The project Token KYC.LEGAL is a discount token that offers its holders numerous advantages. The main one is the opportunity to receive a 50% discount on the verification services provided by the platform for the purposes of KYC. Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region).   Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price",False

The main one is the opportunity to receive a 50% discount on the verification services provided by the platform for the purposes of KYC. Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region).   Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price. A stack is a Personal Account where the tokenholder places his tokens and generates a unique link with a unique price.

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange.",False

Thank you for your question. Buy buying our tokens the person becomes a tokenholder. Tokenholder can divide the half of the verification between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he will receive a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he receives a discount and the tokenholder receives the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price.",False

Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again.

The main one is the opportunity to receive a 50% discount on the verification services provided by the platform for the purposes of KYC. . Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region).   Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price",False

Verification costs 10-50 USD (depends on region). Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he will receive a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he receives a discount and the tokenholder receives the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again.

The core of our team has been together for more than five years now, working on projects that cater to our already existing businesses and provide B2B (business to business) solutions: project management, goal setting, audit, etc. We have been watching blockchain closely since 2016, and have now joined forces with Nick Evdokimov and decided to hold our own ICO.

When you buy a token you become a tokenholder. Our token allows tokenholders to gain a profit by leasing the tokens to potential clients, which means that tokenholder is granted a monetary gain.

That's why the main costs are located in marketing. More potential clients in need of verification mean that there are more ways for tokenholders to make use of their tokens.

Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he will receive a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he receives a discount and the tokenholder receives the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price. The token is blocked for 1 month after it is called by the agent and then you can use it again. Example Basic price 10usd=5usd (agent cost) + 5usd (kyc.legal revenue) Special tokenholder price 7.5usd=5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd(tokenholder revenue). Tokenholder can choose his revenue in stack from 1usd up to full agents price.  Almost anyone who is willing to go and confirm someone's identity and verify his or her documents for $5-25 can become an agent.

The core of our team has been together for more than five years now, working on projects that cater to our already existing businesses and provide B2B (business to business) solutions: project management, goal setting, audit, etc. We have been watching blockchain closely since 2016, and have now joined forces with Nick Evdokimov and decided to hold our own ICO. The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange. We also raised 8 millions already. Join us.",False

Thank you for your question. The following token concept has been developed. The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs.",False

The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user.

In the USA this concept is called Know Your Customer, or KYC, just as you said before. Our product allows the identity of users to be established and documented, so that going forward they can register for any services that require such verification by providing only that information which is required for each individual service. Our solution will help them to quickly and easily become verified users. We have created a product that makes it much easier to comply with client identification requirements. The product is made up of two parts: document verification through a mobile application, and verification of identity and documents with the help of a KYC.LEGAL agent. The entire process should take no more than 45 minutes, which is an all-time record on this market.

Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price.

For example, it is incredibly difficult, nearly impossible in fact, to open a bank account or receive a prescription for a rare medicine without proper proof of identity. In the USA this concept is called Know Your Customer, or KYC. Our product allows the identity of users to be established and documented, so that going forward they can register for any services that require such verification by providing only that information which is required for each individual service. Our solution will help them to quickly and easily become verified users. We have created a product that makes it much easier to comply with client identification requirements. The product is made up of two parts: document verification through a mobile application, and verification of identity and documents with the help of a KYC.LEGAL agent. The entire process should take no more than 45 minutes, which is an all-time record on this market. We have a finished, functional application, which can already be downloaded and installed on both iOS and Android",False

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange.",False

Advantages of decentralization are clear: 1. High adaptive abilities (structural flexibility).  In a decentralized system there is no clearly expressed ""most important"" link (subsystem) and main links. In other words, there is no ""unquestioned credibility"" or a key element. Therefore, each subsystem accepts how to change its connections independently. Hence the system as a whole can relatively easily change its structure depending on the situation and its own criteria of correctness of behavior.  2. Relatively high operational reliability.

For example, it is incredibly difficult, nearly impossible in fact, to open a bank account or receive a prescription for a rare medicine without proper proof of identity. In the USA this concept is called Know Your Customer, or KYC. Our product allows the identity of users to be established and documented, so that going forward they can register for any services that require such verification by providing only that information which is required for each individual service. Our solution will help them to quickly and easily become verified users. We have created a product that makes it much easier to comply with client identification requirements. The product is made up of two parts: document verification through a mobile application, and verification of identity and documents with the help of a KYC.LEGAL agent. The entire process should take no more than 45 minutes, which is an all-time record on this market. We have a finished, functional application, which can already be downloaded and installed on both iOS and Android",False

Tokenholder can divide the half of it between him and a new user, who needs a verification. He should transfer tokens into stack on his backoffice. After that he willl recieve a refferal link. Tokenholder can place it in some internet resources (website, social networks etc). When user (who needs a verification) follows this refferal link and pays for a verification ($10-50), he recieves a discount and the tokenholder recieves the rest part of the half of verification price. The tokenholder should decide (and fix it in his stack) in what proportion the half of the verification price will be divided between him and the user. The stack is a personal cabinet into which the tokenholder placed his tokens and generates a unique link with its unique price at which customers can get a special price different from the base price.

When there is an ICO, token holders act as “investors”, although a large part of them may become agents once the product is built. Initially, however, people buy tokens because they believe a project has a good chance of success and value appreciation. Once the product is built and has some users, we can determine token value with more certainty by analyzing fundamentals, such as the exchange of tokens by users to acquire a particular utility. A tendency toward equilibrium is set when investors realize that a token’s use as a store of value is not properly associated with its utility function, and the price adapts.

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange.",False

Sale of the company’s solution by means of distribution of tokens is also regulated by relevant regulation in every country but the securities regulation will not apply. The very same goes for a resale of the solution tokens. For example, in the US the SEC does not limit the resale of concert tickets on StubHub or other secondary marketplaces, even when the tickets are at first obtained by some buyers to be resold there at the inflated selling prices. Tokens are no diverse and really do not will need new legislation or restrictions they just will need to be identified and bundled into the legal process of any offered country.

The KYC.LEGAL token is a utility token which offers its holders numerous advantages. The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated. Therefore, to be able to regularly use the platform's services and lease the tokens, token holders will have to purchase enough tokens to satisfy their needs. Plans for the future also include the possibility of withdrawing tokens from the system and selling them on an exchange.  The token is designed in such a way that the tokenholder will not be profitable to sell it in the future. It is much more profitable to make money on it regularly. (giving a discount to new customers). Considering the above, the token will have high liquidity.",False

We check those who will then check our clients.

Many countries and industries have specific rules on client relations. For example, it is incredibly difficult, nearly impossible in fact, to open a bank account or receive a prescription for a rare medicine without proper proof of identity. In the USA this concept is called Know Your Customer, or KYC. Our product allows the identity of users to be established and documented, so that going forward they can register for any services that require such verification by providing only that information which is required for each individual service. Our solution will help them to quickly and easily become verified users. We have created a product that makes it much easier to comply with client identification requirements. The product is made up of two parts: document verification through a mobile application, and verification of identity and documents with the help of a KYC.LEGAL agent. The entire process should take no more than 30 minutes, which is an all-time record on this market. We have a finished, functional application, which can already be downloaded and installed on both iOS and Android  Also, soon will be prepare whitepaper. News about this will be on all our information resorses. And right now we have short info in onepager and FAQ on KYC.legal website.  And we already develop a product, and after this we came here for ICO - because we are very carefully approaching our every step. It is because at THIS STAGE is not so much information.",False

How it’s look like? The tokenholder has the ability to influence the final cost of services - he can choose how much he wants to earn on the provision of the token and what discount he is willing to provide to the client  The cost is divided into 2 components: 1) remuneration of the agent - 50% of the base cost of verification 2) the part determined by the token holder, which selects the size of the desired reward. This can be as much as 50% of the base cost, and a smaller percentage if the token holder is willing to provide a discount to the client. In this case, the token holder will receive a reward, the size of which he chooses in his personal account, which we call the stack. What is a stack? A stack is simply the personal cabinet of the tokenholder on the platform into which it puts its tokens and in which a unique link is generated with a special price set by it, at which customers can get services cheaper than the base price.  Special tokenholder price 7.5usd = 5usd (agent cost) + 2,5usd (tokenholder revenue) * Tokenholder can choose a price from 1usd up to full agents price  Addition to the tokenholder  Tokenholder gets the opportunity to earn a large salary so that he helps the service attract new customers by placing their link and receiving revenue from each verification by its link Provided that he has tokens in his stack.",False

The first part is independent self-verification. This is for those cases when the relevant service only requires users to independently put in their information, without any additional authentication, at the users' personal responsibility. The second part is when one of our agents goes to a convenient place of the user's choosing and confirms the information entered. Going forward, the KYC.legal checks this information against numerous databases, and the user receives the maximum level of verification and identification.  The initial information entered can be anything, even false information. However, when the order is processed we check the cardholder and the party who is paying the money. The card is issued by a bank, which performs some sort of check on its end. Potential agents also undergo a fairly in-depth verification process: utilities bills issued in their name and to their address, passport or other identification document, details of bank accounts that have been in existence for at least 45 days (this ensures another level of reliability, we do not want fly-by-night agents). We check those who will then check our clients. A document identification system will be used to check the documents submitted during user verification, and we also perform an AML check and use various other internal and external services that allow us to verify the provided documents. During the second stage of document verification, we use agents who must confirm that the person exists and that the documents indeed belong to him or her. It is similar to the example of receiving a credit card from a bank. The bank sends a courier who checks the recipient and his or her documents.

The main advantage is the possibility of getting a 50% discount on the KYC verification services offered by the platform. This discount is not available to people without tokens. To receive the discount, they will need to lease the project tokens from token holders. In this case, the 50% discount is split equally between the lessee and the token holder, i.e. each receives a 25% discount on the full cost of the services. Therefore, along with the opportunity to take advantage of a 50% discount on services, token holders can also receive an economic benefit from the lease of tokens. After a single use, the tokens will be temporarily deactivated.
