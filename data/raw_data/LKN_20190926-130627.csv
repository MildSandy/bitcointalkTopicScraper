It's just there!   TELEGRAM | FACEBOOK | YOUTUBE | TWITTER Our ICO is successfully finished, thanks for your support! We will release LinkCoinToken (LKN) gradually until 24th April, and list on Bibox.com at the end of April.  >>> Click here to enter our Exchange Website. <<<  >>> Read Whitepaper <<<  When you are buying Bitcoin from current sites, you actually pay 5-10% more than the real price. LinkCoin is like Kijiji in Canada, and we believe that people should have the right to set their own price, if there are too many buyers, you can sell at high price; if there are fewer buyers, probably no one would take your contract if your price is less competitive. ------ it all depends on the market.   >>> Click here to enter our website.<<<  But that's not the fun part of LinkCoin. Since our platform is an over-the-counter platform, which means no cash flow through us, you can pay by cash or wire, or even trade with your car or entity-.- We don't know how you pay and we don't care, we only make sure you get the coins once the transaction is done. How LinkCoin works  In this way, users can trade BTC, ETH, and any other Altcoins. And we ensure the coins will 100% arrive at buyers wallet if the buyer and seller made a transaction.  Credit System Based on Ethereum When the platform needs to know a transaction, it will directly read from ETH network, So that LinkCoin only store insensitive info to determine the credibility of the trading counterparties.  The First OTC Platform for Altcoins     Currently, OTC platforms only provide trading on mainstream cryptocurrencies, such as BTC/ETH/BCH/LTC. LinkCoin will provide more selections for users, adding ERC 20 tokens and forked cryptocurrencies gradually. Altcoins often suffer from low liquidity on exchanges, though OTC users can bulk buy or sell, which can lock the price for trading. There would be two ways of applying new Altcoin.  (A) Applied by Altcoin holder. LinkCoin expert will evaluate the new coin, and approve the initial transaction if passed the examination. LinkCoin would reward the applicant and open the trade to all user.  (B) LinkCoin will release a list of Altcoin each month, all users can vote for their favorite choice, the top Altcoins would automatically join the platform.

Because you can't find another OTC exchange that has our volume, users and multi-end support. If you can, just name it, we will try to improve ourselves.  No doubt we can't compete with centralized exchange like Coinbase, Binance. But since we are OTC exchange, which is naturally friendly with newly released tokens,  we are sure to grow steady and solid.",False
