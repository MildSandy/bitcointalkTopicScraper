FintechCoin (abbreviated as FINC) is a utility token used as payment and fuel for services of the FintechFans Decentralized Marketplace, which is a decentralized contractors platform.  On this blockchain-based platform, job seekers, freelancers, and companies are in direct contact. Because there are no recruiters involved, contact and communication between parties are direct and clear.  The finalization and settling of performed tasks is done inside this Smart Contract, and therefore the results are publicly visible. By giving out a bit of FINC to the involved parties in an advertisement when feedback is given, the Marketplace will show very accurate information about a personâ€™s or companyâ€™s work history.  The reason the FintechCoin is introduced is to insulate the fees of the platform from the price fluctuations of the support layer cryptocurrency, Ether.  FintechCoin is primarily used when creating an advertisement on the Decentralized Marketplace. Creating an advertisement costs a fixed fee. 50% of this fee will be burned, which strengthens the community as a whole. The other 50% are locked in the contract until the advertisement process is successfully completed: When this occurs, both the company and the job seeker can place a review on each-other, and they receive half of the locked fees (So 25% of the advertisement creation fee), which they themselves can use later on to create new advertisements or trade with other parties of the FinTech community.  To make the Decentralized Marketplace accessible to people who have no experience (yet) with interacting with a smart contract directly, a web portal that wraps the marketplace will also be built.  FintechFans will also build a centralized Job Board that is more suitable to use for long-term job positions. Payment for services on this Job Board will also be done using FintechCoin.  FintechCoin is an ERC20-compatible token built as a Smart Contract on top of the Ethereum Blockchain.
