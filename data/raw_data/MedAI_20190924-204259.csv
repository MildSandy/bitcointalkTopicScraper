The founding team has backgrounds building medical imaging provider companies, teleradiology, medical image networking, PACS and AI companies.   MedNetwork currently has an alpha release developed using IPFS for distributed medical image storage and an Ethereum-based Dapp for telemedicine with integrated AI diagnostics. We are happy to provide any user with an account for this private alpha release. Based on our product roadmap, we expect to launch the public beta release by the end of March 2018. This app demonstrates the integration of the teleradiology platform with AI diagnostics overlayed on the storage solution.   The core driving principle behind the MedNetwork is that technology and geography should no longer be a barrier to providing patients the optimal care. With the explosive growth and dependence on medical imaging for quantitative level diagnosis across the medical spectrum, we believe that physicians + AI + Dapps offers an opportunity to provide affordable telediagnostics and care to patients globally.

We are committed to being impeccable stewards of capital raised and to ensure that the funds are used optimally and efficiently with no waste. Each dollar raised has been earmarked for a particular need. This fundraise provides the absolute minimum required to get to our 1 year milestones and continue to develop out the platform. The remainder of the funds between the soft cap and the hard cap allows the company to scale larger faster as well as more efficiently. It allows us to deploy and develop more AI algorithms at a faster pace and provide them out to the network. It provides a longer runway and ability to fund the company over time without needing to distract the core team from more fundraising in the current pipeline and roadmap. We have outlined a detailed use of funds below.
