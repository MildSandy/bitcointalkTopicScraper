This is an important aspect which seems to be misinterpreted by many - that paying with Credit Card/FIAT does NOT circumvent NRVE, but even the opposite: It gets more ppl into it.  Credit Card Payments  In mid-July, we rolled out a credit card option to pay for niches. One of the reasons we did this is, to become an inclusive and large content community, we need to appeal to the 95+ percent of people who don’t yet use crypto. The way it works is when people pay for niches via the credit card option, they are simply paying to have the system purchase the required NRVE on their behalf. There is a convenience fee to cover the exchange rate risk and processing fees. Once acquired, the NRVE payment (minus the convenience fee) goes directly into the Rewards Pool. As of August 30, we’ve collected more than 900,000 NRVE from the purchase of niches. Three quarters of the payments were made in NRVE. Roughly one quarter of the purchases were made via a credit card. (Some of which are still in process of being added to the Rewards Pool.)",False

The white paper was created months ago; if you see any specific errors in the comparison chart, please let me know and we will correct as necessary.

One lynchpin of our strategy is that we will offer a simple way to get your rewards out in regular money rather than NRVE tokens.

Yes, it is the day companies need to be in compliance with the the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements. GDPR includes provisions requiring companies to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens for transactions that occur within EU member states. It also regulates the exportation of personal data outside the EU.  Like a lot of companies, Narrative Company (Narrative) carefully reviewed the requirements to determine if we, a US based company, were subject to the GDPR requirements. According to guidance, any company that stores or processes personal information about EU citizens within EU states must comply with the GDPR. As you might guess, there are a lot of interpretations to the guidance and how far it extends.  Some argue (the minority) that unless your company resides in an EU country, GDPR does not apply. Others have stated that you don’t have to be an EU company, but if you purposely market to the EU, you are subject. Still others have interpreted that if there is no company presence in the EU, but you process personal data of European residents, then GDPR applies.  Regardless of these various interpretations, at Narrative, privacy is a key tenet of our operating principles. The goal of Narrative is to give users control over their content by not allowing anyone (not even moderators) to edit their content in any way and by allowing users to remove their content from the network at any time. This extends to the information/content we collect from and about our community members — no matter where they reside around the globe. Narrative is adopting GDPR and will be fully compliant. We are committed to improving individual rights and understand our data responsibilities.  What does this mean for our Alpha Release — Chaucer? Effective tomorrow, May 24, 2018, the following changes will be implemented:  -No longer collecting IP addresses for users -Completely deleting user data when accounts are deleted -Allow users to revoke agreement to the terms of service -Allow members to download profile data -Point-of-collection descriptions for profile fields  GDPR privacy compliance will be embedded as we work on the beta release of the Narrative platform scheduled for Q4 2018. We’ll only collect necessary data, won’t sell the limited information we collect and let users control their own data. Privacy matters. https://blog.narrative.network/gdpr-privacys-day-of-reckoning-5d40e98554ea",False

One of the major points was that we will be distributing Native (NTV) tokens to our Narrative Token Sale contributors via an airdrop.  Here’s how that NTV distribution process will work:  As stated before, only those people that contributed to the Narrative Token Sale will be eligible for this NTV airdrop.  The number of NTV tokens you receive will be based on the total number of Narrative (NRVE) tokens you purchased in the Narrative Token Sale. For every 1 NRVE token you purchased, you will be eligible to receive 0.6 NTV tokens. Thus, if you purchased 300 NRVE tokens, you would be eligible for 180 NTV tokens.  The date of the NTV airdrop has NOT been set yet. We anticipate it happening sometime in the next six months, but further details will be provided later.  Assuming you are eligible (because you contributed through a registered/approved Narrative Token Sale account), you will receive your NTV tokens by authorizing the airdrop to your registered account via a mechanism we will make available to you at least one month prior to the airdrop. (If you fail to authorize the distribution, you will not receive the NTV tokens). We will contact all Narrative Token Sale contributors via their registered email addresses once this authorization mechanism is available. And it will require that you sign into your Narrative Token Sale account, so be sure to maintain your registered token sale email address in the meantime.  To summarize, only Narrative Token Sale contributors are eligible for this NTV airdrop. It is important to us that we only distribute these NTV tokens to our registered/approved accounts (that have already passed KYC/AML checks). And if you are a token sale contributor you will need to authorize the distribution of the NTV tokens to your account prior to the airdrop occurring. If you fail to authorize the distribution, you will not receive any airdrop tokens. We will provide at least one month for these authorizations to be made (prior to the airdrop). The authorization process will be quite simple.  https://blog.narrative.network/the-native-airdrop-process-6c7e20729889",False

I know there is very little time left before the sale, but I'd really appreciate it if you were able to reply in time!    Think of me as a Fox Mulder 'wanting to believe', but needing to be skeptical.  I also know a number of individuals who right alongside me have wished for something like Narrative to come along for the past fifteen years - I want to contact them and make sure they are on board - they are upstanding individuals with great contributions to make - but these questions are holding me back.  First question It is highly speculative for people to bid on niches with zero metrics or past performance of the Narrative network to go on, to ascribe reasonable value. The platform is not operational yet, but the community is being asked to bid against each other over its real estate.  I am not adverse to speculation per se, but we have to be sensitive to the degree of speculation here.  We all want cryptocurrency and blockchain to thrive.  Before true mass adoption can take place, the negative stigma of excessive speculation needs to be overcome.  The NEO founder has nodded towards this reality and I applaud him for it. So my question is, isn't it multiplying the speculative nature of your platform to do an ICO with no MVP (minimum viable product), and then ask the community to give back many of the speculative tokens they just bought from you, in a second round of speculation, still with no MVP, and with no concrete notion of the returns the niches will generate? I'm sure it was considered during development meetings, that initial niches could simply be reserved for a nominal fee, on a first come first served basis, and I'm wondering why this option did not get chosen.  Second question Also concerning niche 'ownership' - it would be more accurate to call it niche leasing.  Is it fair to tell people they will own a niche after paying the highest bid for it (potentially a large sum of money), when in fact they have to pay annual fees in order to keep it, and if they don't, the Narrative organisation gets to auction it again to the highest bidder?   This concerns me on a number of levels.    First, the so-called owner of the niche pays an upfront, auction-determined purchase price for what is actually a lease.    Then the so-called owner puts effort into developing the niche, finding the best moderators, attracting the best content.  They add value to their 'property' which should be on-sellable should they choose to cease to 'own' it.  You buy a house, improve upon it: you expect to be able to profit from those improvements - nothing complicated here.  But with Narrative, the 'owner' loses any value they have added to the niche if they decide to no longer own it, because they can't sell it, from what I have gathered from your white paper.  It sounds like the true owner, the Narrative organisation, gets to have its cake and eat it too: it 'sells' niches to the community, and leases it to them at the same time, while keeping ownership of the niches, and the possibility of selling the niches over and over again via auction.    So the question is - what am I missing here? I want this to be a misunderstanding because I really want to have confidence that the Narrative Content Economy is being set up with a fair, optimally decentralised ethos.  This aspect clashes with the ethical ideal of a decentralised economy, and also seems to be being described in misleading terms (ownership instead of leasing).  Third question There is mention that niches may need to go through a second approval process long after niche reservations, when the platform actually launches.  How will this be managed, after the community has bid upon and secured potentially expensive niches?  By then, many will have done leg work contacting and screening potential moderators, researching methods of attracting quality content etc...    Fourth question Would you be willing to consider the following option, and report back publicly on your decision and the reasoning behind it?  - Initial niches are reserved for a nominal fee, on a first come, first served basis, with the person who suggested the niche naturally getting 'first dibs' (or first right of refusal).  - The person who purchases the niche becomes its real owner, not a leasee.  She can still pay an annual 'platform' fee, but if she fails to pay, or if she chooses to sell the niche, the niche is auctioned to the community and the proceeds are paid to her, not to the Narrative organisation. In this scenario, such auctions would only be allowed to occur well after the platform is launched, so that bids on such niches would no longer be anywhere near as speculative.  Conclusion This is your project - you have worked hard to bring it to the point it has reached, and the community is watching on with the hope that you - indeed we - succeed in creating a fair, truly decentralised content economy.  I hope you will take these observations and questions in the spirit of constructive criticism, and see them as an opportunity to embody the ideals of fairness and transparency you have spoken of and enthused us with.

Regarding Q1:  We actually feel the system we are going with is the fairest possible way to do things.  If we only charged a fixed fee, then potentially valuable ""real estate"" would be locked up by users for essentially pennies on the dollar.  This way, if more than one person wants a particular niche, they can compete for it fairly, using a market-driven approach. It's true that no one (not even us) knows the true value of these niches prior to the launch of the complete platform and that's why this approach is fair.  A user should only bid what they think is fair value.  In addition, keep in mind that ultimately it is the community that benefits because all revenue from the niche ownership fees goes into network rewards, to be returned to network participants.  Finally, because we are limiting the number of niches that any one user can own or bid on at any time, we expect that to reduce the amount of wild speculation. If I already own 3 niches, I can only have active bids on two niches, since there is a limit of 5 niches per user (owned or bidding on).  Thus, I would argue that the bidding system we have enacted is completely fair and ultimately beneficial for the network as a whole. If one person thinks a niche is worth $1,000 (in tokens), as opposed to the base rate of $75 (in tokens), for example, that entire fee goes into the community pot for redistribution, leading to more revenue for all participants.   Regarding Q2:  We call it ownership because you essentially earn royalties based on the content contained in your niche.  It's kind of like home ownership with a recurring mortgage payment, I suppose.   We like the term ""owner"" because of the obvious benefits you receive, whereas a lease does not usually convey such benefits.  You said that the ""Narrative Organization"" gets to auction off non renewed niches, but that is a misstatement. The organization has no role in this process.  And the revenue collected from the niches- for new niches and for renewals- goes into the Network Rewards pool, which is distributed to all network participants, like all network revenue is.  Regarding Q3:  It is still TBD as to whether or how a re-approval process might work, but obviously if the community later rejects a previously approved niche prior to launch, the niche fee would be returned to the owner.  It is likely that very little work would have been put in by the owner, since this would presumably happen before the launch of the network. But again, this is not even something that has not been decided yet; we simply mentioned it as something that is still under consideration. Also keep in mind that the community can revoke any niche, even after approval through an appeal system... in fact, if we do not require a re-approval on the early niches, then we will likely just rely on that mechanism.  We also do not expect a high rate of rejected niches in either case.  Regarding Q4:  We like the model we have in place, for the reasons I gave above. I don't see that changing for Chaucer. We will always consider feedback during the alpha period, of course... and ultimately the Narrative Committee that will be put into place (comprised of community members and narrative staff) will have the power to make structural changes to the way things work, if it is deemed necessary.  I also want to reiterate again, since you have mentioned it here too... these fees are NOT PAID TO THE NARRATIVE ORGANIZATION. They are paid to NETWORK REWARDS and distributed to everyone who qualifies based on the network rewards payout formula.  The organization receives only 15% of that revenue, while 85% is returned to the network users.  Thanks for the feedback... I hope it helped. And please feel free to keep that feedback coming!",False

So this goes a long way towards addressing the more serious concerns I had, which is great.  I apologise for not realising the niche fees would become part of the revenue stream that gets distributed to the community - perhaps that was not entirely clear in the white paper or perhaps I missed it.  And yes, it stands to reason that the limit on how many niches people bid on might limit speculation.  I still find the 'owner' term very misleading: it is not like home ownership with a recurring mortgage payment.  Niches do not allow for capital gains.  Home ownership, even with mortgage payments, allows for capital gains through both appreciation and adding improvements to the home - this is central to one of my concerns and I'll elaborate further on it here.  The ability for the owner to auction their own niches and potentially make capital gains from those sales seems to have far greater advantages than downsides (from my admittedly limited perspective since I do not know the full scope of your algorithms).    On the downside, the pre-owned niches that get auctioned every year might add a few pennies in everyone's pocket if the proceeds are distributed to the community, and each member would lose these pennies via my suggested route.  I'd be surprised if anyone noticed much of a difference though?  On the plus side, the added incentive for owners to grow and maintain the niches at peak activity seems far more valuable as this goes to the core of the lifeblood of the content economy and could potentially make a noticeable difference to everyone's bottom line?  I'll outline to you what my thoughts might be as a niche owner who after three years decides he might want a change of lifestyle, and after four years, gives up his niches.  Phase 1: I set out to develop some great niches.  Phase 2: A couple of years in, after the initial spurt of effort has passed and I am still devoting energy to the niches but perhaps a little less than at the beginning, it occurs to me that if I ever decide to stop owning the niches, none of the hard work behind me, or going forward, will reward me when the niches change hands.  Psychologically, this creates a diffuse demoralising effect that would reduce my appetite for pouring quite so much effort into them.  Every time the impulse to approach folks for new content arises, that thought will be somewhere in the back of my mind and will have an inhibiting effect.  How strong an effect?  Maybe 10-20%, maybe less, maybe much more, depending on my temperament.   Also this effect might kick in much sooner than after 2 years - again, depending on the individual.  Phase 3: Three years or so have passed.  I've decided the time is approaching for a change of lifestyle.  Maybe I want to head for the hills, grow vegetables, and spend less time in front of screens.  Or maybe I've found another activity that requires 110% of my energy to get off the ground, like a great startup with lots of potential, or volunteer work that is profoundly meaningful to me in a way nothing else has been before.  It is going to take perhaps a year of preparation to enact these lifestyle changes or shifts in activity, and during that year, I have to multitask between work, maybe selling a home and buying a different property, shifting all other aspects of my personal economy, slaving towards the startup if that's what the new intended activity is etc...  In that crowded timetable, the time devoted to adding value to my niches comes under much closer scrutiny. I ask myself: if I put in a lot of effort to my niches in this final year of ownership, how will it benefit me?  The niche revenue will increase, but all benefit ceases when I stop ownership, so it only represents a short term and probably small to moderate spike in income.  By contrast, whether it is a startup or moving to the hills that I'm heading towards, my efforts today will reverberate into greater gains or lifestyle improvements in the future.  If its passionate volunteer work I'm moving towards, then the moderate financial reward from bigger efforts on the niches that year probably don't feature strongly in the equation.  So in all three cases, no real contest.  Also at this stage, with the prospect of no longer owning the niches far more prominent than the passing thought in Phase 2, the thought of the unfairness of 3 years of value-adding resulting in zero capital gain at the end of the run - will be much more demoralizing.  Before it was theoretical as I still intended to keep the niches.  Now it is becoming a certainty, and I'm thinking: if this were a house or a business I had bought, I'd be seeing healthy capital gains from my value-adding, as well as potential appreciation on my initial investment.  Combined with my now constricted schedule, how much would these effects depress my efforts towards the niches?  40-70 percent?  For some, maybe less.  For others - I wouldn't be surprised if they stopped all efforts at that stage.  Phase 4: The niches then spend perhaps a year in relative neglect and perform less, and when they are sold by the platform, not only do they command less of an auction price for the community (than the motivated owner would have received if the bigger proceeds went to him), but it will require some weeks or months for the new owner to hopefully bring the niches back into full swing.  The alternative: The alternative to this scenario, is a niche owner who remains motivated to the very end to have his niches operating optimally.  In fact knowing a niche will be auctioned for their benefit would not only provide the natural care-taking impulses true ownership conveys throughout the period of ownership: it would also arguably cause efforts to increase further in the run-up towards a sale in many cases, so that the niches have the best metrics and command the best sale price.  On the buyer side of the equation, niche ownership is more attractive for this reason also: do I want to bid more on something that will bring me capital gains as well as regular income, or on something that brings me only regular income?  On the community side of the equation, all these niches whose owners start to contemplate a change, instead of seeing a slump in activity, could see a boost.  What is the gap between the slump of the current plan for when niches enter a phase when they will soon change hands, and the boost of what I am proposing?  Difficult to say, but if we imagine a 50% decrease in efforts in the demotivated soon-to-be ex owner, a 20% boost in that owners efforts if they are seeking to maximise capital gains, and a 10% boost to niche buying enthusiasm (which should translate into higher quality ownership), we could be looking at benefits to the niches owner-initiated activities of around 80% during that period.  Perhaps my numbers are way off, but I think they do make the point that the effect would be tangible on the actual quality of Narrative's content, and to me that is far more important than community revenues being augmented by a few cents per member, or even a few dollars.  If you want to look for analogous situations in other industries, you might find some worthy thoughts. For instance, car services that must choose between providing the cars to their drivers, or having drivers maintain their own fully-owned cars. Owner/operators take inherently better care of their vehicles and in so doing drive more carefully, providing a better maintained vehicle to the customer, and a smoother ride.  The company that supplies the vehicles and keeps ownership of them ends up with large maintenance bills, a lower customer experience, and cars that are inherently less valued when it comes time to sell them to renew the fleet.  Last of all, if for some reason it is desirable for the community to receive revenue from an owner's niches changing hands, and I'm simply not in a position to appreciate that reason, I'd imagine you could set up a hybrid process where the owner receives the lion's share of the proceeds, but the network takes something equivalent to a real estate agents fee (anywhere between 3 and 5 percent), and pours that into the community revenue stream.  This would preserve the all-important care-taking factor of real ownership and the powerful motivation of capital gains.  Please give this some thought, and here's to a fantastic public sale!

Our goal is to add a new language each quarter, after the initial release.  Currently thinking that next languages will be Spanish, French, German, and Japanese (not necessarily in that order).  But we also want to support China and India markets, as well.  Each language will have its own domain, with its own niches and channels, while sharing the same user base.  Thus, as we add a new language, the number of supported niches and channels will multiply.  Does that answer your question? Was there a particular language you want to see support for?   Quote from: ainsleyfran on December 21, 2017, 08:02:29 PM To be honest, it would be nice to have a platform for both content creators and people who are in need of content!  I can easily see that kind of marketplace developing on Narrative... meaning that users could solicit content creators to post on their brand channels, for instance.  The tips system built into Narrative would be perfect for that sort of thing.  You could use tips to request someone to post content you are seeking, for instance.

Death & taxes are certain but not a slam dunk!!  I think you look at the scope of the project and how many hundreds of millions of people and the dozens of language groups who can benefit.  The ""value""  inside that economy is the millions of hours or writing, reading and reacting to ""content""  --  the one product we know is endlessly produced and consumed on the internet.  Even a sliver of that is huge.  OK -- now let's bring in blockchain to launch a currency for that value that crosses borders and is indefinitely divisible and moveable according to  smart contracts.  While we're at it, let's reorient the economy away from paying off advertisers who want our attention, demographics, $$ -- but not really our best interests. Reorient that economy toward one where revenue flows primarily among the community.  Imagine for a moment what social media is like when we are all ""influencers"" and we all measure our participation by its effect on our reputation.  There's a whole new economy in play when we all have a stake.  Last -- and this is no small thing  -- this is a project that runs on crypto but doesn't require you to use or even know what crypto is.  We remember when the internet was arcane commands suitable only for computer nerds.   We saw how it exploded when people figured out it was for everyone.  We figured out that blockchain is for everyone but it doesn't require you to go full-on crypto-savvy.  We're designing Narrative for everyone -- not just the crypto savvy.  If fiat currency is what you know, then Narrative is the place to go.  Slam Dunk? No.  But Narrative already has behind it a track record of building successful social media content.  We have the technology on the shelf.  What we need through an ICO is to build out the blockchain architecture to handle the new content economy.  So the short answer is if you want to be part of something really, really big, NRV coins are a great way to start.",False

Thus, a low reputation user will not accumulate as many points/activity rewards as a higher reputation user.  Bottom line, though, the more that you contribute, be it posting content or providing feedback via votes, and other mechanisms, the more points you will earn and the larger share of the activity rewards pie you will receive.

Ads also will not be supported initially. -- A month or so later, we add support for advertising (and our ad system will respect user's privacy... user's must choose to opt in to share profile info and if they do they also qualify for recurring rewards) -- Then we start a series of rollouts (one per quarter approximately) in other languages-- Spanish, German, French, Japanese, etc.  Each language has its own domain (its own niches and channels), while sharing the same overall membership.  This will amplify the total number of niches/channels in the ecosystem of course, as a result.  We've been building enterprise platforms focused on user-generated content for nearly two decades, so we are quite confident in meeting these deadlines.  Hope this helps!

It would be worth pulling both whitepapers and comparing.  Ours is at https://assets.narrative.network/documents/narrative-network.pdf  First: what is the same. We share the same value proposition:  It's time to be the value chain of social media back in the hands of those who do the work.  This means the value of our personal data, our activities, our posts and our hard work to make the community a worthwhile place.  I think the Narrative team has pushed deeper into how an actual economy works for online community and I think Sphere and Narrative have a distinctly different view of what ""social media"" is and what's valuable about it. I think we add to the space a vision of how social media can change for the better. If you want to chase down the nuances here look carefully at Founder Ted's Medium article on reputation https://blog.narrative.network/.  It's one of several that spell out a vision for the new content economy.  So the short answer to your Sphere question is some deeply held difference in how social medium works.  We intend to change the script not simply redirect the paycheck!  Another key differentiator is easy to miss.  The foundation of Narrative is a corporation who have been making community platforms for 20 years.  If you check around for Social Strata, you'll see some familiar faces.  We have already on the shelf a mature social platform (several in fact) that demonstrate mastery in the space.  Building for millions is something we already do.     Infrastructure counts.  Add to that the same years of community management for operations in size from mom&pop to multinationals -- and it means you can trust Narrative to pull it off.  Others from the Narrative team will chime in here and I will add more of my thoughts later.  Thanks for the question.",False

Even though Sphere has a beta version in the app store, there is no detail about how the rewards work or how users will get their money (and based on what criteria).  Another key difference is that Sphere appears to be pure blockchain (i.e., everything is on the blockchain), whereas we are prioritizing user experience and using blockchain for transactions, but off-chain for content (for now).  It's a bit strange that Sphere's team bios have no links or information, other than a name and title. I'm sure that could be an oversight, but still weird.",False

Too bad we didn't get to meet in person in Tel Aviv!  In Narrative, a Founder is anyone who contributes 10 or more ETH. Founders will receive substantial perks, including:  First Dibs on Niches When the network launches, we will give all Founders a 48-hour head start on reserving new niches (there will be a limit on number of niches you can create during this period, however). They can reserve the most lucrative niche subjects before the general public comes in. Since Niche Owners can earn recurring revenue from the niches they operate, this is a potentially substantial benefit. Don't know what a niche is? Read the White Paper!  Access to Team During Development Phase Founders will have exclusive access to the Narrative team immediately after the Token Sale ends until the network launches. Get an inside look at the progress we make.  Lifetime Activity Points Bonus For the life of their network account, Founders will receive a 10% bonus for all activity points they earn each reward period. That means a higher share of Activity Rewards payouts.  To qualify as Founder, contribute at least 10 ETH in total during the Narrative Token Sale. Then, when the network launches, register your account using the same email address you used for the Token Sale so we can automatically grant you Founder's rights.  Regarding Niche ownership, there is only one owner per Niche, and when a new Niche is authorized, anyone with positive reputation can request to be the Niche owner. If more than one person bids on the new Niche, then a formula is used to award the Niche owner, with the bidders' Reputation Rank being the most important factor. In addition, the number of Niches already owned by a Narrator will incrementally reduce his chances, in order to discourage hoarding of Niches by users. So there's no set max number of Niches a single owner can have, but the process is built to encourage new Niche owners to jump in.",False

The Founder perk IS a big deal.  There's a longer article about it at https://blog.narrative.network/founder-status-9a4d7ea4d539.  Number 1 and 2  are a strong incentive to maximize your earning opportunities within Narrative.  We think that the ability to ""own""  and expand certain subject areas (Niches) will be valuable.  In time, with a large community,  these spaces will command a premium.  Having first dibs on establishing one could be big.  Add to it the 10% activity bonus, and you could see some real revenue flow.  There will be limits to how many niches you can claim  (based on reputation & capacity as well as simple numbers) but we anticipate that 'first dibs' alone will make the purchase worthwhile.    Number 3 may be what drives a number of people toward Founder status.  Getting to rub shoulders with the dev team and other Founders could be a great perk if you have ever dreamed of building something game-changing.  Haven't we all?

The network is governed by the users themselves; moderators and a Supreme Court-like Tribunal are elected by members.  User reputation and content ratings reduce the impact of “bad eggs”.  Best of all, even though cryptocurrency is utilized to represent the value instilled in the network, regular users will not be required to understand or use crypto, since payments can be made in fiat currency.  WHAT IS NARRATIVE? Narrative will be the world’s journal, providing a scalable, smart subject-oriented network where the middleman is removed and network members have autonomy in a transparent environment.  Existing social networks subjugate their users with ambiguous content policies, providing little to no economic reward for the content they produce.  Narrative flips the script by rewarding all of the users who positively contribute to the network.  HOW DO YOU USE BLOCKCHAIN? While Narrative utilizes blockchain technology to create a trustless environment for its transactions, it does not rely solely on blockchain for its operation. The fact is that blockchain is a poor choice for content management currently.  Narrative will compete with existing social networks in terms of speed, scalability, searchability, and performance and for that reason it will utilize proven content management technologies to ensure a competitive advantage.  The goal is not to be the best crypto content economy, it is to the the very best social network.    The overall design goal is to observe the fundamental principles of blockchain, like transparency and decentralization, while still offering a user experience that is second to none.  RADICAL PRIVACY AND CONTROL FOR THE USER Narrative will also protect user’s ability to control their content and profile information.  For that reason, content will always be editable by creators (and can be deleted by creators, as well).  This conflicts with the immutable nature of traditional blockchain, and thus content itself will not be stored in a blockchain.  In addition, while advertising will be supported, users will control whether their profile information is shared with advertisers and can be rewarded on a recurring basis if they decide to share that information.",False

However, because we are selling a certain amount in Early Bird and Pre-Sale before then (and the price is lower in those phases), the most likely raise is between $33-37million.   For Early Bird, we are limiting total contribution to 6500 ETH. Pre-Sale will close once we raised a total of 60,000 ETH (across both phases).  If both of those phases sell out, then the total raise will be lower because of the lower token prices in the earlier phases.   Hence, we expect a total sell out to raise between $33 - 37 million.   The other variable that prevents us from giving a more specific total is that the ETH/USD exchange rate that will determine the number of tokens issued per ETH will not be locked in until 24 hours before the token sale day. This is similar to the way Blackmooncrypto handled their token sale.  Hope that helps!

Steemit does not have a complete content economy and its model is relatively simple.  With Narrative, we have a deep model for tracking and rewarding participation on the network.  That model also factors in user reputation and content ratings.  For example, an up-vote or down-vote in Narrative has more impact if the person has more credibility/higher rank in the community.  And we track more types of participation, qualifying more users for rewards.  2.  Multiple Tokens vs. One Token  Steemit has a fairly confusing token model, featuring multiple tokens, each with a different role/purpose. Narrative has one token.  3.  Content Search  Search in Steemit is primitive. It has to be because current blockchain technology is not built for the kind of indexing associated with content.  Narrative takes a different approach with the content, not storing the content itself on a blockchain, allowing for enterprise-class scalability and search.. .and allowing us to compete with the dominant social networks.  4.  Moderation  In both systems, users have autonomy, but in Narrative we add a moderation layer, whereby the community elects moderators (who are also compensated via the rewards system) to ensure a good experience for everyone.  Even better, all moderator actions are transparent, so they are also accountable for their actions.  5. Niches  Narrative is introducing a whole new type of content channel type called niches. For more on that, see: https://blog.narrative.network/niches-a-new-paradigm-for-social-media-2058351b843d  Niches are unique subjects and each niche has an owner, incentivizing upkeep of each such area (and providing rewards for the owners, as well).  6. Not Just For Cryptos  If you want rewards in Steemit, you ultimately need to have crypto.  Our goal with Narrative is to get WIDE adoption so we can compete with the established leaders (Facebook, Medium, Wordpress, etc.). For that reason, we will support letting users cash out their rewards in fiat currency (and even allowing advertisers to pay in fiat).  There are incentives to use crypto (you pay a premium to use fiat), but we want to reduce the barriers to entry for everyone.  There is more detail in the white paper, and I think if you read it you'll see that Narrative is a radical improvement over SteemIt. That's not to knock SteemIt, either. SteemIt has proven that user-autonomous, crypto-based social media platforms can work.  I hope this helps! ",False

The current system monetizes your attention through whatever works (clickbait, outrage, echo chambers..) and sends the paycheck to the  marketers.  With an economy built on the NRV token we can send 85% of revenue to creators, curators,  and the owners that make a content niche compelling.   Thanks Chris. You get it!",False

First Dibs on Niches  Niches are valuable real estate in Narrative. They are the unique subjects that users post to. Think ""Los Angeles Lakers"" or ""World of Warcraft"", etc.  And each niche has an owner, someone who purchases it (just like a domain) and shares in the revenue earned by the content it contains.  Each Network Rewards payout period, 10% of the rewards are paid to these niche owners.  Thus, the more popular niches will likely earn the most money.  When the network launches, we're going to give all Founders a 48-hour head-start on locking up niches.  There will be a limit on how many each Founder can reserve, however.  This gives Founders a significant advantage in securing the very best real estate in Narrative.  2. Lifetime Activity Points Bonus  Members accrue activity points as they do things in the network (like post new content, comment, vote, etc.)  And Narrative rewards all participants by paying 8% of all Network Rewards to users based on their Activity Point totals. The more you have, the higher the payout.  For the life of their network account, Founders will receive a 10% bonus for all activity points they earn each reward period. That means a higher share of Activity Rewards payouts.    3. Exclusive Access to Our Team During Development Phase  We’ll be setting up a private space online after the Token Sale ends and this area will only be accessible by Founders. You will get sneak peaks at new developments and overall platform development.",False
