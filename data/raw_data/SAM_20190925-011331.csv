In most cases we have to supply the electricity to the stables. The costs for the development of the first building were 30'000 CHF, but mostly 2-4 of these buildings are in the same place and we can therefore split these costs. The first stable which can be seen in the video has 2 more next door and all 3 are now useable. Therefore, the costs are quite acceptable there.  Currently we have large scale contracts (with a minimum that we have to buy) for hydro power and we pay 5.23 cents per KW / H. When operating our own power plants, we will operate the containers next to them and operate our own network in order to not have to use the public grid. the idea is to operate small hydropowerplants (we have more then 1400 of them in switzerland), they are exempted from water taxes in switzerland. and of course they are much cheaper to buy  About the banks, currentlyl we work with a swiss bank (you can see the details when you go to our tokensale plattform) but maybe we will switch to a bank in liechtenstein because they can provide us also with wallets etc. Swiss Alps Energy is currently in process to get a SRO Member in Switzerland.

Quick calculation shows:  50 x S9 = 66 kw  4000 Mhs ETHASH = approx 130 RX 580, = 17.5 kw (+ Mainboards, routers, vents  etc) (space must be packed in a 4m x 2m x 2m container ....)  So lets make that a generous 100 kw / Container. On 400 Volts, that's roughly 250 A.  Not one of the buildings in the mountains has that energy supply - so you will be restricted to locations that are either close to a trafo station, or close to e.g. ski lifts / mountain railways, otherwise you pay a fortune to get the energy laid to these locations.  The connection to a trafo station / ski lift will still need to be established, and depending on the distance, this is a 5-6 digit amount VERY quickly just to get the energy to the container.  In addition to that i miss the mentioning of the swiss electricty grid usage cost (5-6 rp/kwh) and general cost (2.6 rp/kwh)  in your calculations and whitepaper.  So in essence, without having your own hydro power stations, you are looking at at least 10 rp/kwh for energy, and thats already the best case. More likely 13-16 rp/kwh.  Even IF you acquire your own hydro plants, the swiss electrity grid usage fee will still need to be paid (happy to learn something new here if that's not the case).  Thank you for your feedback, wish you all the best with the ICO.  my best regards  Sergej  PS: on a sidenote - as far as i know all swiss banks have cancelled / do not further maintain banking relationships with crypto mining companies. Do you bank out of Liechtenstein?",False

The placement of the mining facilities in the Swiss Alps takes advantage of the fact that water has a lower boiling point at these altitudes, resulting in a much more efficient recovery of electricity from heat. Since the mining systems at these sites do not require additional cooling by air conditioning systems, the SAM cubes power consumption can be reduced by up to 50% compared to conventional mining systems. With this unique approach, SAM is solving a global problem in the field of mining.  https://tokensale.swissalpsmining.io//sign_up.html?referralCode=JDJhJDA3JG5HWUNDbWhyempyZ2RFQVVuaXF1ZU94bG53VFdCWW9COWpUM2ptOUhwSkg5bHZXanI0aDUu  Media Link :      https://www.cnnmoney.ch/shows/big-picture/videos/swiss-renewables-cryptocurrency-mining-gian-carlo-collenberg-swiss",False

How can you ensure that the energy you use is from renewable sources? In Switzerland Hydro power production rules but a third of the energy production come from nuclear power and there is no way to know from witch is coming the energy you are using unless you produce it yourself. Not to say that Switzerland import a lot energy from the UE where the production is made for the 75% from conventional thermal solutions.  The other thing that I don’t get is what the matter with mountain cabins and buildings, what is the links with your containers? Usually in Switzerland you cannot put what you want where you want, for the same law of the 2013 mentioned in your white paper. Containers falls in a particular situation because they are movable so they can temporally be placed but what the benefit for the “abandoned” cabins if you place near them a SAM cube?  I really would like to have the possibility to look at a SAM cube in person since you already deployed some, it is possible?",False

SAM Cubes are located at a high altitude and a therefore lowered boiling point of water, which facilitates this process. SAM is the first company with a revolutinary solution to save up to 50% of its electricity costs by using mining cubes powered exclusively by renewable energy and ORC recovery of waste heat from the mining equipment.
