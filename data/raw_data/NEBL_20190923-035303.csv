Neblio is a long term hold. You don’t build a real business overnight. Great technology will get you so far but there will always be competition. Main thing is to follow the road map and stay focused on replacing current database technology amongst other things. This is an opportunity to buy in low to whatever coins you believe are serious. I’m sticking with Neblio. No reason to fud now. This is money I can lose so why be upset? I don’t look at this as currency trading. It’s an investment in a database.

The whole reason I discovered NEBL was from the group called Crypto Traders I'm apart of.  I had high hopes for the Marketing in Q2, but I don't think the team is delivering on it very well.  I contacted NEBLIO on behalf of Crypto Traders to try and get them on one of their episode of Coin Cast that they frequently do.  Coin Cast is a Live video series where the Crypto Traders team interviews developers/team members of different crypto project. They have interviewed Zcoin, Enigma, Vertcoin, EOS, Litecoin, Digibyte, and a few others.  The Crypto Traders team reached out to NEBL and asked if they would do an interview. We even had a few members from the community reach out to NEBL on Telegram and Slack. A few of us had talked to Bryan, Eddie, and a few other lead members of the community to setup a live interview that would be shared to about 75k Cryptocurrency traders.  The interviews are informative and help us learn more about different projects from a trusted source.  NEBL never did the interview and it honestly makes me question them. Why would they not want to do an interview with a community of 75k Crypto Traders & investors?  Why do they not want the free publicity, especially when in the middle of their 'Marketing Campaign'?  I'm not here to bash NEBL, I just want to know why the team isn't taking the necessary steps to Market themselves & grow the community?  Why are they not jumping on the opportunity to do interviews like several other projects do?  This is my biggest concern with NEBL.  I've been holding NEBL since October 2017 and learned about it because my favorite Crypto community posted about it. I tried to set NEBL up with a free interview with a massive community & they declined.

If you are interested in testing Orion, head over to #orion!!!  A couple of notes:  1) *No* tokens created will exist after the beta period is over, they are created with a test version byte that will not be recognized by the official build of Orion  2) Use tiny NEBL amounts you can afford to lose, there have not been any un-recoverable NEBL transactions with Orion yet, but this is BETA software.  3) NTP1 tokens will cost 0.1NEBL to create and 0.0001NEBL to send during the beta. Creation fees will increase after the beta, send fees will stay at 0.0001. All fees go to our stakers.   ",False

Hey I'm a big believer in Neblo. So much so that since the launch I have never sold a single NEBL, I am just staking it strong, it feels like the beginning of Bitcoin or Ethereum at the moment being a part of Neblio so early. I know NEBL went as high as $60 one time and then the entire cryptocurrency market took a plunge. Still I am HODL'ing tight because I want to experience this ride 10 years from now too. If you look at the roadmap you can see it's just the very begining and Neblio is still a baby, once it's start walking, running, go full blast to the moon then we see the real platform emerge and this will benefit the world at large actually providing a blockchain use where there is a demand for it.

Because that would be ridiculous. Even though they don't have 50+ members, they are working hard and are always ahead of schedule. I don't really see any point here.  ""I heard it is so-called ""chinese ETH"" or ""pro-gov project""."" - NEO is great project, that's a fact, but again, are you trying to tell us that Neblio isn't? Both have their features, and I'd say Neblio is even better. The only thing where NEO is better is transaction speed, but they you might remember when their network couldn't hold few thousands of TXs (despite the fact they claim to be able to hold 10,000 TX/s). Anyways, Neblio has quick sync, token-to-token transfer and more (not mentioning their focus on simplicity which is awesome).  ""I can not imagine how they will achieve results in this year."" - They can easily achieve $150 if you mean this. They are not a hype coin, they are still developing ""in the background"", their marketing is going to begin in Q2 2018.  Devs are just silently delivering what they promised. $150 for 1 NEBL is more than possible, considering the fact that NEBL has ~8x less coin supply than NEO. So, when 1 NEO = $150, then the same market cap for NEBL would mean 1 NEBL = ~1200. 1 NEBL = $150? Too easy... Just wait for their marketing campaign, this coin has potential to get to top 20, if not top 10 in 2019-2020. I believe they can reach at least $300-500 in 2018, if not more (my opinion, I'm not financial advisor though).  NEO is great project though, they can be very successful, and I believe they will be, but I don't really see any limits for Neblio. They are from US, they are focused on enterprise (just imagine when they start to attract more and more businesses with their easy-to-use idea/design) and with such a low token supply, they can be very successful too.",False

NTP1 allows users to issue new Neblio tokens on the Neblio blockchain. All NTP1 transactions are made over the Neblio blockchain and use new and existing Neblio addresses. Standard Neblio fees per transaction are used to fund the transaction, which currently are set to 0.0001 NEBL (<$0.01) at today's prices. The fees are paid to the staker, so there is an even greater incentive for staking on the Neblio network. While the existing Neblio blockchain supports the creation and transfer of NTP1 tokens already, Neblio will upgrade their existing wallets and create a new web wallet, which will allow for simple token management similar to MyEtherWallet's functionality for Ethereum.  The NTP1 tokens themselves contain the ability to store metadata on the blockchain, which results in non-fungible blockchain tokens. Ethereum hasn't implemented their ERC-721 non-fungible token standard yet, so it's impressive that Neblio implemented this functionality so early compared to their platform peers. Non-fungible tokens allow for unique-attribute tokens of the same type, which provide ownership functions, metadata inclusion, events (smart-contracts), and regular fungible token functions. A non-blockchain analogy would be baseball cards, where they have different attributes, including names, teams, pictures, and statistics associated with each individual card -- but it's still clearly a baseball card. Non-fungible tokens will be the catalyst for opening up the market for transferring ownership, like real-estate, automobiles, or any digitized property. NTP1 tokens can be created as either fungible or non-fungible token assets.  NTP1 tokens natively support encryption of metadata, so that sensitive data may be written to the blockchain using RSA public key cryptography. This built-in encryption ability will enable privacy-centric industries to implement NEBL tokens without additional security measures to secure their data stored on the blockchain. Transferring the keys to read NTP1 token data can even be integrated into dApps, if desired. Additionally, NTP1 tokens support the creation of smart contracts which can restrict or direct token movement, including lockup and expiration rules, as long as whitelisting or blacklisting of Neblio addresses.  https://thecryptocurrencynews.info/neblio-the-most-promising-baas-platform-under-a-1billion-marketcap/",False

Even thou if I had waited another day I couldve sold it for $60, I am still happy at my 7x return. I used that money and bought NEO at around $100.  Now my NEO is $133.  The main reason I bought Neblio was because it was fairly new and hasn’t seen a pump at that one so it seems like a good idea to throw couple ETH at it.  But when it shoots up like that in few days without any concrete development, it seemed like a pump to me and the overall market was down at that time so people just flock to Neblio for a safe refuge.  I bought NEO because they have a much matured product and it’s an up and coming platform for Dapps because of their advantage in speed compares to ETH since it’s already proof of stake.  Also the  few Dapps that just came out of NEO did very well, e.g. red pulse and deepbrain, unlike QTUM with bunch of shitcoins. Also I met DaHongFei at a NYC meetup, he seems like a honest and humble guy(I know looks can be deceiving, but he hasn’t had any negative rumors on his reputation so far, unlike the guy in QTUM).  Another thing  with NEO was that they returned all the initial funding back to its investors, even though it’s not a lot compare to the current value of NEO, it’s still a nice gesture nonetheless.  It seems I digressed from my Neblio transaction.  But I just want to state that I’m hoping for the best for the Neblio team and its investors.  Maybe I would invest again if the platform is a little bit more mature.  ",False

Neblio is a platform, similar to quite a few other platforms. They all share the same utility. Are you questioning the use cases for Lisk, Stratis, Neo, ethereum? Yes, there are a lot of them, but im not so sure that's a bad thing. We are talking about technology that is about to rapidly spread across the globe. If you think there isnt enough room for the existing platforms to all thrive and carve out their own users and markets then I disagree. Quite frankly, I think there's room for a few more. Just look at any industry and see how many successful multimillion/multibillion different companies exist within them. This is just the beginning and still and I dont think the market is oversaturated.  Also, I think Neblio is smart in targeting existing businesses and their jump to blockchain. While all platforms are more than receptive to this, there is definitely going to be a huge market for these types of projects. A lot of companies will begin to find use cases for blockchains within their business. Platforms which help the development of these applications in the most seamless way possible will thrive.  I was little wary of another platform project back when Neblio started its original rise in popularity, but I have become much more open to the idea that we are seeing just the beginning here.",False

I myself called out a few people for being critical about something stupid but not every complaint deserves to be mocked.  On the Novacoin thing, I've heard it before and it sounds like a more valid critique than it actually is. Many wallets are derived from the same templates. It's a basic wallet, you don't need to reinvent the wheel there. Unless you're trying to do something unique with your wallets it's idiotic to waste time building one from scratch.  Neblio is built from a fork of a fork of a fork of a fork of Bitcoin. Many alts are derived from Bitcoin and that isn't a crime, nor is it indicative of a bad blockchain. It may eventually need an upgrade when volume gets really high (like Bitcoin/Ethereum/Litecoin level high) and I have been communicated with Eddy on a few possible solutions, none of which have ultimately been decided on.  The key to whether Neblio is unique or special doesn't necessarily derive from its origin code, it's derived from what is done with it. If two twins took vastly different paths in life, one could wind up extremely successful while the other floundered, despite being formed from the same mould. The Neblio developers vision is creating a blockchain platform that is both flexible and simple by creating a REST API base to give programmers the ability to code in their language of choice and then after creating V1 of their language libraries going back through and tweaking it to eliminate any code that is clunky, inefficient or difficult to work with for a more refined and elegant API suite V2.  Simplicity and flexibility are the purpose of Neblio, it sounds mundane but it's very much the opposite.",False

ICO price was around                   4500satoshies. at todays btc price that is around         0.19USD.  the team recieved 500BTC , around 2 500 000 USD. that is where you get the              13 000 000 Neblio.  Proof of Stake reward of 10% a year, so around 1.3million coin. this is very good since its not a high inflation in my opinion.  Now, 13 000 000 coin at 4500satoshi means the market cap would be 2.5million.  do you realy believe this platform project is only worth 2.5million. i dont.  lets play a bit with market cap.

We are working on more specific dates for milestones. Once we have that we will want to create buzz when we achieve those milestones. *Community engagement: Members will be able to automatically share those announcements / press releases in their social profiles (FB, Twitter..) by ""donating"" their social profile for these campaigns.

We are targeting 1-4% yearly inflation. After most PoS networks settle down they see 10-20% of tokens actively staking on the network on average, which in our case would lead to a 1-2% yearly inflation rate, within target.

Quote from: Jimmi Andersen on August 13, 2017, 01:24:59 AM What is the incentive for the team behind neblio to actually work on the project for several years if they don't keep any of the tokens and therefore don't stand to benefit(from a rising price) from working on it? Hey Jimmi! Ann and I were committed to the project from the start. We believe in the vision and that this can be a highly successful business, which would be a great thing for everyone involved, that is our motivator, building and sustaining a successful and profitable business. However both Ann and I have purchased a small amount of NEBL, at the urge of our supporters. We did not believe we should get anything for free by default, which is why we did not want to take 1 or 5 or 10 percent from the start. The amount we purchased was at the 25% bonus level, from our personal bitcoin and deposited into our personal NEBL wallets. Hope that makes sense?  I'm not sure it makes sense. Did you basically pay yourself when buying nebl? Are the funds in any way separated from your private funds and does anything prevent you from just withdrawing the money and keeping them as private funds.  I think it would be way better just to take maybe 5 or 10 % from the start unless you actually get paid for doing consultancy and helping people make sideshains on neblio. It's great if developers stand to earn a huge fortune for doing great work. That way their interests are aligned with shareholders/tokenholders. Of course we do not mix any personal funds with NEBL funds!!!! And yes, we absolutely plan for Neblio get paid, in fiat, for all consultancy work and other business services once launched that we provide to our enterprise customers.

Are you holding any/some/all BTC or cashing it to USD in order to hire developers and staff?  Looking forward to seeing the raised amount cross that nice round number 😉 Correct on the consulting/business services.  Private chains will still use a form of the NEBL token, but due to it being a separate, private blockchain, it is technically not the same token. Private chains mean enterprise customers are adopting Neblio, providing revenue, and our vision is validated in the market and our business is healthy. It also provides publicity for the public chain. Imagine the Press Release: ""{Popular Tech Company} Partners with Neblio to accelerate their business using Innovative Blockchain Technology""  I think we will have to see. It is quite possible many businesses may be willing to use the public chain, but encrypt the information stored on the chain, our APIs will support this.  We will be cashing some to fiat to pay expenses and staff of course. We will be holding some for future expenses due to the trajectory BTC is heading   Quote from: nyteo on August 14, 2017, 12:45:30 PM almost $1M 237BTC x $4200 = $995,400 https://nebl.io/pre-sale/ Thanks for your support nyteo!",False

Once a group of tokens stake, their maturity resets, so they are not mature until 24 hours pass again. You can have one big group of tokens or many smaller groups of tokens, due to the stake reward being a % reward, either way does not matter, you get the same reward.  So what I bet is happening is that your tokens are in 1 big group. They stake and you get a reward and then they are not mature until 24 hours have passed.  The staking display on the wallet is a little buggy and not always accurate, but the staking algorithm always behaves correctly and has been tested extensively.  Hope that makes sense.",False

DOWNLOAD WALLET  Business Value Our vision is to simplify the many complexities of current blockchain technology via intuitive services and APIs that speed adoption of distributed blockchain applications in the enterprise.  VIEW OUR ROADMAP  Decentralized & Secure Our blockchain’s decentralized consensus model secures all transactions and/or information stored on the Neblio blockchain in such a way that there is no centralized point of failure in the network.  DISCOVER MORE   We are building a global blockchain developer network centered around simple to use APIs, tools, and services. Let us help you develop and deploy your next generation distributed application.  FAQ When will the Neblio Network launch? The Neblio Network will be live on the date the Token Sale begins. Users that participate in the Token Sale will have their NEBL tokens deposited into the Neblio wallet address of their choice quickly after their order has been confirmed. Users may then immediately transfer their purchased tokens as they wish, even before the Token Sale concludes.  Why are NEBL Tokens needed on the Neblio Network? Large, decentralized networks require robust security protocols and algorithms to ensure that all members of the network are behaving honestly. The Neblio Network does this via a Proof-of-Stake algorithm where users “stake” their tokens to secure the network. To encourage staking and securing the network, the network rewards users for the time spent staking.  What cryptocurrency exchanges will support NEBL? This is up to individual exchanges. Exchanges support tokens based purely upon demand. The more demand expressed by consumers to exchange NEBL for other cryptocurrencies, the more likely it is that exchanges will support NEBL. Contact your favorite exchange to see if they will support NEBL.  How do I Stake my Tokens to generate tokens? Staking is vital to operate and secure the Neblio Network. The network is set to generate new tokens at a rate that is variable depending on the number of tokens currently being staked on the network at any given time. The more tokens you currently have staking, and the longer it has been (up to a limit of 7 days) since the last time those tokens have successfully staked, the greater chance you have of receiving a stake reward. You may get small rewards frequently, or infrequently, depending on your total tokens. For more info, see our detailed blog post on staking.  When can I use the Neblio Platform for my distributed application? See our Roadmap. We are working towards meeting or exceeding the deliverables and timeline we have set. In Q1 2018 the first version of our RESTful APIs in multiple languages are scheduled to be released. These APIs can be used to build applications that interact with the Neblio blockchain by storing and accessing transactions and information.
