This is a really undervalued project and if people soon see the real potential of it, they will come to buy.

During the ICO campaign, enthusiasts and supporters of the firm’s initiative buy some of the distributed cryptocoins with fiat or virtual currency. These coins are referred to as tokens and are similar to shares of a company sold to investors in an Initial Public Offering (IPO) transaction. If the money raised does not meet the minimum funds required by the firm, the money is returned to the backers and the ICO is deemed to be unsuccessful. If the funds requirements are met within the specified timeframe, the money raised is used to either initiate the new scheme or to complete it. Early investors in the operation are usually motivated to buy the cryptocoins in the hope that the plan becomes successful after it launches which could translate to a higher cryptocoin value than what they purchased it for before the project was initiated. An example of a successful ICO project that was profitable to early investors is the smart contracts platform called Ethereum which has Ethers as its coin tokens. In 2014, the Ethereum project was announced and its ICO raised $18 million in Bitcoins or $0.40 per Ether. The project went live in 2015 and in 2016 had an ether value that went up as high as $14 with a market capitalization of over $1 billion. ICOs are similar to IPOs and crowdfunding. Like IPOs, a stake of the startup or company is sold to raise money for the entity’s operations during an ICO operation. However, while IPOs deal with investors, ICOs deal with supporters that are keen to invest in a new project much like a crowdfunding event. But ICOs differ from crowdfunding in that the backers of the former are motivated by a prospective return in their investments, while the funds raised in the latter campaign are basically donations. For these reasons, ICOs are referred to as crowdsales. Although there are successful ICO transactions on record and ICOs are poised to be disruptive innovative tools in the digital era, investors are cautioned to be wary as some ICO or crowdsale campaigns are actually fraudulent. Because these fund-raising operatives are not regulated by financial authorities such as the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC), funds that are lost due to fraudulent initiatives may never be recovered. In early September, 2017, the People's Bank of China officially banned ICOs, citing it as disruptive to economic and financial stability. The central bank said tokens cannot be used as currency on the market and banks cannot offer services relating to ICOs. As a result, both bitcoin and ethereum tumbled, and it was viewed as a sign that regulations of cryptocurrencies are coming. The ban also penalizes offerings already completed][/color]",False

In this regard, I am very pleased to have Ruchali Dodderi join our Advisory Board (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruchali-dodderi-ab148814/).  Ruchali has held senior CTO-level positions across companies, she has worked across a range of companies from Accenture, EMC, Infosys, Wipro. She was Wipro’s CTO for their Integrated Solutions group. And is currently, working as the Technology lead for Antelope.club that is into Internet of Things (IoT), AI and Blockchain.  As can be seen from her profile, she comes with a lot of experience in building scalable technologies; knowledge across a wide breadth of technologies; and distributed platforms. All things that will be valuable for us going forward.  I spoke to Ruchali through a common connection, and he said, Ruchali is a true techie, who will still roll up her sleeves and get into the code. And when Ruchali and I spoke, she said she still codes at Hackathons and Blockchain events, and is probably the most experienced person at those Hackathons among a sea of 20-year olds This mindset itself makes her quite unique.  As a person she is very humble, and open to new challenges, and it is this balance between a strong skillset, and the right mindset, that makes me very happy to invite Ruchali to our Advisory Board.  https://medium.com/@genieico/adding-to-our-technology-team-2a4879343e2",False

Reasons for keeping the fund off the public:  From Akshay: From Akshay: I saw the question on the fund raise a couple of times on the group - so let me answer it to the extent I can - in the pre-sale we have private investors (typically investing in Fiat) and crypto (typically investing in relatively smaller amounts). As private investors are in the process of clearing the KYC etc, I cannot share the number yet, but it is significant. Coming to the crypto group - we have raised $500K in the past 2 weeks; and more than 200 people have invested. The final tally will be a combination of crypto and fiat - and that will only be finalized by the end of the pre-sale. Hope this helps",False

It connects small to medium businesses seeking loans with capital via a blockchain-based cryptocurrency system. Lenders obtain better rates than they would at a bank and borrowers receive better terms. Borrowers who otherwise might not get access to such loans, now have a place to turn. The company was granted regulatory approval in March 2017 by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. That said, Singapore is just their launch country. The team has their eye set on pan-Asian expansion.  How it works is simple; a borrower will be matched with lenders. Lenders can expect to make at least 14% return with all funds held in escrow. This peer to peer lending activities will be tokenized using smart contracts to enable lending without borders more efficient, cheaper and safer. Ultimately, the team has a vision to build an Asset Trading Exchange on Blockchain that will democratize trading and allow investment in infrastructure, stocks, cryptocurrency, and bonds across Asia, which would be prohibitively expensive, and potentially unfeasible due to issues of transparency and trust without Blockchain.  We recently sat down with Akshay Mehra, the CEO of Crowd Genie to have a chat with him about the project as well as finding out his thoughts and insights.  Hi, Akshay. Thanks for joining us today. Can you tell us more about yourself and Crowd Genie?  Hi Daniel, thanks for your invitation. Before founding Crowd Genie, I was the board advisor at Anchanto e-commerce, and previously the brand management head at P&G and Principal Consultant at Innosight. The reason why I created Crowd Genie is simple. I want to make borrowing faster, cheaper, and simpler compared to traditional financing methods. Crowdfunding is popular in the West, but the idea is relatively new in Singapore and other Asia countries. Observing how lenders getting low returns from the banks because of the overhead costs and how established SMEs unable to receive full funding desired and become under-banked, I would like to match this two parties together to solve the problem and that’s what Crowd Genie has been doing.  Why did you decide to use blockchain in building Crowd Genie?  Although our existing P2P digital loan business is incredibly innovative in the Singapore financial sector, it would have been impossible to scale to enable lending without borders and offer Asia-wide asset trading before blockchain technology was introduced. Make borrowing faster, cheaper, and simpler compared to traditional financing methods  To build and scale an asset exchange with pre-blockchain technologies would be prohibitively expensive, and potentially unfeasible due to issues of transparency and trust. Was that your plan from the start or did you start the service and realize that this technology was the only way of scaling, particularly internationally?  Yes, my initial plan was to transform Crowd Genie into a regional lending platform where lenders from one country can lend to borrowers from another, not restricted by geography limitation. The introduction of Blockchain technology has made our vision more cost feasible and practical now  Source: https://www.chipin.com/crowd-genie-ceo-akshay-mehra-interview/  ................

However, with the rising popularity of blockchain technology and the concept of ICOs, many new projects are increasingly adopting crowdsales and crowdlending as the preferred method of fundraising. But the rise in trend has also created uncertainties regarding the authenticity of the campaigns among the contributors, which has started to pose a huge challenge to genuine projects and businesses.  Now, Crowd-genie is a platform which is introducing a safe and secure business lending solution that makes it easier for small businesses to borrow funds in the time of need. The platform has various safety features in place to ensure reliability. In addition, it also holds a license from the Monetary Authority of Singapore, which puts Crowd-genie in the league of very few platforms of such standing. We interacted with the team behind Crowd-genie to gain some insights into the industry sector and their operations.  NewsBTC: Why is licensing so important? How difficult is it to get in Singapore?  Crowd-genie: Being registered and licensed are two different stories. As peer to peer lending platform involves enormous monetary transactions, a securities license is crucial for regulated lending activities. It’s never an easy task and the application process requires time and effort. In order to get the MAS “Dealing in Securities” license, it took us few months to go through our internal operation processes with the regulatory board, to convince them that our platform is credible.  In general, apart from the minimum capital required, we are required to have a solid compliance manual to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing activities, and protect the interest of borrowers and lenders by having an Escrow Agent who manages all funds. Lending activities also need to be recorded and submitted to MAS on a regular basis.  NewsBTC: Can you please explanation of how reputations coin work?  Crowd-genie: The biggest concern that any lender has is the risk of default. Hence, the borrower should be rewarded if they have excellent past payment history, by lowering the interest rate. For each repayment, from the borrower to lenders, we will incentivise on-time payment by adding CGCOIN “Credits” to the borrowers’ wallets. This will be a spendable asset that will be tracked separately in the Digital Passport. The more CGCOIN Credits earned, the higher their reputation, and that in turn, will increase their chances of getting higher investments from more lenders and/or a lower interest rate. This will add an additional data point to our AI credit assessment system which will add greater depth to our credit assessment. Similarly, for the lenders, CGCOIN could be given to reward speed of deal closure or engagement in the Crowd Genie ecosystem.  NewsBTC: Why is there a need to create a token-based lending platform?  Crowd-genie: Token-based lending was created in order to build a private capital hub for Asia Pacific using smart contracts to enable lending without borders more efficient, cheaper and safer. Our ultimate goal is to build an Asset Trading Exchange that will democratise trading and allow investment in infrastructure, stocks, cryptocurrency, and bonds across Asia. Although our existing P2P digital loan business is incredibly innovative in the Singapore financial sector, it would have been impossible to scale and offer Asia-wide asset trading before blockchain technology was introduced. To build and scale an asset exchange with pre-blockchain technologies would be prohibitively expensive, and potentially unfeasible due to issues of transparency and trust.  NewsBTC: How will the funds raised be utilized?  Crowd-genie: In order to build towards our vision of becoming the first Asia wide Asset Exchange on Blockchain, we need funds to expand our current loan book to make it more established. Secondly, we need funds for regional expansion and we foresee that there will be costs incurred for the relevant licenses in other countries. Thirdly, we need to recruit more experts to build up the entire ecosystem, a solid and well supported one.  NewsBTC: Who are your team members?  Crowd-genie: Our team consists of experts covering the aspects of payment security, technology, debt capital, cryptocurrency, and business development. Me myself was the board advisor at Anchanto e-commerce, brand management head at P&G and Principal Consultant at Innosight before founding Crowd Genie. Our co-founder, Mr. Bikash has more than 20 years of retail banking experience with Standard Chartered and he was the former COO of Standard Chartered Korea.  NewsBTC: Anything you would like our readers to know?  Crowd-genie: Yes, they can keep an eye out on the development of the platform. We will be working according to the Roadmap / Expansion plan as shown below.  That's all for today.  Best regards, Brian Li, community manager.  PS: we got great news to come!

Here is what we are aiming to do: We are building an asset exchange built on blockchain, that improves the access to reasonably priced capital for borrowers.   To build this exchange, there are 3 components: 1. Customer passport for KYC/ due diligence 2. Lending analytics engine that can assess borrowers, and price loans correctly 3. Asset exchange that allows lenders to trade fractions of their holdings.  Besides this, the platform needs to be regulated, because this is a licensed activity in almost all key geographies (here's a video I've made on why this is important, and what protections a license provides:http://bit.ly/2kDtSpL).  Why is this unique? We are unique because: 1. We are the only ones who are bringing all the 3 components together - there are others who do 1 or 2 components, but not all 3 2. We are already licensed, so unlike a lot of other ICOs - we know we can execute. If one just has the technology, but not the license, it cannot work. 3. We already know how to execute component #1 and #2, that's our business. So, we can already deliver 2 out of 3 components out of the box  So, as you see, none of the above talks about just being on blockchain - that is not enough (which is what you imply, and I agree with!). We need to have a strong business model and case on why we are running the token sale.  Hope this helps! And thanks for the question.  Akshay    ",False
