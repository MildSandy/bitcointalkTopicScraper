Wild seafood might become scarce, if not absent entirely. These projections seem to ignore other, less palatable signals pointing toward darker features of our food destiny.    At the same time, new production technology, from 3D printing to hydroponic growing to cell-cultured meat, will make it easier to create food products personalized to the individual consumer.

Recent research published by IDC Manufacturing Insights revealed that only 3.0% of the $35 billion in net growth in the consumer goods industry over the last three years has come from traditional, large enterprise players.  The majority of growth comes from young companies: the independents and start-ups. They have taken full advantage of an increasingly digital economy and evolving consumer demand for greater products variety, to win substantial market share from traditional players.  This forces traditional companies to better adapt to changing consumer behavior, as well as find new ways — through new products, sales channels, and distribution strategies — to remain relevant despite intense competition.  Recently a number of traditional companies have turned their attention to the promising blockchain technology, to help drive sales and establish product traceability. Among the most publicized was the IBM project with the world’s biggest retail chain, Walmart, called Food Traceability. Aiming to be able to trace in seconds the provenance of any product, this project has received a lot of attention.  Yet the insiders report that the results of the project is little more than ticking on the “completed” box, — as the real bottleneck appeared in the quality of the data that had to be recorded on the blockchain. As they say — shit in — shit out… And of course, putting it on blockchain does not make it any better…  OSA DC, an ambitious blockchain start-up claims that it has the answer to this issue. They found the solution in combining big data, artificial intelligence with blockchain. OSA DC starts by gathering relevant big data from more than 100 open and private sources, cleans, processes and analyses it, and only then secures relevant hashes in the blockchain, to achieve information immutability and trustworthiness by all parties involved.  This approach allowed OSA DC to develop a solution that has proven to increase sales on average by 5,4%. Tested in a major retail chain and with support and supervision from major consumer goods manufacturers, the project immediately caught attention. Today OSA DC boasts the world’s leading manufacturers as their clients. The company provides services to major international brands including Coca-Cola, Mars, L’Oreal, Nestle, and Metro Cash & Carry.  Recently OSA DC announced news that Nestle, world’s biggest consumer goods company, joined the OSA project. Before Nestle participated to IBM blockchain project. With the help of OSA services, the company aims to improve its supply chain processes, reduce product waste and save billions of dollars annually. Nestle Customer Development and Supply Chain Manager, Ekaterina Lihacheva, points out that “shelf availability is a crucial problem which can be solved only with the help of innovative technologies, implemented by OSA.”  Nestle’s priority is to improve supply chain insufficiencies so the product can always be available for the consumer. The company believes that OSA is an excellent solution as it allows for optimal product logistics and delivery.  Combined turnover of OSA DC big brands clients is 305 billion dollars! This is roughly 1.5 times bigger than the current value of all cryptocurrencies combined!  We keep wondering — as the whole crypto world is holding its breath for a new miracle, ever since January 2018 — could start-ups like OSA DC really become the salvation for the crypto world, the next wave, by finally implementing blockchain technology in the real economy. And — let’s not forget that consumer goods retail is the world’s biggest industry.",False

Alex Isaiev, the CEO of OSA, sadly admits: “I was motivated by Vitaliy Buterin’s speech on blockchain urgently requiring real life applications. We relied upon Ethereum (Quorum-based on Ethereum) for our private chain solution, although we knew about system limitations at that time.  The system was not initially designed to address the enterprise solution’s needs. Ethereum presents only rigid data frames, unadjustable for business needs. The cost of the transaction is another unfriendly side of the Ethereum chain as it levels any business profit provided by other blockchain related benefits. The last, but probably the most pressing system weakness, is the process of tokens distribution with lock up strategies.  While they spend enormous efforts on PR and grand statements, other humble companies are working on actually developing unique and effective solutions. OSA has announced competition for long-standing technological partnerships. MOUs were signed with Intervalue, IPchain, HPB, Everitoken and Penta followed by a row of successful tests of these blockchain protocols. It seems Ethereum is not so indispensable and universal as it’s trying to appear after all.  https://medium.com/osadc/etherium-fail-how-the-blockchain-giant-let-down-its-supporters-223a9198f53a",False

This is a result of lack transparency and and widespread inefficiencies in the entire supply chain. In addition, the retail industry wastes over $100bln in products annually. OSA DC is the world’s first solution for real-time retail supply chain improvements. Our big data platform analyses more than 100 data points and factors that influence consumer behavior. OSA DC is artificial intelligence engine also examines in-store data to recognize if something goes wrong with a product on its shelf or in its aisle. The AI engine then sends alerts to the store’s staff to manage and correct the situation. Our image recognition engine will direct employees towards stock-outs, assist in executing a task to solve the problem, and collect additional data. By doing so, OSA DC can deliver sales growth of over 5% to retailers and manufacturers and optimizes their costs (OSA HP, OSA DC’s predecessor, has already accomplished this feat). To secure data from manipulation and automate business processes, OSA DC deploys blockchain and smart contract functionality. As such, OSA provides reliable data, establishes an environment of trust, and increases profit. OSA DC significantly reduces product waste.

It is the consumers’ opinions, turning into demands, that affect the overall understocking or overstocking of shelves. This opinion now costs about $400 billion in sales losses annually. With an ever growing number of retailers offering all imaginable goods, buyers are becoming pickier and sometimes weary of the constant need to make choices. But,what if options get easier? What if personal preferences, age, financial ability or diet restrictions are taken into account by the retailer who sifts out the chaff and offers only the best, most suitable options? What if before you actually buy something, you get users’ feedback about the item without staging a time consuming Google investigation? And what if you have the opportunity to get a reward for information inputs on your products of interest? That certainly makes it worth a personal contribution to the market. https://medium.com/osadc/smart-shopping-osa-dc-makes-consumers-change-the-future-of-traditional-retail-cb2b3cc70da7",False

This is another form of achievement of the team which I think it will probably can increased the number of investors who wanted to join in their project. Totally taking part in this type of conferences help the project attract more followers in investors which help them maximize their audience hence making the project successful. It depends still of course and on quality of this conference and the most important in what country it occurs. If the conference has no due degree of the organization, then from her it is a little sense. Totally agreed, but I'm assuming they might have been to a good conference hence the confidence in sharing the new with investors and users. It is obviously of no use if the conference is not of good quality or not attended by many people.   It doesn't matter if what quality of conference that the team attended as long as its brings the same objectives and vision of this project then it would be a great opportunity. The point is that they are taking into some alternative moves and ideas that somehow it could help in the progression of this project. And by this structure the chances of getting into a positive response from the investors and in the crypto community is an advantage. Small or big conference, not well-known or a well-know one, if it will help the project gain more popularity and can gain more people trust towards the project, then it's not a problem at all. The conference won't make any sense if ordinary people from the street are invited to it, it is important to understand it. That the project has somehow promoted, there have to be qualified specialists. Quite right.

The company’s goal is to use capital raised in the sale to scale their AI-powered blockchain platform and provide the entire retail industry with a much-needed digital overhaul.  Due to antiquated, analog-based systems still used in product ordering, shipping, and inventory management, retailers lose more than $400 billion each year. This also causes overstocking or under stocking, as many stores fail in their efforts to manage inventory based on customer demand. Supermarkets and grocery store chains lose an additional $100 billion annually when high volumes of unsold perishable foods pass their expiration dates and are discarded.  OSA DC’s data and retail experts are dedicated to bringing order to the industry’s chaos by leveraging their AI, blockchain and smart contract technology. This will ensure that every bit of data generated by manufacturers, farmers, shipping companies, or grocery stores on a retailer’s supply chain is tracked by everyone else. Because of the transparent and incorruptible technical characteristics of a distributed ledger system that defines blockchain technology, OSA is confident there will be greater trust between retailers and their partners and product waste will be eliminated....",False

This is another form of achievement of the team which I think it will probably can increased the number of investors who wanted to join in their project. Totally taking part in this type of conferences help the project attract more followers in investors which help them maximize their audience hence making the project successful. It depends still of course and on quality of this conference and the most important in what country it occurs. If the conference has no due degree of the organization, then from her it is a little sense. Totally agreed, but I'm assuming they might have been to a good conference hence the confidence in sharing the new with investors and users. It is obviously of no use if the conference is not of good quality or not attended by many people.   It doesn't matter if what quality of conference that the team attended as long as its brings the same objectives and vision of this project then it would be a great opportunity. The point is that they are taking into some alternative moves and ideas that somehow it could help in the progression of this project. And by this structure the chances of getting into a positive response from the investors and in the crypto community is an advantage. Small or big conference, not well-known or a well-know one, if it will help the project gain more popularity and can gain more people trust towards the project, then it's not a problem at all. The conference won't make any sense if ordinary people from the street are invited to it, it is important to understand it. That the project has somehow promoted, there have to be qualified specialists.  That is a good point. Lucky for you the d10e event in Tokyo is one of the biggest (the leading) conferences on decentralization & there was an amazing audience! Please, read this post to learn more",False

With OSA DC platform, our smartphone will instantly tell us which products fit we demand and it might even give us a coupon or sale-off. Yes, it does. I wish they can give a notification in our smartphone so I don't have to open the application for finding a coupon or discount of a product.  Hi there! Great suggestions, and I will forward it to the team. OSA DC is mainly focused on Retailers. However, the platform will also make its product data available to consumers in an easy-to-use format. For example, with product and store performance ratings, helping consumers to make intelligent and conscious purchasing decisions while the platform will also help to: 1. save consumers money 2. save consumers time 3. stay healthy by avoiding unhealthy and hazardous foods and leading healthy lifestyle  It's very exciting and I highly recommend you to read page 11 and 45 of the WHITEPAPER to learn more about all opportunities and available resources for consumers  Quote from: Hodlvcl on May 05, 2018, 06:12:54 PM Quote from: zevl194 on May 04, 2018, 07:37:17 PM Quote from: player1001101001 on May 03, 2018, 07:08:23 PM Quote from: Dejech19 on May 03, 2018, 03:23:29 PM Quote from: Junralz on May 03, 2018, 02:01:41 PM Quote from: regalis on May 03, 2018, 11:03:37 AM Quote from: fromkrec on May 03, 2018, 09:01:14 AM It's nice to see how you care and develop your project. To date, the Osa project is a young, but very promising project. If the development team follows their road map, then the project will definitely be on the moon.  Exactly, hopefully this project will provide the best of luck to all individuals who constitute an extra effort in making this project become known to the community and investors. Im very much proud to the people who shared their resources and information in becoming this platform comes into reality.  Well, having a good community can really produce a good outcome especially being active to their clients. This Ann thread seems to be so useful because some of their concerns can contribute to the development of the platform. Yeah, I  actually have a great feeling that this project is something new and exciting, this project helps small and large businesses to evaluate  easly the needs and wants of the customers and clients in specific time  frames,no need for surveys of which product really customer usually  used or need.In customers side it helps for easy and fast way to get some great deals and offers, healthy wise is one of clients concerns.So I think this project has a lot of good services to give and this might one of the best projects that the market members are looking forward.   Yes, I completely agree with your opinion on this project. A project like this will make a great revolution in the retail industry. OSA DC wants to make the retailer more digital and they should implement this project for expanding their business. So in this ico their are very high chances to becoming successful. so making investment here can help you to generate good amount of profit after a certain time later. It will be very difficult to be made, but, in principle, it is possible. It will become a difficult task just because most of agents on about property sale aren't familiar with technologies of the future, in particular with cryptocurrencies per se at all.  I agree with you, it is difficult for ordinary investors to fully understand the idea of this ICO project because not everyone has knowledge of the retail industry and the needs of retail software.  Thank you for the feedback, I can imagine it might be difficult to understand at first. A video is being made that will explain it in easier words.

Earlier, a competitor comparison chart was asked, I've forwarded the suggestion to the team earlier & as soon as this is available I'll share it with you.

Exactly, hopefully this project will provide the best of luck to all individuals who constitute an extra effort in making this project become known to the community and investors.

Well, having a good community can really produce a good outcome especially being active to their clients. This Ann thread seems to be so useful because some of their concerns can contribute to the development of the platform. Yeah, I  actually have a great feeling that this project is something new and exciting, this project helps small and large businesses to evaluate  easly the needs and wants of the customers and clients in specific time  frames,no need for surveys of which product really customer usually  used or need.In customers side it helps for easy and fast way to get some great deals and offers, healthy wise is one of clients concerns.So I think this project has a lot of good services to give and this might one of the best projects that the market members are looking forward.   Yes, I completely agree with your opinion on this project. A project like this will make a great revolution in the retail industry. OSA DC wants to make the retailer more digital and they should implement this project for expanding their business. So in this ico their are very high chances to becoming successful. so making investment here can help you to generate good amount of profit after a certain time later. It will be very difficult to be made, but, in principle, it is possible. It will become a difficult task just because most of agents on about property sale aren't familiar with technologies of the future, in particular with cryptocurrencies per se at all.  That is correct, the good thing is that OSA DC is already working with some very big names! Danone, Coca Cola, Mars, L'Oréal, Pepsico, I'm sure you've heard of all these names and these are just a few examples. The OSA Hybrid platform has already proven itself, and now it is time for blockchain to support that vision and help it grow. If you have specific questions regarding this, please let me know and I will happily try to answer them for you!",False

It would be great for users to have multiple platforms for the same tasks but this increases the competition for developers  There's nothing wrong with several platforms having the same feautres. What it's matter is how each team convinced the possible investors to invest on their project.

They easily reached softcap because the founders have already contributed $4.2MLN USD. If this is real information, then I am very glad that this team is beginning to actively develop its project, and at the same time such a large amount of investment has been collected! So investors saw in the project, then it will be profitable! Really? I'm too happy to see the news about the $4.2MLN USD that have successfully reached, I hope they won't be steal the money because $4.2 MLN is really big amounts.  They claim to have raised $4.2MLN USD but they have not given a proof of funds maybe something like a signed message from an address with that much amount Yes even i would like to wait for some kind of signed messege or the contract address or anything similar. This project can actually be of huge profits ahead and it needs to proove itself about it.  Hi there, as you can imagine the full 4.2MLN USD wouldn't be available anymore, as OSA DC already started in 2015. So, there already has been a lot of money spent on development. For example, the beta already started October 2015! OSA decentralized is built on the already proven OSA Hybrid Platform, which already provides daily services to over 20 retailers and manufacturers  Now it is clearly being explained that this values were already been used for the continuation of the project. So, with that amount I think the team has a better workplace environment and has all the tools needed to developed more about their platform.  Maybe that kind of explanation you will believe that, in this project it has big amount excess. As this platfotm work, they can encourage an investor as they start at 2015 its a long time of experience and knowledge in this kind of work project. No doubt that these project will show up in the market.  Hi there, I understand your point of view. As you can see the funds generated from the token sale will be used for the following things, as stated on the website: Product catalogue and image recognition development, Core product development, R&D, Business development, Team salary and advisor fees, Marketing and promotion. There is still a lot to be developed and done as you can imagine. Besides that, OSA DC will be used within this.",False

Judging by the website, 1 million dollars? Or 1.5? It would be desirable to learn the answer from developers. Also there is such question why there is no information for what period of time soft cap, and in general has been built, can these figures are simply drawn? Thanks for the answer.  To get back to this, the soft cap was $1,800,000 delivered by contributors, funds & angels. Additionally to that, the founders invested this $4,200,000. Quote That's really a big investment coming from the founders for a project they want to be successful. What angels are you referring? Never heard about that one in any blockchain projects.  Angel investors are people who invest in (small) startups/IPOs and this case ICO, or entrepreneurs & is usually a one-time big investment.

In general for logistic companies there is a lot of benefits with OSA DC, for example: better inventory/warehouse planning, closer integration with vendor's delivery and retail monitoring systems, and other benefits (page 8 whitepaper). So, in that case if you mean instead a better way of communicating between retailer and logistic companies regarding stock/inventory, then yes that is right!",False

The big brands that they stated to be on board are already more than enough to make this platform a reality. Aside from the advisors and team members with their corresponding expertise. So I'm curious how this is going to be in a couple of months or maybe this 2018?  Great question, and appreciate the support. If you're really interested, check out the roadmap at https://osadc.io/en/#roadmap-group  Quote from: zevl194 on April 15, 2018, 08:54:28 PM Quote from: ace09 on April 15, 2018, 07:12:22 AM The team seems really working hard for this project to become more known in the community of crypto currency. But I think this will become more popular if they have their airdrops. More people will be glad if the team will have its airdrop in the community. And is there any bounty camapigns of the OSA DC? I would really glad if the team have it for OSA DC.  I like a step of developers that tokens which are intended to them and all whole team, will be frozen for the term of 12 months, after the termination ICO. It means that developers have no purpose at once to be enriched, they want to develop the project really.  Read my reply above Feel free to join in as well, great suggestions & as you can see in the token allocation there is 2% tokens reserved for a bounty campaign.

Looking forward to see, how it will work, nice idea, hope that realization will also be cool! I have a question like that do OSA DC will have corporate with some company look like Amazon, Ebay? Or they will developing their own retailer system with some partners products?  Great question! As you can see OSA DC is working on partnerships with very big retailers. OSA DC technology and AI will benefit towards a more efficient retail system, you can read a lot about it on page 8 of the whitepaper.  Some examples of benefits for retailers named in the whitepaper are: Less out-of-stock inventory,more sales, Increased shopper loyalty, less shopper switch-out, and increased customer volume, Cost optimization, GMROII (Gross Margin Return on Inventory Investment) improvement, A trustful shopping environment built on reliable data sharing and transparent product information, Competitive advantages over other retail chains by providing vendors with state-of-the-art monitoring solutions.  Basically if you look at it generally speaking, it already changes their retail system towards a whole new level!

Also there is such question why there is no information for what period of time soft cap, and in general has been built, can these figures are simply drawn? Thanks for the answer.

If there are more questions let us know, we will be answering all questions, every day! Sorry for waiting.     Hi Bixbem90! I would love to help you regarding exchanges. However, at this point there is no available information regarding this. Co-Founder Alex did share a post on the second of April on Telegram: ''Met the CoinNest, the 5th largest exchange in Korea. Guys are creating the incubator. We found Lots of opportunities for collaboration. To be continued...'.  Quote from: coinswebid on April 13, 2018, 02:37:06 AM i read about this, and i want a little explanations   Soft Cap ETH/USD: Already achieved how much funds as the soft cap collected ? and where this funds coming from ? is this funds come from the founders,? Quote  The founders have already contributed $4.2MLN USD towards the development and deployment of the platform.  Hi coinswebid, Right! The founders have already contributed 4.2MLN USD towards the development and deployment of the platform, giving OSA DC a great start! I will look with the team to confirm this for you You can already join the whitelist for the public pre sale right now, at http://osadc.io  Quote from: fromkrec on April 13, 2018, 08:40:05 AM Quote from: dolcevita99 on April 13, 2018, 07:47:52 AM The project has just started its work, but I see support already. The idea of the project is magnificent and very interesting! The combination of the two technologies and at the same time it will be useful for us. Popularity in the scope of the Blockchain is growing, so we will see in the near future a good growth of the Crypto-currency. in fact, the exchange rate has already started to rise slowly. And in connection with these, I had a question, is not this a large amount for investing - 1 eth per token?  Thank you for the support, and the minimum amount to participate was set by the team. We have no influence on this, but as you can see, the hardcap is $80,000,000, in which 1 ETH is not a lot. 1 ETH min. should make participation available for a lot of interested members  Quote from: Hodlvcl on April 13, 2018, 08:48:16 AM I understand that this is a project to collect data from retailers, manufacturers, consumers, and then what do you do with the amount of data collected?   Great questions. There is a lot that can be done with the collected data, and you can learn a lot more in the whitepaper (https://osadc.io/assets/files/white-paper/white-paper-osadc-en.pdf). For example, it can be used for forecasting. ''Typically, enterprise forecasting systems are focused on distribution centers to warehouses to retail store chain. The purpose of the forecast is to avoid overstocking and ensure appropriate restocking, the forecasting period can vary from one day to several weeks.  OSA is not limited to providing stock replenishment forecasts. Our in-store help customers to better understand their current situation, whether in real-time or within the fastest data collection interval a client’s IT infrastructure can provide. OSA’s instore analysis helps to proactively solve any issues and detect their root causes (e.g., price tag missing, product packaging damaged, expiration date issue). We also provide product to make sure that alerts not only arrive to clients, but that the problems receive due and timely attention from the store’s employees.''

Like the idea itself, as it spreads retailing horizons. But wanted to ask some questions - how many companies you want to involve in that and have you already had some kind of partnerships with some retailers? I hope so. But, don't expect they had some kind of partnerships with a big industry like Google or Amazon, this is just a small company perhaps.   You can read a lot about the partnerships in our whitepaper (https://osadc.io/assets/files/white-paper/white-paper-osadc-en.pdf) Here is some examples from the road map: 2015: Partnerships with L'Oreal, Efes, JTI to implement OSA Hybrid Platform 2016: Partnership with Coca-Cola, Danone to implement OSA Hybrid Platform 2017:Partnerships with Mars and SunInBev to implement OSA Hybrid Platform, Partnership with Neuromation, Partnership with DLA Piper for business support in the USA, OSA Hybrid Platform partners and integrates with 10 retail chains and 12 manufacturers  Quote from: Arvilaine on April 14, 2018, 01:55:18 PM There has been a lot of AI built to help Retailers and Consumers to make it easier for them to get the good that they need, can you create a comparison chart that will be able to differentiate this project from those projects or maybe make it more competitive?
