Existing solutions like printouts, offline storage in USB sticks, or simply keeping the private keys on computers are neither secure, reliable, nor do they scale for institutional applications.  Founded in 2014, Securosys is extending the functionality of its Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for secure storage, access, and use of private keys for crypto assets and blockchain systems. Financial institutions like banks, exchanges, and brokerage firms are in desperate need of a secure enterprise-grade solution to manage cryptocurrencies.  Moreover, Securosys will develop secure computing platforms and key management systems needed for distributed ledger technology. Securosys will also expand internationally to serve and support customers locally all over the world. Blockchain and cryptocurrency specific products: Blockchain and Crypto-Assets HSM, Trusted Execution Platform HSM, Securosys Clouds HSM, Key Management Server HSM.  Securosys is an award-winning company                 2017: SEF.High-Potential quality label granted by Swiss Economic Forum 2016: Finalist for the high-tech innovation award at the Swiss Economic Forum in Interlaken    2016: Winner of Red Herring Europe Top-100 Award     SECUROSYS ITO  The Securosys SET token  Securosys will issue the Securosys Token (SET) as a security token. The following gives an overview, including token distribution, profit sharing, and conversion mechanism.  Name: Securosys Token  Ticker: SET  Price per token: CHF 5.00 (or equivalent)  Token type: ERC20  Token purpose: SET tokens can be converted into shares. The conversion rate is 100 tokens to one Securosys share of CHF 1.00 nominal value. The tokens entitle to an annual dividend-linked participation per token when the company issues a dividend.The dividend-linked participation is a cash payment by Securosys in CHF, tokens, or Ether. The amount of participation per token equals 1% of the amount dividend paid per Securosys share.  Hard cap: 3’049’345 SET Token  Pre-money valuation: CHF 49’259’350 (accounting for discounts)  Participation options: Bitcoin, Ether, and Fiat (CHF, €, $) via bank wire.  ITO timeframe: 6.11.2018–7.12.2018  Ticket sizes, discounts and lockup periods    Token distribution and use of proceeds       Dividend sharing  25% dividends are distributed to the token holders    Mechanism Every year after receiving the audit report and checking the general financial health of the company, the Securosys board makes a decision on paying out dividends. The general assembly has to approve the proposal, then approved dividends are paid out to share and token holders. Note that Securosys just entered the second year of profitability, but has not paid out dividends in the four years of existence.  25% of the dividends paid to shareholders are distributed to the token holders. The 25% corresponds to the 25% of shares represented by the SET tokens. The dividends are paid out via smart contract in ETH or SET tokens with the rate CHF/ETH calculated at the date of payout. If dividends are paid out in SET tokens, they come from the company reserve or market buybacks by the company. If a subsidiary of Securosys is sold, the same procedure applies for the exit proceeds.  Requirements for dividend payouts To be eligible for the dividend distribution, the holder needs to be in possession of at least 1000 SET tokens, and they have to be registered and verified with Securosys. This is due to the Swiss tax withholding requirements.
