With interest from industries such as chia, wool, cotton, fruit and vege, our rebrand to AgriChain will be better aligned with our vision to become the largest industry-wide platform in agricultural supply chains   AgriChain will connect sellers and buyers, provide full paddock-to-plate traceability, and allow bulk logistic companies to manage and grow their operations. We have also formed strategic partnerships with a large number of food and manufacturing companies globally to set up proof of concepts for widespread adoption.  But most importantly, AgriChain will bring value back to farms by enabling transparent and trackable products, reduce risks, and increase sales with technology-powered trust.  With this, we are very excited to be transitioning to our new identity AgriChain, and we would like to thank our community in the agriculture, blockchain, and technology sphere.

They end up dumping the coin as soon as there is an exchange listing.  In fact, I know of only one ICO in recent times that has not done this.

BlockGrain helps extract maximum value at all stages of the supply chain - saving you time, reducing costs and increasing efficiency and accountability.         About BlockGrain BlockGrain is a simple-to-use, secure, independent software solution that automates the sharing of information across all major commodity supply chain participants.  BlockGrain’s vision is to be the largest industry-wide platform for managing the agricultural supply chain; connecting sellers and buyers, providing full paddock-to-plate traceability and allowing bulk logistics companies to manage and grow their operations.  BlockGrain is the culmination of two years of design, development, testing, and refinement. BlockGrain 1.0 has been used in the industry for two harvests, enabling users to manage and control their stock. With the upcoming release of BlockGrain 2.0, an enhanced set of product features will expand BlockGrain’s presence in the Australian domestic market and provide a real-world solution to improve the agricultural supply chain. To expand the system globally, BlockGrain will leverage the power of blockchain technology to enhance supply chain tracking and automation, improve information and data, de-risk contracts and provide proof of origin information  Ask the team questions and get answers instantly!

BlockGrain supports traditional, well-established agricultural supply chains with a dynamic and seamless software solution. By enabling one-to- one global trade, BlockGrain encourages farmers and their supporting businesses to connect with buyers to develop and grow their own supply chains. BlockGrain aims to make a positive impact on the global agricultural sector and society as a whole. With the development of blockchain technology, BlockGrain has an innovative digital approach and the required industry knowledge to distribute a greater proportion of value to the farmers and the critical businesses that support them. As more farmers move to home storage and away from bulk handlers, BlockGrain can support the needs of the industry. By harnessing blockchain technology, farmers can sell their product directly from their home storage systems to domestic or international buyers in a safe, low-risk environment.  Supported by the expansion of the global produce containerisation market, BlockGrain enables farmers to build their own global supply chains and export their commodities directly. BlockGrain helps smaller farmers build networks to form farmer- owned cooperatives, which is particularly relevant in developing economies. Coupled with BlockGrain’s logistics platform and global marketplace, farmers across the world can enjoy the benefits of direct market access.  BlockGrain connects:  • Farmers • Farmer representatives (brokers) • Trucking and logistics companies • Logistics brokers • Buyers of agricultural products • Manufacturers requiring agricultural products (dairies, flour mills, breweries, etc) • Smaller farming cooperatives • Suppliers of agricultural inputs (chemicals, fertilisers, etc) • Importers and exporters of bulk commodities • Customers and end users.",False
