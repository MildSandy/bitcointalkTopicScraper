According to the World Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), in 2050 the total population is expected to grow by 34% to about 9.7 billion, and the elderly population aged 60 or older by 56% to about 200 million. It is a reality that there lacks sufficient supply of food to feed the rapidly expanding population, especially in terms of animal protein supply. In view of this, ATFS has established a plan for Smart Farm 2.0, an intelligent farm with deep learning ability to ensure breakthrough productivity, and research & development of Plant-Based Meat varieties in Asian cuisine.  In addition, the current agricultural distribution system is a collection of high-cost inefficiencies caused by too many middlemen that takes away the benefits from producers and consumers.  Their Disruptive Decentralized Platform based on the blockchain technology sets a new standard of agricultural distribution. The DDP’s new type of food blockchains stores the product’s place of origin, producer, region and transactional movements, enabling rewards for producers with higher transparency and consumers to traceable and verified information....",False

First off, we are basing our primary operations of Smart Farm 2.0 and R&D center for our plant-based meat product variety in South Korea.  Plant-based meat is meat that is comprised of plant proteins. It is one of three types of meat: animal, lab and plant. If you read our white paper (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TIL2Hs9zHGVkKOYiB5DouHWdXdNpMxvt/view), you would see that we explain the different types of proteins and scenarios. I know, our white paper is pretty long. Page 35 onwards talk of plant-based meat in detail.  What we state about the impending food crisis is true. The way we have cultivated and have produced animal meat is not sustainable. CAFO is not the way we should produce our meat. Our livestock consumes grain which consumes land which would be more useful not go to our livestock but to our growing population. The world has never had such a large population that has the economic ability to consume food and not just food that we grow locally, but food that may travel all over the world due to globalization.  We do not make our products to convert the ways of the public, or to promote everyone going vegan. We want to wake people to make one more conscious choice as an individual so that slowly but surely, we could use the technology that we had never had to make drastic changes to our current systems.  Hope this clears up some of your thoughts! I am from the ATFS team.. and would love to talk to you more if need be!

However, since it's based on a larger-scale business model, we consider it more of an asset-backed token.  Generally, platform companies use most of the funds procured through an ICO as expense, and the value of the token in the cryptocurrency market is likely to decline if the development is delayed or the platform is not mainstream commercialized. However, for ATFS, we are using our funds (~40% of crowdfunding) to establish Smart Farm 2.0 by buying land and facilities which are assets. Land does not depreciate but would contribute to the increase in ATFS asset value through the land price increase. In regards to our facilities, the depreciation will be reflected slowly over 20 years, and therefore is more capital than an expense.",False

LOL, no, blockchains will not water our farms, haha. Actually only our DDP is based on blockchain technology. We want to revolutionize the current food systems by creating a new type of food blockchain. You see, we usually buy our produce depending on its label and price. But do we know if the organic avocados came from an organic avocado seed or maybe just the way of farming was organic?  So this is where food blockchains come into play. What if we could store all of this information and it also stores all transactional movements? The consumers would know why they are paying a premium and the producers who are more transparent may charge a higher premium. This would add benefits to the two ends of the agricultural distribution chain who are not seeing the benefits in the current system due to too many middlemen.

Also, our business model combines existing industry with ICT and blockchain technology and is a part of Industry 4.0. Therefore, we thought crowdfunding in the crypto world is a natural fit.  An important feature of an ICO that prompted us is how we would be assessed personally by individuals all around the world unlike venture funds or IPO’s that are funded only by large institutional investors. This aspect is quite inspiring as this is aligned with our vision of contributing to a better world together.  Old habits die hard.

I didnt get satify with your explanation that in the near future bcs of increasing population we are not going to have enough animal based protein.
