We are still working with attorneys and investment bankers to get the structure exactly right, but the way it works is (this is just an example) we set a price of $100 to start a TIF. Let's say that TIF has 10 holdings, so $10 worth of 10 different coins/tokens. If 5 of those tokens rise by 100% and the other 5 stay the same, the TIF would increase in value by 50%, thereby priced at $150. It simplfies the process for investors who want exposure but don't know how. And like I said, our work with TIFs is more of a bonus, not really tied to our core business. We are doing it because we have an established user base of financial institutions and finance professionals who want easy access to crypto, and need a way to do it. The trick is going to be letting those components of the TIF have actual usage.  HADE will be included in just about all TIFs to some degree, and we plan to have a lot. We may have a TIF of coins/tokens that raised more than $50 million in their ICOs (mainstream), and another of components that raised less than $10 million (under the radar), and then we may have others that primarily the big names like Ether, Litecoin, or Ripple.  In regards to HADE, it will be used as both a component and also for transaction fees among other things. There is a good chance we will have to do our own blockchain protocol, but those are questions we are answering right now.",False

WEBSITE WHITE PAPER FACEBOOK TWITTER TELEGRAM MEDIUM HADE PLATFORM    What is HADE Token?  The HADE platform is an artificial intelligence platform SaaS platform for financial services and investment. The HADE token is a brainchild of the HADE platform. The HADE token is an ERC 20 token that is a tokenized representation of the tokenized investment funds, or TIFs run by the HADE Platform. This combines the security and confidentiality of blockchain technology with the financial services of a tokenized investment fund.  In the conventional investment markets, Companies like BlackRock with iShares and Vanguard have amassed trillions of dollars in assets under management by creating single investment products that give investors exposure to many stocks, also called ETFs. Many investors prefer ETFs for their diversification and increased safety profile vs owning just one stock.  The HADE platform seeks to bring such investment products for the cryptocurrencies markets through the TIFs. Unlike the conventional investment cryptocurrencies are somewhat restricted to trading and speculation. This is easy for the seasoned investors who can read the market. However, it locks out the vast majority of investors who do not have the skills or the time to read the markets. The future is the adoption of tokenized investment funds where investors can let experienced professionals invest the money on their behalf.  The HADE platfrom addresses this issue in two ways: i.   The Hade token will be used to license the technology that will facilitate the hosting and creation of the TIFs by investment managers. The technology will be sold on the Hade platform, and the only way to acquire it is using the Hade token. ii.   There will be additional TIFs made from other ERC20 tokens that will be sold on the Hade platform. Both types of TIFs will be available on other exchanges.    The team at HADE Technologies believe that tokenized investment funds, or TIFs, will completely change the crypto investment market as we know it. The team also believes that TIFs coupled with a simple buying process will result in record inflows of money to the crypto space. A single TIF could give an investor exposure to dozens of cryptocurrencies with one single product. Furthermore, the team believes TIFs could give owners access to the collective uses of each cryptocurrency held in a fund, thereby allowing a single TIF to serve the same functions as its components.  HADE TOKEN ICO  The HADE Token sales runs through to January 26 2018. Soft cap of $5 million already reached. Join and participate in the ICO to help the next generation Bloomberg with annual revenue of $6 million reach their Hard Cap.
