Majority of their volume is in Binance, so that would have a negative impact if they will be delisted.  At its price now, it will certainly loss the confidence of the investors, but some will take this as an opportunity as if they can prove that they are not scam, price will easily pump up again.

Their admins ban people on their telegram for asking uncomfortable questions, which reputable company does that??? what are they hiding? They were doing it on reddit too but the reddit admin (who is not affiliated with dead wireless) got pissed off and banned their admins so they made another ""official"" (i.e. censored) page called just dent instead of dentcoin. Only dishonest people that have something to hide use censorship techniques to manipulate the masses like that.  - ""18 million users have entered the DENT project"" - more like 18 hundred users. have you checked the activations on dent.exchange? the actual volume is no more than 20 to 30,000 dollars daily combined for all the countries. most of the volume on dent.exchange is fake so is on binance and the rest of the exchanges, someone (i.e. Dead Wireless Ltd) is buying up and dumping his own shares simulating activity to pump up the volumes and rob unsuspecting investors (I felt for their manipulations too I bought at a top right before they dumped), the real daily volume on binance is also no more than 20-30,000 dollars, except for the days when devs dump billions. LATOKEN is doing fake volumes for many months in a row I reported them to CMC but they don't seem to give a fuk they are the same crooks as Dead Wireless LTD.",True

When you install the Dent app and set up your account by registering your phone number you get a certain amount of Dent. And the number of application downloads must be real as it's recorded as 1 million plus in a number of countries on play store. If we assume that just say 50% of those people who downloaded Dent go on to actually open the app and register with their mobile number then you are definitely going to have over a few million holders - because you get free Dent so it's going to be the in the holder list. As the number of holders is only 25k this suggests the rule of 1 holder = 1 user is wrong. A holder is a unique wallet address right? That means the app can't be a wallet. When you register your phone number that account falls under an umbrella wallet - just like exchanges use. So one of the holders could contain a million plus users.

They sold ~10% of the tokens in ICO and had 90% on their hands, they paid 5kk USD to list DENT on Binance to have liquidity so they could dump large sums. Note that they paid 5kk in tokens, because they didn't raised much more than this in ICO. They are basically printing money.  You can check their dumps on etherscan in real time, 16bi in the last 30 days.. You can track the tx too, they all go to exchanges, most of them to Binance.

Manipulation is illegal in most cases. These false order techniques are often combined with the spreading of false information through online channels and message boards that other investors may frequent. The outside barrage of bad information combines with seemingly legitimate market signals to encourage traders to pile on or off a trade. The pump and dump is the most frequently used manipulation to artificially inflate a micro cap stock and then sell out leaving later followers to hold the bag.""  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/061205.asp   How Does a Pump and Dump Scam Work?  ""A pump and dump scam is the illegal act of an investor or group of investors promoting a stock they hold and selling once the stock price has risen following the surge in interest as a result of the endorsement. The stock is usually promoted as a ""hot tip"" or ""the next big thing"" with details of an upcoming news announcement that will ""send the stock through the roof."" The details of each individual pump and dump scam tend to be different but the scheme always boils down to a basic principal: shifting supply and demand. Pump and dump scams tend to only work on small and micro-cap stocks that are traded over the counter. These companies tend to be highly illiquid and can have sharp price movements when volume increases. The group behind the scam increases the demand and trading volume in the stock and this new inflow of investors leads to a sharp rise in its price. Once the price rise has formulated, the group will sell their position to make a large short-term gain.""",True

Mikko said that they cover the expenses from the premium the people pay by buying dents from the app and the business is already on profit so I ask where does the cash goes from all the massive amounts of dents they dump on binance every day? In my estimation in the last 1 year they must have collected at least $100,000,000 in cash, where do these money go I assume in the devs pockets. There is no other explanation. Regarding this bullshit saying that they must distribute all of the tokens for the ecosystem to work, they certainly don't need all the 100 billion dents in circulation, they could easily burn at least half of them, BTC works with only 21 million in circulation and look how many people are using it. It could work with 100 billion or 100 million, it doesn't make any difference. To mint 100 billion tokens and keep 90% of them for yourself speaks of greed, especially when you make the app users buy it from you only and at the same time you dump heavily on binance screwing us all investors. Devs want the users to buy tokens from them only, if they wanted they could have easily integrated an binance api so that people buy from an exchange. There is zero crypto community interest in this token there is only one person here defending them who actuaally works for them on payroll hiding behind different nicknames - agro465, studio1one, Mdfost87, this is actually this nazi InfiniteTeach who bans people on their official telegram for asking uncomfortable but important questions. 7 months ago I said ""who dumps now?"" because I saw that the devs are dumping from their main account and 5 seconds later I was banned I swear this is exactly what happened I was banned for 3 words I didn't insult anyone, there are a lot of other people being banned the same way.

Dent price was once again capped. Would you please inform us do you intend to do this exercise until all of the remaining 70 billion tokens get distributed or you intend to stop at some time and let the market breathe and develop naturally? You are lower than a banker at least they have the dignity to announce publicly a price peg. With this rate it will take you 5 more years to distribute all. I guess in 2025 we can expect the price to rise again. For the newcomers let me tell you the price of Dent token is pegged to $0.0011.

Facts are as follow: the afterburner DID NOT come operational as promised for Q4 2018, the exchange IS USELESS since it is opened to countries which are NOT eligible to install the dent app, this is demo version to show to potential partners. Dent is running on private chain on servers owned by the company, it has nothing to do with Ethereum chain except using an ERC20 token to fund it, so are the wallets and the transactions that do not show anywhere in etherscan. When do you intend to go live on the ETH chain, you said this was temporary just to test the product and you'll go live soon (this was 1 year ago)? Right now you control everything you can reverse transactions and delete wallets, no wonder the crypto community doesn't give a fuck about dent, this is not a blockchain project this is corporation, the only difference is the shareholders don't receive dividends except a bat in the head from the company's market maker who keeps on building enormous sell walls preventing the price from going above $0.0012. For some reason he seems to like dent cheap, instead of leaving it to grow naturally so he could sell less amount for the same money (which will affect price as little as possible), he is distributing by building unbreakable offer walls on exchanges. There are more intelligent ways to distribute without killing the price of your token, there's OTC (over the counter).

This is not traditional investing where you get dividends for holding a company shares and those shares appreciate in value if the company is successful, dent tokens can go down to 1 sat and nothing will change. Demand means nothing if the company hold 90% of total supply. There's something wrong with their model, it is not designed to favor us, holders of tokens. They sell tokens to users, then buy these same tokens from telcos and sell them again to users. It's like a perpeto mobile, I remember very well Mikko said one year ago on telegram that the tokens in circulation will depreciate over time ( the tokens the telcos receive for data will be burned and not get back in circulation again) but that was obviously a lie I'm sorry I didn't make a snapshot then, this was the only reason I didn't sell my tokens at the highs, I should have listened to my gut feeling it was too good to be true.

I’m not certain how it will work out value wise for the token, I’d like to think the more people you have using the app and holding some coin, the more valuable each token woulf need to be, that’s my thought just my opinion. And I’m sure everyone wish they dumped at ATH but hind sight is 20/20 luckily for me I don’t need to value to hit even close to that again for me to get back what I have in, but I’m not selling for a loss I do see an actual working product so I’m willing to ride this out to see where we end up.

Dent should be valued at least 1000 times more! Wow! Now seriously, perhaps you could impress the homeless guy outside with this number. The fact is that this volume comes from the people selling their 20 000 free dents. There is zero demand for dents on the exchanges simply because it's a scam project and we are all left holding a bunch of useless crappy tokens while devs sell their reserves in both the app and exchanges too. It turns out there is no dent exchange - it was promised for Q4 then they promised beginning of December. Also it turns out the users of only one mobile operator can sell their unused data which was the whole point of this app in the beginning. Devs lied to us all they were swearing that the tokens used to buy data in the app will be burned and the tokens in circulation will decrease over time, they told us the tokens in the app will be twice more expensive than tokens in exchanges so people will be forced to buy off exchanges and price will go up. Lies lies lies... That's not how you do business. The way I see things they are trying to sell as much tokens in the app as they can because they are personally making profits out of the commissions of every dent sold. If it depends on them they will never release the exchange - their cash cow will die, right now they are the only seller and they are selling big no wonder prices have been crashing - they own 90% of total supply and it will take them 8 years to unload it all which means 8 years of crashing prices. No matter how many gazillion users they have in the app the supply will outnumber the demand since they're the one controlling the supply and they are greedy to sell more and more.",True

I dispute this reasoning. They hold millions of USD worth of ETH and Binance has recently gone on record rebutting claims of requiring millions of dollars to be listed on their exchange. Even if Binance did require it, thats an appalling use of funds considering the listing has done nothing but provide more buyers for the devs to dump on by their own admission and reducing the portfolio value of everyone who showed faith in this team. The overriding duty of a company is to maximize profit for their shareholders - NOT themselves at the expense of the shareholders. They have shown their true intentions - to generate as much wealth for themselves as possible while the rest of us stare at 80-90% losses or more in some cases. That's not how you encourage or incentivise people to invest and they are dreaming if they think anyone will hand over more money to them for their worthless DENT tokens when they have now proven it is their mission to dump the price and extract as much revenue from buyers as possible. Back in the day we used to rip apart these 'dev pre-mine' scams but it seems to be trend now to worship the developers even as they cash out on the backs of those who handed over money in good faith. If they said at the start 'Hand over your BTC for DENT and we will drop the price 90% over the coming year and the only person making any cash on this transaction will be us' - I guarantee you no one would invest and if they say they would on that statement then they are a damned liar.",True

All that being listed on Binance has accomplished was that EVEN MORE dumping of DENT as visible by the charts themselves has taken place vs. the period before the listing. That's completely irrefutable. Dumping has ramped up and buying has dried up and any fool can read the charts pre and post listing and see it for themselves. When combined with the fact that the Dev controlled wallets have been sending billions of coins to Kucoin and Binance since at least April and probably January if we are realistic here - it paints a damning picture. If the coin was truly used by 3 million people and just the best thing since sliced bread why the fuck can they not get more than 100 likes on their twitter posts or more than a handful of people in their telegram room ACTUALLY using it. Shit, they just announced today that - suprprise! - there's actually 70% more coins in circulation than was made known on Coinmarketcap - so for all intents and purposes the price is even more likely to fall as perception is everything and regardless of how long those coins have been in circulation - as far as Joe Bloggs is concerned the coin just became 70% less scarce and has plenty of room to dump probably down to 10 Sat again now that the devs have shown their hand as dumping their 90% premine.",True

Every single person save those who bought the fucking ICO is out of pocket. Its down 97.6% for the year to date. It's not a bear market - it's a scam, a means for the devs with 90% of the tokens obtained for nothing to rip us off and take our bitcoin on the promise that they aren't actually selling anything (despite the blockchain clearly showing transactions of 100s of millions of DENT to Binance and Kucoin wallets) and will 'keep working hard'. If a 97.6% drop in value is what happens when these guys 'work hard' I'm scared to see what it looks like when they don't.  Just face it - we got scammed by a pipe dream app and a scummy dev team who have been dumping their pre-mine since January at least. The DENT token is perhaps the most useless blockchain project yet - it literally isn't needed at all by the project it was merely a instrument to scam us out of Bitcoin so they can go and do god knows what with it - one thing we know for sure, they sure as hell haven't been 'creating value' for the shareholders with all the money they have collected by dumping the 90% pre-mine on unsuspecting users and preventing any of us from ever seeing a return on investment.",True

Looking at the daily volume of Dent (and some other tokens which I am holding), it reaches 15% of Dent's market cap and it stayed like this or was even higher for the last several days (or practically since the Binance listing). This is insane and for me very worrying. That means that the price is heavily manipulated by some. Just consider that roughly 15% of the tokens get ""different"" owner every day. Imagine the loss one would sustain over several days trading constantly. So in my opinion these entities are trading between themselves, and most likely these ""traders"" are intimately connected to the exchanges (think about all the fees that are ""wasted"" in this kind of price movement, with this kind of liquidity). I somehow doubt that this kind of movement is caused by the developers flooding market with their supply. This long-term negative trend with such a high daily volume would end much faster (or at least the volume should drop significantly over time) if there was only one entity releasing Dents onto the market.",True

How often do you need to buy mobile data? Several times a year when traveling abroad? You also forget that there are 100 billion coins and according to whitepaper, these coins can be on the market at any moment !!! I think investors are really afraid of this.  if you take into account all the coins and the current price, the capitalization would be $ 400,000,000 = 30% of BNB  capitalization  + I don't quite understand: 1) why someone need a blockchain and a coin for this project. To sold 10 % and make some money and leave 90% and the coins make more money later? i think it would be much easier to immediately buy data in app. 2) Why do they need 100 billion coins at all - most people will immediately buy data.

If you're worried with its price falling & falling, then you're doing something wrong. First of all, learn to ""swing-trade"" and ""bitcoin-cost-average"" (instead of dollar cost averaging).

DENT needs new exchanges, that's for sure. All the low-volume alt-coins which are getting most of the volume through Kucoin, are currently in a terribly-low price if compared with their ATHs (like HeroPlay, SelfKey, etc).

They will be able to easily buy/sell their unused prepaid mobile data.(problem Dent solves)  This is a world wide program so Dent token would allow someone anywhere in the world for any reason to quickly buy/sell something without having to pay penalties or wait for days for the transaction to process or worry about exchange rates etc.  Maybe someone needs a quick $10 and has nothing else but unused prepaid data to sell.  Bingo!  Problem solved Dent Wireless.  Or, someone runs out of their original data plan and needs just a few minutes to complete a project but doesn't have enough money to purchase a full plan from the carrier.  Seems like Dent would help solve that problem. Quickly!  These are just a few thoughts I had about Dent Wireless/Dent coin.   Like I said I am a complete newbie to this world and I may be far off on my opinion here.  I welcome advice and any other pros/cons arguments on Dent as well as any constructive criticism.  Thanks all!  And good luck to the Dent Wireless team!  ",True

Quote Just because user can't send in-app DENTS to crypto market doesn't mean that telcos can't. It also doesn't mean that DENTs bought in-app aren't real ERC20 tokens. They likely are. That's likely what the telcos are being paid with. My guess is that when a user buys DENTs in-app, they are given control over real DENTs and the DENT company takes that fiat from the sale and goes to replenish the sold DENT (from the 90 bil) from the markets. Depending on the daily volume of im-app buys, this could put a constant upward pressure on DENT market price. This means that in-app users are likely buying from the market (just indirectly).  Understanding this arrangement, the telcos would undoubtedly rather be paid in a token that will appreciate (almost by guarantee using the system I described above) as opposed to fiat. This could explain how/why DENT got so many big name players on board so fast.  The telcos most likely CAN send their DENT out-of-app to wallets, just not users. As to why the company is being murky on the exact design and organization of the in-app market - if they were doing something like this there would undoubtedly be criticism. Such a scheme is certain not illegal but many would say it were unethical (I don't believe so).",True

May I ask what people own when they buy Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, B2x bla bla bla? Where are those companies? Do people own a share of those companies when they buy a coin? Absolutely No! People just own a coin (Currency) & that's all!  When people own US dollar, does that mean they own a share of USA? When people trade on USD-Gold pair in Forex market, do they own real gold? Or do they think about owning a share of ""Gold"" company? Isn't it very funny when people ask if they own share of DENT company when they buy DENT tokens? Dear DENT community, please note that you are owning cryptocurrency when you buy DENT, just absolutely is as like as you own a bitcoin when you buy it.  Now let me come to the main point. People are confused about the price of both DENT (App & Crypto Exchange). First of all, DENT is a blockchain base decentralized company who has a product for real life utilization! Besides, they have their own Crypto Currency (Mind it, a currency). About 10B tokens (Fixed) are the circulating supply that can be traded through Crypto exchanges. 60B tokens are for Data exchange through mobile app. Please note that price between these two platforms aren't connected to each other at all. Price of app tokens may vary according to the market price of mobile data, which can't rise that much. But as many operators DENT will connected to, as many mobile users connected to DENT & business of DENT company can extend to many ways (such as advertising through mobile app, which is a pretty big market now a days). As we really pray & hope, DENT company will be bigger & bigger, besides the price of DENT (crypto) will go higher & higher (is as like as stock price of Google, Apple etc). Stock/Trade market is totally a different platform where price goes up depending on company's growth & trader's/investor's faith on the company.  Some people are still confused I know! Let me try to make it clear again.  What's the product BNB (Binance Coin) or KCS (Kucoin Shares) actually? Why the price of those coins grow? Do they have any product that is increasing in value? Absolutely no! They are providing services (Trading platform) to the users, number of users are increasing day by day, investors are happy to invest on their coins & that's how the value of their coins growing.  What's the current price of very first phone that Apple has launched many years ago? And what's the price of each share of Apple now? Is it necessary that product value should go higher so that the value of share can go high? Absolutely no! The most essential thing is delivering quality products, achieving the faith of large number of customers. That's how a company can be big day by day & that's why the investors invest more & more, that's how the value of shares go higher & higher. To grow the share value, it's not necessary that the product value should go higher. Same matter works for DENT. DENT just started the journey, they have a real product (already connected to some big operators), let them grow day by day. Don't compare the price of DENT tokens (App) with DENT tokens (Crypto Currency). For better understanding, please read their whitepaper very attentively.  Hope I was able to help you to understand why you shouldn't compare the price between DENT(App) & DENT(Crypto). Thanks anyway.  *** Near about after 2 hours of posting this thread, someone has sent me a private message saying that he was about to sell all of his dents (Half a million) but he didn't. It's because he found my thread, read it & felt some confidence to hold. And then within 1 & half hour dent price gained almost 25% from a deep dip. Now he is happy & wanna send me some dent as a reward for this post. I have given him my MEW address & he already sent 5000 Dents! This is the first time I have received some money as a reward! I'm honored!  I don't know if this is okay or not if I give my MEW address here for anybody like him who wanna send some dents as a reward/tip. Ummm, I'm not gonna give the real one that I use to store my assets. Please don't take it otherwise.""",True

There's been millions of dollars invested on a daily basis over the last week or two. Unless DENT is specifically buying up their own tokens with reserve Ether/Bitcoin from the ICO sale, it seems highly unlikely to me the DENT team would have anywhere close to the kind of money available to manipulate the price.  And it does no good for them to own all of their own tokens, as the whole goal of the company is to allow other people to sell their mobile data to help other people. They (the customers) would need access to the tokens to do so.  Cryptomarkets can be illiquid, and some coins price increases are due to fake pumps, no doubt about it. But DENT has managed to mostly follow their roadmap, which is pretty rare among ICOs, and they have had positive news for weeks. And trading volumes over $5,000,000 most days seems to suggest the DENT token isn't really ""illiquid"" at all. I could get on HITBTC or any of the other exchanges and sell all my DENT if I wanted to without much of a price drop.",True

It is good stuffs.  DENT: 2. The DENT EXCHANGE (Where the DENT Tokens for Mobile App and the operator Data Packahges reside)  To make the data handling and high transaction volume of payments, operator activations and that fast and efficient, we decided to run a parachain, which is connected to ETHEREUM main chain  This makes transactions faster and we dont have to pay high Gas fees for a micropayment, for example a 1 dollar purchase of data  Use case 1: An Existing DENT owner wants to top up the DENT app from his Crypto Wallet:  When you are registered in the app, we create you a ""wallet"" in the DENT Exchange  If you want to buy data, lets keep this example simple: lets say, in the USA you would want to buy a 1 GB package, and the price would be 10.000 DENT  So in the app, you have 2 options to top up your account:  1. Use Paypal to buy DENT using FIAT 2. Transfer existing DENTs and deposit them to your DENT Exchange wallet  1. is the obvious choice of the millions of mobile users that have never heard of Crypto currencies or wallets or such, they just buy ""Credits"", without knowing that there is Crypto in the background  So: in case 1: The User buys the DENT Tokens from DENT Wireless, our company, where we have roughly 89 Billion tokens stored in our wallets. 30 Billion + 60 Billion that are locked up in vaults and released to our company quartely  So released means: Not to the free market as some of you are worrying  Now, so Jose, the customer in Mexico uses his paypal to pay 10 Dollars for the 10.000 DENT tokens (or credits).  With that he can send data to anyone in the carrier network of ours, starting with AT&T, Verizon in the US, and America Movil and Telcel in Mexico  At the moment, when he purchases the data package, the 10.000 DENT get back to DENT Company account, and data is being credited to the users phone number that was the target  2. Okay, so you guys have DENTs that you have today, so you can open the app, it will show a QR Code and the DENT wallet address that the app created for you, and you can just move DENT tokens to the DENT exchange. You will be able to send data to others or top up your own, if you are on a supported carrier.  So you can use the DENTs from day one when the app is released  If we look at trhe situation from the side of the crypto currency owners (the 10B+) Tokens, the tokens that will be sent to DENT Exchange will be away from that inventory, as they have been moved away  There is no way for the mobile user to buy DENT in the mobile app and then sell them to HitBTC, so the Crypto DENTs will be less and less. DENT Company can of course move them back to the crypto market if it has a reason to.  About the release of the VAult tokens:  The 60B vault tokens will be released from the vaults to DENT company, and will be used for many purposes, salaries, bonuses, market liquidity, seeding the carrier market etc. It is not planned to ""dump"" them anywhere, as they are a real asset for the business  User Acquisition:  - It is planned that the users will receive a certain amount of DENT tokens automatically to their wallet at DENT Exchange, so they can immediately purchased data packages.  These DENTs will come from DENT company, and if we have, lets say - a million users that get 1000 DENT, yes thats a billion tokens, but remember, from the user's sight, they are just credits, not cryptocurrencies, and they can ONLY buy data with them, not move them to Crypto exchanges.  And after they buy the data, they come back to DENT Parachain circulation  Also look Into this :  https://youtu.be/WwLuoy5hVPU  A user analysis of the dent token.    The value of DENT within the DENT app will be based on the current market price from the exchanges am i right? So if that is the case, then i guess buying DENT within the app will be slightly more expensive compared to the current value in the exchanges  Not really, they created a subnetwork for the payment that is based on eth but it does not affect the crypto sold during ico.  Pretty much this is what I understood : the dent token are treated like stocks, depending on how the app goes the price will go up. But those token hodled by users will be also usable in the app and in case of extreme need once they have been transferred they can be put back in the crypto market. In the app the tokens used will not have a value outside of the app. If you buy 10.000 tokens in the app you cannot sell them back on an exchange.  This is my understanding.",True

It is good stuffs.  DENT: 2. The DENT EXCHANGE (Where the DENT Tokens for Mobile App and the operator Data Packahges reside)  To make the data handling and high transaction volume of payments, operator activations and that fast and efficient, we decided to run a parachain, which is connected to ETHEREUM main chain  This makes transactions faster and we dont have to pay high Gas fees for a micropayment, for example a 1 dollar purchase of data  Use case 1: An Existing DENT owner wants to top up the DENT app from his Crypto Wallet:  When you are registered in the app, we create you a ""wallet"" in the DENT Exchange  If you want to buy data, lets keep this example simple: lets say, in the USA you would want to buy a 1 GB package, and the price would be 10.000 DENT  So in the app, you have 2 options to top up your account:  1. Use Paypal to buy DENT using FIAT 2. Transfer existing DENTs and deposit them to your DENT Exchange wallet  1. is the obvious choice of the millions of mobile users that have never heard of Crypto currencies or wallets or such, they just buy ""Credits"", without knowing that there is Crypto in the background  So: in case 1: The User buys the DENT Tokens from DENT Wireless, our company, where we have roughly 89 Billion tokens stored in our wallets. 30 Billion + 60 Billion that are locked up in vaults and released to our company quartely  So released means: Not to the free market as some of you are worrying  Now, so Jose, the customer in Mexico uses his paypal to pay 10 Dollars for the 10.000 DENT tokens (or credits).  With that he can send data to anyone in the carrier network of ours, starting with AT&T, Verizon in the US, and America Movil and Telcel in Mexico  At the moment, when he purchases the data package, the 10.000 DENT get back to DENT Company account, and data is being credited to the users phone number that was the target  2. Okay, so you guys have DENTs that you have today, so you can open the app, it will show a QR Code and the DENT wallet address that the app created for you, and you can just move DENT tokens to the DENT exchange. You will be able to send data to others or top up your own, if you are on a supported carrier.  So you can use the DENTs from day one when the app is released  If we look at trhe situation from the side of the crypto currency owners (the 10B+) Tokens, the tokens that will be sent to DENT Exchange will be away from that inventory, as they have been moved away  There is no way for the mobile user to buy DENT in the mobile app and then sell them to HitBTC, so the Crypto DENTs will be less and less. DENT Company can of course move them back to the crypto market if it has a reason to.  About the release of the VAult tokens:  The 60B vault tokens will be released from the vaults to DENT company, and will be used for many purposes, salaries, bonuses, market liquidity, seeding the carrier market etc. It is not planned to ""dump"" them anywhere, as they are a real asset for the business  User Acquisition:  - It is planned that the users will receive a certain amount of DENT tokens automatically to their wallet at DENT Exchange, so they can immediately purchased data packages.  These DENTs will come from DENT company, and if we have, lets say - a million users that get 1000 DENT, yes thats a billion tokens, but remember, from the user's sight, they are just credits, not cryptocurrencies, and they can ONLY buy data with them, not move them to Crypto exchanges.  And after they buy the data, they come back to DENT Parachain circulation  Also look Into this :  https://youtu.be/WwLuoy5hVPU  A user analysis of the dent token.",True

Pretty much this is what I understood : the dent token are treated like stocks, depending on how the app goes the price will go up. But those token hodled by users will be also usable in the app and in case of extreme need once they have been transferred they can be put back in the crypto market. In the app the tokens used will not have a value outside of the app. If you buy 10.000 tokens in the app you cannot sell them back on an exchange.  This is my understanding.",True

The team also seems solid. And the partnerships they already have acquired is a good sign. There is also a lack of competition in the cryptoworld with the same idea, not any of whom I know, at least. Wi Coin was added 11 days ago on CMC, which seems similar project but for wi-fi only, so the scope of the project is not as big. The team also seems much more rookie, compared to Dent team.  I want desperately to invest in this project, but there are few things that are concerning me and stopping me for now: 1. Devs don't give a sh*t about the community. No reply for 3 months. No news. No nothing. They don't give a sh*t that price fell under ICO prices now. What would be the point in getting involved in the ICO then? Or any ICO if price is dropping below ICO prices short after that.  2.Tweets like: https://twitter.com/dentcoin/status/915164624080769024 https://twitter.com/dentcoin/status/912315133682167808 ...and some more like this in the twitter account. What does it mean? That one of the devs is a regular attendee of these conferences? Just a visitor walking around? Or a speaker? I guess it is the former. So not really any news. Seems more like a desperate move to show some activity on the project. Although, a lot of guys shout for some communication and reassurence from the devs here and there, they don't bother for a single reply.  3.These are some valid concerns copied from one of the crypto bloggers, I agree with: -The cost of mobile data on the DENT exchange has to be lower than the same package directly from telcos, otherwise arbitrage opportunities exist. For example, if a telco package for 5 GB is $50 a month, then the price for the same package listed on DENT has to be cheaper, otherwise people can just buy the plans from telcos and sell them on DENT for instant profit. Hence, people can just rely solely on using DENT to buy data plans without using a plan from telco. Telcos are not going to be ok with that. -Because larger plans are cheaper on a per GB basis, people can just buy the largest plan that’s offered by telcos and then sell it piecemeal on DENT – telcos won’t allow this to happen because no one would buy smaller plans from them anymore. -Telcos might not want to join the DENT platform because it is going to reduce customer loyalty. Users can use different service providers easily on DENT.  These issues and not explained in the whitepaper. I would like to see these matters and their solutions explained in a much more detailed manner.  Summary: If all of this project's problems are lack of marketing and communication, then it is an undervalued project. But a professional team like that should know better they shouldn't abandon the community for 3 months.  If I see any sign of life out of these people, I am gonna probably throw some pennies in the project.",True

Unsold tokens are released to the company at a rate of 25% every quarter, 6 months after ICO.  Released to the company, not the market.  There is no market dilution and there will not be a price decrease when this happens.  Companies need capital to thrive and drive new business.  I wouldn't worry about these tokens affecting market supply and would rather concentrate on whether the company delivers on milestones.  To that point, they've already secured partnerships with 12 mobile operations in Africa, India, and the Middle East via U2opia Mobile.  Big demand for mobile data in those areas.  Yeah it's not the EU, North America, or Chinese market (yet) but it should be proof that Dent is on to something.  They're plan for app release is in Q4 and by that time they will have a definite proof of concept and a launchpad for further partnerships, if they haven't secured additional ones before then.  Trust me the team is busy working on the project and there is fairly frequent communication on Slack regarding progress or questions for the team.  Keep in mind they probably can't provide much detail on potential business partnerships they are working on but there's a good amount of optimism from them.  Yeah it would help if they were on other exchanges, but with the uncertainty around Chinese exchanges and other governments looking more closely at ICO's, current exchanges require more scrutiny before tokens are listed.  The team IS working on getting listed to other larger exchanges but with additional scrutiny, time is required by both parties.  HitBTC and etherdelta may not be the best volume wise but the price of this token is undervalued.  Might as well buy while you can and help inject more volume into the exchanges while the price is still low.  As soon as Dent begins to trade via the App, the trade price over the app should be reflected in the market.  Expect the spread between the two to shrink very, very quickly.  Plus, wouldn't you rather invest in a promising ICO at an undervalued price now and watch it grow in value over time?  This isn't a token where you can ride a quick week's worth of volatility to make a quick profit.  It's going to grow exponentially, with time.  Speculators control over crypto is not going to last much longer, especially when large institutional money starts flowing into the space.  Who's to say DENT won't be one of those where the institutional funds will flow?  Time will tell, and it looks like right now Dent is out there trying to make things happen and put their feet to the ground to get the project / partnerships going before Q4 app release.",True

Due to low volume, price of the token is nowhere near what it will be once real trading starts.  DENT is not available on any exchange yet. HitBTC does this with every ICO: they participate in a presale, secure X amount of tokens and trade the promise of receiving said token. They still have to wait of the release of the actual tokens like everyone else. So instead what you see on HitBTC is I-owe-you's (IOU), in other words, ""futures"". You are trading IOU's of DENT token, not the actual token. Due to the extremely low volume, price of a token on HitBTC is seldom anywhere near the price you'll see once the actual token is traded on Bittrex, Polo etc. Take TenX's PAY token for example, regularly saw $40-50 ""price"" on HitBTC, but that was only due to the trading volume of a few BTC's worth. Once the tokens were available for trade, PAY was trading for fraction of what it was on HitBTC.",True

ICO u do isn't enough even for one country... on the contrary, u are building global business where multiply telcos shall recongnize u... too BIG! 4. also regarding the team:  the one that has any experience with telcos is just advisor that looks like just getting money for allowing how name be stated on ICO page. all other check by themselves, has experience that is SOOOOO FARRRR from telcos infra and iternals... who is there: ios android DEV? ok... they will have nice app with nice screens...

The less data you use vs. what you purchase equals profit for the telcos as they say. So it's not in their interests to work with dent because they lose the profit they would have earned from your wasted data & the profit they'd make selling 'new' data to a customer vs. helping them buy yours.  So you'd have to do it against the telcos and I'm not sure it's an easy process to sell unused data to someone else if the telcos don't want you too.",True

I also think the ICO will not be the only source of funding for the project and that they'll be seeking large(er) investors pretty soon. Not sure how future marketing will be handled, but if they bring big(ger) money, I'd assume they'll ramp up the marketing as well. Just a hunch.  Mikko and his core team have a shitton of biz and project experience outside of crypto, yet have just ventured on to crypto and especially ICO's. I was asking myself, if this is such a revolutionary concept, why not just seek VC funding and be done with it? Why fumble around with small donations when you could just score $10 mil of Series A funding? And the answer is, I think, with a token sale and subsequent Dent app, Dent can demonstrate to a telco (hopefully a large) number of users wanting their data liberated. Can't do that if you have 1-2 large investors giving you cash.  Unlike the ""normal"" ICO's I don't think Dent's purpose for the ICO is to create massive hype (TenX) or raise an insane amount of cash (EOS) -- though I have to admit the 152K ETH cap is pretty fecking huge --- but rather, bring on users at a gradual pace; again because the point of the ICO is not create inflated prices or a pump and dump. Many of us look for those under the radar projects with small a cap, low number of tokens, for that 20x, 50x return. I don't think you'll achieve that with Dent. You should get onboard because you believe this actually solves a *current* problem, and not just for cryptoenthusiasts, not because you expect DENT to be worth 10x in 6 months.

Let assume that the team is able to collect the maximum amount in the ICO and is well supported by the community. Development and marketing goes really well and the community base grows exponentially.They release the app in which users can share data and earn Dent coins. People starts using and things started to get traction.  The operators looses their revenue and soon finds about DENT and the revolution!  And now comes the problem : do you really think the operators would allow this? They could prevent users from sharing data via a third party app like Dent. Even if the users somehow manage to share data, won't there be legal actions from the operators against the users and DENT?  How is the team going to face these issues and counter them? The team really needs to explain and nail these issues if this project has to become a long term success like an Uber of Internet data. Remember that Uber is facing hell lot of issues right now even after disrupting the field in which it deals with.  I would greatly appreciate if the team answers this and add a well featured video about it in youtube, even write a detailed blog about this issue.",True

It would be great if everyone had as much data as needed at an affordable price - in fact this is our vision. However, reality is that today data is expensive to most users - domestically and most pronounced in case of international roaming, and also in the future data will not come for free. The reason is that data capacity  is a limited resource, which can be expanded by more spectrum or denser telco network - both of which comes at a price.  What DENT wants to achieve is a better utilization of the limited resource mobile data, by making data prices fully transparent to all users, and by allowing to trade data between users. With DENT therefore the market imbalance today - where operators determine the price - will shift to a fully balanced and transparent market, where users determine data market prices purely based on supply and demand.

Here quick answers:  Yes, we prefer of course to work together with the telcos, and we are already in conversations with multiple ones. If that takes too long, we always have the option of  launching on our own MVNO with the DENT features.  In the first phase, DENT is attractive to “attacker” telcos who want to lead the market with a customer friendly proposition, i.e. to offer customers to sell, buy or donate mobile data across all DENT users and better roaming etc. DENT is also attractive to existing telcos who want to launch the “data liberalization” proposition anyways, but want to save time and money to build their own platform.  DENT Exchange is a marketplace which makes buying and selling of mobile data easy and dynamic. By making mobile data buying easy, (just like Amazon and ebay made buying and selling of goods easy), we will extend the market of the telcos, and also modernize their business model, buy for example enabling autimatic data buying for iOT devides. Nobody will run with SIM cards any more in the near future. Telcos can not do this fast, since they are competitors, so there needs to be a 3rd party that will do that marketplace.  To drive the pressure on, we will be gathering a growing growing number of DENT users, on who’s behalf we will negotiate with telcos. Remember, every user in the eyes of a telco represents a value of ion average 460 EUR . So 2 million users of 1 telco represents 920 Million Dollar revenue for them. Every telco will listen to that.  We are not worried about fighting against a big industry. I am also Co-Founder of DOVECOT, the IMAP Server, and with that product we are fighting against Oracle, Microsoft and Google, and with actually quite good succes: growing the IMAP market share of Dovecot from 49% to 72% in the last 3 years, having today over 4 million Dovecot servers live. Reference: http://www.openemailsurvey.org  Look back what happened to NOKIA and Blackberry, they just vanished in a few years by not having the product that the users wanted. Therefore telcos should not feel too secure in the monopolistic and silo-like mindset. The users are not happy at the moment, and mobile data is one of the most important commodities in our time.  Thanks for your support!  -Mikko, Co-Founder of DENT Wireless",True

The issue DENT solves is, that - unlike fuel - you don’t really own the data you bought, for example you cannot just give it to someone else, or - even worse - you lose the data you bought at the end of the month if not fully used up. So selling mobile data is therefore nothing else than handing over the right to use the telco’s network from you to someone else, for the specified number of bytes. Technically, this is realized by removing the amount of bytes from your telco account, and adding it to the other person’s telco account.  This already works inside the telco network by some telcos you can for example move data allowance between family members, so why not also inside and outside the network?  Cheers, Mikko",True

You are trying to offer something that you have no control over, namely unused mobile data traffic. What leverage do you have over telecom providers?  How are you going to convince them to open their data links to users from abroad just because they have some DENT? Are you hoping to form a massive userbase which is supposed to pressure their mobile providers to implement DENT? How are you going to achieve a massive userbase without any funcionallity in the beginning?  What should incentivise telekom providers to use DENT? 33 milion is peanuts for Deutsche Telekom or Verizon. I guess the cost of implementing is higher than that? And if this ever becomes something that market strongly demands why wouldn't telekom providers come up with their own solutions and sideline yours?",True

And answering this: ""And if this ever becomes something that market strongly demands why wouldn't telekom providers come up with their own solutions and sideline yours?""  Telekom providers won't show any type of these solutions, because their paradigma, way of thinking or the way they see things is not about bringing this type of solutions to mobile users, their goal is to make profits, make money, that's their main focus and goal. In order to achieve something like this, there is the need to think beyond this mentality that most people working in a corporation have these days.",True
