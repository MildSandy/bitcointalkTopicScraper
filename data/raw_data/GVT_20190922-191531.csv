Think beyond October,  GVT has the fundamentals to be a crypto beast, with the combination of the GV platform, Genesis Markets, low supply and active users on the platform (which may take us to early 2019 to get lots of users trading and managing) I see no reason why we can't aim for a 1 billion marketcap!  Of course a 1 bill MC is easier with a higher priced BTC, but we dont need BTC to be up near the top!   If GVT has a 1 billion market cap come Q1/2 2019,  1,000,000,000 M.C / 3,700,000 current circ supply  = $270+ p/GVT    IMO GVT can be valued at bigger than a 1 bil M/C, DYOR and make your own estimations but GVT aint slowing down!",False

The indicator shows the days until the end of reporting period. As you know, at the end of reporting period, a profit will be distributed to a manager and investors depending on their shares. It also means, the new requests for investment can be accepted if a manager has got available tokens.

Forget the copy trading feature of GVT platform where you give your money to managers and they play with it. That's like Covesting. Every one is forgetting that Brokers will be trading their clients assets on this platform. Totally same as they always did except the money flows through GVT. All this talk about managers this and managers that..bla bla bla...managers are mostly children. Thanks for your constructive conversation. Genesis Vision needs the brokerages to provide liquidity of all the trading activities. If a cryptomarket doesn't need a brokerage cause there are not exist any law regulation, to trade on the FOREX, stock, metal and other financial markets you should be registered and licensed. We choose the full regulation brokerages for partnership. The choice leads us to follow consequence: we have got the full regulated brokerages and they provide us liquidity. As for GV, our company provides to investors and traders a huge amount of trading instruments, and also Genesis Vision provides to brokerages a percentage of the managers' trading activity. We would like to notice that all the percentage will be covered by Genesis Vision, not traders or managers.

Thus, we will be announcing more projects to join the Genesis Vision ecosystem in the nearest future.  Today we wanted to tell you about Genesis Markets — a project of a Genesis Vision crypto broker. We will be talking in a bit more detail about why we need brokers, and what specific tasks the Genesis Markets will be dealing with.  To dive into this further, we need to define why we actually need a broker:  Brokerage firms are financial companies that act as the middleman between the buyer and the seller. The broker gives you access to the exchanges and takes care of all the clearing and settlement relating to the trade, so even if it were all one centralized system to trade you would likely still be paying something to someone for connecting you with the exchanges and guaranteeing both sides of the trade.  This is also necessary so that customers, who do not have accounts with the existing brokers can also become traders without going beyond the platform.  Thus making it possible to trade and use the platform even if your broker is not yet connected.  Unfortunately, the current situation with crypto trading is far from paradise. Traders currently need to trade on multiple exchanges just to purchase a particular altcoin. Not only this but most of the exchanges have entirely different trading platforms and UI, many of them also have insufficient liquidity levels.  In contrast with that, the conventional trading world has it rather good, compared to crypto markets. Conventional trading has products like MetaTrader, which solves most of the problems mentioned above.  Conventional traders have gotten used to the unified trading platforms and the abundance of assets within one platform. But, they would love to dive into the crypto world and learn a lot more about altcoins if they had access to all of the crypto trading instruments at once. There is no desire to make due diligence for 10 or more exchanges, just to have a basic grasp on the market.  Our solution to this was to create Genesis Markets — a crypto broker, that would feel familiar to conventional traders, designed to make all crypto instruments accessible within a single brokerage.  Genesis Markets will aggregate depth of the market and order books from multiple crypto exchanges. This is necessary to provide customers with access to all available orders that are currently on the market. This also inevitably increases liquidity, as the orders with similar prices will be merged.  Similarly, all of the crypto trading instruments will be aggregated as well. There are exchanges on which there are many trading pairs and tools. Then, there are more specialized exchanges, where the number of available trading instruments is significantly lower.  One thing unites all of them — none of these exchanges unites all trading instruments.  You can only trade the individual cryptocurrencies, which are available on that single exchange. If you do want to purchase some coins/tokens that aren’t at present on the exchange of your choice, well, you will have to switch to another one. There is simply no way around it. Such migration barriers represent a real issue, mainly because it is quite tricky to move your cryptos from one exchange to another. Genesis Markets will have all trading instruments available.  The liquidity will be provided by multiple exchanges. This would make Genesis Markets a perfect hub for purchasing cryptocurrency. As a customer, you will have access to multiple order books that will grant you an option always to purchase crypto at the best available price.  Here is a nice example: if you want to purchase 1 BTC, Genesis Markets will be able to purchase 0.5 BTC from one exchange, and both 0.3 and 0.2 BTC from other exchanges. In the end — you will acquire your BTC for the best market price currently possible via all of the available market.  Genesis Markets will also be developed concerning enhancements of the trust management aspect — standard platforms and exchanges do not provide any functionality for trust management. Genesis Vision is a platform for trust management, and Genesis Markets will also incorporate this idea.  Last, but not least — Genesis Markets will have convenient unified trading platforms. The trading platform will be standardized and transparent. This is made so that a customer does not need to learn all the exchange user interfaces in existence; they can just get used to a single platform.  Finally, we’d like to take the opportunity to remind you once again, that the Alpha version of the platform is launching on April 1st.  You need to keep in mind, that the project at such a stage is still very much primarily a prototype, but we’ve been dying to share the progress with you, and we hope that you’ll like what we have in store.  Genesis Vision is looking forward to conquering the market. We are obsessed with the idea of transparent asset management. Keep an eye out for future news, a lot of great stuff is coming soon. This is just a beginning.  https://blog.genesis.vision/genesis-markets-announcement-f520ea832168",False

Convincing someone to buy from the price perspective is what is damaging the project. The person might buy thinking the same thing, but if the price drops, they will not think twice about selling off as soon as they recover the money. GVT has great potential and the platform will enable people to make traders earn for them. Before considering selling off anything, just consider what you might be missing out of. We saw 826 percent profit from the best trader and that too in 7 days. If this is the growth percentage, it will help make a lot of money to all the gvt coin holders and they will be making fortunes within a year while using the platform and not just holding the coins.",False

I actually invested the majority of the funds in crypto as I wanted to finish top 10 for the comp!   Now my trades, for example at one point I was at 6k (1k up) showed up in the Genesis Vision Platform and you could track the progress of my investments as well as how many trades I had. This platform is where you, the 'investor' would go to decide who you would like to manage your funds. You could then decide to invest in me as my risk score was low and I was making steady, small gains, or you could invest in a more eratic trader with a higher risk - but possibly higher rewards!  I was impressed, I liked the platform and I will be using the platform myself. One thing I very much liked was to be a 'fund manager' (if theyre called that) they have to put up there own funds too to get to that position, and for them to profit they need to make sure you have to profit too!

Questions after reading GVT whitepaper u/jrockz Hi all,  A few questions after reading the whitepaper. 1) The following claim is made on the whitepaper:  ""Investors have additional protection, due to the fact that all managers have a real trading history that cannot be faked.""  My question is, is this the only system in place for protecting investors? What if I spend a year building up a good management portfolio, then run away with a big portion of money?  2) They also state ""Special service verifies that there were no history amendments, using received hashes and IPFS data""  What is this special service they are speaking of? Is it something that exists or that they will create?  3) They talk about the need for possibly switching from Ethereum if the project scale becomes too big for ETH, and state the following:  In case of blockchain platform change, all Ethereum tokens will be migrated. Token quantity and conditions for holders will remain unchanged.  Wouldn't this have a massive effect on the ETH market? If this project gets big enough to the point where they can no longer use ETH, wouldn't migrating that massive quantity of tokens ruin market prices? How can they expect to uphold token quantity and conditions? What are their plans for people who are storing these on wallets that don't support the new currency they want to swap to?  4) Development budget statement:  The budget and components are planned, assuming that our fundraising efforts will reach the estimated maximum amount. Otherwise, a part of the components will have to be abandoned, and the budget will be reduced for the remaining features  Where can I find information on the budget goals?  Maybe I don't understand fully. Any help is appreciated, thanks  ___________________________________________________  genesis-vision  Hi jrockz! Thank you for your questions!  1) Funds on manager’s account are protected by the integration plugin in the trading platform/exchange. In fact, manager can’t withdraw investors money and run away.  2) We are talking about our own service, that we will develop for this purpose specifically. To be honest, there is no rocket science there, and the process of conformity check between initial data and hashes, stored in the blockchain is quite straightforward.  3) ETH market (and the cryptocurrency market in general) is extremely volatile, so the effect on the market is possible. However, we don’t think such volumes are enough to ruin or even to move it significantly.  The migration process is not automated. In fact, token holders will claim their new tokens through a specific gateway. This allows to maintain the same quantity/conditions and avoid specific wallet problems, since users can migrate their tokens when and where it’s comfortable for them.  4) The information about ICO goals and the full development plan + approximate roadmap for the next 3 years you can find in the whitepaper. However, I think the most interesting information at the moment is our actual plans, considering the amount that we attracted. These updates can be found in our recent blog article:https://blog.genesis.vision/genesis-vision-ico-wrap-up-448ea7fafe47  If you have any questions left – you’re welcome!",False

GVT was sent to Bittrex early days for testing,  2.)

Unlike other blockchain projects connected with trust management, we don’t limit our target audience with the crypto world only. Our first goal is to bring the transparency and stability to the traditional financial markets such as forex, stock markets, hedge funds and so forth. At first glance, our projects are similar as them are aimed at the asset management market. But the fundamental difference is that the Blackmoon builds its own assets management Funds  and Iconomi work only with crypto. We are aimed to the private trust management sector with already existing money managers and Funds. We unite already operating brokers and money managers from Forex, Stock markets, hedge Funds, crypto asset managers and crypto exchanges and so forth. We unite all of them in a single decentralized network and make the process of investment and profit distribution transparent and stable. Additionally, we provide the instrument to check the statistics of each particular manager since our investors should be confident that all profits are real.

This could be in 6 hours, 6 days or 6 weeks ~ they will be listed so just be patient, and if you take notice of what I just said you will know that now would be a great time to invest, ignore any price fluctuations and HODL. You'll wake up one day and your GVT value will have doubled and some and you shall be extremely happy im sure!

While is no news about the placement on Bittrex.  Quote from: Learn.It on November 20, 2017, 09:33:30 PM I'd like to get some conversion going on peoples' predictions in price, releases, community adoption. Also, how does the value get stored in GVT when the market managers will be distributing their own coins? GVT will be used for all investment operations, profit distributions, and managers’ token trading on the internal exchange. Investing in Genesis Vision platform is a simple as purchasing a managers’ cryptocurrency. When investors purchase coins, GVTs are transferred to a broker’s account, where they are converted to required currency and transferred to a manager’s trading account. Holders of coins receive part of the profits of the managerin GVT, according to their share.

Hello devs, do you have a translation into Spanish? If you do not have it, I would like to translate it! if is posible thank you Hello! We do not have WP on Spanish language. Unfortunately, Bounty program was over and we do not need more translations.  Quote from: RntMC on November 19, 2017, 01:06:24 AM Is this project like Blackmoon Crypto(BMC)? At first glance, our projects are similar as both of them are aimed at the asset management market. But the fundamental difference is that the Blackmoon builds its own assets management Funds. The number of these Funds is limited, and each of them has a company-like structure and executes its own specific fund management strategy. Unlike the Blackmoon, we are aimed to the private trust management sector with already existing money managers and Funds. We unite already operating brokers and money managers from Forex, Stock markets, hedge Funds, crypto asset managers and so forth. We don’t change the way of trading for our managers; we don’t control their strategies. We only unite all of them in a single decentralized network and make the process of investment and profit distribution transparent and stable. Additionally, we provide the instrument to check the statistics of each particular manager since our investors should be confident that all profits are real.

KuCoin https://www.kucoin.com/#/trade/GVT-BTC https://www.kucoin.com/#/trade/GVT-ETH  *GVT will be listed on more exchanges, negotiations are underway with Bittrex confirmed by the CEO of Genesis Vision and the support team. However, this requires a non-disclosure agreement as to a release date. IMO expect to see Bittrex listing before platform launch, and further exchange listings to coincide with platform alpha & beta launches (Starting Early 2018).    So now we have some of the facts and figures out of the way – What is Genesis Vision?  See for full details -> https://genesis.vision/#how-it-works -> Note the GVT token supply figure will shortly be updated. The true total supply figure is -> 4,436,644 GVT.  Genesis Vision are building a new decentralized platform that aims to bring exchanges, brokers, traders and investors together. They state in their whitepaper that by using blockchain technology they'll be able to provide a completely transparent platform to facilitate lending between professional traders and investors.  The Genesis Vision platform will integrate with Metatrader 4 & Metatrader 5 with the GVT tokens at the core of the Genesis Vision platform. The Genesis Platform will have registered funds managers/traders who are companies/individuals with a proven trading history, ready to acquire investors' money for management. The profit, received as a result of management of the total funds, is shared proportionally between the managers and investors. Managers receive a commission for management and a commission from the profit (success fee).  Investors do not trade in the market directly. Instead, investors transfer their funds to experienced traders who manage the funds for them. Investors get their shares from their managers’ profits  Brokers are companies that have the appropriate licenses to carry out brokerage activities. Through brokers, traders have access to trading financial instruments on exchange and over-the-counter markets.  For a full detailed visual representation of this view the Genesis Vision White paper here -> https://genesis.vision/white-paper-eng.pdf  Market size that GVT will be tapping into? TRILLIONS. They are not only tapping in to the ‘normal’ markets, they are combining the cryptocurrency trading and the modern day ‘normal’ markets together simultaneously.  For any casual investor is important to know that making profit from the price of a GVT token is just an added bonus, the real value comes with using this on the Genesis Platform to piggyback investors and make some serious gains!   Upcoming Genesis Vision Events:  - NOVEMBER 29 AMSTERDAM https://icoevent.eu ‘’This is an event, focused on the ICO process and activities. Despite the fact, that our ICO is already finished, we think that it’s important to stay in touch with ICO community. We already scheduled a number of meetings with our current investors and that’s a good chance for us to meet with people in person, answer questions, share the details of our ICO and future plans.’’  - DECEMBER 1 SOFIA http://financeforum.investor.bg ‘’Due to the nature of our project, we are not limited to cryptocurrency markets. Traditional financial markets and investors are important for us as well. Our project is aimed to remove the borders between these worlds, that’s why we believe it’s important to stay in touch with both of them. The co-founder and CTO of Genesis Vision, Dmitry Nazarov will take part in this conference as a speaker. Additionally, he’ll join the panel discussion about cryptocurrency and blockchain investments as an expert.’’   PRICE SPECULATION:  Now everyone new and old to crypto knows that it is impossible to predict an exact price of a token, but doing your own research can guide you into accurately estimating where the currency is going.  One thing I believe in with GVT, is that the token has a real life use and value. This combined with a 4.4 million market cap, the price is only going one way – UP.  But if you ask me to make a prediction on this;  $10+ before a Bittrex Listing (supply is going to run out)  $25 after Bittrex listing  $100+ after product launch coinciding with addition exchanges MID 2018  $??? In 2019? With bank integration too – expect to potentially see 100x gains on the current prices in November 2017!

I am very confident in the genesis vision team and they shown their dedication to the project and a high level of responsibility time and time again (as an example, I refer back to the fact (as you mentioned) that they only hold 11% of GVT tokens that are locked up for one year). I have the utmost confidence that they will be able to deliver the project. Also I understand that these things take time and I am not trying to expedite the process through my enquiries. I simply wish to understand how I can keep up with the project development process as I am excited and wish to follow along and stay in the loop. I think having such a way of keeping us informed is greatly beneficial to the Genesis Vision community (and believe me, to survive in the crypto world, a strong community is absolutely essential!) which in turn leads to a much better ecosystem and platform.

I think you have a solid project and I am excited to be an investor. Also kudos to you for burning the unsold tokens, this has greatly enhanced my trust in the team and should greatly benefit the platform ecosystem. I don't think I will partake in any more ICOs unless the devs commit to burning unsold tokens as you have done. And great work on being listed on so many major exchanges so quickly, that must have taken quite a bit of work.  I have a few questions on what comes next and how you plan to keep us all updated on the platform development?  1) As I understand it, the ICO did not raise quite as much as you had intended so the platform may need to be scaled back and delayed somewhat (understandable). Consequently has your team developed a new road map and will you be able to make this public so we have an idea of the new project timeline?  2) How do you plan to primarily communicate with your community? One of the things that lead me to invest in this project was the clear and frequent communication displayed throughout the ICO period. However since the ICO has been completed I have noted that it has been a bit quieter here lately (although that also may be because people are now asking less questions). I understand that you must be quite busy now that you are moving into the development stage of the project however I think communication with devs is vital to a functioning community. I'd like to suggest that you maintain a development blog that you keep frequently updated on progress with at fortnightly updates (even if it is just a simple post with a few images outlining recent progress and challenges that need to be overcome). Any plans to release something like this? Or is there one already that I may have missed?  3) Any news on negotiations with Bittrex for listing GVT on the exchange?  Once again! Congratulations. I am excited to be part of the ride.     ",False

It's more of an unfiltered message group for fans and investors (containing a whole lot of smack talk and stickers - which is absolutely fine, it's good to have a place for that, but it's not where you would want to send prospective investors to learn about platform development progress). If the developers were to make updates on this medium, they quickly will get lost in the chat activity. I'm thinking more along the lines of a developer blog like the one hosted by the Golem project (https://blog.golemproject.net/) which is frequently updated and focuses on important development and community issues. Twitter is also good but still not perfect for development updates considering the character limitations.  In order for the price to go up (which I'm not concerned about in the short term, I'm planning to hodl as I believe in this project) the project will at some point need to attract buyers. This will be much easier to do so if they can clearly see progress in the platform development. Having investigated further I note that there is indeed a Genesis Vision blog (https://blog.genesis.vision/) which is very exciting. I hope it maintains frequent updates.

On more than one occasion I've seen coin market cap list the wrong numbers and it takes them a really long time before they correct their errors. How can 4 million be the total supply? Unless there is a max supply that has not been listed by Coin Market Cap. The development team was supposed to get 4.8 million. 2.2 million were supposed to be reserved for a fund. Then the rest was for the ICO. That's 7 million coins not counting the ICO coins. I think that there should probably be another category for maximum supply because there's definitely more than what Coin Market Cap has listed. I'm guessing that if you add 4.4 million total supply to the 7 million reserved for the team and fund, it should put us at around 11 million tokens. This is just a guess, but I believe that it's more accurate that what coin market cap has listed.  Nonetheless, I bought a few coins at the start of the ICO and I will be hodling my coins.",False

But if I'm going to be honest this doesn't really mean anything?  I guess my question are these tokens actually going to be useful and bring some kind of new functionality or do they simply exist so yo can run an ICO to raise funds? What exactly am I purchasing?  I'm, very interested in this project and will be following it closely. Cheers!",False

GVT is an internal currency of our platform; it is used for all investment operations and profit distributions. It exists mainly to unlink the currency of investor with the trading asset of manager and make it unified. 2. The possible Scalability problem in the case we have to change Ethreum to something else.  It will be easier to do with our own tokens, without binding to Ethereum.

You have not hidden it. Thats not what I’m saying.  The financial commission doesn’t seem legit is what I am saying. It is not a regulator (though when you google it some websites say it’s a regulator or self- regulatory body),  it has a house as a registered office, and a phone number in New York. Yet your registered offices are in HK, SVG and UK.  All the companies that are members of this supposed self regulatory organization seem to be connected. The first company on top of the list has lots of regulatory problems (google it).  I would also advise investors to do a linkedin search on the team members of this fincom (some profiles on the website are clearly inflated from linked in - like this dude artem who did two summer internships in a firm and is called on the fina com website as a senior lawyer - ). Many of the board members have very close links to the supposed member firms of this finacom. Also do a whois on the finacom website and some other member companies. So many links and shady businesses, many registered in Belize or Vanuatu, the bastions of credible regulatory oversight.  I’m not an investigator and I have a full time job so I’m not going to spend more time researching this. However, it makes me very uneasy and I will not be investing in your ICO as a result and I also think other investors should be aware so they can draw their own conclusions and/or you can explain it to them.",False

I think we should be at 1M USD by the end of today witch is very good during everything that is going on. Very curious where the project will end at. Really hope they get the funds they diserve because this is a really good project! I wonder, what was the soft cap for Genesis Vision? But as there is still plenty of time left, they will be fine anyways, at least after the money will come back to the altcoins. I know that 33 million $$ is the hard cap but no idea about the soft cap or whether there is one. I dont think it will have any possibility of not reaching that hard cap. We do not have a soft cap. The budget and components are planned, assuming that our fundraising efforts will reach the estimated maximum amount. Otherwise, a part of the components will have to be abandoned, and the budget will be reduced for the remaining features.   Quote from: magisterr on October 17, 2017, 09:58:24 AM Who invested in this project on pre-ico? Which bonuses was? Our pre-sale was in form of Options sale. So $2.3M is the equivalent value of GVT, reserved for the ICO stage. An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) during a certain period or on a specific date (exercise date).Genesis Vision option guarantees the right to acquire GVT tokens at a specified price during the ICO, so you have to pay only 5% on Pre-ICO and the remaining 95% you will have to pay during the ICO. The bonus was 30%   Quote from: eneyardi on October 17, 2017, 02:42:19 PM Want to invest in this project. What I should use? We reccomend to use BTC or ETH.

I previously participated in Rialto.ai which claim to be the largest arbitrage and market-maker with a team of PhDs in data analytics and machine learning, and yet its performance is sub standard that I have to sell off everything.  And I was a trader before going full time now into crypto. I developed my own proprietary trading system that can do both trend-following and mean reversion, and still it cannot survive the rampant HFT manipulation. Luckily I didn't put real money into it because the whole thing was running on historical data without over-fitting (I bet you don't know what I talk about). Despite having a system that can potentially make over 2000% return every year in conventional index market (S&P 500), it still systematically beaten by HFT manipulation. I realized a market that is powered by machine learning and data analytics (just the same thing in different name) is a highly competitive and saturated market. It is better to just buy and hold in a booming market than trading it.  Genesis Vision's business model based on trading approach will not turn out well. Please don't kid yourself that it will.  I would advise you to save your money and just do some objective fundamental analysis on some viable ICO projects and just ride the wave up. Genesis Vision is not one of such viable project.  Edit: I would like to advise you on which viable ICO to buy judging by what could potentially be the next big thing in crypto + conventional market, but these ICOs have already ended and no matter how promising they will be in my mind, suggesting them to you to buy would be some conflict of interest and thus not ethical.

Also will the profit been payed in the same currency which it was invested? If you asking about investing in the ICO, the minimal investment amount is 20 USD (in the equivalent of BTC or ETH). GVT doesn't give the rights to profit or dividends. GVT will be an internal currency of our platform. If you are talking about our platform, investing is a simple as purchasing a managers’ cryptocurrency. When investors purchase coins, GVTs are transferred to a broker's account, where they are converted to required currency and transferred to a manager's trading account. Holders of coins receive part of the profits of the manager, according to their share. Profits will be distribeted in GVT.

The 1000+ figure didn't just came out of thin air in a single go; it was accumulated one unresolved case at a time until it reaches unmanageable level.  I can only suspect the admin is collecting a database of who owns which bitcoin addresses (and the associated IP address to pinpoint the geographic location) thru all the hacks.  Back to ICO. Basically this is not limited to Genesis Vision, but to almost all ICOs. If you notice, many ICOs are now much quicker to realize big loss right after listing. I have no idea what is the exact reason for people to dump countless of coins that they bought during the ICO at far below the ICO price. I can only speculate they are getting free coins behind the background of most ICOs. I am not saying Genesis Vision is good or bad because I didn't study its business model. But if indeed the same pattern is going to repeat (i.e. price drop below ICO), then you might have better opportunity buying after listing. I might be wrong. I myself bought into PayPie that sold out in half a day, with maximum hype by some charlatan Clif High and gang, and yet that cannot help the price at all from falling so low. I notices even some ""highly rated"" ICOs also facing similar outcome after listing. These days, I wouldn't feel I missed out on a good ICO if I don't manage to get in because there is a big chance I might be able to get it cheaper after listing.",False

So... now I'm wondering, you buy currency from a manager because you believe in this person as a good manager? I'm convinced that this project has a strong backbone, good development team, and a big group of believers behind it. Just asking myself a question for each new ANN that is started, why are there so many new projects that miss out the Dutch speaking part of the world? We might be a small part of the world, but we could make a small difference to when it comes to supporting a new coin/token release )) This said, after briefly reading the ANN and following comments, I'm sure we will hear more about this one for sure  Good luck with the roadmap and I hope you guys can make it happen ! Thank you for you support. Let's figure out the situation with the ""manager"". Managers/Management funds/Traders are companies/individuals with a proven trading history, ready to acquire investors' money for management. The profit, received as a result of management of the total funds, is shared proportionally between the managers and investors. Managers receive a commission for management and a commission from the profit (success fee).   Quote from: imtiazmahmood on October 12, 2017, 02:28:46 PM that is good news hitBTC exchange genesis will be available and what about next exchange? is there any plan to bring token on livecoin or bittrex or polonix? On hitBTC we will be listed from 16th of November. Do not worry, GVT being listed on all possible exchanges and being liquid is essential for our platform operation. We continue negotiations with the number of exchanges.   Quote from: Piggy on October 13, 2017, 05:58:01 AM Almost missed this project, is there any dividend or some form of compensation for the token holders? (Reading the whitepaper right now) GVT doesn't give the rights to profit or dividends. GVT is an internal currency of Genesis Vision platform and will be used for all investment operations and profit distributions. Fundraising and the use of GVT (Genesis Vision Token) will help to finance product development, marketing and advertising for the development of the platform. Here you can learn about our token more: https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/token-price-gains-gvt-growth-based/   Quote from: viljy on October 13, 2017, 07:27:37 AM Such question: the manager will receive the commission from the sum of profit for the certain period of time, or the manager will receive the commission from each transaction which he makes? I think the first option, but I would like to clarify this issue. The profit received as a result of the each trade, it automatically distributed proportionally between managerial token holders at the end of the reporting period.

According to PwC analysis[1] , global investable assets for the asset management industry will increase to more than $100 trillion by 2020, with a compound annual growth rate of nearly 6%.'' Interesting article. Does anyone know what this means ? Genesis Vision ICO is certified[2] by Financial Commission  ? This Financial Commission thing? FINACOM PLC LTD. (“Financial Commission”) is an independent self-regulatory organization and external dispute resolution (EDR) body. Financial Commission ensures that traders and brokers are getting their disputes resolved in a quick, efficient, unbiased and authentic manner, while making sure they walk away with a well-founded answer.

Someone suggested a partnership with genesis vision.  When i think about it, some trust managers can be ai and there is napoleonx for this. But on the other hand, napoleonx can count as a competitor.  Still seeing as a bot as a trust manager could be an interesting experience  I think they are not the same, working on the same goal but have different approaches. Probably they could complement each other to have a complete offer, but this could be outside the scope of both projects. Exactly NapoleonX has totally different approach to trading than Genesis Vision. They will be using low frequency trading bots when Genesis will be depending at human day traders    what will be benefit if napoleonX and genesis vision go for partnership. is there will increase both projects popularity or vision or plan etc? i just want to know. The only way of our cooperation if NapoleonX becomes Genesis Vision platform's manager. As a manager they will have an opportunity to attract the investors.   Quote from: eneyardi on October 13, 2017, 11:11:46 AM When is the end of ICO? The official date of ICO's end is November, 16 or if all the tokens will be sold out.

Performance fee proponents assume that a fund manager's desire to outperform and the ability to outperform are highly correlated. In other words, if a fund manager wants it bad enough, they can outperform. I can assure you this isn't true. The world is littered with workaholic fund managers who can't beat the benchmark.  Another fallacy of the argument is that it assumes fund managers don't already have enough incentive to perform well.  You have to wonder why the well-paid professionals you've entrusted your hard-earned savings to are asking you for more money when they produce strong returns. Isn't that what they are being paid for in the first place? We don't pay doctors more money if they perform a successful operation; they do everything in their power to save a person's life no matter what.  The complexity of performance fee structures leaves the potential for all manner of unintended consequences. For example, imagine you are running a fund and are slightly underperforming. You may be tempted to ratchet up the risk with the hope that you surpass your hurdle and trigger a fat bonus.  When you boil it down, performance fees are really just an over-engineered set of rules that attempt to mimic the natural alignment of interests that exists when fund managers become investors in their own funds.",False

Quote from: kraterion on October 10, 2017, 07:30:32 PM Really good that you're answering questions so quickly Regarding managers' tokens on internal exchange, I suppose that if a manager is doing pretty good his/her token will go up in price in the internal exchange, it will be possible to sell/buy tokens on internal exchange during the reporting period? An investor can sell/buy manager's tokens in any period, even before the reporting period.

What? In which way they will be issue their own cryptocurrency? I dont think, that is good idea... Every manager can make hundreds cryptocurrency, but in fact, this will be wourth nothing... One cryptocurrency per manager. So there will be a lot of different tokens but I'm sure only the best will remain and gain strong value. If this will get mainstream we should raise gwei on ethereum transactions. All manager with his token would definitely make ethereum blockchain slower. Why should this slower the blockchain? There wont be hundreds of managers I think. Quote from: pynetx on October 11, 2017, 07:51:15 AM I don't quite understand the meaning of ""• Managers issue their own branded cryptocurrency, which can be freely traded by investors."" You mean to say that managers will create new tokens rather than using the existing ones? Will these tokens not be created and running on the Genesis platform and when these tokens are transferred outside the platform they will converted to the Genesis token?

What? In which way they will be issue their own cryptocurrency? I dont think, that is good idea... Every manager can make hundreds cryptocurrency, but in fact, this will be wourth nothing... investors will invest on good traders. before they invest theyn can check trade history and strategy bio data. this is one first rule all invester doing before investing money. You read, what i wrote? I asked about their own tokens! May be devs can explaine this? Manager need to put some funds to make their coin valuable. Its one of the requirement to register as a manager what if they dont put some funds into their tokens? their project will fail or will the tokens worth something when generated? Manager’s tokens give investors the ability to speculate on the value of the managers themselves. For example, by buying coins from an unknown trader with a winning strategy, investors will see the value of their coins rise not based solely on the value of the profits gained from the trades but from the perceived future value of that traders winning formula. This gives investors the ability to take a hands on approach by betting on traders and their strategies but also by diversifying their investments with different traders. You can hedge your bets by investing in traders who use different strategies. Genesis Vision platform is powered by Ethereum smart contracts, which are basically open-source apps running on the blockchain. Smart contracts are coded in a way that will allow on-demand creation of new tokens - manager’s tokens. Each new registered manager will issue his own cryptocurrency, which will be traded on the internal Genesis Vision exchange. Its value will rise and grow according to manager’s success. Practically, manager’s tokens can be thought of as common stocks. The form of sale of manager’s tokens will depend on the form of coins issue. During initial manager’s token issue, coins will be sold by a manager directly and their price will be fixed. After the initial sale is finished, manager tokens will be freely traded between users of Genesis Vision on the platform own exchange. From that point on, the price will be unpinned. It will be defined entirely by the market based on how successful a manager is.  Quote from: EgoPaintedGrey on October 11, 2017, 08:11:10 AM How can the investor check the manager's ability? Investors will have access to manager's trading and profit statistics, which will be accessible in one place.  Quote from: viljy on October 11, 2017, 08:51:59 AM Quote from: genesis.vision on October 10, 2017, 06:38:10 PM Quote from: viljy on October 10, 2017, 10:27:55 AM Thank you for the explanation. But the second question, probably I could not properly ask. That's what I mean. Suppose the manager sold 1,000 coins for $ 1. Then the manager got a profit and now has $ 10,000. Then these coins, which already own investors, also increase in price to $ 10? And to get your profit, the investor can just sell these coins? Or the second option: the manager pays to all holders of coins profit in proportion to the number of coins they have? And then the owners of coins can receive profit from the manager while owning coins? In the first variant, the profit itself does not directly go to investors. In the second variant the profit goes to them directly, minus the remuneration of the manager (commission). From the documents, I did not quite understand how exactly the profit is made by investors. Holders of coins receive part of the profits of the manager, according to their share. The investor has the right to transfer coins to another Ethereum wallet or sell on the internal exchange. A manager doesn't distribute the profit, the profit will be distributed automatically by the smart contract. The second varient is true - ""the profit goes to them directly, minus the remuneration of the manager (commission)."" Thank you for the explanation. Thus, manager coins are a kind of shares that pay dividends, as long as they have me. In addition, manager coins can grow in value. But it is possible and this option: the manager issues a new issue of his coins, for example, increasing his security deposit, and this amount produces coins. Then the number of manager coins increases and the price of coins may decrease? And it's possible that the profit on each coin may also decrease, if the manager could not increase the profit even after obtaining additional working capital, as the number of coins increased. No, the outline is different. Smart contracts are coded in a way that will allow on-demand creation of new tokens - manager’s tokens. Each new registered manager will issue his own cryptocurrency, but only one currency.

That's something you don't see that often. We appreciate it! We are glad to answer every question. See you tomorrow  Quote from: levyashin on October 09, 2017, 05:00:32 PM I don't understand this. Ok it is good for joiners, he makes his option but there is not an obligation. But i don't understand that what is in it for you? Recent ICO campaigns identified a number of problems in the investing process:  - People who have been following the project for a long time can simply be late to invest money. - A large influx of transactions in the first minutes after the launch of the ICO creates difficulties for ICO investors and other Ethereum blockchain users. - Due to the geographical dispersion of investors, participation for many of them may be compounded by the fact that the launch of ICO falls on a deep night in their time zone. - Early investment bonuses are often given not to actual first supporters, but to those who managed to be the first to carry out a transaction in the blockchain.  To solve these and a number of other problems, Genesis Vision team is launching an option program for ICO participation.  Quote from: Heimer on October 09, 2017, 05:16:10 PM  Quote We don’t hire managers; we don’t control their strategies. We only unite all of them in a single decentralized network. Each investment will be charged 0.5% of the operation amount.  But if some bad manager lost all investors money, can you influence to him and prohibit him trading more? I doubt in that. There must be some kind of KYC verification and even this won't prevent you from identity stealing or other form of frauds All the managers will go through cryto exchanges' KYC verification. Users don't have to pass verification process in Gevesis Vision platform. As usual to become a manager in any broker you have to pass full verification process (including KYC).  Quote from: kraterion on October 09, 2017, 08:12:45 PM Quote from: genesis.vision on October 09, 2017, 04:23:57 PM Unfortunately, alpha version will be launched in the first quarter of 2018. Currently we have a working solution, but it is not decentralised. Let me explain the situation with current solution: It is not a prototype, but already built solution, which already sold to more than 80 companies in the world. Unfortunately, this solution is not open-source, so we could not provide you with the code. So we put this to the blockchain, and  in the first quarter of 2018, it will be ready.  OK, understood, you think there will be at least a chance to see a video about it? And what do you mean by ""sold""? You sold your centralized solution but the decentralized one will be open-source as far as I understood. Why buy a product when it will be open-source soon? Centralized solution was sold because it is in high demand.

But if some bad manager lost all investors money, can you influence to him and prohibit him trading more?  i think thats the risk everybody should take on his own. trusting managers always involves a (higher or lower risk)  that's why there will be a reputation system implemented. so people can judge the performance of the manager. this rating will be very useful, and everyone will be able to choose a more successful manager, of course this does not give a 100% guarantee, but still the chances that your funds will increase significantly will grow  Won't the performance of the managers also be visible by how much percentage growth they accomplish?  Judge them by the numbers. Sure statistics will show all profits and losts results.

So your partners include 400 brokers around the world...nice! And what about cryptocurrencies exchanges? Afaik they aren't brokers because when people buy tokens, they buy other people's tokens.  you mean, that they have already 400 partner brokers? Or they planning? Our partners' companies have been engaged in technological maintenance and software development for brokerage companies, mainly in foreign exchange markets. All of these companies are potential brokers for the project. Considering our more than 400 contacts with brokerages among our partners and advisers, we expect at least 100 brokerages to join our distributed system within 2 years.

You can see our team on the website. We are planning to expand the stuff in 5 times.  Quote from: greatteager on October 09, 2017, 09:46:33 PM Educate me in what is the meaning of a transparent investment system? Why should a trader show his knowledge to everyone? Because there are some advantages for managers: • There are increased opportunities to attract investors from any country • Managers issue their own branded cryptocurrency, which can be freely traded by investors. • There are excellent opportunities for promoting your own trading strategy to attract more investors. • There is increased investor confidence, due to guaranteed transparency, which will lead to an increase in the average investor's check.  Quote from: greatteager on October 09, 2017, 09:18:03 PM I look at the road map and see that the alpha version will be released in 2018. Why should I buy tokens on ICO? just for the sake of bonuses? It is your decision to buy tokens or not. To support the development of the innovative Genesis Vision, you can buy our token.  Quote from: pynetx on October 10, 2017, 04:42:37 AM I read somewhere that there are 7 levels of investments limits but, I could not find the numbers anywhere. There will be 7 trust levels totally, and traders will each have a level based on their trading history and whether this history was successful or not. Level 1 managers are required to have at least 1 000 USD in GVT equivalent of their own funds on the platform and their maximum investment pool can be only 1 000 USD worth of GVT. More trusted managers will be able to attract investments up to 1 000 000 USD in GVT equivalent.  Quote from: R.Hasan on October 10, 2017, 08:26:57 AM Regarding the use of the Blockchain technology behind the project. Is the Blockchain necessary? I think the business problem doesn’t really exist, isn’t significant enough and cannot be solved by a Blockchain. What are key features of GenesisVision that set it apart from other options? And the market size is truly as big as the ICO claims and that the solution is possible. Evidence please? The trust management market is growing rapidly every year. According to the Boston Consulting Group report Global Asset Management 2016, the total amount of funds in management is more than $70 trillion. Despite the industry's steady growth, existing trust management mechanisms do not meet the requirements of modern investors and managers. Trust management industry suffers from fakers, unfair money managers, hidden processes and strong regulation. There is no consolidated reliable source of information or statistics. This leads to serious limitations, lack of information, lack of transparency and, consequently, a lack of trust.  By using the blockchain technology, Genesis Vision unites huge trust management industry into a single decentralized network, making the financial market transparent and even more global. This will help to re-establish trust in the market and open up new avenues for investment in the digital era.  We recommend you to read our whitepaper.

Quote from: R.Hasan on October 10, 2017, 09:39:23 AM How big is the market? Have you done the math to determine your total addressable Market? The trust management market is growing rapidly every year. According to PwC analysis[1], global investable assets for the asset management industry will increase to more than $100 trillion by 2020, with a compound annual growth rate of nearly 6%.  Quote from: kraterion on October 10, 2017, 04:59:39 PM Profits are going to be paid in GVT right? Because it's what I'm reading in the whitepaper, ""GVT will be used for all investment operations, profit distributions, and managers’ token trading on the internal exchange."" Yes, profit will be distributed in GVT, as well as all investment operations.  Quote from: tiger5056 on October 10, 2017, 05:23:29 PM start date 15 oct.

But the second question, probably I could not properly ask. That's what I mean. Suppose the manager sold 1,000 coins for $ 1. Then the manager got a profit and now has $ 10,000. Then these coins, which already own investors, also increase in price to $ 10? And to get your profit, the investor can just sell these coins? Or the second option: the manager pays to all holders of coins profit in proportion to the number of coins they have? And then the owners of coins can receive profit from the manager while owning coins? In the first variant, the profit itself does not directly go to investors. In the second variant the profit goes to them directly, minus the remuneration of the manager (commission). From the documents, I did not quite understand how exactly the profit is made by investors. Holders of coins receive part of the profits of the manager, according to their share. The investor has the right to transfer coins to another Ethereum wallet or sell on the internal exchange. A manager doesn't distribute the profit, the profit will be distributed automatically by the smart contract. The second varient is true - ""the profit goes to them directly, minus the remuneration of the manager (commission).""

So $2.3M is the equivalent value of GVT, reserved for the ICO stage.  An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) during a certain period or on a specific date (exercise date).  Genesis Vision option guarantees the right to acquire GVT tokens at a specified price during the ICO, so you have to pay only 5% on Pre-ICO and the remaining 95% you will have to pay during the ICO.

And about forex platforms, are you sure they're gonna move their funds into the eth blockchain? Only platform I see around it will be spectre because the broker is basically a smart contract First of all, we would like to note that we already have partners preceding our launch who will provide an active client base (our partners include 400 brokers around the world). “Fair” brokers will be happy to join Genesis Vision and confirm their transparency publicly.  These factors will lead to Genesis Vision network being big enough to provide incentives for brokers, who currently have something to hide. In this situation, the initiative usually comes not from a broker, but from his clients, desiring to participate in Genesis Vision. Since our platform provides many advantages for brokers’ clients, brokers, rejecting connection to Genesis Vision will simply start losing clients. For example, if an investor wants to get access to the huge list of Genesis Vision’s managers, and his current broker refuses to join the network, he will probably decide to change the broker. Luckily, Genesis Vision’s client base of brokers will be already big enough to choose from. In this way, each non-transparent broker has a choice, either stick to obsolete operation model or move forward in transparent and fair future together with Genesis Vision.

The only thing you can do afterwards is to deprecate that manager so that other people will not invest in him  But he also lost him trust and rating? Right? So, we must choose only trusted managers... Of course, you always have to look at managers rating because it depends on trading statistics.

That makes no sense to me  Let's divide the notions of a manager and broker. Managers are companies/individuals/traders with a proven trading history, ready to acquire investors' money for management. Brokers are companies that have the appropriate licenses to carry out brokerage activities.Through brokers, traders have access to trading financial instruments on exchange and over-the-counter markets. Broker can instull Genesis Vision software, which is free and distributed with an open license. Brokers doen't trade, but can provide potential managers’ access to the Genesis Vision Manager registration function in their client application - generally a ""Become a Genesis Vision Manager"" button.  Quote from: okspam on October 09, 2017, 06:27:21 AM Can someone please ELI5 me what this platform does? No fancy words. Trust management industry suffers from fakers, unfair money managers, hidden processes and strong regulation. There is no consolidated reliable source of information or statistics. This leads to serious limitations, lack of information, lack of transparency and, consequently, a lack of trust. The main goal of Genesis Vision is to bring transparency and stability to the traditional financial markets.

Probably it will be regulated somehow, like max commission will be set or something similar. Quote from: autolove2 on October 09, 2017, 12:41:01 PM Which comissions managers taking for himself? May I choose tokens? Or only managers? Yes, you are right. Manager sets all parameters of trading by himself. But there will be some reasonable limitis. It is early to determine the exact numbers on the development stage.  Quote from: viljy on October 09, 2017, 01:13:16 PM I would like to consider several issues that are not entirely clear to me: Investors buy manager coins, which the manager can only create for the amount of his deposit? (for example, at $ 1000 creates 1000 coins). Or can a manager create any number of his coins? These coins give the investor the right to profit only from the originally invested funds, and the manager gives profit in exchange for coins? Or can you own coins for a long time and constantly make a profit? Manager's tokens are equal to amount of the deposit. Genesis Vision platform is powered by Ethereum smart contracts, which are basically open-source apps running on the blockchain. Smart contracts are coded in a way that will allow on-demand creation of new tokens — manager’s tokens. Each new registered manager will issue his own cryptocurrency, which will be traded on the internal Genesis Vision exchange. The form of sale of manager’s tokens will depend on the form of coins issue. During initial manager’s token issue, coins will be sold by a manager directly and their price will be fixed. In any event, the maximum market capitalization of a manager token (maximum investment pool) depends on the trust level of a manager. After the initial sale is finished, manager tokens will be freely traded between users of Genesis Vision on the platform own exchange. From that point on, the price will be unpinned. It will be defined entirely by the market based on how successful a manager is.

If you invest any amount of money into a certain manager's coins, you profit depends on a manager's investing abilities (minus the above mentioned commissions). Are they going to show the manager's investment record or at least statistics? This would be extremely helpful in choosing a manager. Investors have access to managers from all over the world. Information is available on their trading and profit statistics, which will be accessible in one place. All managers’ trades will be automatically verified, uploaded, and recorded in a smart contract, building a trustworthy trading history and statistics.  Quote from: Rigorous on October 09, 2017, 03:04:38 PM I am 5 and what is a trust manager? What is a portfolio and what is investing? I don't understand anything you just said! Trust management is a form of interrelationship of an investor and a finance manager (trustee). Under the trust management an investor (a private individual or an organization) delivers financial assets for trust management by a third party on preliminarily agreed conditions. Managers Management funds/traders are companies/individuals with a proven trading history, ready to acquire investors' money for management. Investors Investors do not trade in the market directly. Instead, investors transfer their funds to experienced traders who manage the funds for them. Investors get their shares from their managers’ profits. Brokers Brokers are companies that have the appropriate licenses to carry out brokerage activities. Through brokers, traders have access to trading financial instruments on exchange and over-the-counter markets.

Quote from: Jay2408 on October 07, 2017, 09:01:17 AM As no one will have a trust history at platform launch, ALL managers will start at trust level 1, right? Yes, you are right!  Quote from: haxllega on October 07, 2017, 09:42:06 AM Hello everybody! I did German translation for Genesis. If you are from Germany feel free to visit. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2243348.0 Thank you for your work! Stakes were credited. We offer you to translate our whitepaper into German. You can inform @mia in telegram channel (DM) about your desigion.  Quote from: Elkmar on October 07, 2017, 01:57:13 PM I did not really understand, the presale was cancelled, or their was a preorder for the presale ? I'm quite confused here. Our pre-sale was based on the option’s sale. Genesis Vision option guarantees the right to acquire GVT tokens at a specified price during the ICO, so you have to pay only 5% on Pre-ICO and the remaining 95% you will have to pay during the ICO. So we have pre-order on $2.3 M  Quote from: magisterr on October 07, 2017, 01:54:38 PM Quote We hadn't a pre-sale hard cap. Our pre-sale was in form of Options sale. So $2.3M is the equivalent value of GVT, reserved for the ICO stage. A hard cap of ICO is 33.000.000 usd  So, all remaining tokens from pre-sale will be sold on main sale? Right? Yes, you are right. Bonuses from other types of options will be moved to the ICO: During the first 3 days of ICO (15.10–17.10) investors will have bonus 20% The week after (18.10–24.10) bonus 15% The week after (25.10–31.10) bonus 10%  Quote from: Rigorous on October 07, 2017, 10:24:34 AM Well dang. If there is so much demand I guess we do not have to worry about minimum caps and that ""flexible funding"" would cut features at all. More the opposite, are potential investors going to miss the boat? We don't think so because we have detailed plan for capturing the market and none miss the boat    Quote from: kraterion on October 07, 2017, 02:29:20 PM For what I understood in pre-sale they sold options to be redeemed during ICO not actual tokens. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong genesis.vision We need to tell more about the essence of the process for investors to understand the further steps better.  Usually, ICO generates overwhelming interest on the first days of launch and during this period token sale transaction number could reach millions within few hours. This giant queue of transactions is sent directly to the Ethereum network, clogging Ethereum blockchain, which causes massive transaction delays and transaction fees to skyrocket, making the network unusable for hours.  In addition, the very time of ICO launch may be inconvenient for the investors – due to the geographical dispersion of investors, participation for many of them maybe complicated by the fact that the launch of ICO falls on a deep night in their timezone.  In overall, early investment bonuses are often given not to actual first supporters, but to those who managed to be the first to carry out a transaction in the blockchain. Implementation of the smart contract-based token option solves all of those problems.  To solve the mentioned problems related to ordinary ICO process Genesis Vision team launched a special option program for ICO participation. This way the company gave the participants’ a guarantee to acquire GVT tokens at a specific price during the core ICO. Options also give some additional bonuses for tokens amount, and can allow early supporters to book their tokens in advance at a price they consider fair.  Quote from: FIEX on October 07, 2017, 04:41:35 PM I dont like the idea to stop a presale! If transactions are stuck in the blockchain, so be it. If the transaction will go to Genesis Vision after the pre-sale was sold out, they just get there funds back and they can try again during the ICO.  What about the ICO will it be stopped if there is a big backlog? No! So why do it for a presale? Options are one of the most difficult financial instruments. Not all investors are familiar with it and understand how it works. Considering the feedback from the community, we decided to stop it.  Quote from: sockpuppet1911 on October 08, 2017, 08:51:08 AM If i have understood correctly, only exchange owners can be brokers and they have to install a software to participate...

Most projects this days show a demo/pre-alpha before/during ICO, I think it's important, there a lot of ICOs right now, only trustworthy ones gain popularity/trust Alpha version will be launched in the first quarter of 2018  Quote from: magisterr on October 05, 2017, 04:38:08 PM history? may be you can make live statistic? Let me explain. During the reporting period, the manager trades on his or her trading platform with the amount of funds available at the beginning. The history of its trading is unloaded from the trading platform and recorded in IPFS in real time.  Quote from: haxllega on October 05, 2017, 05:24:43 PM I think successful traders will be well-known soon so there is no use in live statistics. Will the trader be able to communicate with his supporters? We will make a featuring list. And it's issues will be realized on demand.  Quote from: Heimer on October 05, 2017, 06:20:03 PM I think that there will be some kind of ranking system and traders will have special channels to communicate with investors and post some updates/spreadseets, etc. Regarding rancking there are 7 levels in total, with the first-level manager maximum investments capped at 1 000 USD ( in GVT equivalent) plus a first-level manager must invest 1 000 USD of his own money. For comparison, manager of a maximum trust level can receive investments up to 1 000 000 dollars.  Quote from: Cauchy on October 05, 2017, 07:06:29 PM After finished Reading the whitepaper I am curious about some of the challenges with etherium that you point out, especially the scaling/performance issues. However as we expect to have them solved in 2-3 years you might run into problems depending on the Projects success. You mention that you have looked at other chains that would be possible to transition to, out of curiosity would you mind telling which chain(s) that would be most probable to transition to? There are some interesting existing chains to transition to and much more are under development. As far as it hard to predict future of blockchain in half a year we haven't choosen a specific chain to transition to yet.  Quote from: cantdecide on October 05, 2017, 11:39:42 PM So when the manager themself can choose the length of the reporting period, can they choose freely or will the platform itself have specific time frames, like 1 week, 2 weeks, etc.? Is there any limitation for managers or could they just say like 8 weeks and then it is like this? There are will be variants for managers to choose in the platform.  Quote from: Cauchy on October 06, 2017, 09:39:40 AM I would like to ask the team to elaborate on which key challenges they will meet to ensure mass market adoption and how they plan to overcome these. Please note that I dont mean the technical challenges as outlined in the whitepaper but rather Incentives models, (broker, manager, Investor)-interest etc. thanks Genesis vision has a detailed plan for capturing the market. First of all: Tools For Brokers (a company of Genesis Vision co-founder, Alexey Kutsenko) already sells a similar centralized solution that is installed in the environment of a particular broker. This software was purchased by more than eighty different companies around the world. The total turnover of funds through this trust management system amounted to more than $100 billion.  As soon as alpha version of Genesis Vision is launched (1Q 2018) our first goal is to attract these existing clients. Average investment per month in retail FX market is about 1000 USD(500-2000 depending on the region). According to statistic I have, total traded amount in a month close to 5x times of the deposit, which means 5k USD (traders opens/closes trades, so total turnover will be around 5k USD per 1 investor per month).  Our goal is to link at least 10-15 brokers to the moment of the release, and it should bring us 10,000 – 15,000 investors into our system. So total expected turnover in first months will be around 50,000,0000 – 75,000,000 USD.  I would like to point out that this turnover already exceeds the GVT capitalization during the ICO, so we expect GVT growth in value.  Quote from: pynetx on October 06, 2017, 09:56:06 AM Are there some star traders you guys plan to bring on the platform while starting up? Of course we are planning that with starting of the platform a lot of successful managers will begin their work in Genesis Vision. However all the managers will start from a scratch.  Quote from: the_donald on October 06, 2017, 12:43:31 PM True, activity in the thread would be nice, but also some marketing is needed for this. I don't think I've seen any banners or commercials on social media for this project. Thank you, we will enhance our marketing!  Quote from: Yasemin on October 06, 2017, 01:42:01 PM I read that the number of tokens is limited to 44.000.000 and total token sale is 33.000.000. What happens to the rest of the 11.000.000 tokens? 44,000,000 tokens will be created in total, of which 36,960,000 (33,000,000 for sale, 3,960,000-marketing, advisers and bounty) will be distributed to the ICO participants, 2,200,000 will be reserved for a fund and 4,840,000 will be circulated among the team.  Quote from: levyashin on October 06, 2017, 02:23:49 PM I saw that dev wrote that there is not a soft cap. Did he mean, we hit hard cap or else we will cancel the project. Or We are going to make project real regardless of the funds. The logical thinking is the second one is. But if it was the issue he should have said, we already hit the soft cap. Anybody have any ideas? Yes, we don't have a soft cap. Even if we don't reach a hard cap we are not killing our project. The budget and components are planned, assuming that our fundraising efforts will reach the estimated maximum amount. Otherwise, a part of the components will have to be abandoned, and the budget will be reduced for the remaining features.  Quote from: magisterr on October 06, 2017, 03:40:02 PM How much will receive investors from his invested money, how much trader and which your comissions? ( I mean in % from profit)  Each manager will set their comission terms. The profit, received as a result of management of the total funds, is shared proportionally between the managers and investors. Managers receive a commission for management and a commission from the profit (success fee). Investor receive part of the manager's profits, according to their share, minus the manager's commission and fee. The project will receive profit from commissions on investment operations. Each investment will be charged 0.5% of the operation amount.  Quote from: chaoscoinz on October 06, 2017, 04:24:11 PM Is this platform available for use by citizens of the United States? What about the ICO, can Americans invest in this platform, or are these considered security tokens?  The platform will be serving worldwide. If it will be necessary we'll get license for legalization of our activities  Quote from: magisterr on October 06, 2017, 04:57:23 PM Only 2.3 mln for main ICO? Which hard cap for pre-sale and ICO? We hadn't a pre-sale hard cap. Our pre-sale was in form of Options sale. So $2.3M is the equivalent value of GVT, reserved for the ICO stage. A hard cap of ICO is 33.000.000 usd  Quote from: Elkmar on October 06, 2017, 04:55:31 PM What does the use of blockchain technologies or token brings in compareason to others platforms like 1broker ? Implementation of blockchain will allow trust management market to achieve transparency and efficiency on the technological level. This will help to regain the trust to the market. Besides that, it will attract the attention of new companies and the investors of the new digital generation.  Quote from: Jay2408 on October 06, 2017, 05:33:39 PM Will all managers start at trust level 1, that is with a maximum investment pool of 1,000$ worth of GVT, when the platform will be launched? Level 1 managers are required to have at least 1 000 USD in GVT equivalent of their own funds on the platform and their maximum investment pool can be only 1 000 USD worth of GVT.",False

The amount of investments you could possibly attract depends solely on your manager's level. The algorithm of the level increase will be unburdensome enough for manager to grow up really quickly if somebody buys his tokens and he makes some profit. The idea of this levels is not to make the manager's life miserable and oblige them to grind these levels. It's more of a protection for investors for the first manager's trading period while he doesn't have any verified statistics. Managers have different trust levels that define maximum investments a manager can get. There are 7 levels in total, with the first-level manager maximum investments capped at 1 000 USD ( in GVT equivalent) plus a first-level manager must invest 1 000 USD of his own money. For comparison, manager of a maximum trust level can receive investments up to 1 000 000 dollars. Quote from: kraterion on October 04, 2017, 07:31:53 PM A manager will be able to trade only cryptocurrencies? If yes I can see many cryptotraders join as managers to take advantage of this.

Quote from: tiger5056 on October 04, 2017, 09:16:14 PM how this option program work to purchase token? Genesis Vision option guarantees the right to acquire GVT tokens at a specified price during the ICO, so you have to pay only 5% on Pre-ICO and the remaining 95% you will have to pay during the ICO. Options will also give additional bonuses for tokens’ amount. Currently, options program is finished!

Looks like they have removed the numeric counter. I think it is roughly 1.5musd options sold. They warrant a 20x the option investment opportunity at buyin when mainsale starts not including the additional bonus. Is this the first time an ICO sells options? And can those options on GVT be traded like options on traditional stocks? This could pose an interesting new development in ICO land. Yes, Options program was for the first time ever! We believe that one day it may become a common practice, taking into account all benefits it can provide. Technically, options can be traded like options on traditional stocksб but we didn't place them on exchanges, since we used them for other purposes.

I image it will depend on the manager how he will decide to run the fund? When investors purchase coins, GVTs are transferred to a broker's account, where they are converted to required currency and transferred to a manager's trading account. Coin holders receive part of the manager's profits, according to their share, minus the manager's commission and fee. The investor has the right to transfer coins or sell on the internal exchange. The investor can withdraw invested money, but only at the end of the reporting period, having previously created an application for withdrawal. In the case of returns, the investor receives the money according to his or her share, and the coins are returned to the manager for further sale on the internal exchange. Managers themselves choose the length of the reporting period, according to their trading strategies.",False

Quote from: lvsca on October 03, 2017, 10:30:02 PM another social trading platform, right? or some one can explain with simple definition for this program? i didn't understand. Genesis Vision is not exactly a platform for social trading, but a decentralized platform for trust management.  In fact, it is a core of trust management process, which unites already existing and operating exchanges, brokers, traders and investors. Quote from: greatteager on October 03, 2017, 10:49:53 PM Do you have a video review? Tell us about your partners, if they don't exist then when are you planning? The most detailed video review for now you can find here: https://youtu.be/0rUTSbsZtHM Our partners include more than 400 companies, which are clients of Tools For Brokers, a company of Genesis Vision co-founder, Alexey Kutsenko. Apart from that, our advisory board is formed by owners of Divisa Capital, Genova Global Hedge Fund, Changelly, Lykke which are our partners as well.

Am i understanding it correctly? It's a platform for professional traders. We will look and see their success ratio and put our money to trader to make his trades for us or just copy his trades.Like 1broker's function? And every professional trader would have his own coin.  Hi! Not exactly - the platform will allow all people to manage investments, however, some check are implemented to insure investors interests. But the main mechanism is that, indeed, all investors will be able to see the most successful traders and invest with them by buying their token. 1broker, Etoro and Zulutrade are all centralized platforms, but only Genesis Vision can be genuinely honest and transparent, every piece of info on the platform can be checked and verified. Invest with them by buying their tokens? I don't quite understand what it means. Could you please elaborate a bit on why would investors will buy trader's tokens? Why not just buy whatever a top rated trader is buying. The profit of each manager is shared between hit tokens’ holders. The amount of tokens of each particular manager is limited. You can’t just copy trades of top manager since his trading history is not published in real time due to the manager’s strategy protection Quote from: the_donald on October 04, 2017, 06:20:32 AM Quote from: FIEX on October 04, 2017, 06:04:04 AM Quote from: genesis.vision on October 03, 2017, 11:34:13 PM Quote from: Rigorous on October 03, 2017, 09:33:38 PM Why is it called Genesis Vision?

Can someone from the team say anything about how that name came to be? I am guessing genesis = blockchain, vision = transparency. Hi!

Ireland is very Loyal for ICO, what confirmed by Deloitte analyze. We have no legal risks based on upcoming regulation or restrictions of ICOs Quote from: niklasmato on October 04, 2017, 06:53:20 AM So if I understand correctly. The genesis vision idea started at the hackrussia hackathon? And you guys won in the category fintech/blockchain? Or am I misreading this information? Yes, you got it correctly.

Invest with them by buying their tokens? I don't quite understand what it means. Could you please elaborate a bit on why would investors will buy trader's tokens? Why not just buy whatever a top rated trader is buying. Correct me if im wrong, as i understand it now. If we buy the token, we are basicly buying a part of the investors portfolio? And investor will have more money to invest. So its like a staking thing, where u buy his token, he has more money in portfolio and you get a piece of that portfolio. So if the investor does well, your token is worth more. That means Genesis token holders will get profit from each profitable trade? No, there are two types of tokens on Genesis Vision platform: 1) GVT is internal currency of our platform; it is used for all investment operations and profit distributions. It exists mainly to unlink the currency of investor with the trading asset of manager and make it unified. GVT will be freely traded on external cryptocurrency exchanges. 2)Manager’s token is the instrument for attracting investments for this particular manager. These tokens are “internal”, they can be bought from manager and afterwards can be freely traded on internal Genesis Vision exchange. Holders of manager’s tokens will receive the share of manager’s profit at the end of each reporting period. Quote from: Cauchy on October 04, 2017, 08:27:14 AM Can anyone from the team please communicate when we can expect a final version of the whitepaper? (as it is currently in draft status) thanks I would describe current version of whitepaper as “very stable”. We haven’t done any changes to it for almost 1 month. So the concept is pretty much finalized and won’t have any significant changes. Quote from: Elkmar on October 04, 2017, 09:28:54 AM Hello, what are the main competitors for this project ? I don't know much about trust management. We can name social trading platforms (like Etoro and Zulutrade) as our competitors, even though they are not related to the blockchain technology. Quote from: levyashin on October 04, 2017, 10:46:18 AM Quote from: pynetx on October 04, 2017, 07:18:41 AM Quote from: Mystic90 on October 04, 2017, 06:23:05 AM Quote from: pynetx on October 04, 2017, 05:05:28 AM Quote from: genesis.vision on October 03, 2017, 01:25:21 PM Quote from: levyashin on October 03, 2017, 10:15:19 AM Still not sure about that. I'm trying to summarise the things in my head.  If a manager has a token and he is doing well, the token price will rise cause everybody wants a piece of the portfolio.  So token will be created by a manager and he will sell them to investors. For example, He made 100.000 tokens and sold 50.000 of it. So he has %50 of his portfolio and market has %50.  If it is true then, Portfolio value = his start-up money + investments?  And if he is good and makes a profit 100.000$. Will he take 50.000 and investors got 50.000?   If he lost nearly all of it, no money to divide and 0 token value. Almost correct, except the fact that the part of manager’s portfolio is not connected to his tokens. His part of portfolio is his own funds on his trading account. So in your example, manager should have $50k of his own funds, to share the profit 50/50 with his investors, who bought $50k worth of his tokens. Quote from: dsutil on October 04, 2017, 11:38:41 AM Hi all. I have invest some ETH in the PRE- ICO one hour ago and It doesn't show the transaction in the transaction history yet. Is it that normal? Yes,today, payments in ETH were processed with delay.ETH transactions in queue were processed. Has your transaction been confirmed? Quote from: Heimer on October 04, 2017, 11:47:03 AM Quote from: Elkmar on October 04, 2017, 09:28:54 AM Hello, what are the main competitors for this project ? I don't know much about trust management. I thing that there will be competing with other trusts management companies and maybe even with investments funds. Probably their biggest competitor will be BlackMoon No, Blackmoon are not our competitors.At first glance, our projects are similar as both of them are aimed at the asset management market. But the fundamental difference is that the Blackmoon builds its own assets management Funds. The number of these Funds is limited, and each of them has a company-like structure and executes its own specific fund management strategy. Unlike the Blackmoon, we are aimed to the private trust management sector with already existing money managers and Funds. We unite already operating brokers and money managers from Forex, Stock markets, hedge Funds, crypto asset managers and so forth. We don’t change the way of trading for our managers; we don’t control their strategies. We only unite all of them in a single decentralized network and make the process of investment and profit distribution transparent and stable. Additionally, we provide the instrument to check the statistics of each particular manager since our investors should be confident that all profits are real.

Well I wouldn't say theses funds suck like hell, but they could be better of course. So if the platform is open for everyone as long as the traders are professional, you could technical also build up an fund there? 5% GVT will form the Genesis Vision fund. Tokens from this fund will be regularly invested in successful platform managers. We plan to keep the fund operating regardless of the profit it generates, constantly stimulating Genesis Vision managers’ activity.

You are buying now tokens with 30% bonus, but you just have to pay 5% now and later you pay the rest during the ICO, did I got it right? Yes, you are right. Option guarantees the right to acquire GVT tokens at a specified price during the ICO, so you have to pay only 5% on Pre-ICO and the remaining 95% you will have to pay during the ICO.Options will give a bonuses for tokens’ amount - 30%.  As soon as all 30% options are sold, the option sale will be stopped. We have less than 40% of GVOT30 left.",False

I understand that we mean the withdrawal from the system of fiat money in both cases, well, or btc, eth. So explain why there is a contradiction? How can an investor dispose of his funds with respect to withdrawals from your system? Money supple GVT is concluded in a smart contract. And how to control coins of managers?

So token will be created by a manager and he will sell them to investors. For example, He made 100.000 tokens and sold 50.000 of it. So he has %50 of his portfolio and market has %50.  If it is true then, Portfolio value = his start-up money + investments?  And if he is good and makes a profit 100.000$. Will he take 50.000 and investors got 50.000?

GVT is an internal currency of our platform; it is used for all investment operations and profit distributions. It exists mainly to unlink the currency of investor with the trading asset of manager and make it unified. GVT will external currency and will be freely traded on external cryptocurrency exchanges. We will provide an automated way to convert crypto and fiat to GVT and vise versa via the cryptoexchange gateway.  Manager’s token is the instrument for attracting investments for this particular manager. These tokens are “internal”; they can be bought from the manager and afterwards can be freely traded on internal Genesis Vision exchange. Holders of manager’s tokens will receive the share of manager’s profit at the end of each reporting period. Quote from: Cauchy on October 03, 2017, 05:29:48 PM I like this Project. I bought a stake in the presale. Also enjoyed the approach of buying an option for use in the main sale. Nice addition to token sale mechanics from fiat World. Best of luck to the Project. Thank you!We think that options are a very good financial instrument for ICO programs. We believe that one day it may become a common practice, taking into account all benefits it can provide. Quote from: Rigorous on October 03, 2017, 05:31:16 PM Quote from: PewPewGoesTheDuck on October 03, 2017, 05:03:27 PM When I have some more free time I'll dig into the whitepaper. Speaking of which, if there is one tip I can give startups concerning whitepapers it would be: Do not give your whitepaper a generic name like ""white-paper-eng.pdf"". I have downloaded a ton of whitepapers by now. I have taught myself the habit to rename them properly. Most people will not. And they will not be able to find your whitepaper a few hours later after downloading, let alone after several days. They will have a download list or PDF reader's recent files list filled with ""whitepaper.pdf"", ""whitepaper(1).pdf"", ""whitepaper(2).pdf"". You may be losing a potential investor that way. Here are some ideas: ""Genesis Vision White Paper.pdf"" ""GenesisVision-Whitepaper.pdf"" ""WhitePaper_ GenesisVision.pdf"" You made a remark to the point! Thank you, we should take this advice. Quote from: magisterr on October 03, 2017, 05:48:32 PM Quote Investors do not trade in the market directly. Instead, investors transfer their funds to experienced traders who manage the funds for them. Investors get their shares from their managers’ profits. If someone trader lost my money, than I lost also all my money? Or ill have some funds insure?   How many % Ill receive from their pfrofit? Hi!Yes, if the manager lost the balance then you will lose your investment. There is no any insure. But you have manager's cryptocurrency and if he made a profit later - you will receive the share of his profit at the end of each reporting period. Quote Well just started looking at this coin. I must say the video is really looking Nice. I don't fully grasp what the system will do, but I see integrations planned in 2018 with several market leader platforms. Hi! Perfectly noted! We plan integration with: MT4/MT5, FIX/FAST protocol, Crypto-exchanges, SDK for integration with our platform, Integration with exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, CME, MOEX, LSE, JPX, SSE, SZSE, SEHK, NSE, BSE). Quote from: matjas on October 03, 2017, 06:18:38 PM How will a manager prove his trading history when this platform will just launch and how long history are we talking about here. I will follow this thread to get better understanding of your idea. All traders will start trading with zero since there is no reliable trade statistics at present time. Quote from: kraterion on October 03, 2017, 06:23:31 PM Quote from: psy0 on October 03, 2017, 06:01:48 PM I personally think the trust system itself is flawed as you may never now when a user decides to perform an exit. He might have very good feedbacks but could exit at the end... Or the trust can be easily faked... Why would we need a decentralized trust system? Was wondering this too, brokers activities are recorded on blockchain, ok, but what if a broker decide to quit operations and scam investors? It's like hella easy to withdraw all investors' money, a couple of transfers here, a couple anon coins there and moneys are disappeared.

The manager can leave a request for deposit/withdrawal of his own funds from his trading account, which will be processed at the end of the reporting period. In this case, the amount of remaining funds should not be less than the minimum amount. Quote from: Rigorous on October 03, 2017, 09:33:38 PM Why is it called Genesis Vision? From the name I would not expect it has anything to do with financial markets. Then again with BlackRock or Vanguard are not that descriptive either. Can someone from the team say anything about how that name came to be? I am guessing genesis = blockchain, vision = transparency. Hi!

The profit, received as a result of management of the total funds, is shared proportionally between the managers and investors. Managers receive a commission for management and a commission from the profit (success fee).  Investors Investors do not trade in the market directly. Instead, investors transfer their funds to experienced traders who manage the funds for them. Investors get their shares from their managers’ profits.

Our platform will allow people to manage all investments types. We will develop the project for all markets including stock markets, cryptocurrency markets, futures markets, and so forth.  Quote from: haxllega on October 03, 2017, 01:57:10 PM It would be great if they will release a demo or beta before ICO! Unfortunately, we don't have any working prototype. Alpha version will be released at the first quarter of 2018. Currently, we have a working solution, but it is not decentralised. Let me explain the situation with current solution: It is not a prototype, but already built solution, which already sold to more than 80 companies in the world. Unfortunately, this solution is not open-source, so we could not provide you with the code.  Quote from: magisterr on October 03, 2017, 02:47:27 PM this looks like Dash coin project (platform for traders)? Or this platfrom for adversiting project? Or what main concept of your idea? Can you tell me, please  Hi! In a nutshell, Genesis Vision is the world’s first blockchain based decentralized private trust management platform! Unlike other blockchain projects connected with trust management, we don’t limit our target audience with the crypto world only. Our first goal is to bring the transparency and stability to the traditional financial markets such as forex, stock markets, hedge funds and so forth. Our team has a great experience in developing financial software, and traditional trust money management systems mixed with deep blockchain knowledge. We want to bring indispensable blockchain technology advantages to the long existing industry, which is currently suffering from fakers, unfair money managers, hidden processes and strong regulations. These factors cause limitedness due to the lack of information, the lack of transparency and consequently the lack of trust. And the Genesis Vision is a unique solution to these problems. Quote from: Elkmar on October 03, 2017, 03:02:25 PM I don't really understand the use of the broker.  It's contrary to decentralization and it impacts the profits generated by the managers no ?  Hi! Through brokers, traders have access to trading financial instruments on exchange and over-the-counter markets. Our cooperation with financial brokers was chosen as the starting point of the project.  At present, brokers have the technical ability to influence the data on the trade history and statistics of their managers. Implementation of blockchain will allow to achieve transparency and efficiency on the technological level.  Quote from: magisterr on October 03, 2017, 03:53:11 PM Quote Hi! Not exactly - the platform will allow all people to manage investments, however, some check are implemented to insure investors interests. But the main mechanism is that, indeed, all investors will be able to see the most successful traders and invest with them by buying their token.  1broker, Etoro and Zulutrade are all centralized platforms, but only Genesis Vision can be genuinely honest and transparent, every piece of info on the platform can be checked and verified.  But same concept want to make Dash coin. So you will have competitor already? Or your platform more expanded?  Coindash it is social trading with ICO tokens.It has its own assets management Fund. Our platform allows to work with any set of financial instruments We unite already operating brokers and money managers from Forex, Stock markets, hedge Funds, crypto asset managers and so forth. We don’t change the way of trading for our managers; we don’t control their strategies. We only unite all of them in a single decentralized network and make the process of investment and profit distribution transparent and stable.",False

Excellent question!  When we speak about Risk Management solution for brokers regarding currency conversion, we speak about a system which will show them their risks and liabilities in different currencies. Such kind of systems used by regulated brokers, due to regulators rules, but for fiat currency.  We will explain the very simplified version of such system because it is too complicated and consists of many parameters: So for example, all regulated European FX brokers need to calculate several risk parameters in EUR, but their customers could trade on many different currency pairs like GPB/USD, GBP/CHF, NZD/CAD, etc. And there are a lot of clients, and all of them could be in market in different directions(Long/Short, etc.) In this case, brokers need to understand how much liabilities they have in case of all these currencies, and in EUR as well.  It shows to brokers how their currency liabilities changes in dynamic while their client's trade, and allow them to understand if they need to exchange one currency to another to prevent rate risks, etc.  So, what we could offer them, is the same system, but based on GVT rate. So they will be able to understand 'when' and 'how much' they need to exchange from or to GVT. We have a partner who has great experience in such systems. So, how it will help broker: broker will not need to make conversation each time when someone deposit or withdraw some specific currency (like GVT) but make it time by time. So it will dramatically lower amount of conversions, which will lead to lower total commission and fewer risks.",False

Unlike other blockchain projects connected with trust management, we don’t limit our target audience with the crypto world only. Our first goal is to bring the transparency and stability to the traditional financial markets such as forex, stock markets, hedge funds and so forth.  Our team has a great experience in developing financial software, and traditional trust money management systems mixed with deep blockchain knowledge. We want to bring indispensable blockchain technology advantages to the long existing industry, which is currently suffering from fakers, unfair money managers, hidden processes and strong regulations. These factors cause limitedness due to the lack of information, the lack of transparency and consequently the lack of trust. And the Genesis Vision is a unique solution to these problems.  Our partners' companies have been engaged in technological maintenance and software development for brokerage companies, mainly in foreign exchange markets. Their experience allows them to integrate all of the necessary software into the industry without unnecessary costs and delays or difficulties from the broker’s side. For example the co-founder of Genesis Vision Aleksey Kutsenko is CEO of Tools For Broker inc., which is servicing more than 250 companies from thirty different countries (35% - Europe, 35% - Asia, 25% - Middle East, 5% - Others). All of these companies are potential brokers for the project. At the moment, Tools For Brokers already sells a similar centralized solution that is installed in the environment of a particular broker. This software was purchased by more than eighty different companies around the world. The total turnover of funds through this trust management system amounted to more than $100 billion. Considering our more than 400 contacts with brokerages among our partners and advisers, we expect at least 100 brokerages to join our distributed system within 2 years. Since this statistics involves only existing customers, it will make Genesis Vision one of the largest blockchain applications. This will allow the project to move from the idea phase to an operating business as soon as possible.",False
