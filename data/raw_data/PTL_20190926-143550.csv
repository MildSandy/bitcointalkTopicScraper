Yet WE are still dealing with them. So can we conclude that generations of lifecycles moved on with them while having the power and solution to solve them ? Researching deeper, although WE have made good progress in 1900-2000s. Let’s look at the current trends – ⇒ 1⁄2 of the the total population (more than 3 billion people) currently live on less than $2.50 a day ⇒22,000 children die each day due to poverty-acc. to UNICEF. ⇒805 million people worldwide do not have enough food. ⇒in 2011, 165 million under the age of 5 were stunted. 3 billion smiles, covered victim under the oath of luck, fallen to the ground as petals ,waiting, dreaming about the blossoms of the past because all we ever give to them is false hope. we as humans are failing everyday to tackle the liabilities and move on to widespread positivity. In the other half of developments, technological advancements, ......WE have failed.  We founded petal to act upon poverty reduction with the utilization of solution i.e. money in a straight and direct way, the benefits of which can be seen almost immediately and of course, through some wide smiling faces.   What we do - we operate cloth manufacturing plants in one of the poorest state of india, Uttar Pradesh. we provide employment to the underprivileged and initiate education schemes for children living in slum areas.  ♥⇒free mid day meal is also provided to the workers to ensure their attendence  ♥⇒we have contracts and deals with major brands and the product is directly supplied to them.  ♥⇒50% of the revenue from all plants is kept for expansion and giving back to society in ways selected by community voting every month.  we are hosting an ico to accumulate funds to provide employment, education , food to the underprivileged while keeping in mind about the investor's benifit. in depth working of our business is explained and current operating plants can be seen in the video and whitepaper.   Whats in it for the investors ?  ♥⇒ LOW TOKEN SUPPLY ⇒ TOKEN  SUPPLY 1  MILLION ( one is for unity )  ♥⇒ REVENUE USED IN FAVOUR OF TOKEN HOLDER ⇒ 50% of revenue (4000$ per plant-per month) from the plants will be used to market buy PTL tokens to support the market. this will help in raising the token demand over time as we expand and operate 100s of plants.  ♥⇒ LISTING ON EXCHANGES ⇒NEW EXCHANGE LISTING EVERY THREE MONTHS.  ♥⇒ INITIATIVE FOR WIDESPREAD POSITIVITY ⇒ we just tried to decentralise positivity. hoping for a better future.  WHY ARE WE CREATING A TOKEN AND BASING OUR INVESTORS ON THE BLOCKCHAIN ? ⇒ An Important foundation idea of the creation of blockchain was to overthrow the forced centralization imposed on the people by the governments, who also provide less transpiracy. This idea relates to the mindset of the team at Petal who plan to take off some of the responsibilities of the world and plan to furnish and apply merits of decentralization to achieve objectives. we will also be providing complete transpiracy in every task we initiate.  During this time of corrupt governments and egoistic mentality ,this is just a small step but in the right direction. Our team might not have the best link.d in profiles but we assure you,we can make things happen. you can meet with the team at one of the plants or even have a skype chat with them.
