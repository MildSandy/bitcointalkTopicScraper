Comp Air Aviation will seek $100 million USD in unique cryptocurrency and has an option to issue more cryptocurrency product tokens for a maximum of $200 million USD.  The XFT is a multipurpose extreme fighter trainer with integrated FLiR technology and advanced augmented reality features. A flight instructor can change the dynamics of a dogfight simulation from the back seat of the XFT while aloft. The front-seat pilot will see digitally recreated images of various attack aircraft that the pilot must deal with during a real time scenario. The XFT platform is different from a ground-based simulator whereas the pilot does not feel the natural G forces of military missions. Furthermore, the XFT can partially simulate different flight envelopes allowing the pilot to feel the differences between various military aircraft behaviors during combat scenarios. The XFT is the sole platform with this capability.  The XFT can also train pilots to provide increased air support for naval as well as ground-based forces. The augmented reality visor system can place both enemy and friendly patrols on the landscape so the fighter pilot can learn to better mitigate enemy forces. The same can be done with small landing craft for covert naval operations or other special mission scenarios.  Comp Air Aviation has secured a $800 million USD order for the XFT system. Development funding will be a mixture of both traditional investment and Nimbus cryptocurrency.  Ron Lueck, CEO of Comp Air Aviation, commented, “In the aerospace industry, you have to create unique funding avenues, especially when launching something exotic like the XFT. We have been working with Nimbus for months, and I know they are the perfect fit for our needs.”  Dean Williams, Senior Executive/Business Development for Nimbus Token, said in a statement today, ""We are excited to help Comp Air with their crypto needs. The XFT is an amazing piece of aviation hardware, and we look forward to seeing it fly!""  Comp Air Aviation of Titusville, Florida, is a well-established, market leader in the design, development and production of experimental certified piston and turbine powered composite utility and private business aircraft. To date, in their 28 years of operation, produced nine different models and delivered over 500 aircraft kits and partially assembled aircrafts. These aircrafts have flown an estimated total of over 1 million total flight hours. Their aircrafts have achieved high customer satisfaction ratings in their market segments through a combination of on-target aircraft model performance, on-time delivery, good value, and leading reliability and serviceability.

The super low cost of mining. The ability to exchange product tokens (swap yoga tokens for a bicycle). The ability to get a pro rata refund for your product token purchase.

That said, we are broader based as we also include the manufacturing and service industries.  ModulTrade has some similarities but they seem to be a B2B play and do not involve the end customer.  Cryptaur has an interesting product idea. And I can kinda see how they could play in part of the space Nimbus is operating in but they don't deal with the end product or the end customer.  Kickstarter announced a Bitcoin option that looked promising. It would make them the elephant in the room for us. But Coindesk sorted that all out with this article.  All of that said, I can't find a direct competitor for our specific idea. And no one, including the above mentioned offers a barter marketplace. And our pro rata refund is simply unheard of.  Read more in our whitepaper.  Lastly, my comments should not be construed as being negative toward any of the company's I mentioned. I think they are all great ideas AND there is more than enough room in the cryptocurrency world for everyone. They do not need to perish so Nimbus Token can survive. I do NOT believe that at all.  We are all in this together.  Storm Bear Williams Founder/CEO NimbusToken.com",True
