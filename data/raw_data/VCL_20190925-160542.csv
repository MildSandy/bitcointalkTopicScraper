Thank you for visiting our bounty & airdrop. We are currently accumulating data for the Excel spreadsheet. We promise to get back to you in the very near future. For the application form, did you mean the method to participate in the bounty, or the advertisement? Most of our participation in the ads are done by putting in your post's URL on this link; https://ico.blocvehicle.com/bounty/registAirdrop Please let us know if you have any trouble. For your question, we plan to first launch the program in the Asian region first, then will move on to U.S., then Europe. Of the ninety million driving vehicles in the U.S., fifty percent is consisted of rentals. This is why by initiating our project and building up a strong basis in the Asian region, we will move on to the U.S. next. The European market is also comparable in its potential as well, since of the annual one point two billion travelers, more than half of them visit European regions. By creating an alliance with existing businesses in the regions, we plan to have our business effectively conducted in all of the three markets. This is why we have 15% of the total supply of tokens allocated to the 'country partnering', so that the said businesses will also be able to become participants in our network as well. Ultimately, our plan will breathe new life into the VCL tokens, and help create a more diverse and active economy system.",False

What you are saying is right. Without a regulated control from a third-party, price of the cars may fluctuate. What is important to note, though, is that the current centralized market has no control over the credibility of provided information - we get fraudulent deals, unacceptable rates, and 'lemon cars' happen more often than we want. If, however, we only had comparable size of car data uploaded to the blockchain network, be it six months' or an year's worth of accumulated information, the transparency in the information that we would get will be unmatched to what we are given right now. Part of what we plan to achieve is to make it so that the car owners may have the option to choose whether to have third parties (repair shops, maintenance centers, insurance companies, etc) upload their car history to the network or not. Since it is not an intermediary uploading the data, the information will have higher credibility than what we get when we ask about a car at a dealership.

It is true that there are many other programs on the market right now, that plans to share car data openly and publicly. Oracle, DB2, and Sybase, to give out some examples. It may seem similar to what we have in store, but the main difference is that these are still, a part of the DBMS(Database Management System) - a centralized infrastructure that is still susceptible to modification of data. During our 18 years of experience in the IT fields, we have seen too many admins or moderators that had influence on what information that they could provide. The only technical solution to this problem - the one that can provide complete immunity from data corruption - that we have found lies in the basis of blockchain technology.
