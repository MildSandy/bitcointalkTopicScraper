In these months of hard work we managed to develop the platform (MVP) thanks to your support. So all of us at GastroAdvisor Team would like to say ""Thank you"" to all the supporters, investors and who believed in us, in our project, and in the product we are developing. No one of our results would have been possible without your help and your unconditional trust.  We successfully collected 324.880,00 CHF (325.955,00 $) at the end of our ICO which ended January 31, 2019. Unfortunately, our ""softcap"" target was not reached for this period, but even in these difficult market conditions we were able to to collect a good part of the initially set objective. This allowed us to develop the website, the first version of the official ""MVP"" platform and run marketing to bring GastroAdvisor to greater visibility!    What will happen in the future? We of the GastroAdvisor Team will not stop working on the project, right now that the ICO is over we will focus more on the development of the platform, to provide you as soon as possible a functioning and stable service of all functions of GastroAdvisor!  The new ICO will start on March 08, 2019 soon all the details of how the token will be sold in the new ICO, regardless of the exchange factor, will be released. So you will can contribute to the further development of the platform and really take advantage of all the services offered!  As promised, we now bring our security and payment token on exchange. We already have 3 confirmed exchanges, IQFINEX, Bitrabbit and Systemcoin that will list the FORK token on these days! We are in touch with other exchanges and we are evaluating the best route and which exchange will be appropriate for GastroAdvisor, so that we can make the incredible project known to all the world!  FORK tokens SOLD: 5.652.125  FORK Burned: 5.000.000  As you know, FORK tokens are in limited quantities. At the end of each specified phase, (PrivateSale, Pre-ICO, ICO) we performed a token burn. A destroyed token is a way in which a company limits the provision of available tokens, adding value to an investor's portfolio. When the supply of tokens decreases, the demand is satisfied by a smaller number of tokens that bring added value to the portfolio. And this is what any investor wants: value creation.

Restaurant owners will have full control over all operations and transactions thanks to simple, intuitive management software created by a dedicated development team. GastroAdvisor will create the world's first blockchain-certified restaurant review feature. This will only be activated for restaurant owners who accept the FORK token and other digital currencies as a form of payment from GastroAdvisor users. GastroAdvisor analyses restaurant ratings, view history, likes, searches, follows and other user actions on the platform to establish people's tastes and coordinate the results within the SocialFood network.  These are just a few examples of what the project will allow. All this will give much more visibility to restaurants and enter a social network where they advertise their food and restaurant. Users can always be informed and can participate by assessing in real time the restaurants they visit.  And very important. Allow to pay in cryptocurrencies, uniting, at last, the real world with the cryptocurrencies in a real way.  I hope I've helped you ",False

When a user makes a booking and this booking is then confirmed by the restaurant owner, the platform will post a notification on the user's profile to let them know that they can write a review with a silver certificate.
