In the crypto space currently, we feel that there is a lack of real estate project that really tackles the issues faced by the industry as most projects have been really just focusing on the crowdfunding aspect of real estate. Though there are some that have a similar cause which is good for the industry but our focus is quite different as we are focused on the developing countries in S.E.A with most of these countries posting GDP growth of close to 7% and we have existing property investment and management businesses in the Philippines for the last 6 years. As such, we believe that the project presents an opportunity with a different focus on the real estate market.",True

As for asset acquisition, it will be more of a mid-long term plan and acquisition can be in the form of residential, commercial or even joint-development with developers or land owners.  Acquisition will also be done over careful planning where assets acquired will be for revenue generation rather than a ""quick flip"" of the assets for profits.  Also, we hope to position the IAT Platform such that it will be ready to work with government bodies when they are open to using the Blockchain for actual asset ownership transfer. At the moment, any real estate transfer over Blockchain are mostly just transfer of rights rather than the actual ownership of it.",True

That is also the reason why we were able to tie down multiple partnership including one with one of the biggest real estate agency in the Philippines, Land Asia who has under its management about 5,000 agents and brokers.  This is an excellent partnership as we will be able to tap into the agents and brokers network of clients to gain access to the home owners segment.
