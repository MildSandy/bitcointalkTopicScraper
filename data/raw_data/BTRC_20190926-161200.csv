Anyone can download a copy of the blockchain, and it can be inspected to trace the path of bitcoins from one bitcoin transaction to another. It should be noted that while there is a record of every bitcoin transaction ever made, these transactions are not inherently linked to real life identities. For this reason, Bitcoin is considered pseudonymous. Bitcoins themselves are not files stored on your computer’s hard drive like MP3s or PDFs. Rather “owning bitcoins”, means owning a bitcoin address, which has a balance recorded on the blockchain. What it means to own a bitcoin address is to control the associated Private Key, and therefore allow the signing of transactions. As Coinbase is a hosted wallet, it's not feasible to provide the private keys to individual wallet addresses doing so would prevent us from taking advantage of our secure cold-storage technology to protect your funds. This not only ensures your security but it also allows us to reduce the cost of sending digital currency to another  Coinbase account. You can always find and create new addresses to be associated with your Coinbase wallet on your Addresses page.
