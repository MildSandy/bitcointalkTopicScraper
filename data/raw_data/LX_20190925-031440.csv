It brings 6 key features:  resource identification, advanced project coordination, trustless resumes, remittance, project crowdfunding and decentralized staffing to change the way how you identify, recruit and scale your workforce.  It provides improved liquidity to conventional resource management activities by integrating 'gig economy' mechanics into an analytical project management platform. Tasks completed in Moonlight are published to a user's address on the blockchain which acts as a trustless resume. The project therefore provides a public ledger of contributor work experience and a match making algorithm to effectively fulfill project needs using a global pool of qualified contributors. This data is also leveraged by the ecosystem's project tracking and staffing tools.  WHY MOONLIGHT?  The compartmentalization of skilled resources and inability to verify previous work experience prevents employers from finding ‘the right person for the job’, and inhibits employees from finding roles they are passionate about. These issues can cause low moral and productivity within the workplace, and are detrimental to the success of any given project.  Moonlight aims to address this through a combination of trustless resumes and an employer-to-employer match making algorithm, in conjunction with a project management and remittance system. As workers are hired and complete tasks on the Moonlight platform, their experience is logged to the blockchain through smart contracts, including the skills required to complete the task, reviews from participating parties, and bid accuracy, which is the the accuracy of the time quoted to complete a task against the actual time to completion.  This will create a multidimensional and verifiable record of work experience, and will allow Moonlight to build a comprehensive recruitment solution. The inability to falsify skills and experience aims to be an improvement on current solutions such as UpWork, Freelancer and LinkedIn. By also providing project management tools comparable to Jira, Teamwork or Trello, the creation of teams and project execution can happen in once place, whilst new employees can be easily onboarded to existing projects.  WHY BLOCKCHAIN?  In a traditional centralized network, the launch of effective attacks on a central node, e.g. third-party payment intermediaries, will damage the entire system; whereas, in a decentralized blockchain network, attacks on a single node are unable to control or damage the entire system. Differing from the centralized platform, each node on the blockchain must comply with the same set of account keeping and transaction trade rules, which are based on an encryption algorithm instead of credit standing. At the same time, each transaction needs to get the consensus reached by most nodes on the network for final confirmation, thus evading the dark force of super administrator behind a centralized platform. It is the technological cause for the blockchain's ability to offer timestamp and tamper-proof transaction record.  WHY MOONLIGHT LUX TOKEN?  Through the use of Lux tokens, Moonlight intends to define GAS as the primary currency for the NEO platform. The Lux token will use a similar, multi-token UTXO operating mechanic to NEO and Neon Exchange (NEX) to provide value to token holders. Addresses holding Lux will periodically be awarded GAS proportional to their Lux holdings. The amount of Gas awarded to Lux holders is proportional to the fees collected by the Moonlight project. The Lux token will have a utility within the ecosystem. By using the token for remittance, resolvers (the organizations that fulfills a task in the system) and issuers (the organizations that creates a task in the system) will be charged reduced system fees.  TOKEN SALE DETAILS  NAME: Moonlight Lux Token TICKER NAME: LX TOTAL SUPPLY: 1,000,000,000 LX PRESALE (25%): 250,000,000 LX PUBLIC SALE (25%): 250,000,000 LX ACCEPTED FORM OF PAYMENT IN PRESALE: ETH/NEO/GAS ACCEPTED FORM OF PAYMENT IN PUBLIC SALE: NEO/GAS LX/NEO EXCHANGE RATE: 2000 LX : 1 NEO LX/GAS EXCHANGE RATE: 800 LX : 1 GAS LX/ETH EXCHANGE RATE: 15000 LX : 1 ETH COUNTRY RESTRICTIONS: Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Ethiopia, United States, ️China, Pakistan, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Yemen, Iran, Syria, Serbia and Sri Lanka. KYC/WHITELIST: OPEN NOW (REGISTER HERE!) PUBLIC SALE OPENING DATE: 11 August, 2018 at 06:00 UTC PUBLIC SALE CLOSING DATE: Token Sale will conclude either when we sell out 250 Million Lux Tokens or on August 31.  PRESALE DETAILS  MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PARTICIPANT ACCEPTED: 50 Slots PRESALE BONUS: None MINIMUM INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION PER PRESALE PARTICIPANT: 1000 NEO/2500 GAS/133.333 ETH MAXIMUM INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION PER PRESALE PARTICIPANT: 5000 NEO/12500 GAS/666.666 ETH DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF PRESALE APPLICATION FORM: 20 MAY 2018, 00:00 GMT PRESALE: Concluded on July 2, 2018 PRESALE OVERVIEW: HERE   VESTING  VESTING MECHANISM FOR PRESALE/ PUBLIC SALE TOKENS:     Token Sale Quantity                      Vesting Schedule       0 - 250,000 LX                 -            Immediately     250,001 - 5,000,000 LX       -           Token Sale End + 3 Months         5,000,001+ LX                -           Token Sale End + 6 Months  Vesting is done in a waterfall method. For example, if one purchases 10,000,000 LX, the first 250,000 LX would be available immediately after public sale, the next allocation would be available 3 months after public sale (4,750,000 LX), and the remaining 5,000,000 LX would be available 6 months after token sale.  The vesting mechanic exists to prevent market manipulation and dumping by whales, which in nearly all cases, happens in the first month after the public sale or first exchange listing. The immediately available LX allocation for presale members will be comparable to the maximum available to public sale participants.  TOKEN VESTING FOR FOUNDERS:  A relatively low percentage of funds (10%) will be reserved for the founders. Founder funds will also be spread over an 18 month period, following a linear quarterly maturation and beginning six months after the token sale ends.  Please view the addendum at the back of our white paper which outlines token and funding allocations for more detail including how we will be seeding core neo development tasks to improve the entire NEO ecosystem.

Tyler B. Adams и Michael de Wal are part of the board of City of Zion. Developers from City of Zion are especially competent in the NEO ecosystem. From the advisers’ perspective, I can especially note Ethan Fast (co-founder of City of Zion and Nex) as a strong contributor. From the partnership side one can note NEO Global Capital, City of Zion, Thor, VDT.Network and nOS. The product-hype level is growing fast. In just two weeks, the Telegram group increased from 2,000 to 10,000.  Verdict This is another project from City of Zion, which will be a part of New Smart Economy vision of Neo. Human resources and project management are problems for many organizations and industries and City of Zion offer a good solution.  Risks     The token economy is rather weak as token usage is supplementary and uses cases are limited. -1     Possible regulatory risks as token holders will receive gas on a regular basis, which may be akin to a security. This can make problems with a listing. -1     Marketplace product, which is known for not creating a high return on investment after listing (Gems, indorse). -1  Growth Factors     A very strong team, advisers and partners from the ecosystem of NEO and City of Zion. +3     The project has the support of Neo Global Capital. +1     A strong partnership with NEO,  which a sister project of Nex exchange and is considered one of the key components of the Neo Global Foundation’s establishment of new Smart Economy. +1     Reasonable hard cap and token sale structure without any bonuses and good vesting. +2     Has a growing hype and community interest especially considering there will be no bounties or bonuses. +2  Disposition The project has a great team, partnerships and reasonable token sale structure. On the other hand, it still has not shown MVP, its token economics is supplementary and tokens may have security elements. This leads to an overall score of 6 of 10.

Completing tasks on the blockchain and building a skill set on the blockchain serves to build a resume that cannot be falsified. As workers are hired and complete tasks on the Moonlight platform, their experience is logged to the blockchain through smart contracts, including the skills required to complete the task, reviews from participating parties, and bid accuracy, which is the the accuracy of the time quoted to complete a task against the actual time to completion.  There are no known competitors who are building a trustless resume on the blockchain like we are facilitating in the hiring process. Most projects are simply importing resume information onto the blockchain, information which can be falsified. This completely misses the point of  verification and immutability that the blockchain provides as in the case of falsified information, it stays in the blockchain forever. The inability to falsify skills and experience aims to be an improvement on current solutions such as UpWork, Freelancer and LinkedIn. By also providing project management tools comparable to Jira, Teamwork or Trello, the creation of teams and project execution can happen in once place, whilst new employees can be easily onboarded to existing projects. We are building a platform for other tools to be built off of. This is important because it provides a source of data without a gatekeeper.  Regards, Moonlight Team",False
