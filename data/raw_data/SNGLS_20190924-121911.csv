So now this should be a no-brainer. Still, the price is higher as on ICO but way much cheaper as when I wanted to buy a big bag. This project is constantly developed and the team is committed to this vision and success of SingularDTV.  There is still no concurrence for the SingularDTV project. They are still pioneers in blockchain and developing great new features. I knew that this will be successful one day. For any price movement up there have to be better market conditions. Until BTC and other cryptocurrencies together with the market cap will tank further, then there is no chance for even small price spikes.",True

Written by Jason Tyrrell, Vice President of Content and Shreesh Tiwari, Chief Strategic Officer, SingularDTV  The entertainment industry was historically built on a simple premise: tell amazing stories, and the people will come. The ways in which those amazing stories have been delivered to audiences have evolved drastically over the years, from the crackling whispers delivered over a RCA radio, to the flickering light of a theatre, to the stunning 4K and 5.1 surround sound of a cutting-edge home system. Yet the goal has been the same: to entertain, enlighten and inspire.  SingularDTV is committed to the same goal, but is reaching it through drastically different means, by building an alternate entertainment economy that brings artists and audiences closer, removing gatekeepers and intermediaries. What’s good for fans is good for artists, and vice versa. The dream has always been there, and now there’s a technological means as well. To achieve these goals, we’re leveraging blockchain as an underlying technology with a renewed focus and delivery capability. That will establish long needed transparency and accountability.  SingularDTV is building this transparent and accountable entertainment ecosystem by developing a suite of development, distribution and production applications. We launched Tokit two months ago as our rights management gateway, and an artists on-boarding application. SingularX launched in conjunction to empower creators and consumers to exchange the value created on Tokit in a fully peer-to-peer environment. Tokit will grow into a real difference-maker in the years to come, for artists of all types, so that entertaining, enlightening, and inspiring content can find production funding without forcing artists to lose their direct connection to and control of their work. SingularX, our decentralized exchange will work in tandem, and will fuel sustainability to artist tokens.  https://medium.com/singulardtv/singulardtv-welcome-to-ethervision-4ee659d03921",True

Much of the the worldwide groundswell of interest in digital currency over the past year has been funneled through major exchanges like Coinbase, Gemini, and Kraken. With their simple interfaces and mainstream-ready infrastructure, these centralized exchanges have brought billions of dollars of value to blockchain projects and digital currencies. The growth has been exponential — over 3400% in 2017 alone!  The list of centralized exchanges is long: Bithumb, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Poloniex, Kraken, GDAX, Coinbase, Gemini, just to name a few, but there are hundreds popping up all over the world. However, centralized exchanges are subject to a whole host of problems like hacking and scaling issues, and are beholden to a centralized perspective that does not fall entirely in line with the decentralized ethos of digital currencies and blockchain tech.  All signs point to an evolution in value transfer — decentralized exchanges — taking the lead in the cryptocurrency space in 2018 and beyond. Decentralized exchanges like SingularX provide a more secure and fair way for users to exchange digital assets for a whole host of reasons, and as the general public grows in blockchain savviness, we’re likely to see a move towards holders of digital assets wanting more control and security in their engagement with exchanges.  Amongst the most pressing issues with an over-reliance on centralized exchanges is security. Every week it seems, there is a new report of a major hack at a centralized exchange, with stolen amounts ranging in the hundreds of millions of dollars. This kind of hack is only made possible because centralized exchanges store vast amounts of users’ digital asset holdings in hot wallets that are susceptible to attack. Considering this threat, the decentralized model is preferable, as users get to maintain custody of their own assets and engage directly with a smart contract to exchange tokens with other users in a peer-to-peer fashion.  https://medium.com/singulardtv/why-decentralized-exchanges-are-the-future-for-digital-assets-8a3b7f1032c2",True

The Decentralized Exchange for Intellectual Property  By Zach LeBeau, CEO of SingularDTV  SingularX (www.singularx.com) is SingularDTV’s peer-to-peer trading platform for intellectual property created in Tokit.  Tokit, our project creation and rights management application, launched yesterday on November 6, 2017. With Tokit, we generated the SNGX token which powers SingularX’s economic infrastructure.  The revolutionary thing about SingularX — aside from empowering artists to be their own economies — is that all transaction fees generated by the exchange are embedded in the SNGX token. This means that anyone holding SNGX can withdraw the revenue pushed into it, or store it there. SingularX is an important part of the SingularDTV entertainment economy and we look forward to generating millions of dollars of value for SNGLS token holders.  We’re going to do something that isn’t typically done in today’s cryptosphere — we’re going to prove the SingularX tokenized ecosystem is successful and prosperous before we release SNGX tokens to the public. This is something that doesn’t happen today… everyone releases a token based on an idea or a whitepaper and then goes out and attempts to prove it. We’re doing the opposite.  Before I go any further, I’d like to thank Zack Coburn, the creator of EtherDelta. Zack is a true visionary in the cryptosphere. EtherDelta has been in operation for more than a year now and until recently was the only decentralized exchange in existence. EtherDelta served as the inspiration for SingularX. In fact, Zack consulted on the construction of SingularX throughout the summer of 2017. Initially, it was my personal hope that SingularDTV could have acquired EtherDelta — tokenized, optimized and rebranded it — but it didn’t work out that way… thus SingularX was born.  SingularX has many similarities to EtherDelta. Why reinvent the wheel? EtherDelta has been heralded by some as the most successful decentralized project on Ethereum — up until Tokit and SingularX of course, ;-). But seriously, SingularDTV needed an exchange in which all intellectual property generated via Tokit could be listed and traded. It’s a crucial component to artists and creators becoming their own economies. After all, we can’t expect centralized exchanges to list all the tokens generated via Tokit, especially the way things are going down behind-the-scenes in the USA now. While SingularX’s architecture is similar to EtherDelta’s, there are some significant differences between the two. Let’s explore those differences…  1. A newly designed front-end with full customizable UI, each trader can build their own layout based on their preferences.  2. New modular design to make it easy to add new features in the future for new types of trades (encourage people to provide suggestions).  3. New back end infrastructure to improve reliability and responsiveness.  4. Security improvements.  5. Integrated support channels for users with the S-DTV support team.  6. Removed reliance on etherscan performance (coming soon).  7. External API access (in BETA).  8. The biggest difference is that SingularX (SNGX) is Tokenized!  The SNGX token was generated by Tokit and utilizes its revolutionary smart contract technology. All transaction fees generated by SingularX are pushed into the SNGX token for holders to store or withdraw. The ownership breakdown of SNGX tokens is 45% to SingularDTV, 45% to Centrality and 10% to Digital MOB.  All revenue pushed into the SNGX tokens owned by SingularDTV, will be further pushed into SNGLS — the token that powers the SingularDTV tokenized economy. We look forward to the benefit this brings SNGLS token holders. If SingularX can reach the activity level or beyond of EtherDelta, this would mean millions of dollars a year SNGLS holders can benefit from.  We look forward to building SingularX into a trading library of international intellectual property as well as a profitable platform that enriches the SingularDTV economy.

Basically, it’s like owning dividend paying stocks in a decentralized Netflix with greater transparency and support for the content creators.  SingularDTV Released applications: https://singularx.com (decentralized exchange, currently quiet launch, UI improving, all the functionality tested, etc..) https://tokit.io (ERC20 token creation and launchpad for projects, first projects launched and fully funded..) Dividends about to begin as there are applications generating income stream.  SingularDTV upcoming: EtherVision 2018 (amazon/netflix type shop) + over 10 other apps  Dividends example: If you are holding 1,000,000 SNGLS (0.1%) and SingularDTVs revenue was $100M you would get $100,000 USD which is paid in ETH to holder.  * https://tokit.io => REVENUE SHARE, from new projects setup GOES TO SNGLS-TOKEN holders, amount based on holding percentage of SNGLS. * https://singularx.com => REVENUE SHARE, part of the fees (45%) GOES to SNGLS-TOKEN holders, amount based on holding percentage of SNGLS. * SingularDTV Original Movies/Series/etc Royalties=> REVENUE SHARE GOES to SNGLS-TOKEN holders, amount based on holding percentage of SNGLS. * SingularDTV EtherVision coming 2018, (""monthly fees""), purchase fees => REVENUE SHARE GOES to SNGLS-TOKEN holders, amount based on holding percentage of SNGLS. * Upcoming other 10 or so modules => REVENUE SHARE, part of the fees GOES to SNGLS-TOKEN holders, amount based on holding percentage of SNGLS. => All applications have been designed so that they will increase SNGLS-value.

Due to arising transitions from centralized to decentralized exchanges, Binance is the only exchange that is accommodating the revolutionary functionality of all ERC20 tokens, ensuring Binance's growth and popularity when decentralized exchanges take over.  Make sure to transfer all of your SNGLS tokens to any ERC20 compatible wallet by Ethereum block #4304467 (sometime between September 21 and 22) to ensure your eligibility to receive your OMG tokens.

Zach wrote a blog post on this: https://medium.com/@SingularDTV/whats-the-difference-between-an-ico-and-a-token-launch-7105edbb2112. But basically the value of SNGLS are a function of 1) the value of the network as encapsulated by SingularDTV's intellectual property including all the modules/app and content of the platform/economy. 2) Utility - apps/modules will require SNGLS to operate and even moreso when gas can be paid in SNGLS (upcoming) 3) Rewards - as Ether is collected from the activity on the SDTV economy, a portion will be made available for SNGLS holders to claim. 4) Fungibility - all SNGLS are worth the same amount. No one SNGLS token is worth more than another. While many coins/tokens share this same property, it's worth pointing out.",True

I must admit i bought a few SNGLS a month a go purely for Trading purposes, but a recent check through my portfolio had me wondering if i should take another look. I will also be honest and i didnt fully research the project a month ago, i only looked at market cap/trend and GitHub etc. Tonight i went through and checked out the 3 videos https://youtu.be/Vvrd-2i7or0 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQJeAE0KTnY and https://youtu.be/xKjaTMtl-dY. One of the key factors i find that can tip me in the direction of a project is attention to detail. I see many new companies that are raping the ICO system that i am sure wont be here in 1 years time. It can be down to the smallest and maybe 'Insignificant to Many' details that can sway me in the right direction. The email confirmation has a real nice custom landing page (that 99% of these companies don't give a fuck about) and believe it or not that was made me just buy a good chunk But i have to say i love the vision and i really dig this project i think it has legs that go way higher than most models on the blockchain ...Looking forward to the app releases.",True

Zach put out a new blog post today concerning the recent SEC announcement here: https://medium.com/@SingularDTV/coins-vs-tokens-why-the-sec-decision-is-a-step-in-the-right-direction-99868248a6a6  Some may not be aware, but since day one, SingularDTV has openly announced it will have no whitepaper and will release no code until the first modules are developed and properly audited. There is no alpha or beta so we are going straight into a full fledged launch sometime later this year. To quote one of Zach's Slack posts:  ""What SingularDTV is putting together now are business plans and instruction manuals for each of our modules and applications. We are not yet making these documents public, for a variety of reasons, many of them strategic, especially because we have such a unique development ladder and execution strategy. One of our primary interests is increasing the value of the SNGLS token by creating applications of real utility and this strategy helps to ensure it. For a macro view of how everything works, please refer to https://medium.com/@SingularDTV/singulardtv-be-your-own-economy-f9cfb543b70d or also to the Ethereal presentation video here, https://singulardtv.com/video/TQJeAE0KTnY.""  Our Slack is where all the action is happening. Zach pops in there regularly to answer questions as do many of our team mates. We release update videos in the Slack that are NOT released by the team on other social media platforms. Our Slack is currently on manual invite to thwart off the recent rash of DM phishing attacks, but if you'd like an invite, please email me at matt@singulardtv.com and I'll send you one. Our Slack really is the best way to engage in the SDTV community. I hope to see you there and thanks for your continued support.",True

Some must have been sold at a lower price to cover expenses, and they increased their staff and the project scope. That could still leave up to $100M or $0.10/SNGLS to be returned to SNGLS holders.

With regard to property, SNGLS are an expression of IP inside a programmable token.  The IP SNGLS represent is derived from SingularDTV’s proprietary content - the modules/apps and original content we produce.  SNGLS is also a utility token in the sense that you need SNGLS to operate many of the modules.  Additionally, When Ethereum’s protocol is upgraded to allow for ERC20 tokens to be the gas that pushes transactions through the network, the SNGLS token will achieve absolute utility because it will be the SNGLS token that is the gas that pushes all the smart contracts through the SingularDTV network.  Thirdly, SNGLS manage the flow of income and rewards generated through consumption and participation in the ecosystem and that are distributed to token holders .  Lastly, the most known and understood attribute of SNGLS is that it is fungible",True

It's a straightforward process for everyone to implement. They’ll need to do it eventually anyway because the future of tokens is all about functionality coins don’t/can’t possess. We're looking to start implement testing soon and will be announcing it before we do. We'll probably ask everyone to transfer their SNGLS into the various wallet options that already support the reward withdraw functionality to lessen customer support issues for the exchanges and wallets that don't have the reward function implemented yet. These upcoming tests should provide the opportunities for the wallets/exchanges to implement this function.  From SingularDTV light wallet:   https://www.myetherwallet.com/ has this implemented also On MEW go to contracts Select existing contract - SingularDTV Then choose the withdraw revenue function.",True

With regard to property, SNGLS are an expression of IP inside a programmable token.  The IP SNGLS represent is derived from SingularDTV’s proprietary content - the modules/apps and original content we produce.  SNGLS is also a utility token in the sense that you need SNGLS to operate many of the modules.  Additionally, When Ethereum’s protocol is upgraded to allow for ERC20 tokens to be the gas that pushes transactions through the network, the SNGLS token will achieve absolute utility because it will be the SNGLS token that is the gas that pushes all the smart contracts through the SingularDTV network.  Thirdly, SNGLS manage the flow of income and rewards generated through consumption and participation in the ecosystem and that are distributed to token holders .

With regard to property, SNGLS are an expression of IP inside a programmable token.  The IP SNGLS represent is derived from SingularDTV’s proprietary content - the modules/apps and original content we produce.  SNGLS is also a utility token in the sense that you need SNGLS to operate many of the modules.  Additionally, When Ethereum’s protocol is upgraded to allow for ERC20 tokens to be the gas that pushes transactions through the network, the SNGLS token will achieve absolute utility because it will be the SNGLS token that is the gas that pushes all the smart contracts through the SingularDTV network.  Thirdly, SNGLS manage the flow of income and rewards generated through consumption and participation in the ecosystem and that are distributed to token holders .

Tokit is where you create your project and tokenize it.  Your tokens are be programed with the ability for you to manage and control your IP’s rights and revenue flow.  Once tokenized, you can interact with LaunchPad to connect with your potential audience and those that want to buy your tokens.  You can list your tokens on our decentralized exchange when it launches.  It should launch around the same time as Tokit and LaunchPad.  At the exchange you can trade your tokens and create a market cap for your project.  But once EtherVision launches, our distribution portal, you’ll be able to create your own channel and distribute your work peer-to-peer around the world.  Tomorrow we’ll be releasing an article that mentions SingularDTV’s commitment to fund and market scores to hundreds of projects with the resources we have acquired with the rise in ETH.  Our launch will also tell you exactly how to use our applications and it will showcase several artists doing this.  They will serve as the example.  We have some exciting projects.  Then you'll be able to do it yourself.  I'm going down to Puerto Rico next week to start the first of three call centers to help answer all of your questions.

The 2nd was those that were Bitcoin savvy and knew little to nothing about Ethereum.  The 3rd category knew little to nothing about either Ethereum or Bitcoin and didn’t posses either.   The test was on an alpha version of “Tokit” our first module.  The exercise was for each of the three groups to operate the module by paying into it the respective ETH, BTC or USD that accompanied the group they belonged to, and then interacting with the results.  Because Group 1 was most familiar with Ethereum and were comfortable with using ETH there were virtually no technical or customer service issues with this group.  The experience with Group 2, the bitcoiners, was near frictionless as well, but there were a larger % of technical and customer service issues.  But still, it went well.  Group 3 was a extremely high maintenance.  The amount of technical and customer support was overwhelming.  We learned a lot from this test.  It is the number one reason we are establishing customer service call centers in Puerto Rico, Europe and China where artists and creators can talk to real people.
