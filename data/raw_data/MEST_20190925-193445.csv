Once the distribution smart contract is developed the project requires no further technological development.

As detailed in the whitepaper, if needed we may utilize a local lettings agents who manage the properties for a nominal fee. However it is unlikely an agency will be needed given the number of properties under our management.  This is a project dealing with real world assets with a focus on investor returns. I am always vary of ICO projects with huge teams, it can often be they do not have investors interests at heart given that each team member and adviser may be getting a token or company share.  We are working with several contractors (web/graphic designer, legal counsel and online marketers), none of which are receiving a share of the company or additional tokens. These expenses are paid personally by the directors and these expenses will not be reclaimed from the ICO. By minimizing our team we can maximize the investors token share.   To provide comfort/clarity to potential investors, it may be beneficial to publicly detail who you will be utilising for the blockchain related aspects and information on the smart contract. We appreciate your concerns regarding the small team. We did not feel it was important to list the contractors we were using and listed only those involved in the long term project. Having raised this concern with us, it is now likely we will add the more recognizable names we are dealing with to our website as others may have these same concerns.    Who are the blockchain architects/experts that will be used?  We have hired a company called Aequalis to develop the crowdsale, escrow and distribution smart contracts. They are a highly skilled blockchain development company and have an excellent track record working with multiple ERC20 tokens and Ethereum Dapps.  They are always on hand to provide further development if needed, but they are contractors hired at the directors expense. They are not getting a share of the tokens or company.    What are your mediation/risk protocols for token security, wallets, hacking etc?  It is the token holders responsibility as to where they wish to store their tokens.  Regarding smart contract security, all aspects of smart contract security are taken into account by the development team. The token sale will be utilizing a secure escrow wallet for investor security. Extensive testing is done before the smart contracts are deployed.  With regards to our ongoing security, no cryptocurrency will be held long term by the company. Ethereum will be purchased on a monthly basis and sent directly to the distribution smart contract.   If you have any further questions or concerns, we are happy to address them.",False

Rental payments accepted in BTC/ETH/EUR. Making us the only real estate rental service in Monaco accepting cryptocurrency.   INVEST IN REAL ESTATE RENTALS  Real estate investment is known to be one of the most secure ways to invest, hold and grow your capital. With todays cost of housing, real estate investment is reserved for institutional investors and those with large capital.   ETHEREUM BLOCKCHAIN  By utilizing ethereum smart contract blockchain technology we can evenly distribute rental income to all token holders. You can now participate in the benefits of real estate rental with no minimum investment and without the huge capital usually needed.  https://preview.ibb.co/mqC5Tm/business_model.jpg   WHY MONACO?  Monaco houses the highest concentration of millionaires anywhere on the planet, making it one of the most sought after prime real estate investment locations in the world.  High demand for properties that increases every year driving huge capital growth and rental income growth. Monaco has a proven track record of huge capital growth year after year.  The renowned tax haven draws in thousands of extremely wealthy clientele looking for minimum of 12 month rentals (needed for them to benefit from Monaco’s tax status). Monaco is one of the best tax jurisdictions for business and real estate in the world, with 0% tax on rental income within Monaco – this allows us to maximize investor returns.  https://image.ibb.co/eGxQdm/Housing_Price.png    INVESTOR INFORMATION  Monthly Ethereum payouts for token holders storing their token in Ethereum wallets.  We love investments that produce income. That’s why at the start of each month we share 60% of previous months profits with our token holders! Utilizing Ethereum smart contract technology the profit share will be equally distributed between token holders.  40% of the profits will be put into the reserve fund and reinvested to grow portfolio. Rental income increases year on year, plus the reinvested 40% of the companies profits we ensure we are constantly growing your monthly Ethereum payouts. As the payouts increase in value so will the token.  https://preview.ibb.co/cyqvdm/timeline.jpg   GUARANTEED BUY BACK  5% of the company reserve fund will be used to actively buy back tokens on exchanges should any investor wish to sell their tokens. Tokens purchased by the company will be burned, thus increasing the monthly dividends for all remaining token holders. Over the long term this ensures higher demand of tokens due to reduced circulation and increased dividends.   TRANSPARENCY  Properties will be purchased and held by a newly founded Monaco company with the team as registered directors. A Monaco company is required by law to file publicly available annual accounts that can be freely downloaded by all investors.  Quarterly investor reports will also be available detailing income/expenditure and operating updates.  Transparent accounting ensures investors are fully informed on their investment finances.

You are right, property and everything in general in Monaco is extremely expensive.  Our softcap of 2,000 ETH is sufficient for us to purchase a single apartment.

With the excess left over from our just our softcap it is likely we will have enough to purchase an additional car parking space which can also be leased separately.  There are plenty of apartments studio and above in excess of $2.4, but we focus and specialize in finding deals that produce a higher than average returns.  Maybe after the studio and additional parking space we may just about have enough left over for a Monaco coffee!! ",False
