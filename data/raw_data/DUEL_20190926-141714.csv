We have prepared and thoroughly tested the ICO smart contract, and now we want to submit it to our community for review.  Key elements of the ICO:  The ICO is divided in 3 phases, with bonuses in earlier phases. The ICO starts with a first period of 24 hours limited to whitelisted members. The second and third phases are open to all. The contract allows for a refund of ETH if the soft cap is not met. Tokens can only be traded after the trade switch is called by the owner The token model is as following: https://dueltoken.io/#ico  Open-source development and transparency are crucial when building healthy ecosystems â€“ which is the intent of dueltoken.io. We would like your help to review the ICO contract through the following bounty.  ICO Review Bounty  Bugs canâ€™t be reported twice, the first person to report it in here or on our GitHub will receive the bounty. Contract source: https://github.com/dueltoken/token  20,000 DUEL tokens for bugs that will cause funds to be lost or locked so they canâ€™t be recovered anymore, e.g. no refunds are possible when softcap isnâ€™t reached after the ICO. 10,000 DUEL tokens for bugs that will disrupt the intended flow of the ICO or its outcome, e.g. you can buy tokens at full bonus price throughout the entire ICO. 2,000 DUEL tokens for bugs that bugs with low impact, e.g. view functions are displaying wrong data but do not impact intended behavior. The bounty closes the 21st of March at 5 PM UTC.  Feel free to contact us on our social media accounts or here in the comments.

We had some expectations when we first started thinking of launching our project. Today we wanted to share with you what we have learned so far, and how we intend to go forward.  Building community engagement We are still really excited to bring the concept of dueltoken.io alive. It is a relevant need in the evolution of gaming and a strong use case for decentralization. In the end of 2017â€Šâ€”â€Šearly 2018, we witnessed a strong influx of user interest in upcoming DApps. We were picturing a similar rapid and massive interest from the community as we are targeting the gaming community: a growing and digitally-native segment who embraces new technologies. We chose not to create social bounties as user engagement is far more valuable to us than a large number of inactive followers.  A working product So far, we have elaborated a product vision, both from a business and a technical point of view. We have also prepared some high-level wireframes to give you an idea of the experience we intend to put into place.  Now our focus will be directed towards developing a minimum viable product (preferably a minimum lovable product). In the same way as we intend to build dueltoken.io in the foreseeable future, we want this to be a collaborative effort. We will conduct a user story mapping session with the team, publish it online and integrate your feedback. You will help us decide which features should be part of the MVP. We believe that this is the correct approach to get you excited about dueltoken.io and excited about the future of the ecosystemâ€Šâ€”â€Šthus grow an engaged community.  Timeline For the time being, we are putting a pause button on the ICO. When the timing is right, when weâ€™ve produced a working MVP and that we have started to build an engaged community, we will propose a new date for the crowdsale. For now, we will focus our time and energy on building the foundations to make this community grow.",False
