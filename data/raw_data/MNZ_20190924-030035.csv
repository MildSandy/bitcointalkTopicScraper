Quote from: Moris1987 on April 06, 2018, 05:19:48 PM So what can you offer better than Bankera? They already having functional product aka Spectrocoin where sheres are distributed monthly.  We are not in competition with Bankera as they do not provide B2B current accounts last time I checked. In comparison we provide only business current accounts for client companies as they are the most underbanked in the world. We currently have a working product as well, ours is simply in closed beta, streamlining the sign up process. Another distinct difference is that we are not going to be based on another blockchain (either based on NEM or ERC20 as far as I can tell), and are going to be beginning with our own blockchain as an asset of the Komodo Platform. Further, the ICO for bankera has already concluded if I am not mistaken, ours has yet to begin. Further we will not be providing exchange services to the general public. Our accounts will be the first to be a business current account with a built in cryptocurrency wallet. Additionally it seems that Bankera does not exactly provide current accounts but instead will launch an exchange on top of its coin protocol.",False

So the big things that came out of the AMA were a few well worded questions. I will do my best to summarize.  One that was asked was about the hardcap. A direct quote from Robert follows, ""The price of btc has exploded since we first set out to the ICO and with our current hard cap of 10 000 btc we have realised this is to much. WE WILL BE LOWERING THIS AMOUNT. The actual raise amount will be communicated when we announce the new date for the ICO.""  When asked about the date for the ICO, it was reiterated that we have an internal date set, but due to the two delays we have had thus far we wont be announcing the date until we are 110% sure it will be the final date.  We discussed the mechanics of mining and how that will look when ""merged"" with the Komodo Platform and then when and if it will be appropriate to discuss a split.  Masternodes were also inquired about, and we mentioned that this is not currently in the road map but something that we could absolutely do in the future as the blockchain is our own and we are able to change or include protocols as needed.  One member inquired to the price of KMD falling abruptly when the second delay occurred, relating it to current market businesses and relating to their stocks. A response from Vincent follows  ""This is not our business, our banking partners PFS or Wacecrest has also their human ressources issues, this happen in all companies. We are concentrating fully on our services, and making sure that our partners provide us with the highest level of services, if their stock prices or currency goes up or down, that is not our concern""  There were some questions raised about the Komodo Platform, one of which was how we could offer an ICO on a platform/cryptocurrency that doesnt have a legal entity behind it. A response from our CEO follows:  ""The tokens are issued by Monaize Pte. Ltd. which is a legal entity in Singapore. And the Blockchain is an indépendant private Monaize Blockchain, all nodes (servers) are managed and paid by Monaize. All this relationships are binned with legal contracts. Like I said before, Komodo is a service provider to Monaize.""  Additionally there were questions raised in relation to a recent article about the CEO of Komodo. The question was responded to by our CEO Vincent below:  ""We at Monaize have nothing to do with the person that you indicated. Komodo is a blockchain service provider to Monaize and also a minority share holder in Monaize. We consider this as a Komodo's human resource issue and we have nothing to add to it. Technological companies have often incidents like this unfortunately, individual are often trying to do some buzz and maybe sometimes trying to make some money out of it. We at Monaize are also working closely with the head technical team from Komodo and we are not informed about the product manager that you mentioned. Activities going on in Komodo, got nothing to do with the launching of our dICO.""  Lastly, but some would argue not least, it was argued that British beers are far inferior to all German beers. Consensus was reached on this argument that German beers were better.  If you have anymore questions please feel free to ask them here or in telegram at t.me/MonaizeOfficial",False

One of which is that the KMD team shares our ideals and values. Further, we believe that they have some astounding technology and we have partnered with them to take advantage of that. Lastly, it is a pioneering thing to launch on their blockchain as they are the first zero-knowledge coin to do a ICO, but also they are constantly innovating and share out vision of collaboration, which is what we are doing within the business sector.  Ethereum Tokens are very common these days, we dont want to fall into that category. So due to this, we have decided to do things outside of the traditional box, much like our company is doing.

I really guess you need some more time to finalise the token sale and technical implementation. I am really convinced from the idea of Monazie and the Komodo platform and how the team planes to archive all the milestones. However, it seems really hard for a non-tech guy like me to figure out how to participate in a dico like this at all. Im afraid this will lead the first ""d""ICO to become something complicated instead of something innovate, what it is actually ment to be.  I remember previous ICOs where you had plenty of time to also study the ICO tech besides the actual white paper. I actually haven't seen any ""manual"" accesible to a ""non Komodo involved"" part of the future community. So of course, declaring the 6 hour bonus for KMD as a benefit for the KMD community is a reasonable approach to benefit current coin holders. However, the wide mass (which definetely has to occour since whales are """"blocked"""") will be informed very late and will therefore probably pass on this opportunity due to the FUD of entering to late.  However, dont get me wrong, i will definetely be investing in this dICO but i just ment to point out some concerns.",False

This is a fully decentralized ICO We will be doing it with cross chain atomic swaps so that it will be secure and you will have access to your tokens nearly immediately.  As for news updates, we have a FAQ that is rolling out as well as guides to use the ICO. The KMD team ran a huge test with exactly 1 BTC worth of MNZ allowing them to realize where the issues were with the software. They have been smoothing out the operation of the GUI app so that everyone will have a great experience.  If you are looking for wallets they have been announced in the telegram announcement channel, and discussed extensively within the other channels.  Additionally, there was a great video from CryptoGrinders done today with a live AMA that went out this morning. See here for the following link to the AMA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aZO-B3pfg4  There will be much more stuff coming out soon as we get the BarterDEX application finalized and we will get the guides and final launch version of the dICO.  Many people have been asking if it is possible to deposit your KMD prior, to the ICO into your ""smart wallet address"" generated through the BarterDEX, and the answer is yes with a huge caveat - WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS. Please keep your KMD in a secure location until you can guarantee that you will be able to make a swap and then withdraw your KMD. These wallets are secure, but if you lose your key, your funds will not be recoverable.  Ther you go!",False

At the moment, only for the implementation of the loyalty program? I.e. the actual working application of the token on the platform is not present and, probably, will not be. Representatives of the team ask in telegram-chat what application users would like to see for the token. And this is only a week before ICO , before they sell us these tokens! If the token does not have an application, it does not cost anything! This is a trinket for the sake of taking money through the ICO. But what about the loyalty program, you ask? Passive income - it's cool! Loyalty program ... Let's count a little. Information for calculations is on page 25 of the WP. Let's consider the 5th year. If KMD will cost $ 1 and «NUMBER OF MONTHLY SIGN UPS» = 500000 (as noted in the WP), then by the formula we will all get (5*500000)/1 = 2500000 KMD. I.e 2500000(KMD)*1($) = 2500000 $ for everyone. If KMD will cost $ 100 and «NUMBER OF MONTHLY SIGN UPS» = 500000 (as noted in the WP), then by the formula we will all get (5*500000)/100 = 25000 KMD. I.e 25000(KMD)*100($) = 2500000 $ for everyone. That is the same as in the first case. The number in dollars is equal to the number of signers, multiplied by the bonus (x2/3/x4/x5 depending on the year). That is, from 2018 to 2021 (according to WP), users will receive 40,944,000 $. But with at a rate of 7000 for BTC developers will receive on ICO with a max cup 70,000,000 $. Catch the thought? You give them 70 million, and after 4 years you get a total of 41 mln. I.e. even after 4 years you will not return your investment. Where is the mistake? Show me please! I really hope that somewhere I was wrong. Will there be a loyalty program after 2021? In the WP, nothing is said about this… They say, well, we are building a bank of the future! It's the most important! Yeah, yeah, ok… But what will be for the person who will now give his money for implementation? What profit? The Monaize will have a bank and business, and what will get ICO-participants? In my opinion, it would be fair for passive earnings to allocate a portion of the annual cost of customer service, and not just for SIGN UPS. That there was an analogue of owning shares, not candy wrappers, i.e. to get a part of the company's profits. Or do you think those who give you money are fools, and that they do not deserve fair compensation, as in large real companies. As a KMD-holder, I do not want to throw them into the wind. Argumented criticism is welcome. What did I miss?",False

Also future/current use cases could require or at least accept MNZ token to use.  So best case scenario you make 6x if you hold and MNZ team hits its goals. Worst case scenario ,  you 60% ROI from rewards alone ( and this is assuming Komodo doesn't maintain its upward price trajectory ) and you still have all your coins to use.  Also the MNZ team can proceed a lot faster raising 10k vs 1k .  I believe the loyalty program will be around after 2021,  just the multiplier will not increase.

This is not exactly a coin to mine until we really get this asset chain going. At that point we will help others to mine it if we indeed split completely from the KMD blockchain, but this is just in the roadmap - the best way to participate is to buy into the dICO on November 10th or get involved with our bounty campaign.  Quote from: dvachayu on October 19, 2017, 01:58:32 PM This coin has ICO and premine too. It is not good.  I understand your hesitancy and concern friend, but I think you are thinking of our token as more of a fair launch cryptocurrency. This is a very interesting avenue as a project like this hasn't really been done before. We are kind of more like an ERC 20 token except without Ethereum. Its going to be like a much wilder and crazy version as we are based on top of Komodo using cutting edge technology. At some point our tokens will have many more use-cases but for the time being they are going to be issued ""at will"" for whatever use-case we need to issue a block for such as storing data on the blockchain or something. Some day we will break off and take flight from the main chain, but for now, think of it like merged mining with KMD.

Can anyone from the team PM me some details? Thank you all. Very interesting project.  Sadly, friend, we have already concluded the presale. This was exclusive to the SuperNET team and was only a tiny portion of the tokens. However, the best way to get involved would be to get in within the first 6 hours as you will receive a 20% bonus for participating with KMD at that point. I also have a feeling the demand for this token will be very high immediately out of the gate so who knows how long this dICO will last! Just remember November 10th - 12PM GMT the sale begins. We will be keeping everyone up to date on how to participate here and via social media.",False

Initially we intend to use it in ways that are very familiar to those who are in the crypto-scene. Initially to raise funds, as was mentioned, but after that we will be using it in much the same way that cryptocurrency works currently. To pass finances within branches - Think of it like the current uses of crypto, except for using fiat. Of course, we are going to be only able to use it to transfer into other Monaize branches. Of course, this all needs to be cleared by our legal team and local governments, but we are confident that we will be able to work things out as we intend to do this using the correct channels.  Additionally due to the nature of the Komodo Platform, and our partnership with them, we have the capability to store databases on the blockchain. So immutable client information can be stored in a fully encrypted and secure manner. We are also provided with a ton of other developments being partnered with the Komodo Platform, due to their white label platform, we intend to fully use every aspect of the blockchain that we can as we move forward.  To make a much more complex process short, we want to put fiat on the blockchain to start. And explore the other potential uses of this technology as we expand our partnerships through successful experiences within our two initial jurisdictions.",False

Imagine getting your small business a bank account within 5-10 minutes instead of 5-10 business days. Further, picture being able to do this by taking pictures of the proof from your smartphone, uploading to the app, then being able to access tons of other integrated services such as lending services and insurance for your business.  Quote from: bundo on October 03, 2017, 02:03:07 AM Projects that carry banks and crypto always busy visited investors are always successful in launching And such a concept is worth it for later but for all continents or in europe only ,, success  Of course! Check out the whitepaper to see the expansion goals. We already have partners who will help us to get our foot in the door on expansion into many new places, but as of right now the plan is early next year we will move into Germany, then head over to the USA and expand into other European nations. Asia is planned for 2020. As France has some of the most intense banking laws, we are very confident that we will be able to prove to our partners that we can hold our own abroad, but for now we need to focus on what is right in front of us!  This is all laid out extensively in the whitepaper, and if you have any questions please feel free to join our slack.",False
