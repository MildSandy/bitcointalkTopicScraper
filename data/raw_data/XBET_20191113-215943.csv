We officially launched our ICO, using a Dutch Auction contract. You now have the chance to become one of the early XBET-token buyer and it probably won’t take more than 5–10 minutes of your time. Our starting price setup is 0.00015 ETH for 1 XBET token. The ICO is finalized when the ETH funds are collected OR it expires on 31.08.2018. Based on the final price tokens will be calculated and distrusted to every participant.  LetsBet.io  —  The Idea behind it Betting is the one of biggest but at first glance not most obvious use case for a DAO — a decentralized, autonomous organization. Current DAPPs lack an intuitive, easy to use, fun interface with a compelling and addictive proposition. With the launch of LetsBet.io we intend to turn the tables!  Currently there is no application which uses the right incentives to reach and build a community and at the same time generate a scalable ROI for investors. Regulations inhibit global gambling services and hinder profitability. Blockchain technology offers the ideal environment and incentive mechanics to run next generation applications which can circumvent legal and geographic barriers — through decentralized and fractional community-ownership of an organization.  Once deployed, the application runs on unstoppable, scalable and transparent code, with complete operational independence. The unique monetization model generates a physical ROI in form of ETH dividends distributed to all token holders. The typical breakeven is linearly related to the jackpot size (e.g. 25 thousand bets per day would yield a ROI of 100% p.a.).  Token Structure  Ticker symbol - XBET  Total supply - 100 000 000 (100 Million)  Maximum crowdsale cap - 10 000 ETH  Minimum investment amount - 0.001 ETH  Presale cap - 1000 ETH  Get XBET Tokens here If you need help with buying tokens this might help you: How to buy XBET-tokens with MetaMask How to buy XBET-tokens with MyEtherWallet  For more information check out our Whitepaper and Website  LetsBet.io | Place a bet | Telegram | Medium | Twitter | Facebook | Youtube",False
