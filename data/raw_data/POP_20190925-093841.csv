Without this, creating a truly decentralized governance model to run The POP Network is impossible.  Given the intense interest in token events, having a presale of POPs is meant to satisfy initial enthusiasm of larger contributors while reserving tokens for the vast majority of participants that may not meet the requirements needed to participate in the presale. Launch Sale Even though countless token events have been executed to date, no clear consensus has emerged on the best method to conduct a sale. The POP Network aims to take the best ideas in practice and unify them around The POP Token event.  After the initial sales period, an open sale of POP Tokens occurs at platform launch. The exact method for this process shall be detailed in community channels well before the go date. If incoming funds exceed a predefined amount during the open sale, then the smart contract conducting the sale triggers its resolution at a specific time. Additionally, a maximum level (“kill cap”) is set at which point the sale immediately ends. Continuous Token Issuance After the initial token generation event, it is important for POP Tokens to continually be created with the purpose of sustaining long-term development of The POP Network. Newly minted tokens reinforce The Rewards Pool and provide a powerful incentive mechanism to both new and old users.  Although adding tokens is inflationary, the central function of burning tokens to publish is deflationary. With experimentation, finding the right balance which fosters network growth is achievable.  The best defense against token inflation is running a POP Node. By staking tokens to perform activities on the network such as video encoding, storage, and peer-to-peer streaming, nodes get token rewards for their efforts. This encourages token holders to reinforce The POP Network rather than remain passive.

As a centralized and hierarchical corporate system, it stands that those at the top of the corporation make the decisions and earn the most from the company’s success. YouTubers and the YouTube audience may nominally be considered members of the YouTube community, but they are not involved in governance nor do they receive a majority of revenue. Additionally, the YouTube audience is not truly free to make choices on what they view. Instead, they are forced to watch ads to gain access to the content they want. Absent of true creative agency, content creators are left chasing advertising dollars to earn money.  POP Network; A Video Sharing Ecosystem on the blockchain is not a magic wand a company waves to rectify all the injustices of the world; however, blockchain and other decentralization technologies can be used to create more egalitarian and fair ecosystems. By building our video sharing ecosystem on the Ethereum blockchain, POP Network is able to leverage micropayments and tokenized systems of reward to form a new video sharing economy where all participants are compensated for the part they play in growing the network. Through this token-driven economy, behaviors that support the community can be incentivized. Community members also can play an active role in governance by using tokens to support their interests within the ecosystem.",False
