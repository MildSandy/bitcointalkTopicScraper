The first ICO on EOS! By tokenizing the poll/survey market using the blockchain technology iRespo gives both organizers and participants an opportunity to earn on their activity.  iRespo uses EOS blockchain platform to create an ecosystem in which users will be incentivized to take part in the voting by earning tokens when they respond to questions during polls and surveys.  Both sides – the organizer and participants - will become the owners of the results collected during the voting. The organizer will be able to decide whether the data should be public. If he decides to do so, he can also set down the price for the access. The user that wants to access the data, e.g. an analyst, will see the questions. In order to see the results, he will need to make a payment that will be split between the organizer, participants, and iRespo.  In this way, the transparency of smart contracts enables complete utilization of the data.   We believe that our idea can fundamentally change the whole survey and poll industry. It allows sharing of the data created during voting and earning on it. By using iRespo economy active participation is incentivized and all the contributors become the owners of the created content. We have selected EOS platform for our solution, as this “blockchain 3.0” offers scalability and performance needed for the real-world applications.
