What is the incentive to buy-in your ICO?  As I understand your token is limited to your ecosystem and pretty useless out side of it, which reminds me of BS like ""Lyoness Cashback"" etc. Don't get me wrong , I like your ideas and everything, but I just don't see the point why I should invest in you. Whats in it for me? Because with your token I don't get shit, no shares of revenue, no shares on your company, nothing. For example other ICOs like Tezos, Electroneum etc. target to be a globally useable and therefore are speculative investments like BTC, ETH and so on. But your coin doesn't aim to be that. It aims to be the token of your own eco system which by definition is limited to your existence as a company supporting said eco-system and your ability to execute your plans.    2. You have posted and electric bill to prove that you are already operating mining-farms in Austria  I may be wrong here but to the invoice identification looks a bit sketchy. As Austrian law requires that every invoice has an unique alpha-numeric identification, it seems that your hoster, which seems to be a energy company, has only one customer, which is you. Hence ""Re Nr 2017-09""doesn't leave much room for uniqueness for the month of September....    3. Your videos/pictures of your Swedish farm  As being involved in datacenter design for almost 15 years  for Austria's Top companies I have quite some knowledge what the ""dos and don'ts"" are. It almost gave me a heart attack when I saw your footage. Come on guys really? No ESD protection while assembling the miners? Power cables across the room so people can trip over them? What is the power cable diameter lading to one ""rack""? If a miner has 10 cards inside and we assume those are 120-150W cards each because of the 6-pin power connector, we get to a possible power drain of ~1,5kW per miner, multiplied by 8 that leaves us with 12kW per rack, which is insane to be powered by such a thin cable. As you are transporting 52A worst case and 30A best case......fire hazard anyone? Also I am curious about the cooling of the room as I spot 25-30 racks, which would result in 250kW-300kW of thermal energy emitted into that room if we are being moderate with 10kW per rack. Or are you mining Cryptonight so comes down to 1/2 of those figures?    4. You claim that you have specially customized cards for you by Nvidia   Why are those boxes labeled Zotac? Why would Nvidia go through the trouble of developing a small batch of a product in the first place? Since when does Nvidia offer alternative designs themselves for a  consumer class product? If you would have been running Tesla or Quadro cards, sure I get it, but not with some 6-pin wafer-yield-cutoffs 960 or 1060",False

Your benefits are clearly stated in the whitepaper, it is up to you to buy tokens or not, if you don’t see the benefit for yourself (discounts in purchasing our products). Or you never intend on using them in the future, maybe our token is not for you, which is fine!  2. This is true, we are the only customer at this location! At the beginning of our mining operation, we started cooperations with a number of small private hydropower plant operators, who would otherwise simply supply the energy to the national power grid. Through us, they got a much better deal and we received a steady source of clean and relatively cheap energy to operate our mining farms.  Any surplus of energy is still supplied to the national power grid.  3.  All cables come in from above through cable trays. We are actually much more efficient than your retail grade hardware/software assumptions since we have a lot of experience. One card uses 80 watts @~26 Mh/s Ethereum One rig uses a total of roughly 850 Watt at the wall  We use CAT7 cables and in the video we were still not finished with assembly, now they are already bound and nicely placed. There are no cables on the floor that have any power running through them on the floor. Thank you for your concern!  Our power cables have some safety buffer 6² for 3 phases with 32 Amps. For each PDU we are only pulling 29-30 Amps per phase.  I hope that answers all your questions!   4. First of all, we consider more than 100 000 cards not a small batch, what would be a large batch for you? Zotac is a close  partner of Nvidia, since you know that Nvidia focuses on producing the chips and not the cards (they do produce some but most cards come from partners), working together with Zotac and Nvidia to design our custom graphics card was a logical step for us.",False

That's a false statement without any possible excuse. the Austrian authorities will look into these false public statements we have been informed Cointed GmbH has not recorded any revenue in its balance sheet 2016 and has not provided any audited or CPA-confirmed numbers for 2017 hence it has not shown any established business. Maybe the people behind Cointed have made some great business but it's not shown on balance sheet or tax records. Crypto Unity OG has not made or provided the balance sheet as of Dec 31, 2016 (!) as confirmed by their accounting firm Crypto Unity OG has not yet delivered a single record of business for 2017  to their mandated accounting firm (we have the official confirmation of the accounting firm) many of their investors are waiting for their mining servers, some of them already since April 2017 as confirmed by one director Crypto Unity OG and Cointed obviously sell mining equipment off-balance sheet against cash and thus may run into investigations of the financial authorities in the very near future as confirmed by one of its directors. The point is that this may be money laundering.  Again, these are documented facts and no allegations. Maybe Cointed is a legitimate business but it doesn't look like that.

Despite the company's public statements about an *established* business revenues were ZERO last year and no assets were shown in the balance sheet as of end of Des 2016 (see below), hence no *established* business all Cointed people are sort of Hongkong refugees and no social media contacts of the people involved are provided at all given all the findings it seems that a newly set up Hongkong shell company without assets is the token issuer and the white paper is false.  These are not my accusation but just a wrap-up. Well, to me it seems at least worthwhile to give it a second thought. Would you really give those people USD 120M to do exactly expand what?

The areas we are active in are: (mainly GPU) Mining, a Crypto Exchange, Mulit-Cryptocurrency ATMs (as the biggest Crypto ATM provider in Europe) and a Payment System for crypto-payment processing. We were able to achieve all this with absolutely 0 outside funding.  Our goal is to now expand to the global market with those products. When you take a look at the Cointed Whitepaper on page 38, you will see that we are currently in the process of expanding throughout Europe and that Asia is our immediate next goal after that. We are already in talks with a number of potential partners throughout South East Asia, which we mainly met by regularly attending blockchain-focused events in this area. Another event, the Black Arrow Conference in Bali/Indonesia is just coming up, which we are really excited for!  We place huge focus on the South East Asian market, because it seems obvious to us that cryptocurrencies are ideal for countries where the financial infrastructure is not yet fully developed. In addition, there are very few cryptocurrency-focused companies in South East Asia as of now.  Logistically, it is just not possible to enter the Asian market from Austria (or anywhere in Europe for that matter). After much consideration with our financial advisor Deloitte, we decided that the base of our operation should be moved to Hong Kong. Thus, the Cointed Ltd was founded, where we will now move our attention to more and more over time.

I did a quick search on this:  On Bitcointalk as of 16th February 2016 you talked about having sold 60 BTC so far (via LocalBitcoins).https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1351953.0. As the average price for a BTC end of 2015 and beginning 2016 was quite low (300 – 500 USD) compared to nowadays figure, pls explain how you came finally up with sales of 7 Mio USD. !!In addition you only set up CoinTed OG as of 10.12. 2015 (what is in line with your statement in the Bitcointalk Forum back then). So again how does this fit with 7 MIo USD sales?    For 2016 you claim impressive sales of 30 Million USD and a profit of 600k. Again I tried to do a quick check but eventually CoinTed OG was deleted (!) as of 15.12. 2016 from the official books: the new Company CoinTed GmbH which is in existence since 24. 11 2016 does not show any sales between end of November 2016 and 31/12/2016 at all. So as of 16th February you just spoke about sales of 60 BTC and in December you made 0 sales: how did you make 30 Mio USD sales<?   Regarding my question about your physical presence in Hongkong: For Austrian legal and tax purposes only the economic substance of a legal structure is valid. So if you people being the board of management of the Cointed Limited are sitting in Vienna or Kufstein, Cointed Limited will be regarded as Austrian place of economic activity and you will be treated as an Austrian entity (but I am sure Deloitte will tell you all these things).  I am sure that Deloitte´s statement on your figures for 2015 and 2016 will bring assurance about your press releases. I can not imagine that you lied about your financial results in luring people to participate in your ICO. By the way you also could publish the financial statements of CoinTed OG for 2016 as well as your tax filings for 2016.",False

I am not the CPA (but we have mandated one to take a look into the matter to help our client in this case) but its my understanding that if Cointed OG would have been the predecessor company (the established business that Cointed claims to run since 2014) and would have been merged into Cointed GmbH (which is the way it works usually) this would be shown in the books, even in an ""Eröffnungsbilanz"" but the filed balance sheet isn't an ""Eröffnungsbilanz"" anyway.  Please read the post by @taxi. Seems strange that Cointed OG has been deleted and hence the business ceased officially. Where have all the customers, revenues, assets gone then? Why aren't they shown in the balance sheets? If they have gone elsewhere then Cointed has no right to claim to have an *established"" business.  And still, the big question on the Crypto Unity OG remains open yet. Where are all the assets and the business that's claimed to be in Cointed Ltd? Off-Balance, Off-Shore?

So i also did my check on hydrominer! Actually i also think that it is quite risky for the management of Hydrominer GmbH to issue Coins as long as the GmbH is not yet registered with the Austrian Commercial Court. But the risk is quite limited to any losses incurred between the day of the establishment of the company contract until the registration day (VORGESELLSCHAFT), afterwards the GMBH will be liable for the Coins issued. Hydrominer runs a voucher model: quite simple! you can exchange mining power in exchange for the vouchers. The people behind Hydrominer never issued any statements on big sales number achieved in 2015 and 2016 and they never claimed to move to Hongkong! resp. to issue the coins by using an asian company. When Hydrominer fails everyone knows that there is an Austrian company which can be sued! Quite simple. to sue an Asian company is much more difficult and the reason that Cointed ltd. moves to Asia in order to work the Asian market is not valid. Groups usually set up subsidiaries but do not move their headquarter to the Asian market.   Regarding the token model:  hydrominer just issues voucher which can only be exchanged against mining power. The only problem which could result in their token being qualified as e-cash and resulting in big troubles with the FMA is their promise to get a listing on cryptocurrency exchanges (what will anyway probably never happen), but as long as the vouchers can not be used to buy services or goods from others the risk is limited.   CoinTed describes in its white paper and in its public announcements that its coins can be used in a widely manner: other merchants and so on. So there is a very high risk to be qualified as e-cash and this means more than big troubles with a lot of different financial regulatory authorities in each country where such merchants will be located.  Both tokens/coins issued will not empower a decentralized network to be established.",False

Also from what I saw they do actually own hardware (assets) unlike other ICO’s which really only exist on paper.  I also know that they are running a optimized and customized OS as well as that they are having custom bios for their cards, I know because I know the person who wrote it 😉  Furthermore, their concept of mining contracts where a miner at least owns his/her machine seems to be a lot better than spending the same amount on money on a mining contract which gives only half the Hashing power without owning the hardware.  Regarding the comment about the location looks like a storage place, most of us started like this, again respect for coming up with ingenuity to transform this place into a farm and therefore saving your customers quiet a lot of money.  I for sure are watching this ICO, As ElioVP I am not a believer of ICO’s which only exist on papers, but this one has as least a feasible concept and assets.  Cheers!",False

I just would like to point out that I have not made any accusations but only stated what the initial investor, co-founder of Crypto Unity OG and director stated to me. I am pretty sure that he knows what he is talking about as he paid for the first servers and allowed to set up Crypto Unity OG and is an experienced investor as well as an honest guy.  I can see absolutely no transparency at all and most of the recent ICOs have been provided way more information, especially when going for so much money. To be transparent it definitely needs more information: no detailed information is given on the past corporate transactions and the corporate structure and which entity owns what exactly. The former Crypto Unity OG shareholder has been bought out after a few issues and insists that he agreed with you to dissolve the company. That's his view but maybe he has the same misunderstanding with you like some other guys? obviously Crypto Unity OG still exists with new shareholders, it isn't shown yet in the Commercial Register, right? Furthermore, it isn't shown that Cointed GmbH is owned by Cointed Ltd in Hongkong, right? You shouldn't call this transparent, I guess. no proof is given on the revenue numbers  of the past years that make the ""key difference* to other ICOs. This should clearly be the case if you guys go for so much funds. The number we know is ZERO hence you have to provide the proof for your *key differentiator"" to be transparent. Being an Austrian company with operations in Austria and Sweden and setting up a Hongkong Shell company as holding is not transparency at all, it's hiding or tax avoiding or regulation issues of whatever. With EUR 100M revenue in the past you must be a huge tax payer you are not delivering details on the investors in the mining business and details to the investment concept. According to the former director, there are some tax/legal/regulatory risks associated with it. This should be transparently explained I guess.  We are working on an analyzing blog post on the Cointed ICO and its background on Medium and LinkedIn and this forum really provided a lot of input. Thx for that.",False

Hence, the White Paper is simply wrong public information. As of today the Commercial Register doesn't show a Hongkong-based company as a shareholder. Hence, legal-wise the Austrian Cointed GmbH belongs to the shareholders Christoph Rieder with 90% and Wolfgang Thaler with 10% and not to Cointed Ltd doesn't show that the Austrian Cointed GmbH or the Hongkong Cointed Ltd is a shareholder in the Crypto Unity OG, hence it doesn't own the mining business. Based on the information provided by the Austrian Commercial Court the Hongkong Cointed Ltd is neither shareholder of the Austrian Cointed GmbH nor of the Crypto Unity OG and hence Cointed Ltd doesn't own the business or the shares of any of the companies. This is in strict contradiction to the White Paper and leaves the token holders without assets.  Furthermore, the Crypto Unity OG shareholder and director we spoke with has confirmed to us (and will do this before any court) that he agreed with the other shareholder Charli AHO to dissolve the company and that AHO and his tax adviser have been instructed and agreed to do so. Obviously, this hasn't happened and thus he will take the necessary legal actions on Monday.

You however don‘t find it worthwhile to comment on them. Instead you only bring up new and wrong accusations without providing proof or simply repeat the same accusations again. The reader has to decide for themselves why you behave that way. It is clear that all your posts are not objective but clearly subjective and in a negative, destructive spirit.  Nevertheless, for the sake of transparency, we will continue addressing them:  - Fraudwarning in newspaper In the article you mention, there is no warning of fraud at all. They only reported the accusations from our former business partner GB and the very comments you posted in this thread. The same newspaper posted an article from our point of view, which can be found here where we explicitly dispute all allegations: https://www.derbrutkasten.com/a/schmutzkuebelkampagne-cointed-wehrt-sich-gegen-vorwuerfe/ In addition, Cointed gave a live video-interview to this newspaper today for the sake of complete clarification, which can be found here: https://www.facebook.com/derBrutkasten/videos/1968866463337243/ So far, GB refused to react to any of our statements.  During this interview, we also invited the same newspaper - https://derbrutkasten.at - to come and visit our mining facilities in Sweden to give the community an unbiased view and to prove that we have nothing to hide. More information will be coming in the next 2 weeks!   - Fraudwarning from experienced Forum Members with Herostatus We answered all concerns of the mentioned user and are patiently waiting for further comments. But I am glad you mentioned the issue of warnings from users. We think it is important for the community to know who is actually behind those accounts. When checking the trustworthiness of the user Zeroxal, one can find a review that leads to this interesting statement of the user himself  where he admits to tax fraud: https://archive.fo/Q916h    - 100% Fake followers on Facebook Every company, has to deal with this problem. It is true that we advertised our facebook page in those countries, which is completely legitimate way to reach potential customers. A look at our whitepaper will reveal, that expanding to Africa is one of our core goals, since cryptocurrencies are ideal for markets where financial infrastructure is still underdeveloped. The statement that 100% of our followers are fake is an exaggeration of incredible dimension.   - Censorship of Reviews Already addressed, you refused to provide prove.   - Huge Fight with the only confirmed partner GB (witch is a credible palyer in the crtypto community with a very good reputation) A statement regarding the GB situation can be found on the first page of this thread and in the article and video posted above. We will also invite GB to a roundtable discussion. The fight was never intended by us and we didn’t start it as mentioned time and time again already in this thread. Cointed is very disappointed in GB for taking these steps. This point has been addressed multiple times.   - No proof for any up and running mining farms (exept some pictures of rigs standing around in a warehouse) As mentioned before, a camera team from https://derbrutkasten.at has been invited to visit our mining farm in Sweden. At this mining farm alone, Coitned operates 16,000 GPUs, which are up and running at this point. Stay tuned for the video! (and thank you for providing the publicity!)   - Fee Manipulation Already addressed, you refused to provide prove.   - Lies about claiming the BT ATMs are Cointed ATMs Which lies? We bought the ATMs and always paid our bills on time, even stated by GB in the private letter they decided to post on their site. They belong to us. We have already provided proof of our own new ATM prototypes which are not only owned, but also produced by us: https://imgur.com/a/COt41   - Lies about Revenue/Turnover Again no lies. The 180$mio dollars are a low estimate for the end of this fiscal year. We are willing to admit that these numbers were communicated poorly. We will be able to prove this with our balance sheet at the end of the year. Sceptical investors are invited to revisit this ICO at the beginning of the next year when this information will become publicly available.   - Lies about amount of ATM Locations (at least not willing to provide proof) Please go to the website https://coinatmradar.com/operators/ where you can find 51 listed already. A look at our facebook page https://www.facebook.com/cointed/ will reveal that we installed !!18 ATMs!! in the last 10 days alone. GB also said themselves in the private email they decided to publish that we bought 73 ATMs from them alone. In addition, 5 BITXATMs, 5 GENESIS ATMs and 15 new Bitcoin ATM „X“ Machines are owned by Cointed, with more models ordered already.  Regarding the ATMs that have not been listed publicly they: 1. Are at private clubs, which can only be accessed by members of the club 2. Still need to be shipped out (I just received word that a new ATM has arrived in Mallorca/Spain!) 3. Are prototypes which have been developed and produced by Cointed and are now being tested   - Lies about having a developed Mining Hardware together with Nvidia. (And pretending to have a non disclouser Agreement after anouncing it themselves) Already answered, you are repeating yourself to inflate the list of unbased accusations   - Lies about Online Traffic on theire site. Already addressed, refused to provide prove.   - Lies about developing theire own software. Already addressed, refused to provide prove.   - Lies about developing theire own ATMs. Already addressed, pictures of our prototypes have been posted multiple times: https://imgur.com/a/COt41 The GeneralBytes drama you keep citing is entirely because we are producing our own ATMs, as GB says themselves in the private email they decided to pusblish. This makes your point not make a lot of sense I am afraid. It seems like you are running out of accusations you are able to make up.   - Censoring all channels, deleting old profiles and creating new ones That is a new one which again, you refuse to provide any proof for. If you mean the Cointed OG account, a short Google check will reveal that the Cointed OG has been closed over a year ago. I don't think that you mean this account though because it would not make sense to talk about the account of a company that no longer exists.   It is obvious that you are just flinging dirt and hope that something sticks. You don’t care that all these points have been thoroughly discussed and just keep repeating them without addressing our answers in any way, shape or form.  We are happy to engage in a healthy discussion. However, so far it seems like the only thing you are interested in is to inflict the biggest economical damage. I am sure it makes the community wonder what your motivation actually is...",False

You are just claiming things without providing proofe. Anyway ,I will add a few lines to some of the (many) bullet point just to show you what I mean:   1.) you say: - 100% Fake followers on Facebook Every company, has to deal with this problem. It is true that we advertised our facebook page in those countries, which is completely legitimate way to reach potential customers. A look at our whitepaper will reveal, that expanding to Africa is one of our core goals, since cryptocurrencies are ideal for markets where financial infrastructure is still underdeveloped. The statement that 100% of our followers are fake is an exaggeration of incredible dimension.  comment:  It is not a ""problem that every company has to deal with"". Buying fake followers means that you engaged in a service to pay for a certain amount of followers. Thats a very shady thing to do because its only purpose is to look bigger/better as you are. It is easy to proofe by comparing the rate between amount of followers and amount of interactions. This ratio is not right on your site, thats a simple fact and your information does not provide any value to it. Although you are right. 100% is a exaggeration, it is probably around 95-98% fake followers in reality.  2.) Lies about corporate structure turnover/revenue:  you claimed that as of 20.10.2017 your Cointed GmbH will be owned . 100% by your Hongkong limited. This simply false. The relevante documents have been posted already in this forum. As a consequence, your Tokenholders are holding tokens with no value. Thats a simple fact  Also turnover/revenue/profit is not existing until beginning of 2017. As stated in your public balance sheet. I posted this information erlaier. Your figuers ( 25m, 100m) are pure fantasy.  3.) Lies about mining capacity. You are claiming that you have developed minining Graphigcards with Nvidia and that you have plus 100.000 GPUs up and running as of today. Thats simple false. The only thing you have been willing to share sofar is pictures of a storage room with a few thousend GPUd standing around not making money. And your offer to invite journalists in a few weeks (when your ICO is over) is simply a joke. Why proofing anything after your ICO. If you are not willing to provide a simple screenshot of your miningpool with a simple picuter of your mining facilitys then the simply do not exist. (like hundreds of other scams in the cryptoworld)  4.) Lies about one of the biggest player in the crypto ATM Industry. It is said how strong you try to blame GT for your own misbehaviour.  5.) Claiming to have ""developed"" your own ATM It would be easy to prove that, just share your patents. The animation you shared can be made with a photoshop app on a simple mobile phone. Its no prove for nothing. (and for sure not for getting 120m USD!!!)  6.).... so many more things to say... but it makes no sense to continue as long as you are not willing to puplish the above mentioned documents. It would be simple and if you would have all they things you claim to have in place you could share it in a matter of minutes.  But I have the feeling that nobody will ever see any of these documents, company registers, mining farm pictures, patents, etc... because if you would have them you would have published it at the beginning of your ICO to ensure your investors that you are the real deal...  Please do not get back to me with empty words. They dont change nothing. Puplish the requested documents or save yourself the energy of posting a extensive reply with no content.  with love ens",False

I know from 100% source that no contract with Nvidia exists and the claims were already forwarded to Nvidia and legal steps FOR SURE to be initiated in the near future. I had tried to work with these people at Cointed but after a while I realized that they were big liar and blender and that neither contracts nor commitments were respected. I'm sure the ICO of Cointed IS a Scam is all that is claimed in the Whitepaper is largely fictitious.

Some belong to the shopkeepers. Some shopkeepers payed a deposit of a few 1000 euros. The Mining Hardware also belongs to Clients of Cointed. Only a fraction-if anything at all-belongs to Cointed. Its a fact that the ICO is issued by a Hongkong Limited that dont even owns the Austrian Business.  What could ever keep the issued tokens from being worthless? 140mUSD-keep that in  Mind!  In case you buy this token you dont hold any fraction of maybe existing assets(ATMs-Mininghardware...) of any company.  The owners of the token receive a 10% discount on a small exchange-well there are hundreds of exchanges that sell Cryptocurrencies at lower prices and far smaller spreads. You get some discounts for further investing at cointed.  So to generate a value of 140Mio people should invest 1400Mio more?  Come on guys - at my local pub I receive a discount of more than 10% without buying tokens before....   This whole thing smells fishy...  ,False

The simple truth is that the company and token issuer Cointed Ltd is not what it claims to be and doesn't own what it claims to own. Moreover, at least one company - General Bytes - officially claims IP infringements, right?  Cointed said in their White Paper and in several other public communications that they own Crypto Unity OG (mining business) and die Austrian Cointed GmbH and all other assets and that everything is already recorded accordingly. Last time they did so in their ""Brutkasten Interview"" yesterday or in their official answer to the General Bytes Open Letter:    Fact is that the Crypto Unity OG still is owned by Charli AHO and the initial investor and hence they definitely do have this mining business in Cointed Ltd as purported in their White Paper:   Our subsidiary, the Vienna-based Crypto Unity OG, has been at the forefront of crypto mining developments since 2015, distributing custom-designed mining hardware for decentralised cryptographic networks - such as BTC, ETH, ETC, XMR and ZEC - as well as developing advanced BIOS and operating systems in-house. This has been confirmed by AHO to the investor yesterday in a phone call. And the same is true for Cointed GmbH that is not owned by Cointed Ltd. See the official record of the Austrian Commercial Register above. The investor of Crypto Unity OG will take the necessary steps on Monday to reserve his rights and keep damage from him.  Cointed's public statements are simply false in the sense of § 163a StgB and a criminal offense. False public statements are punished with up to 3 years jail especially if you provide those false statements to raise funds. They claim that the token issuer Cointed Ltd has assets it hasn't and hence they provide a false statement of assets to potential investors.  It's sad to see how ICOs are done and how careless teams are asking investors for up to USD 120.000.000. I mean, that's really big money. Look what's just happening to TEZOS with the upcoming legal procedures and litigations. There will be a lot of litigations around other ICOs too. So be careful with your investments especially when there is so much uncertainty.  Stay tuned, we will finish a comprehensive blog post ON Cointed and the team on Medium and LinkedIn tomorrow with all legal data and pieces of evidence.",False

Well, you did talk about it because you made the claim in the first place. So if you would have an confindentiality agreement you would already have broken it. The only thing you did not do is deliver proof for this unrealistic claim.

Our graphic clearly states that 130k GPUs are on the roadmap for Q4 of 2017. Contracts with various suppliers for this volume have already been signed.  At the moment Cointed operates GPUs with a combined ETH Hashrate of about 400 GH/s in not only this mining farm in Sweden, but Austria as well. An additional 10,000 GPUs are being installed as we speak.  It should also be noted, Cointed does not only provide mining, but also sells the mining hardware AND software (such as in-house developed BIOS and operating systems) to customers and businesses alike.  Since Cointed has repeatedly been target by large scale DDOS attacks - after expanding throughout Europe and becoming a high profile mining company - Cointed now mines in private pools. Any mining company of even moderate size will be able to tell you that this is best practice behaviour.  Your comment that the GPUs simply lie around and are not operating seems odd, since those are clearly pictures of the assembling and set-up process, which our customers are extremely interested in.   As for your concerns regarding the company's status as an Ltd and other points, it seems rather obvious that there is a lack of knowledge regarding corporate structures and taxation in general.  The Cointed OG existed until 2016. The Cointed GmbH, has been operating since the beginning of 2017, which is why there obviously cannot be a annual balance sheet yet. We invite anyone to check the annual balance sheet of the company, which will be publicly available at the beginning of 2018, while the ICO will still be running - if it has not been sold out by that point!

Every random unsuccessful company is doing or planning an ICO. The ICO just became a kickstarter for startup and/or people trying to get free cash. This thing here is even more absurd. I have read their stuff from time to time as a really active person in the crypto landscape, but purely to entertain myself. You can’t take them seriously. The only reason I am writing here and started to research a bit more is that the impudence to fool people. Before they were just minding their own business inside their MLM scene. Those people should stay where they are and stop trying to get into the real world with their practice.  First of all, look their website. It is clearly shitty, but nevermind. It is not a fact, it is just my opinion. I will try to stick to facts that anyone can research themselves. Their slogan was (until spring time or so in 2017) “Cointed – Der vertrauenswürdigste Bitcoin Händler Österreichs” -> Cointed – the most trustworthy Bitcoin vendor/merchant in Austria” … I am not joking.  The only business they have is their ATMs. Regarding this, the statement from GB speaks for itself: https://www.generalbytes.com/cointed/ This is absolutely consistent with my impression that the Cointed member don't have any technical competence themselves.  I can only recommend going through their posts on Facebook and their former thread on bitcointalk: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1351953.0 Unfortunately, they deleted everything. … for a reason. The answers in there where pure gold. They were operating something without knowing that they constantly violated anti-money laws. It was a mixture of incompetence and telling everyone that they should not go in this industry without any knowledge without knowing it themselves.   Nonetheless I told you I researched a bit after reading the statement of GeneralBytes, who are a well-known and respected company in the industry. Another alarm bell is there freshly incorporated HongKong Ltd. Apparently, someone told them not to do this ICO scam with an entity in Europe, because I don't think they are smart enough to find it out themselves.  Not that I did not even find one innovative thing in their ICO (by the way, launching the shitty Wavecrest PREPAID card with the same shitty conditions that has been on the market forever is not an innovation. Apart from your actual announcement to launch this standard product in early summer this year, you are two years late for this anyhow.), I have also found some interesting numbers within their key figures: -   180M revenue -> apparently, they don’t even know the difference between revenue and turnover -   ATMs with 4% margin, but a net profit of 5% -> well… interesting. … I will spare you with every inconsistency in their offering. It’s not worth reading the stuff anyways.  But here are some facts that are really amusing:  Alexa Website rating of their website cointed.com: Global Rank: 124,717 (even now after ICO ads have started) Rank in Austria: 2,113 Everyone who can interpret this numbers know that their website is pretty much non-existing in the industry and has no relevance. They do not have on app, meaning their numbers in their ICO are 100% fake.  They are using their Facebook for their news and posts (look at their pictures, the location where they place their ATMs and the content in general… pure gold, believe me). But as I was going through their Facebook page I have realized that they have 21,630 Facebook Likes. After I saw the Alexa numbers before, I knew this was fake. But this time, it was more ridiculous then I expected. I immediately realized that they barely have any interaction on their posts, especially for their 21,630 likes.  Here are the numbers where their Facebook Page Likes come from (top 5): 1.   Uganda – 6,916 // 32.22 % 2.   Nigeria – 6,039 // 28.13 % 3.   Egypt – 5,606 // 26.12 % 4.   Austria – 1,283 // 5.98 % 5.   Germany – 772 // 3.60 %  Now you could say, “Wow they are really big in a brand-new market: Uganda, Nigeria, Egypt”. Well, I got bad news for you: The website has 0 visitors from these countries. Then I thought, how stupid and incompetent do you need to be to buy more than 90% of your FB Likes!? Well, they seem to be not the smarties cookies in any field. They pretty much destroyed their own Facebook Page without having a clue what they did until today. But when I was about to think this was the absolute climax they surprised me again: Here they are celebrating their fail by buying African Likes with a meme: https://www.facebook.com/cointed/photos/a.1030649583667871.1073741828.986732868059543/1343514402381386 “… woooohooo 10k likes… you guys are fantastic” A week later they posted another meme, celebrating 15,000 likes. After they reached 20k Likes within a few days (before buying the fake Likes their page had around 200 Likes). This 20k increase happened in February. You can do the math.  I also found this article from an Austrian page: https://www.derbrutkasten.com/a/cointed-krypto-startup-will-sich-mit-ico-120-mio-dollar-holen/ Apparently, the article yesterday said 120M. Probably it wasn’t enough for the ambitious team. Now their aim is 140M$. Still can’t stop shaking my head. I really hope this is not a big mainstream media or newspaper that fell for their lies and fake numbers.  I have also asked some friends in our neighbor country. Obviously, no one from the well-respected ‘Bitcoin Austria’ foundation has ever had any contact with them. They don’t know anything about them.  tl;dr Everything about this company and ICO is fake and the team is incompetent.",False

All miners in our farms are owned by the customer, as opposed to cloud mining where you are left empty handed once the contract is finished. You buy the hardware directly from Cointed, we operate it for you for a flat 40% of the miners hashrate, from which ALL expenses are paid - such as electricty, insurance, rent, service, 24/7 real time monitoring, a redunancy system, etc. - and the rest of the hashing power goes directly to you. Apart from the percentage fee, no further expenses will ever need to be taken care of. 60% go directly into you wallet!  At the end of this hosting contract, you can do whatever you please with the hardware. If you prefer we can also ship out the hardware immediately.  We can tell from experience, that in most cases, this fee is much cheaper for our customers than trying to operate their own mining farm - not considering the time and effort required to operate a mining farm.  With the Cointed Token, you can enjoy a wide range of benefits when mining at Cointed. You can use the token to: 1. Lower your fees and receive a bigger percentage of the hashing power 2. Get an up to 15% discount on the mining hardware itself 3. Use the token to license our in-house designed BIOS and operating system for your own miners  At the moment we are sold out for at least the next month. If you want to reserve a spot for the next shipment, simply write us an e-mail .",False

Throwing around words like ""MLM"" without further details, and speaking about ""friends"" you talked with doesn't seem like the best way to present yourself as a reliable source.  Unfortunately, this looks like another attempt to spread FUD and to discredit us from an envious competitor, who is not ready to compete in the open market.    The only business they have is their ATMs. This is absolutely consistent with my impression that the Cointed member don't have any technical competence themselves.   To call this statement ridiculous would be an understatement: - Exchange: Our Crypto Exchange Platform is growing at an incredible rate, from 0 at the start of this year to 55,000 visitors each month. New features are being added each month and our customers give us their trust because we were able to design an easy-to-use interface, that even inexperienced users can navigate. In addition, as somone who has actually been active in the crypto scene for years, I know how frustrating the customer support at crypto exchanges can be, often times having to wait weeks before receiving an answer. We process 90% of all tickets within 24-48 hours. - Mining: We operate mining farms in multiple European countries, which we have already discussed in detail in this thread. We are sure that having 18,000 GPUs with in-house designed BIOS and operating systems constitues as having some sort of ""technical competence :-) . https://imgur.com/a/xjiem - ATMs: ""Only"" our ATMs would still make us Europe's biggest Crypto ATM operator, with in-house designed brand new ATMs (both software and hardware) ready by Q1 2018: https://imgur.com/a/COt41 . Check coinatmradar.com to take a look at our network. - PayCo: The payment solution, which can be integrated into cash register systems and online shops, allows merchants to accept all kinds of cryptocurrencies as payment. Ther merchant can decide if he wants to receive the payment in crypto or if he prefers to immeadiately change it into a fiat currency. PayCo is already being successfully tested with a number of selected partners and will be ready for official release in the coming months.  All of this was achieved in a very short timeframe and with absolutely 0 outside funding. In additon, an online shop has already been launched and more products will be added soon.   Alexa Website rating of their website cointed.com: Global Rank: 124,717 (even now after ICO ads have started) Rank in Austria: 2,113 Everyone who can interpret this numbers know that their website is pretty much non-existing in the industry and has no relevance. They do not have on app, meaning their numbers in their ICO are 100% fake.   Using Alexa rating to show visitor numbers seems a bit laughable to anyone with even the slightest web experience. For anyone wondering, Alexa tracks users who have the Alexa toolbar installed, registers which sites they visit and then extrapolates those numbers to the entire internet user base... Make of that what you will.  Even so, I invite anyone to actually look at those numbers. Note however that Alexa clearly is not accurate in the slightest.  Rankings in Austria: 2,113 cointed.com  7,466 bitcoin-austria.at  (whom you cited as a well-respected foundation - and we agree; if we are ""non-existing in the industry and have no relevance"", then what does this make them?) 10,748 bitcoinbon.at 15,086 coinfinity.co Our numbers are entirely consistent with other Austrian crypto websites, if not significantly better.     Regarding this, the statement from GB speaks for itself: https://www.generalbytes.com/cointed/   In regards to the situation with GB, we very much would have preferred to handle the seperation with our former partner in private. The simple thruth is that GB was afraid to lose their best customer and knew that we were able to develope and produce a much better product that would threaten their existence. Note how they are not willing to dispute a single point of the press release regarding this situation, which can be found in the second post of this thread.    Nonetheless I told you I researched a bit after reading the statement of GeneralBytes,   This is where the charade falls apart. You first speak about some hidden MLM structures from some distant past that you claim to know about and then say that you just now started researching the company.  We will leave it to the community to decide how trustworthy those statements are.",False

I talked with the co-founder and initial investor of Crypto Unity OG just a few hours ago. According to the Cointed White Paper, this is their subsidiary that has been involved in mining and software development since 2015.  The facts seem to be that: Crypto Unity OG has been founded in spring 2016 (not 2015) Crypto Unity OG has been terminated as of end of August 2017, the assets have been taken over by Cointed the company never had any in-house capacity or competence for ""advanced BIOS"" or ""operating system"" programming Cointed GmbH had zero revenue as of end of 2016 as filed with the Austrian Commercial Court Aho and Orlov have not been founders of Cointed but founding members of Crypto Unity OG Crypto Unity OG's business model was (is) to sell mining equipment to investors  This was what the founding investor and director said. Hence, this guy showed himself pretty surprised to find this statements in the White Paper.  I mean, maybe Cointed is not really a scam or fraud but to go for so much money in an ICO clearly needs more transparency, I guess. We are talking about a real fortune here, right? To set up a Hongkong-based holding company as an Austrian startup just a few weeks before the launch of the ICO isn't something that builds trust.

We will be happy to address all concerns you may have, point by point. Feel free to to let us know if anything remains unclear!  1. It's true that the Crypto Unity OG was founded in 2016, as anyone can verify here. We never claimed otherwise in any document. Founding a tech company is not an easy undertaking, especially in an industry as young as crypto mining. Therefore, the development and planning phase was started many months earlier. 2. It seems a bit weird to make up an accusation like that, since it is very easily disproven. Crypto Unity operates a number of mining farms throughout Austria at hydro power stations of various sizes, keeping with our goal to always mine with sustainable energy. Here you can find a picture of an invoice for the rent of one of those farms from just two weeks ago and here is the current excerpt from the Austrian companies' registry (which is publicly accessible to anyone in the world). 3. Well, this is simply false. We have been using our own software since mid 2016! 4. Again, a true point. As the Cointed GmbH was founded at the very end of 2016, as anyone can verify here, there obviously was no revenue for that year. 5. True as well. We fail to see the point you are trying to make though. Mr Aho and Mr Orlov have however been founding member of the Cointed Ltd, which is the company responsible for the Cointed ICO. 6. This point is is also true! We offer a unique business model, where our customers own the hardware they use to mine. They can decide whether they want us to ship it out immediately to them or if they want to sign a hosting contract. In that case the hardware is remains the property of the customer and the Crypto Unity OG simply operates the hardware for a flat percentage fee of the miner's hashing power. From this fee, all expenses are paid - such as electricity, service, 24/7 monitoring, rent, cooling, insurance and so on - the customer NEVER has to pay any additional costs. After the contract is over, the customer is free to decide what to do with his equipment. The goal of our business model is to give back the responsibility to the community, when it comes to the way the blockchain is being controlled - instead of having a handfull of cloud mining companies have all the power.  I think you will have trouble finding a more transparent company! I hope we could help you by answering all your questions and please let us know if any further questions arise.",False

This company has been doing shady business for a long time! Please respond to the issues below.  1. Fee manipulation: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1351953.msg17429694#msg17429694 Agreement on trade on current market price. Originally tied to the kraken market price + margin. But you decided to create your own ""market price"" already with margins on it and take another fee. Proof can be found on archive.org by comparing their market prices with the price on their site. I posted that post a while ago, why did you disappear and create a new account?  2. Lies You are lying about Wolfgang Thaler being the CEO and one of the co-founders. The real co-founders were: Christopher Rieder and Matthias Rhinow. Mr. Rhinow most probably left the company due to internal problems and Mr Rieder stayed as the CEO. Mr. Thaler came in late 2016 as the CFO. I don't see how Mr. Thaler is getting CEO and Mr Rieder then being the CFO, unless the company (Rieder) wants to have someone else responsible in case the ICO is a scam. You have been telling lies on and on, now even one of the biggest bitcoin ATM makers generalbytes adresses them: https://www.generalbytes.com/cointed/  3. Facebook fake followers and reviews. According to my analysis, most or all of your Facebook followers were purchased. Doesn't it seems suspicious that a page that has 20k followers only give about 10-40 likes per post? At one point you also had hundreds of reviews, but somehow you disabled it after I addressed the issue by giving your site a review? As a matter of fact, I still have archived sites before you had hundreds of 5 star reviews and after you disabled reviews after I commented.  Why are you not responding to my previous accusations??? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2261138.msg23189622#msg23189622 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1351953.msg17429694#msg17429694  4. Generalbytes losing customers because of you being their competitor? Complete joke. You surely did all the development of ATMS, not one of the first and biggest Bitcoin ATM companies. They all just copied your work and your patent and are stealing buyers from ATMs from you. *sarcastic* You are dependent on generalbytes from the beginning of introducing ATMs in Austria. They were your major supplier and instead of thanking them you ripped their logos off and promoted it as your own product. Generalbytes never intended to create a product with you. Prove me that I'm wrong by showing up the publicly listed patents on Bitcoin ATMs, I can't seem to find any in the patentdatabase.  To all customers and eventually employees at the company: Be VERY careful with whom you are dealing with. Quit the dealings before you are also being dragged in for fraud!!!",False

This is quite a confusing point, you might need to elaborate since it doesn't seem clear to us what exactly you are trying to say, especially by us ""creating our own market price"". The rates of the Cointed Crypto Exchange are decided by supply and demand - the same as any exchange. In some cases this rate will be higher than the market average, in some cases it will be lower. This is just the natural order of all exchanges. No fee is calculated in the rates shown, since the fee depends entirely on the payment method chosen and the trading volume of the customer. If someone feels like he or she can get a better rate elsewhere, they are free to purchase their cryptocurrency whereever they want. This is an open market after all. Feel free to post any prove you think you have.  2. This point is full of speculation that is being presented as fact. If you say something like ""probably left due to internal problems"" and having nothing to back that claim up, it only serves to put all your opinions in a poor light. Mr Rieder and Mr Rhinow went seperate ways on amicable terms at the end of 2016. At this point, due to the rapid growth of Cointed, the original Cointed OG was closed and the Cointed GmbH was created and Mr Thaler was brought on board, which can easily be verified by this public record. The job titles where switched because the responsibilites within the company switched. If you think a job title has anything to do with who would be liable in case of fraud, then I am afraid that there is a substantial misunderstanding of basic legal and economic principles.  The GeneralBytes situation has already been addressed thoroughly. We invite anyone interested to read our press release regarding this situation on the first page.  3. We again invite you to post prove for those points. We try our best to address all questions and concerns the community might have. Please understand that in some cases a post or two can slip under our radar.  4. As you surely know, Cointed is one of GB's best customers and currently by far Europe's biggest Crypto ATM provider, as can be verified here. Sadly, it cannot be denied that GB's ATMs have certain problems that we are sure can be fixed. That is why we invited GB to work on improving their product together with us, which they sadly declined. GB had many chances to dispute that fact, which so far they did not do. So what you say is - of course - true, GB never intended to create a new product with us and we never claimed otherwise.  They also never refuted, that they threatened Cointed for months to not even consider producing our own ATMs, even after declining to work together on improving their current product line. So yes, they are clearly afraid to lose their customers due to a new product on the open market, which they are not willing to compete with. As Cointed continues to grow, better hardware and software solutions need to be developed. We are convinced that the crypto community deserves the best products possible. It was clear to us that our goals could not be reached with any ATM currently available on the market.  Cointed is thankful for the long and fruitful relationship we enjoyed with GB, which is why we find the manner in which GB decided to end our relationship so disheartening. However, we don't quite see how being thankful means that you have to stay in the same business relationship for the rest of your days.  If any of those points were not answered to your satisfaction, please let us know.

COINTED is building a bridge between the cryptocurrency world and the real world. Even though cryptocurrencies have brought a whole new dimension in creating value, consumers regularly face the same problem: how can I easily change my cryptocurrencies into fiat currency? Additionally, consumers are also looking for easier and more secure ways to get their hands on cryptocurrencies in the first place. The goal is to satisfy the demand for convenient ways to convert fiat currency into cryptocurrencies and vice versa, without abandoning safety. Unlike other projects in the cryptocurrency world - where business ideas are being presented without transparent roadmaps how those self-set goals are meant to be reached - Cointed already offers a wide range of working blockchain-based products and services. The company has a successful business model and is already profitable. - Cryptocurrency Trading on the Cointed crypto exchange. - Multi-Cryptocurrency ATMs, which we operate as the biggest provider in Europe. - Payment Solutions, which can be integrated in online shops and existing cash register systems. - Green Mining at multiple mining farms throughout Europe, keeping with our slogan „Mine green and save the planet“. Only through environmentally friendly mining with hydro- and wind power a sustainable growth of the blockchain can be ensured. Additionally, we are currently in the final stages of acquiring a banking license. Other upcoming requirements from authorities are also being evaluated in order to have a legal framework in place.    Company Philosophy At Cointed we are guided by the principle that in the IT service industry you have to keep innovating and introducing new products in order to stay competitive. Additionally, as a young and dynamic sector, the cryptocurrency world is constantly in motion. This forces companies to proactively adapt to the development of the market situation, following the motto: The early bird gets the worm.  Our goal is to bring our blockchain-based products and services to the global market. By 2017, we have taken a leading position in Austria’s crypto scene and we established ourselves as the only all-round service provider in the industry. Cointed is already expanding into a number of European countries, which will soon be followed by Asia and then Africa. By analysing the individual countries and their legal frameworks, we will develop our products to suit the respective market situations.   WHY WE ARE DOING AN ICO We choose to do an ICO because we want the community to join us in shaping the financial market of the future. ICOs have given people an opportunity to invest in forward-looking ideas that are set to gain more traction with time. Instead of only giving wealthy investors a chance to participate, ICOs enable anyone to take part in revolutionary ideas they believe in. As the cryptocurrency adoption rate continues to grow, an increasing number of technically inexperienced people will be looking for safe and easy ways to gain access to cryptocurrencies. Thanks to our products and services, the barrier of entry for cryptocurrencies has never been lower which is why we are optimistic regarding the long-term outlook for us and our investors alike. Furthermore, investors will have a chance to first hand witness and contribute to the development of various blockchain-based products and technologies, some of which are already well into development and will soon be revealed. The funds raised at the ICO will be mainly used for product development. In order to provide our users with a seamless cryptocurrency payment experience, with high quality offerings and variety of integrations, we need additional funding. We will be able to expand our team with tech, legal and administrative experts, launch new products as outlined in the whitepaper and form new partnerships. Moving forward, our products and services will receive new features and discounts through CTD tokens. CTD will form the backbone of the Cointed network. With the raised funds our expansion - which is already well under way - will be sped up even further. Those funds will be used to hire specialists and to lay the groundwork for entering new markets. Only through easily accessible products and services - which even the layman can use - will it be possible to disrupt and challenge the traditional financial service industry, which is the only way the cryptocurrency landscape can grow sustainably over the long term.     THE CTD TOKEN You will be able to use the CTD token in combination with all of Cointed’s products and services to lower your fees and to purchase exclusive software and hardware.

Starting as a small and local start-up in Austria as a crypto exchange and Bitcoin ATM provider, we have now developed a number of products and services in the areas of GPU mining, crypto hardware development and payment processing for crypto transactions. We have established trust with customers and partners all over the world through great customer service, as well as being transparent and straightforward with everyone we work with from the very start.  The Cointed parent company in Hong Kong “Cointed Ltd.” is about to start its own ICO. This is a very exciting time for us, since we experience more positive feedback in recent times not only towards us, but the crypto landscape as a whole.  As Cointed continues its rapid global expansion, we begin to feel the limitations of existing products and services in the crypto world. We are convinced that the crypto world deserves the best products possible. For the crypto scene to sustainably grow in the long term, the access to cryptocurrencies needs to be as easy, fast and convenient as possible.  One of those areas are Crypto ATMs, which allow everyone to exchange cash for cryptocurrencies and vice versa. Cointed is now the biggest Crypto ATM provider in Europe and has gained plenty of experience and feedback from customers and partners as to what problems existing ATMs have - both from the hardware and software side - and how they can be improved. We want to allow everyone involved in the crypto scene to enjoy a better-quality product. Those ATMs have already been developed and working prototypes are already available: https://imgur.com/a/COt41  Unfortunately, one of our now former suppliers, General Bytes, has decided to publicly denounce us for trying to expand our product line and develop our own ATM. We decided to end a long and fruitful business relationship in a friendly manner and face new challenges by envisioning how to enhance existing products. The response from our former partner was to make baseless and easily disprovable accusations. We are deeply dissatisfied with how the situation unfolded. Our former partner was not ready to let his product compete on the open market and therefore threatened us for months not to develop or produce any products he would consider a risk to his own business – which defies the core principles of an open market. The former partner has burned bridges with a company that used to be one of his best customers, simply because he was afraid to make a little less profit.  Even though there is no contractual obligation to do any of this, the Austrian “Cointed GmbH”, which is the licensing partner of our former partner respected those wishes and didn’t even deploy the Cointed-owned Crypto ATMs in countries the former partner didn’t want to be associated with - against our own business interests. We were convinced that a clean termination of our business relationship would be possible. We deeply regret that our former partner decided to take these steps and are convinced that they only serve to hurt his own reputation.  We at Cointed will continue to follow our determined path to offer the best products and services possible. We are excited for the times to come and invite you all to join us in shaping the independent and progressive financial world of the future.",False

Cointed does not merely present an idea that is to be implemented in an uncertain period of time.  The company already has a working business model and functioning concept. The undertaking is thus a profitable business and the expansion starts immediately after completion of the financing round.

I will share our press release regarding this with all of you since we want the community to hear all parts of the story.   Cointed has been a successful all-round crypto service provider since 2014. Starting as a small and local start-up in Austria as a crypto exchange and Bitcoin ATM provider, we have now developed a number of products and services in the areas of GPU mining, crypto hardware development and payment processing for crypto transactions. We have established trust with customers and partners all over the world through great customer service, as well as being transparent and straightforward with everyone we work with from the very start. The Cointed parent company in Hong Kong “Cointed Ltd.” is about to start its own ICO. This is a very exciting time for us, since we experience more positive feedback in recent times not only towards us, but the crypto landscape as a whole. As Cointed continues its rapid global expansion, we begin to feel the limitations of existing products and services in the crypto world. We are convinced that the crypto world deserves the best products possible. For the crypto scene to sustainably grow in the long term, the access to cryptocurrencies needs to be as easy, fast and convenient as possible. One of those areas are Crypto ATMs, which allow everyone to exchange cash for cryptocurrencies and vice versa. Cointed is now the biggest Crypto ATM provider in Europe and has gained plenty of experience and feedback from customers and partners as to what problems existing ATMs have -both from the hardware and software side - and how they can be improved. We want to allow everyone involved in the crypto scene to enjoy a better-quality product. Unfortunately, one of our now former suppliers, General Bytes, has decided to publicly denounce us for trying to expand our product line and develop our own ATM. We decided to end a long and fruitful business relationship in a friendly manner and face new challenges by envisioning how to enhance existing products. The response from our former partner was to make baseless and easily disprovable accusations. We are deeply dissatisfied with how the situation unfolded. Our former partner was not ready to let his product compete on the open market and therefore threatened us for months not to develop or produce any products he would consider a risk to his own business – which defies the core principles of an open market. The former partner has burned bridges with a company that used to be one of his best customers, simply because he was afraid to make a little less profit. Even though there is no contractual obligation to do any of this, the Austrian “Cointed GmbH”, which is the licensing partner of our former partner respected those wishes and didn’t even deploy the Cointed-owned Crypto ATMs in countries the former partner didn’t want to be associated with - against our own business interests. We were convinced that a clean termination of our business relationship would be possible. We deeply regret that our former partner decided to take these steps and are convinced that they only serve to hurt his own reputation. We at Cointed will continue to follow our determined path to offer the best products and services possible. We are excited for the times to come and invite you all to join us in shaping the independent and progressive financial world of the future.",False
