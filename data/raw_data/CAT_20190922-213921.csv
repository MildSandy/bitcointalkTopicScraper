We recently designed a smart contract that we believe solves a very real problem crypto users experience today. We’re not ready to announce what it is, or how it works, because to our knowledge, there is no other service that solves this problem. Being first to market is very important in this situation, and we’re very close to release.   Product Development Here’s our notes directly from the Dev team.  Dev Notes The contract we alluded to last week is all-but-ready. While we have deployed it to the blockchain, tested the appropriate functionality and built out a good user experience, we’re looking forward to do a deep-dive security review and polish up all the edges. This project has included considerable reusable UX work for future contract development — functionality like representing Ethereum addresses with their blockies. Work for producing automated unit and integration tests for the whole flow, from UX to the smart contracts, has been started and the first steps of integrating React-driven UIs with Web3-driven smart contracts have been done.  Transaction Survey Results Last week we released a Crypto Transaction Survey which gathered a huge amount of attention from our community. We received a vast number of responses, which gave us a fascinating insight into when/how users transact their cryptocurrency.  Here are some survey insights: 74% of users own the private key to their wallet (eg: MEW, Ledger) 94% worry about making a mistake when sending crypto. 11% have actually sent their crypto to the wrong address (ouch!) These statistics paint a very telling picture. Based on the answers provided, this would indicate that 1 in 10 people have sent crypto to the wrong address. With transaction values ranging from $1,000 (8% of respondents) all the way to $50,000 (3% of respondents), it’s clear just how potentially devastating this could be for the crypto community.  Here are a few firsthand accounts of what happens in this scenario:  “Sent 300 dollars to an address with 1 different digit on accident.” “The address auto filled and I thought I pasted the address, was careless and didn’t check… so it’s gone.” “Gave ICO wrong address, so they sent it to wrong wallet.” This is a fairly critical pain point that, if solved, could have a tremendous impact on the industry by instilling a higher level of trust for the accuracy and frequency of future crypto transactions.   Continuing Education  In the interest of spreading awareness and educating others on what blockchain technology can do, our legal guru David Kemp presented to a community of lawyers this week about the various legal issues surrounding crypto, token sales and smart contracts.  The key takeaway was that despite the general lack of knowledge of how blockchain works from a technical level, there is no doubt of the potential applications and the vast impact it will have on traditional industries.  Unfortunately, it’s difficult for professionals in these industries to gain the education and training required to take advantage of this technology, despite the willingness to learn. We’re looking forward to the day that crypto becomes even more more accessible in a safe and functional way.",False

First off, we're very glad to see that the Community is still active in the forums here. We've been heads down for the last two months while we gear up for our beta launch, which is on track for a release in the coming weeks, so we haven't spent as much time here as we would have liked to.  There have been quite a few updates recently, including a release on Radar Relay, a new website launch, some fake news and a few key hires in development, legal and community. I'm going to post a few links below in case anyone has missed these updates:  • Community Update: November 18th • Community Update: November 24th • Community Update: December 1st  In a nutshell, we’re excited to move into beta. To reiterate what was covered here, our beta will be focused on visual contract simulations. This is an exciting chance for us to connect directly with our Community to test the product, solicit feedback, develop iterations and finalize the UI — ultimately creating piece of software that works extremely well for everyones needs.  Once we’ve completed this cycle, we’ll deploy live versions of the contracts that interact with the blockchain.  We'll be keeping an eye on this thread going forward, but if you want to get in contact with our team directly you can do so on our official Discord channel here.  Thanks for the continued support, folks!  --  -Justin Community Manager, BlockCAT Technologies",False

It is beatiful to see you here. We are here since the beginning. Thousands people aren'n entering because of the complexity of coin space. Our approaches must be reach to them and their languages. Our smart contracts must be multilingual. English, German, French, Russian, Chinese, Turkish,Hindu, Spanish, Portuguese etc. Resting from that is needless according to me. For example my father is Turkish who doesn't understand except the Bitcoin. He only buys and sells Paribu that is Turkish site. Because he knows only Turkish. İt is need to reach with original language to thousands people. This will be create the difference the others Etherparty, Agrello vs. BlockCat decide to be a big and leader company or a small and insignificant company. Eric must be read my this states.

WEBSITE | TABBY PAY | WHITEPAPER | BLOG | TWITTER | DISCORD | REDDIT   Overview Our mission is to help everyone benefit from the security and convenience of smart contracts on the Ethereum network and beyond, unlocking the door to intelligent and automated commerce at scales never before possible. The team was drawn together by the disruptive power of smart contracts when made accessible. We see a future where anyone can use smart contracts, regardless of technical prowess. Thanks to our commitment to simple design and the world’s growing need for intuitive solutions, BlockCAT is poised to usher in the explosive growth phase of smart contracts.  Token Sale Our token sale wrapped up in August, 2017. You can check out the recap here.  Video Overview You can check out our video overview here.   Applications While far from an exhaustive list, the following examples provide some insight into the general idea and class of applications that BlockCAT targets.   TOKEN SALE Launch your own token sale with a visual interface. Remove all the worry of hackers taking advantage of bugs by using our tested and secure contract.   ERC20 CREATION Now anyone can create ERC20 tokens with ease. You could use them for a local event or as a core feature of your Dapp.   AIRDROP Schedule airdrops to specified Ethereum addresses, or provide a link for people to claim their tokens manually.  JOINT PAYMENT Create a payment which can be funded by multiple users. Once the funding has completed, the payment will be sent.   WALLET AUTOMATION Automate the transfer of funds across all your wallets by setting up distributed payments in predefined ways.  TIMELOCK VAULT Lock up Ether or Tokens until a specified date or a defined condition has been met.   Roadmap  Revised Roadmap You can learn about our updated 2018 roadmap in our Road to Beta blog post on Medium.  Core Platform: User-Deployed Smart Contracts Release Roadmap: Q2 2018 A web service that allows users to deploy a series of custom written smart contracts using a visual interface. Users can select options to customize the contract to their requirements. We will be targeting applications as detailed above. After initial launch we will integrate our DApp with various prediction markets to allow users to make transactions based on the outcome of real world events.  Marketplace: Community Contracts Release Roadmap: Q1 2019 The marketplace will allow developers to upload their own smart contracts, receiving a portion of the fees for each user deployment. Marketplace contracts are verified by the community using our token, CAT. Users can stake CAT on the validity and reliability of the contracts, and receive additional CAT for correct verification. The BlockCAT team will also provide security auditing for high volume contracts.  Visual Designer: User-Designed Contracts Release Roadmap: Q4 2019 Through a visual interface, users will be able to design their own smart contracts without writing any code. This will open up the ability for non-technical users to design highly specialized contracts that perform very specific tasks. From small scale local charity events, to large scale business owners building unique payment gateways.   Have questions for our team? Come join the conversation on Discord!",False
