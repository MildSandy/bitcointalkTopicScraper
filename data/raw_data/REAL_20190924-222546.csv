Our token is not a security since it is simply a form of payment we will accept on our platform — users have no rights attached to the token. Our platform is separate from the token, and though offerings on the platform may be classified as a securities, the platform will seek to be licensed and regulated accordingly so as to be able to offer such items for sale legally.

I have a question: NEXT YEAR if i buy a real estate with BTC i will recieve back BTC when the real estate is sold. If i buy with ETH i will recieve ETH. When i buy with REAL i will recieve REAL as described in this example:  Examples: If an investor invests 1000 REAL Tokens valued at 0.50$ each, he will be effectively investing $500. If a) the REAL Token grows to 1$ each, and there are $200 in profits, we will pay the investor 500 REAL (principal) + 200 REAL (profits). If however, b) the REAL Token goes down in price, to 0.25$ each, we will pay the investor 2000 REAL (principal) + 800 REAL (profits).  I think noboday will invest in 2019 with REAL tokens if the liquidity is so low, because if i want to sell my REALs to take ""home"" the gain, the REAL price will go down 30/40/50%+ with this book/liquidty.  But i have a question about the investments in 2018.  RPP bought with REAL, real estate is sold, gain payment in ETH and payment of the REAL invested? Only the gain is paid with ETH right? What if i bought the RPP on the secondary market with lower price per RPP.  For example: Appartements in Phuket, original price 91 REAL per RPP = 91 USD per RPP. On the secondary market i can buy 1 RPP for example for 600 REAL. 600 Real now 0.12 USD = 72 USD. I buy with discount. But how much REAL will i recieve when the real estate is sold? In 5 years? With the 2018 rules? 600 Real or 91 Real?  Another question: REAL is in Singapore or in St. Vincent and Grenadines?  thanks for helping me",False

RPP price is defined by the value of the property, its fixed to the pricetag, when bought or when sold.   All this concept is described (better then i could here) in the whitepaper.  What is REAL?(1) The Real Estate Asset Ledger (REAL) team aims to disrupt the world of real estate by applying blockchain technology to an industry that is historically inefficient and illiquid. REAL uses Ethereum smart-contract governance to provide the best ecosystem for real estate investment. They aim to eliminate intermediaries, improve transparency and liquidity, lower barriers to entry, and alleviate tax issues associated with cross-border transactions. REAL aims to generate rental income and value appreciation through worldwide real estate investment. By bringing together property owners and potential investors, the REAL platform will reduce friction in the real estate investment process.   Any amount of money can be contributed towards a real estate property. Anyone can exchange REAL tokens for economic rights to some piece of property (these economic rights are referred to as REAL Property Participation — RPP). Profits are paid back in Ether, and users can even trade/sell rights to those investments (RPPs) on the platform. Both a website and mobile application will be the home to view and invest in any property made available by the REAL team.  It is important to note that the REAL platform will take a 10% fee of all profits. If a property earns 1,000 Ether in rental income, the REAL platform will take 10% as commission for finding and hosting the property on their website.  How does it make money?(1) Through the REAL platform, both investors and property owners will be brought together in one “marketplace” of sorts. Property owners are able to “tokenize” their real estate holdings, thus making them more liquid, and users are able to use REAL tokens to gain real ownership over the property. The REAL team will also be selecting, acquiring and managing a variety of real estate properties all over the world. The team aims to employ three value-investment philosophies to their acquisition strategy:  “Buy-to-lease” commercial properties: These are commercial properties that the REAL team will purchase and lease out. The goal is to recoup your original investment through leasing, while the asset appreciates in value over time. “Buy-to-sell” flip properties: These are commercial or residential properties that, for one reason or another, are being sold at a discount. Generally, the purchase of the property will require some sort of further investment to flip the property, but this is not always the case. Buying low and selling high (and quickly) is the goal when using this strategy. “Loan-note” investments: These investments are “paper” investments, meaning, the REAL team would be buying the loan on some property with the goal of renegotiating the terms of the loan. Often the previous owner has failed to make payments, or is in foreclosure, so the lessor will accept less than the original loan to ensure newly negotiated payments are made on time and in full. The team will look to acquire high-quality properties in desirable locations with steady, long-term cash flows. The team states that they have already identified the Spanish market as one with room for considerable growth, and will analyze the North American, Latin American and Asian markets next. Spain, the Caribbean and United States are of particular interest to the team. Some other important details include:  — The team is aiming for 12–20% annual returns depending on the type of asset and market risk. While these returns may be smaller than some of the reported returns through cryptocurrency investment, it’s important to note that these retrurns are generally valuable in the real estate industry. REAL is essentially providing a safe haven from volatility that is more typical of cryptocurrency investment.  — REAL is aiming for a 50% loan-to-value ratio (re: putting up 50% of the total property value in a loan). They also plan to allow for 20% headroom in the ability to service the debt, which will allow for some cushion in case of unforeseen circumstances with each property.  — The team aims to build a partnership with Portblue hotels, a hotel operator that is managed by one of their advisors. This will be the first major partnership for the REAL team.  — The team aims to have a desktop, mobile and lite client of the REAL platform in order to make the use of the platform available to as many people as possible. For further details on smart contract or desktop/mobile specifications, please consult the REAL whitepaper.  Technological Specifications(1) The REAL token is the primary driver of the REAL platform. As an ERC-20 token, it has full smart contract functionality. In this case, the smart contract will complete the property acquisition for users. Users can exchange their REAL tokens for RPP (REAL Property Participation), which entitles them to a proportional amount of profits from that property. As the property earns rental income or when the property is sold, Ether will be automatically deposited into the RPP holder’s wallet. Further, once the property is no longer owned by the REAL team, the REAL tokens that the user exchanged for RPP for participation in that property will be returned to them.  Evaluating new property   The REAL team will ensure that the process of finding new property is intensive and results in a positive outcome for REAL token holders. Their 11 step checklist found in their whitepaper involves identifying a location and property, renovating and furnishing it post-purchase, and ensuring profitability through low vacancy rates and available maintenance processes when necessary.  Once a property has been purchased, a smart contract executes the following steps in order to list the property on the REAL platform:  A property register ID, acquisition documentation hash (using IPFS), custody information (using IPFS), total amount of participants, and value in REAL from each participant are all included. The smart contract will mint the necessary RPP for each property, allowing users to exchange REAL tokens for property participation/ownership. The smart contract associated with each property will hold the REAL contributed for each user and return the REAL tokens when the property has been sold. Process Flow of the platform  The REAL team lists a helpful 12-step process flow in their whitepaper for ease of understanding:  1. The REAL Platform invests in the acquisition of a property and offers participation(s) to platform users. For that, we will create a REAL Property Contract (RPC), a smart contract of physical property.  2. The REAL Platform creates participations that are offered to the users through REAL Property Participations (RPP). These are internal tokens that describe the participation details for each property with their different valuations and participation percentages.  3. Users will get REAL Tokens in the Token sale, or at exchanges. We will facilitate on our site the exchanges link where users can buy REAL Tokens.  4. Once the users have REAL, they will be able to acquire RPP (Real Property Participation(s)) by exchanging REAL Tokens.  5. Property participation(s) of each property generates profits through rentals.  6. These profits will be split according to the participation percentage of each user in that property. (This will be detailed in the RPPs).  7. Rental profits will be paid monthly among the RPP owners in Ether.  8. The REAL Platform sells the property.  9. Profits from the sale of the property are obtained.  10. The profits are split proportionally among users as detailed by the RPPs.  11. Each user’s profits are paid in Ether.  12. Each user gets their REAL Tokens back when the sale transaction is finished.  Finally, it is important to note that the REAL team has spent time analyzing the future price of the REAL token and potential profit or loss. They also include information on what they believe will be a token price “floor effect” (re: token cannot go lower than “x” price) and have analyzed the level of growth of the project. All of these equations created by REAL can be found towards the end of their whitepaper. (1)",False

Overseas buyers are now the biggest investors in many real estate markets. Also, local investors want like to invest in overseas properties.  NO LIQUID INVESTMENTS A couple of months ago I wanted to make my investments in the platform liquid. I could not. As in typical Real Estate investments, I have to wait until properties are sold to get my money and profits back.  REGULATORY AND BUREAUCRATIC PROCESS Dealing with wire transfers and banks when participating in the investment is burdensome. These companies also are set up in an old fashion way to provide more trust, but everything ends up being unnecessarily complicated.  LACK OF TRUST I could see how many users were very suspicious in the sites forums and very preoccupied with the site activities. Some sites decide to audit their activities but that does not seem to be enough.  SOLUTION: As experienced Online and Real Estate entrepreneurs we immediately recognized the opportunity of solving those issues by applying Blockchain technology.  We sat together with Blockchain experts in Barcelona and developed and tested a solution on a small scale.  Thanks to Cryptocurrency and Smart contracts, we can address all these matters and provide a :  GLOBAL PLATFORM FOR GLOBAL INVESTORS AND PROPERTIES We are building a Crowdfunding site where anyone from any part of the world will be able to receive the profits from a flat in Barcelona, a Hotel in Mallorca, a penthouse in New York or a commercial space in Berlin.  TOKENIZATION OF PROPERTIES = SELL & BUY INSTANTLY Thanks to the tokenization of properties and the ease of token transfers, we will enable a secondary market section and allow anyone to sell their investment to other users in the platform without waiting for the property to sell.  USABLE & SIMPLE ONLINE WEB/APP Everything will be done from an easy and simple Web and APP without the need of signing documents, notaries or bank transfers.  BLOCKCHAIN AND SMART CONTRACTS LAYER Every step of our activity, from property buying with third party value appraisals, to adding into the system, renting and selling, will be recorded on the Blockchain so everyone will be able to audit and verify the information.

We’ve rewritten and adapted this slightly for churches, but every organization (whether it’s business, government, educational institutions, etc.) can have a tendency to hold on to old forms long after their effectiveness has diminished or ceased entirely.  The tribal wisdom of the Dakota Indians—passed on from generation to generation—says that when you discover that you are riding a dead horse, the best strategy is to dismount.  Modern churches, however, have found a whole range of far more advanced strategies to use, such as:  1.     Buying a stronger whip.  2.     Changing riders.  3.     Declaring, “God told us to ride this horse.”  4.     Appointing a committee to study the horse.  5.     Threatening the horse with termination.  6.     Proclaiming, “This is the way we’ve always ridden this horse.”  7.     Develop a training session to improve our riding ability.  8.     Reminding ourselves that other churches ride this same kind of horse.  9.     Determining that riders who don’t stay on dead horses are lazy, lack drive, and have no ambition – then replacing them.  10.  Lowering the standards so that dead horses can be included.  11.  Reclassifying the horse as “living-impaired.”  12.  Hiring an outside consultant to advise on how to better ride the horse.  13.  Harnessing several dead horses together to increase the speed.  14.  Confessing boldy, “This horse is not dead, but alive!”  15.  Providing additional funding and/or training to increase the dead horse’s performance.  16.  Riding the dead horse “outside the box.”  17.  Get the horse a Web site.  18.  Killing all the other horses so the dead one doesn’t stand out.  19.  Taking a positive outlook – pronouncing that the dead horse doesn’t have to be fed, it is less costly, carries lower overhead, and therefore contributes substantially more to the bottom line of the church’s budget than do some other horses.  20.  Rewriting the expected performance requirements for all horses.  21.  Promoting the dead horse to a supervisory position.  22.  Name the dead horse, “paradigm shift” and keep riding it.  23.  Riding the dead horse “smarter, not harder.”  24.  Stating that other horses reflect compromise, and are not from God.  25.  Remembering all the good times you had while riding that horse.",False

I don't understand well the technology.  I will try to learn, maybe your technologic solution is great to create a crowdfunding real state platform. I see more as an investor:   If you bought 100 ETH in the ICO ( ETH was 300 USD ) , so you spend 30,000 USD, now you will have 17.300 USD ( as each ETH give you 220 REAL )  If you just keep the ETH now you will have 91.000 USD as ETH Tripled.  Lucky for REAL that their 11.000.000 would become about 30.000.000 USD but not so lucky for investors.  As well REAL just sell 50 % of tokens and didn't burn the rest, this normally dilutes the value of the token.   And at the end changing Bitcoins or ETH for REAL, seems a bad decision not only in the ICO but in future, changing increases in bitcoin price for small rentability in real state.  Thanks for your time, no offense, people in REAL  more clever than me, so the money depart from me.   NOTE: Hope someone can illustrate me why is necessary use blockchain to develop a crowdfunded real state platform. I have some doubts in this recent conversation.  "" First, if you trust a third party like Bittrex with your coins/tokens, good for you, personally I don't leave coins/tokens in exchanges, unless it's decentralized and I own the private keys"". I supposed some Exchanges like Coinbase or Bittrex never hacked because high security, but who knows. Anyway if you send Ethereum to REAL ( the company ) they can be hacked as well, if they are hacked probably the REAL token will suffer.   ""Second you're saying ""I can send you Bitcoins or ETH"" but you write also ""you can run without blockchain"". But btc and eth are on blockchains Cheesy"" That is like to say that if Facebook accepts bitcoin as payment all the platform is in Blockchain   ""Third, why I have to send manually btc or eth to hundreds of addresses if a smart contract can do it in one go? "" If you opened an account in REAL  you could have your participation and payments there. ""This could be in Ethereum, but will be needed to be insured againtst hacking, as does Coinbase.  The investor in real state  wants an stable investment  ( appreciation of value of property and rents ) , but using blockchain makes the REAL token an speculative one as is trading in the exchanges, so for me not make any sense as a business concept. Maybe I am wrong but for me the team started with a good idea of crowdfunding real state but just used the blockchain technology when they saw the huge opportunity to receive free money from the madness of our times. Now they will try to defend blockchain is a revolution to keep the interes of people and new investors. I suppose this happens in many projects out there.  I will see how works the platform and if blockchain really offers something here but I think in this case is just the opposite, using a token that can be traded in exchanges and has an high volatility is a problem for the real state investor ( apart that with the current liquidity if someone sells just a little of REAL the value just goes to 0 ).

I agree that was a bad investment in the ICO. But I disagree that is a good investment if you like the real state strategy.  The token don't make any sense. With not liquidity if you sell the value of 15 ETH in  REAL the value goes to 0. If you want to buy 15 ETH of REAL to buy some real state the price will sky rocket. For this to work it would be necessary that investors just use a very liquid crypto, as Bitcoin or maybe ETH.  I think they try to adapt some parts of blockchain technology to their crowdfunding real state idea but they made a company that don't make any sense. For me they didn't need a token, or at least this token can't be used to invest in the first place. Maybe  they use some parts of blockchain technology, but for me was never needed.  I don't think the founders Bernardo Hernandez and Enrique Dubois are scammers, they just jump to the opportunity of dumb money. Maybe they will figure out some solution ( all will be done in ETH, in fact I believe they do some payments with it ) but then the REAL token is just useless and not serious exchange will ever list it.  If you want to invest in Real State using this  soon you will realize you can't calculate your rendability using the REAL Token.",False

Once they do, that real estate should generate a return for token holders. If that happens, the liquidity will appear. As an example, let's say the real estate provides a 10% annual return based on its true value. If the token is trading at a 50% discount, you'd earn a 20% return for buying it at that price. I can pretty much guarantee there will be buyers if the return looks attractive.  However, this is the same reason you can't really expect the token to trade at much of a premium. If the real estate is generating a 10% return and you pay 2x the value for the token, you'd only earn 5%.  That said, I think you're right about other points. The token isn't really necessary, and this business doesn't even have to be on the blockchain. Fractional ownership real estate already exists. It's not a very liquid business, but REAL isn't solving that problem either.  The team didn't scam anyone. Unfortunately, they structured the ICO in a way that made it a terrible investment, but they were pretty upfront about the terms. Anyone who did proper research into the ICO should have known it wasn't worthwhile. The team saw an ""easy"" way to raise money and took advantage of it.",False

Go look up 'REAL' on coinmarketcap and then look at the 'Historical Data' tab. Check out all of those numbers -- they are way off. I started getting confused when I was looking at the price jump significantly -- seeing that millions supposedly went into it at that time, but then the 24 hour volume on the exchanges just didn't add up to that kind of a jump -- not even close.  Does anyone know why this happens? How are we supposed to know real valuation of a company's token without trustworthy data? It falsely inflates the token value. Thanks in advance.",False

First basic facts: - REAL received 37049 ETH - They minted 19.717.288 tokens. Out of those, 25% is a reserve for future projects. 51% went to investors, 4% were bounties, and 20% went to the team. The team cannot sell their tokens for a year time, but since they are way behind the schedule.... i'll come to that.  As for today we've got (51%+4%)*19.717.288 tokens minted. That is 10.844.508,4 tokens at disposal.  Out of their 37049 ETH, they will invest 70%, that is 25934,3 ETH.  With ETH valued at $1000 that accounts to $25.934.300      If they manage to launch their platform AND buy a property before the team is able to sell their REAL, the value (when 1ETH=$1000) is ~2,39, however taken their policy into consideration it makes much more sense to value REAL not in USD, but in ETH,  BUT ONLY BEFORE PROPERTY ACQUISITION.  Ceteris paribus 1 REAL is worth approx. 0,0023914 ETH (25934,3 ETH / 10844508,4 REAL) or 0,0017537 ETH (25934,3 ETH / 14787966 REAL ) if they acquire  properties after the team can sell their tokens (after that the number of disposable REAL tokens will increase from 10.844.508,4 to 14.787.966).  After they buy the properties, increase of ETH value means decrease of REAL value in ETH (meaning that value in $ should remain the same)",False

Here you can find the 2015, 2016 and 2017 forecast update, where you can find more information about this approach.  Updated values for bitcoin (in brackets values of last year) using daily data since August 2010 (average of 4 exchanges when possible).   BTC/USD Growth Factor G   1.0028 (1.0007) Shannon Probability P   0.5384 (0.519) Root mean square RMS (see this as volatility)   0.059 (0.045 ) Bitcoin's entropic values versus the Usd strongly improved in 2017 but volatility increased a bit, despite this the Growth Factor (G) increased up to 1.0028% (remember that volatility is detrimental to the Growth Factor) compounded daily or 280% yearly up from 30% of 1y ago. Also the optimal fraction of your capital to invest in bitcoin improved in 2017 with a 7.7% instead of 6.4% of 1y ago.   2018 Price forecast    Full volatility    Half volatility Forecast using only G*   ~38700$   ~38700$ Upper bound adding volatility   ~121000$   ~68000$ Lower bound subtracting volatility   ~12300$   ~21800$ *38700 is obtained with today price (around 13800$) times (1.0028^365)=~2.77 13800*2.77=38740, just change 365 with the number of days you prefer for a different forecast.  It's interesting to notice that with reduced volatility the support level is above the actual quote of XBTUSD (13800$ at the moment i'm writing) because the growth factor (G) is very high and is skewing everything to the upside. If volatility stays low the uptrend should push bitcoin above 22k USD during the year without too much effort, it's a scenario i prefer instead of wild price swings.  What went wrong in 2017? A year ago, I forecasted a top of $2900, reached in July 2017 with an intermediate Top well ahead of the end of the year. I tried to double the volatility factor (rms) to see the next level after a reader asked me about the possibility that bitcoin was in a bubble above 2900$. The next level was around 6000$, again this new level has been broken at the end of October. The last 2 months have been crazy and the explanation is a huge change in shift in this market happened in March 2017 (with altcoins literally exploding) that basically erased the reliability of the January 2017 forecast. I think that this year forecast should be more accurate compared to last year.  Conclusions For this year i think that i'll consider the support/resistance levels obtained with a full volatility value with the result to have for the whole 2018 a good probability to stay inside the 12300$-121000$ price zone. At the same time i think that at the end of a strong buying climax period, if any, it will be wise to reduce your bitcoin investment if the price goes above 60k-70k USD.  I'm at your disposal for any questions; see you at the next update and Happy New Year!",False

REAL will earn a 10% commission fee on all income or value appreciation profits from investments made through the platform.

The platform doesn't generate any income for token holders at all.  That said, a successful real estate manager will typically shoot for 2x returns in 5-10 years. On occasion you might see some hit 3x - 5x, but that's pretty rare. It's possible that REAL could achieve that but it has nothing to do with  pioneering tokenized real estate. It's all about whether or not they can find good real estate deals to invest in.  I realized when I said it was ""impossible"" we were referring to returns of 20x, but for some reason I typed 10x into my reply. They could get lucky with a 10x return since the token is trading at half its value right now. If they could 5x what they invest and also hit the tokens actual value, that would be a 10x total. I think that's highly unlikely, but possible. A 20x still seems pretty impossible to me (unless ETH continues to run up while they hold it).",False

Even if they stuck to the time line, they would have spent most of the capital they raised on development so there wouldn't be much left to actually invest in real estate.

It is fun to see the same impatient whining attitude across all ICO threads.

People thinking that you just go to your bank with the raised crypto funds, get on many exchanges, navigate on the current regulatory environment, and have everything done in one month are delusional.  There is no such thing as overnight success and this team is very experienced and capable.  Very bullish on REAL.  I keep my eye on the Real Etherscan address where all the Eth was collected, they still have nearly 26,000 ETH in the main wallet that is now worth $12 million, they have just in the last 24 hours cashed out 8,000 eth from the platform budget, this guarantees that they have the $3million they have budgeted for the platform build.  The market cap is of REAL is only $3.9million but they have assets of $12 Million now to spend on properties, volume is low because nobody is selling – granted nobody is really buying either. I’ve been critical of the team previously but I honestly think if they can keep to the roadmap and Eth can maintain this sort of support until January time, we’ll be in a great situation with this token.

They cut their budget because they were basically forced to. Aside from the pressure put on them to address the issue, if they didn't do anything, they would have had an $8 million budget and only $3 million to invest. That's obviously not good economics.  Plus, they've either been unwilling or unable to show the breakdown behind the $3 million budget. They provided detail when it was $8 million, so not sure why it's not provided with the updated budget.  To their credit, Melissa messaged me privately to ask what they could do to help show me they are a capable team and I outlined a couple of the specific issues I have.

By investing in REAL, you're buying into EU real estate (although we don't really know what country for sure). It also sounds like it'll likely be hotel investments. Let's put aside the possibility that they are actually just going to sell you a property they already own.  Holding on to tokens is therefore a hedge against crypto investments. Essentially you're saying you'd rather sell some of your cryptos, convert it to fiat (Euros) and buy real estate. You're betting that the 12% - 20% returns they are targeting is better than you can earn in cryptos on a risk-adjusted basis.  Assuming they will be buying hotel assets, it's likely a bet on the economy (although we don't know which one). Most hotels either target business travelers or tourists, but both depend on a strong economy. So, in order for your investment to do well, the dependant economy has to do well.  It sounds like you won't have to buy into each investment they propose, but since they didn't raise that much money, I don't know how many choices you'll have. If you don't like their first investment, you can hold onto your REAL tokens instead of buying RPPs, but then you're not earning a return on your money, so it's just tied up.  Of course, if the Euro isn't your local currency, then you're you're taking that currency risk as well.  I know nobody asked the question, but I find this ICO fascinating and it's helping me become a better ICO investor as I think about what I'd REALLY be buying into.",False

The team has confirmed there's 15 million tokens that will be in circulation, not counting the ones being reserved for a future sale (or possibly burned). They raised around 37,000 ETH.  Putting the budget issue aside for a moment, the MAX price is 0.0025 ETH/REAL. That's just simple math. 37,000 ETH divided by 15 million tokens.  Of course not all of the 37,000 ETH will be used for investment since they need to set funds aside for the Operating Budget. We know they were originally budgeting $8 million, but that's way too much considering the value of the ETH they are holding is around $11.1 million. I'm assuming an ETH price of $300, even though it's trading lower today.  They haven't released the new budget yet, so that's the big question. The last trade on EtherDelta was at 0.00128. This implies that the company will invest 19,200 ETH and 17,800 is being set aside for the budget. That's $5.3 million, or a little more than $1 million per year.  I can't say if this is a reasonable budget or not, but that's what's being priced if you just look at the amount of ETH they are holding. Of course, there are other considerations, many of which I've outlined in previous posts.  I'm still keeping an eye on this, but I've decided that it's still too expensive for me right now.

They are only a store of value that gives you the right to buy RPP tokens.  Until they start making investments, there's just cash (or ETH) sitting in the accounts. Why would anyone pay more than $1.00 for $1.00? Even if the prospect of them making investments is great, you don't know that you'll actually get a piece of it. REAL token holders will be competing to buy RPP tokens, so you're not guaranteed to get a piece of a great deal just because you hold REAL. For that reason, I think the RPP tokens will be more representative of the real estate prices / opportunities.  There will likely be an inverse relationship between REAL and RPP once they start making investments. In aggregate, the value of RPPs should approximately equal the value all the real estate they own. If the RPPs are undervalued, people will pay more for REALs for an opportunity to buy in. If RPPs are overvalued, the price of REALs should go down.  Remember, right now the value of all REAL tokens combined should be equal to the value all the cash/ETH they hold. As they invest everything into real estate, the value of all the REAL should be somewhat equal to the value of all the real estate. Same with the RPPs. Short term deviations in price can happen, but you'd expect them to self-correct as people notice they can buy $1.00 of real estate for $0.75.",False

By definition, if REAL tokens give you claim to (estimated)  19,200 ETH they are holding for investment, that's what the aggregate value of the tokens should be. Across 15 million tokens, that's 0.00128 each. This is a huge discount from the ICO price because there's a big loss of funds associated with team compensation and other costs.  I wasn't clear enough in my previous post. The sentence you highlighted should have said:  ""the value of all REAL tokens combined should be equal to the value all the *INVESTABLE* cash/ETH they hold"".  You could apply some other discounts, but I'm just trying to figure out the absolute max price this token could be worth right now. My point is it would be irrational for anyone to value it for more than the amount of investable cash they hold. Anyone waiting for the price to recover to the ICO value is out of their mind because that would be assuming the 37,000 ETH raised is still available for investment. In reality a much smaller amount is available.  I'm surprised more people aren't flipping out over this.",False

There are plenty of people like that buying coins, but hoping to find uneducated buyers isn't a great investment strategy. Fundamentally, the price should never go back to ICO prices.  Regarding the decision to hold ETH longer, it's pretty ironic. Investors could have held ETH for themselves if they wanted appreciation without having to pay salaries for the team. So if they thought ETH was going to go up more than 12%-20%, they shouldn't be investing in the token.  As I mentioned in a previous post, at some point the team will have to convert to fiat in order to invest in real estate. So, by buying tokens, you're really buying into a fiat based investment and will lose out on any ETH appreciation (once they convert).  So either you want the ETH exposure and shouldn't invest, or you want the real estate exposure (based in fiat) because you think it'll outperform ETH. In that case, you should theoretically want them to convert to fiat because you wouldn't have bought tokens if you thought ETH was going to go up.",False

My assumption is that before the ICO they already knew which properties they want to buy. That is both good and bad. To me more bad than good since it raises more questions regarding true intensions. However if they turn out to be 'honest' in what they do, and the money they have is enough to buy at least one of the resorts, than most important question is how will they approach the 8M Core Operating Budget. It's quite complicated, but if they had reached their initial CAP, it would take slighlty under two years to brake even. They managed to gather 10% or less of what they intended, so ... anything is possible. What I'm absolutely sure of is that $11M is way to little to make it work as planned.",False

I'm not a bitpro, however I try to get the knowledge regarding crypto. To make it short. From what I understood it's common to give 20% to developers. On top they decided to have 29% to their disposal. Just in case there was a need for that tokens. If I get you right, what you mean by finanacing the properties is the maintanance costs eg. keeping management, keeping housekeepers and so on. I tried to get an answer whether that was included in their 20% goal, but I got no answer. So I guess 20% was.. undescribable.

So, together with the 51% above, around 80% should be available for investment LESS $8 million reserved for 5 years of operating expenses (this is the Core Budget that was referenced).  Typically, with institutional investments, you'd expect the following, but it shouldn't be surprising that REAL fees are higher since they are a smaller platform. That said, the essence of how it works should still be fair to investors.  Management fees: 1.5% - 2.0% of invested equity annually. Let's work backwards to see how much they can support. If $8 million is supposed to last 5 years, that's $1.6 million per year. Using the 2% of equity rule, that should support $80 million of investable capital (including the 29% that's being held in reserve). They have raised $11 million so far.  Incentive fees: Typically 20% over a return hurdle. Since they are targeting returns of 12% - 20%, you'd probably expect a 7% - 8% return hurdle (let's say 7%). This means that the team shouldn't take a portion of the profits until investors have earned 7%. After that point, investors should receive 80% and the team should receive 20%. Again, this is from an institutional perspective.  I've seen there be no hurdles, where the team starts earning a percentage of any profit. So once investors get their money back, there's an 80/20 split. However, the REAL team is taking 20% right off the bat, from day 1. Yes, there's a lockup period and they are being paid in REAL tokens, but they are still guaranteed this payment. This is extremely egregious in my opinion.",False

They don't need all of the employees they have for 4 years straight, especially when that's soaking up the large majority of the budget.  I don't knock REAL for the budget because they were transparent about it, so there's enough info for any diligent investor to know what they're getting into here.  That doesn't condone it though, and to me it looks like, FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF THE REAL COMPANY, positions and/or salaries need to be shaved.  REAL should work within their means.   It's more important to have capital to invest on real estate than to use the large majority of the budget on anything that doesn't directly return income.   If REAL is counting on the token to grow in order to invest in real estate, that won't work if the returns to the token holders are laughable.

Otherwise the business falls apart since they won't have much money to actually buy real estate. However, it's not clear if they'll be able to actually execute their strategy with too small of a budget.  Regarding your last comment about needing the price of REALs to appreciate so they have more money to invest, you're looking at it the wrong way. It has zero impact on how much they can invest since they raised a fixed amount of ETH and that's what will be used. A higher price would help the team members personally (not investors) since that's how they received their 20%  That being said, they could sell the reserve tokens, so a higher price could help in that respect.  The budget is really the big question since the REAL token value is highly dependent on this. The higher the budget, the lower the value of REAL tokens. It's a balancing act since they didn't raise as much money as expected, but they still need money to run their business.  It was really a poorly structured ICO because they set it up to disadvantage early investors. That's the opposite of how it should have been run. This is aside from the fact that they didn't provide enough info on the real estate side of the business, which is really what token holders bought in to.  The ONLY things that should matter to token holders is the real estate investment strategy and how any non-investment money is being spent/allocated. They screwed up both, which I suspect is why they didn't raise enough money. There should have also been a minimum amount they need to raise or have everyone refunded. Because they didn't do that, they now have the issue of having to drastically reduce their budget, which is a HUGE problem.  At some point, a real estate company will put together an ICO  the right way, so that's what you want to keep an eye out for if you're interested in the space.",False

Considering the current financial state of REAL and some of the profit projections they make on investment (I believe 10%), what would you say the tokens are worth in your mind at this time?

The reserves can be sold to new investors in the future, which would raise additional ETH.  Regarding the valuation, it's impossible to know what's a fair price until we get the following info:  * An updated budget * More info on how the reserves work and how much is actually set aside for future investment (vs any non-investment expenses) * Estimated timing on their first property purchase * Much more detail on their real estate strategy and their previous experience implementing that strategy. * it would be helpful if they could also confirm how much ETH and fiat they currently hold. I have a pretty good idea based on the ICO results they posted, but confirmation would be helpful.  Without having any of this info, I'd say the max price right now is about $0.20 if the budget is still $8 million and assuming they will acquire their first property very soon.  My guess is that they are working on reducing their budget. That would raise my estimate IF I thought they could still pull off their business plan based on the new budget, so there's a balancing act there.  It doesn't really take many people on the real estate side to acquire and manage just a few properties (in my opinion), but the tech side adds a lot of bloat that most real estate firms don't have to carry.  Of course, if they were to reduce the number of people they hire, you'd expect a commensurate reduction in the amount of REAL set aside for the team. Otherwise all the remaining people end up getting more.",False

All it does is provide you with the right to buy into their real estate assets (by acquiring RPP tokens), but there are no other benefits to REAL token holders. For that reason, it should always be pegged to fiat value, with a potential illiquidity discount.  It's the the RPP tokens that should fluctuate in price based on the value of the underlying real estate.  The only point where REAL tokens should maybe appreciate is after the team has realized a long track record of successful investments based on a competitive advantage they hold. At that point people might be willing to pay a premium to buy REAL tokens just for the chance to invest in the real estate.  On the other hand, it makes sense for the tokens to be trading below ICO value until the first properties are available to invest in. Until then, they are just sitting idle so there's a big opportunity cost for holding them.  So the when the tech is ready should theoretically have no impact on the token price either. The big question is when will that first property be available?  Am I wrong in how I'm thinking about this?",False

There is a common problem with centralized exchanges, that is, they become too powerful and eventually fragile: https://medium.com/@sixarp/the-elephant-in-the-crypto-room-centralized-exchanges-b857720d1ec8  But EtherDelta has its own share of problems. Besides the obvious UI and UX shortcomings, it doesn't have order matching: you have to manually click on orders in the order book to execute them. One source says it is a technical limitation of the smart contract, while not impossible it would be expensive.  It costs extra gas when placing the order because you have to somehow sort it on-chain. It costs extra gas when doing a trade because you have to iterate through this sorted list. There are lots of ways you can think of to do this, but they all come out to the same result: expensive.  https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6t4w55/does_etherdelta_has_a_matching_algorithm_or_the/   Another source says it was a deliberate choice: the lack of order matching minimizes trust.  EtherDelta and 0x both attempt to minimize trust in the off-chain matching service by not giving it the power to perform automatic matching of the buy and sell orders.  http://hackingdistributed.com/2017/08/13/cost-of-decent/",False

The demand is already there.  - they already have their eye on a first property to acquire. When they add properties to the platform and people can actually use the REAL tokens, that will prevent large dumps, because the REAL platform only accepts REAL tokens.  This last point deserves some elaboration, because it's a very important one. When you actively participate on the REAL platform and buy RPPs (ownership in property), your REAL tokens will essentially be 'locked-in' that property. You only get them back if/when you sell them the RPP back. On the other hand, if you want to keep your investment and continue to invest in more/different properties on the platform, you will first have to buy more REAL tokens. In other words: the supply decreases and the demand increases, which translates into price increase.  Needless to say, adding attractive properties to the REAL platform is going to determine the success of this project.",False

You make money from your initial investment, based upon rental income, or property sales, and property appreciation value.

Participate in http://www.real.markets  Update from CEO  We have a very good new about Pre-Sale participants and more general updates below. As you might know, we did run a pre-sale reservation process that offered 25% Token Bonus to participants of over 100 ETH. This pre-sale reservation process failed so everyone that participated during the first 25,000 ETH got the 25% as we said in our Whitepaper terms. We understand that pre-sale registered users feel that is unfair to them because of their previous and big commitment (over 100 ETH) so we have decided to give an additional 5% Token Bonus to those that registered in presale and deposited in the Token Sale. (Total of 30% Token Bonus). The requirement is that they should contact info@real.markets with subject ""Presale bonus"" during the next 7 days and provide your deposit info (today is last day).  We hope you find this solution satisfying for all parties. We are working hard to ensure everything is done right and everybody is happy about their contribution.  If you are a pre-sale participant and did not purchase yet, go ahead, this is your last day to receive 30% BONUS. Blockchain network is not congested as yesterday so it should go smoothly and quick.  Go to http://www.real.markets to get the details and participate. (address starts with 0x92 and ends with ab10)  Main Token Sale participants can also participate and get 20% Token Bonus (we are in second bonus tier until 50,000 received ETH)  On a separate note: I wanted to share following updates for your information:  -Received amount during the first 24H is 29,000 ETH, around 11,3MM USD. -The hard cap is now 100,000 ETH (Whitepaper stated that 200K Hardcap only entered into effect if the soft cap was reached during the first 6 hours). -Website will be updated today with live progress information. -You can check Live progress here in the meantime directly here:  https://etherscan.io/address/0x2fab4598bf2e09b0d2e48474984315fb36df61b8#internaltx  (address is different because that is the joint Multisig account with Bitcoinsuisse, where funds are securely stored)  -We have received some complaints from USA and Singapore people because of the restriction preventing them from participating.

But the upside of this ICO is that there is a guarantee that the token can only drop so far, because it's backed by real world properties. REAL have mentioned in their white paper that they estimate 10-12% profit on your investment. Not a big increase compared to some ICO's, but the big part is stability. As the saying goes, slow and steady wins the race.  10-12% could be seen as a conservative estimate. The housing market is doing well and when properties are sold you will get parts of the profit (if you used your REAL tokens to invest in said property).",False

The ""1 ETH = 220 tokens"" plan was made when ETH was around $200.  It's now nearly double that.  In other words, the plan was for investors to obtain REAL tokens at around $1 each; now, investors would have to pay around $2 each.  There's been no change in what REAL brings to the table in that time, but now they stand to collect double their planned ICO proceeds merely because of a substantial change in ETH valuation.  The end result being that investors stand to receive half the value they were intended to get.  And, assuming REAL did a good job valuing their offering when initially announcing ""1 ETH = 220 tokens,"" the current ETH exchange rate means REAL will start out being substantially overvalued.

There will always be people looking to buy, rent, sell a property. Even though property value can decrease over time (due to a number of circumstances), real estate proves to be a good way to preserve your wealth, whereas your property can be considered an asset. One of the best advantages (in my opinion) is the residual income from leasing your property out. You can earn monthly, quarterly, annually, etc. A nice little bit of steady income in your piggy bank!  ",False

These tokens will bring dividends based on the rent. So the price of the tokens naturally should always be higher than the dividends x duration of time.

I have a few queries -  1) As of now what's available to the public and potential investors is the website, and few details of the members of the team. There's a 5 year operational fund plan that has been shown in the white paper, but no business plan. The company is hardly a couple of months old - and there aren't clear timeline goals given. After the ICO, within how much time can investors expect rental income, for instance?  2) Depending on where the REAL team plans on acquiring properties -there are going to be a lot of macroeconomic factors in play - since we are talking mid - long term investments. From what I understand a good portion of the team is from Spain, so naturally there would be inclination to invest in a comfort zone / known area. However how is the team going to ensure investments are going to be in areas where demand outstrips supply, to ensure capital gains mid to long term?  3) As I understand there's an agreement with a hotel chain, are agreements going to be presented to investors? How do investors know agreements are negotiated favourably for the investor - a hypothetical situation is there's a renter, a broker and an investor, the broker may give favourable terms in comparison to the local market to the renter and take a cut in the savings to the renter (say 20%), at the same time take 10% from the investor from the rent - how is it that fair play ensured?  4) As a potential investor my question is simple - why should I not invest in a local rental property and invest in REAL; other than the fact that with REAL I can invest a minimal sum that may not be the complete value of a property? If I can afford to invest in whole properties myself - what is the attraction of REAL to me? Am I not a target audience for REAL?  Is the REAL model tuned only to people who cannot afford to invest in complete properties themselves?  5) Another concern is REAL seeks a 400K ether hard cap invest (120 million US$ today approx) if REAL would assure potential investors that capital losses would be on REAL's account then I understand that some risk is going to be absorbed by REAL and that is a benefit to investors - otherwise REAL doesn't possess much risk since investments are made with OPM (other people's money) and at most the lose the profits they could have gained.  How can you allay this concern of investors - that REAL's risk in all of this is highly limited?",False

No offence, but ......  I was very interested in this but the second I read they would be getting bank loans I was put off. I would be put off investing in a bank een that gives loans to crowdfunding purchases. That laone must have a entire whole new manual written. Mortgages generally have a completley different law when it comes to a joint ownership. It must be insane for a crowdfunding ownership. The legalities and the concern over lawsuits from the crowd wuld be something I think would scare a bank away. So for that point alone I would have to wonder if this ICO has gotten anything from a bank saying they would give this particular crowd funding business a bank loan or mortgage. You would think that the bank would have to go through everything before agreeing to lend to a crowdfunding business andevery single crowd funding business would have to be scrutinized by a case by case basis. i cant imagine they ahve a run of the mill loan available to this type of business.  Furthermore, back to where Melissa mentioned bank lonas, I was put off this insantly. It makes no sense to me that you would take out a loan for 50% of the house when you are crowdfunding, it is a complete waste of money and brings concern over going bankrupt very quickly, as you have the business who has ownership in the house, the crowd has ownership in the house and then the bank has the biggest ownership in the house. Do the investors get a say in what bank they will take the mortgage from or is this just up to the business to decide? The thing is the business is the minority holder out of all the groups involved. So surely the crowd gets a say in this, but then you have to think they would not have many options as i do not see banks giving crowd funding groups bank loans on houses very easily.  Actually, if you really think about it, if the business is going to get a bank loan for 50% of the house, and they have already put 350k into this business, why would these people not just buy the house themselves, with the baknk loan and then flip it and buy again, and flip it and buy a couple and flip them etc, why would they not just be a little investment group making a killing, why do they need crowdfunding if they have bank loans for half the property and there is so many of them involved. Surely with so many involved thye could do a much better job than a experimental business that still needs the same bank loan but with a ton more people with their hand in the jar.  The second they menon bank loans, it brings up a ton of questions, it becomes very experimental for a bank and the risks are huge. The risks of lawsuits for ownership from the crowd is a massive risk. Banks who give loans out to joint ventures dont give them out to one party considered 90% and 100 people considered 10%. That statement may actually be way off base from me but this whole thing has annoyed me as the more i write the more questions and concern that come to mind.  I think this is doomed to fail from the start. Why on earth would a successful business need a bank loan......they think its better to have more propertoes and multiple loans all while the bank has 50% of every single investment property than the bsuiness adthe crowd owning the properties outright. They seem to think jumping into the deep end with the bank paying for half of every investment is better than them owning one on their own. Brings me back to why would this crack team of real estate experts not just buy the houses between themselves and sell them/ They seem to be destined to earn less money by having a crowd and the bank involved in every single property. if they were as good as they claim to be they would not be starting a business like this,. Surely they have watched Million Dollar listing and know that this is going a bit backwards.  I can tell you now that the whole thing about investing in multiple countries in not very well thought out considering every single country has different land ownership laws, different lending laws, different business laws, etc etc. Not to mention tax laws.  This ICO may not exactly fail, but they seem to be taking on a lot more risk than anything i have ever heard of and i dont think they are going to have a bank that will loan them 50% on a property and if they do im sure that bank will only give them one loan at a time while they see how they go with it, which makes me think they should just do it wihtout the bank.  Anyone notice there is a reason and excuse for everything as well? Spelling mistakes pinted out so they excuse it by talking about grammar and speakign other languages. They arent going to get bank loans like that. Also if their team is full of coders...i thought they were real estate agents and thats not a good excuse anyway as they need marketing right?  So this message has had the spelling mistakes and grammar left in for keeping with he theme of the thread.  Cant supply company documents because they are new? Companies get their documents before they are officially a company/ Maybe melissa tries to answer everything and things she does not know she does nto bother asking the person who does know? Will that continue through everything? Good luck to those investing in this but if they had any clue about real estate they would know that Spain is one of the cheapest places to buy property. Why would they buy cheap property to sell just as cheap when hey have the whole world to look over. Something tells me they have not put much effort into their research here./",False

Finally, one should judge the team and previous track-record. 4- The benefits of crowdfunding would allow someone like you to diversify. Instead of having one asset you could have participation of 10-50 assets. 5- An update coming today about the soft-hard cap. A user can loose its tokens as maximum losses.

All you need to do is to be able to service the loan.  If rental income from the properties bought can service the loans it shouldn't be an issue, but lot of other pressing queries in this ICO - essentially since this is a real estate business which is tangible - unlike many other crypto 'currencies' or digital 'assets' which bring value to crypto functionality to a large extent; and from what I've read and perceive - REAL does so in a limited fashion with limited risk to the promoters and higher risk to investors - unless they can put across their points otherwise.    @ Melissa - thank you for the answers, I look forward to seeing the roadmap and hopefully more details before the pre-ICO. I'm still open to hearing more about how the REAL team could mitigate the risk to investors - you mentioned 'insurance' in point number 5 - what is the insurance for?  You certainly seem to have a strong, credible team which is good attraction to investors - I think anything into the crypto value add space I'd have jumped on without thinking twice - but you are venturing into an age old business which is real estate which has always been long term for real value - rental income is rental income be in ether or in dollars or in euros - and even though you promise liquidity for token holders - there are questions like what happens if a property is rented and I want to take my money out and the property has no other investors (no one else wants to stake their REAL tokens on this particular property) - does REAL sell it off quickly, even if it is at a loss? So does the liquidity come at a steep price? Or does it just keep the property? What if there are many properties like this - if cryptocurrency speculation is in a bear market and people want to sell all tokens, will REAL be caught bare handed - like EDL2016's fears as mentioned above, collapse with investors money? What steps are taken to protect REAL investors from a volatile cryptocurrency market, which is an added risk to traditional real estate investing?  I see lot more risk for investors and lesser risk for promoters due to these concerns - and a better presented business plan, with factors to mitigate traditional risks in real estate investing would certainly add more value than traditional real estate investing and make this investment a no-brainer.",False

Tokens for economic rights - I want to know how are these rights enforced in case of a breach of contract. Will there be a contract between the investor and your company?

Why are you using mortgages and loans to acquire properties? Isn't it better to pay them in full with the investment money, so you don't pay interest to the banks? We expect that as our site becomes popular, and as our users start receiving regular income and profits on a monthly basis, they will want to acquire more REAL Tokens in order to invest in more Real Estate assets. This will cause the REAL Token to grow in value and price. - Can you give an example of another market where this is possible? – Buy assets that are increasing in value, but with fixed dividends payouts. In the rare case of losses the REAL fee won’t be applied and the user will lose some of his invested Tokens. User won’t ever lose more than his invested Tokens. - Can you clarify this point please. If my REAL tokens investment in a building is 10% of the total price and you sell that building at a loss, then I will receive my tokens back minus 10%? Is it possible that a user can lose all of his invested token in a building?

This is just another excuse to make a shitcoin where the creators automatically (in this case 20%) earn money from selling the coin rather than providing any real investment value. This project would work if it was done in a fiat currency or simply with bitcoin because in that case there is no way to magically generate 20% out of thin air.  If bitcoin was used for this project all the money that would be invested by investors would be used to buy real estate -> real estate generates rental income -> investors get paid - management fee. The company's profits would be the management fee. The management fee could be 20% without any problems, but it would be 20% of the MONEY EARNED FROM RENTS not the whole amount invested. Just to make it easy we will say that the rental income is 10% of the total investment value. The company takes 20% from 10% = 2% profit per year for the company.

It is a crypto, accepted my millions of people now as a form of payment. Explain to me what is the benefit of making a completely new coin for such investments.  2) My issue is that you are taking ETH (something of real value) and giving back your madeup coin which is monopoly money to be honest. You are saying it is backed up by real estate, but note really, not in full.  So if I invest $100 and get $100 worth of monopoly coin. I am getting rent for example 10%. If the price of the coin rises to $150 therefore I should be getting 10% of $100 or the $150?  How are you calculating the rental income exactly?",False

Our tokens work as the internal currency of our platform. That helps us when dealing with different currencies. It is fine calling it monopoly coin, all other cryptocoins were monopoly coins in the beginning. Once they are connected to property dividends, they will become very valuable monopoly coins Perhaps one of the most.  2) If the price of the coin rises while invested you will make the same rental income but you will be holding a more valuable token asset.  We are converting income/profits into ETH and assigning it to property participation holders proportionally.",False

But anyways if it would fail  we would adapt our strategy for example accepting bitcoin and changing it for fiat to acquire the assets. In that case we would give Real token holders more benefits like big discount on comission and priority access.

We believe a crypto-REIT fund is a good project as well, but the idea behind our ecosystem is more ambitious and gives more control to the Token holder, as he/can build a custom portfolio, and has many indirect upside effects by introducing a Token as a virtual currency.  There are many comparisons available between REITs and RE Crowdfunding sites (See http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/071015/reits-vs-real-estate-crowdfunding-how-they-differ.asp).  ""The idea behind both REITs and crowdfunding is that you get a piece of the pie without all of the risk. But there are pros and cons to each method. The biggest drawback that many people have with REITs is that they generally include higher expenses. These are difficult to manage portfolios, real estate can come with some hefty maintenance costs, and there are profits to be reaped by those who run the companies. This translates into a lower rate of return for the investor.""",False
