What is a masternode?  A masternode (MN) is simply a cryptocurrency full node or computer wallet that keeps a full copy of a given Blockchain in real-time. For example, the Bitcoin Blockchain has full nodes that are always up & running.  But, masternodes are considerably different in their functionality than are normal nodes. The NEXT. Chain is based on the Bitcoin Core Blockchain, with additional modifications. We have also adopted certain features from DASH i.e Masternodes, InstantSend, PrivateSend and Governance Proposals. Our aim is to achieve a fast and extremely cost efficient decentralized network for our exchange. We combine Proof of Work and Proof of Stake consensus algorithms. Our Network is a two-layer network.  Some of the special functions that these nodes perform are:  Blockrewards (45% PoW miners, 45% masternodes, and 10% superblocks. Masternodes receive seniority rewards based on their long term services). Increasing privacy of transactions Executing instant transactions Participating in governance and voting Enable budgeting and treasury system in cryptos Passive income for supporting a Blockchain network.  NEXT. Chain masternodes are not standalone. Instead, they are always communicating with other such nodes to uphold a decentralized network. PoS and PoW consensus mechanisms have their individual advantages and disadvantages. PoW is more secure, it requires computer hardware, computational power, and energy costs for upholding a Blockchain network and verifying data. PoS does not require computational calculations or costly computer hardware. Rather, it relies on staking coins to uphold a network. The PoW aspect utilizes the SHA256 algorithm for maintaining the Blockchain, while the PoS part requires Masternodes.  More information on the above attributes can be found below;  Proof-of-Work Proof-of-Stake SHA256 Algorithm Masternodes   What does it take to run a masternode?  Just like full nodes in a cryptocurrency, MN’s can be run by anyone. However, there is an entry barrier in place to ensure that the system does not become malicious. The entry barrier is what one needs to commit or collateralize certain units of that particular cryptocurrency to run a MN.  This is done to ensure that an MN owner does not cheat or corrupt the system and the best of doing so is by putting this entry barrier where the masternode operator has something at stake.  So, naturally, it becomes less likely that a masternode operator will cheat due to having something at stake. If a masternode operator chooses to be malicious, he will be punished in the form of devaluation of his or her own HODLings.  Now that you have understood the concept of masternode, let’s jump to what one needs to set it up:  Collateral of 25,000 NEXT is required to run one masternode A VPS or dedicated server to host the masternode, 24 x 7 A dedicated public IP address Up to 50GB of storage space for the Blockchain Our verification, including Know Your Customer (KYC) verification These are pretty much standard requirements for most masternode cryptocurrencies.  Now I know some you might be thinking that in order to meet all the above requirements, one needs to spend quite a bit of money. But, how can one profit?  This takes us to the next section of this write-up, which provides further clarity on the topic.  How are masternodes useful for cryptocurrency investors?  Masternodes are very useful for crypto investors because they provide monetary incentives. One can earn weekly or monthly interest on their cryptoholdings by running a masternode.  Our goal is to create a secure and fast system which will act as the backbone for all of our ecosystems transactions. Keeping in mind a circulating supply of around 3 million NEXT, it’s quite possible that our Masternode network will only consist of 30 to 60 masternodes during inception. By combining the best of PoS and PoW, will allow us to avoid security issues experienced by PoS networks harbouring a small amount of nodes.  We see holding a NEXT masternode as a rather exclusive and potentially profitable venture. Additionally, masternodes posses voting rights, which allows them to decide on directions in which our ecosystem grows and develops. Due to the network being rather small at the start, we will aim to restrict the quantity of masternodes obtainable by a single user to 1 masternode. To do so, we will require potential node holders to pass Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures.  Apply for a masternode  We select masternodes on a first come, first serve policy. Once you apply, and hold over 25,000 NEXT, we will run a check to ensure that all of the requirements to run a masternode are satisfied. As soon as we run out checks, and if you are approved, we will send you further information and custom scripts to set up a masternode.  Please login to apply for a masternode.",False

Is Chris van Steenbergen (35) from Eindhoven, whose company BiQ Group NV is taking over the controversial biodigester in Nistelrode, a smart businessman or an unreliable geezer? That question is important now that it has become known that Chris van Steenbergen is going to exploit the controversial biofermenter in Nistelrode.  The regional government withdrew the environmental permit, which leads to legal sabre-rattling. Whatever the conclusion, very clear is that when Van Steenbergen gets involved, business often ends nowhere.  Two companies went bankrupt under the leadership of Van Steenbergen: iSense BV in 2012 and iSwitch Global Group BV in 2005. In the last case, curator Lawrence van Woensel of Bogaerts & Groenen Lawyers, found that Christiaan van Steenbergen acted unlawfully. He was accused of fraudulent conveyance. He would have acted in the sale of inventory of the bankrupt company to another company he owned. The deal was therefore reversed. In a reaction, Van Steenbergen says about the bankruptcy of ten years ago: ""I was not sued for the suspicious that I would have committed a fraudulent transfer or for the fact that I acted unlawfully.""  Whatever the case, in recent years BiQ created a real Christmas tree with, for example, investment funds - each accommodated in its own private company (Ltd). At least nine Ltd’s, such as BiQ Services BV, BiQ Real Estate Fund BV and WiComm BV, were terminated within one year. The plan for a business bank, the BiQ Bank, also met with an untimely end. And a planned investment in a first part of the manure processor in Sterksel, a deal BiQ toots their own horn for, does not seem to continue, reports director Peter Schaminee. ""The deadline has been running for months,"" he says. ""But in spite of the agreement, no money has been transferred yet."" Van Steenbergen describes this as 'nonsense': ""It was just an application and not a commitment to finalize financing of the entire project.  It is a complex financing request and it takes time for investors to assess this opportunity.""  True or not, BiQ is expert in generating media attention. Barely a few months ago - december last year - the company was looking for publicity with their project the 'internet of things': connecting equipment via the internet. This seems also turned to be a balloon. ""It was actually meant to get media attention. There is no concrete plan or so"", says an intended business partner. Other information on the website - which goes black after questions from this newspaper - raises questions at least. For example, BiQ claims to have invested last year in Angellist Europe Ltd, Opentrader Ltd and Favoom Corp. Separate companies with their own legal structure. But these companies do not exist at all; these are the tradenames of BiQ Group NV. ""It is indeed a typo,"" says the entrepreneur when asked for an explanation.   Image Building a good image is important, and Van Steenbergen knows that all too well. Officially, the BiQ Group NV has their office in the prestigious Evoluon building in Eindhoven. But this turns out to be a flexible workplace and not an office at all. Van Steenbergen just operates from a terraced house in Eindhoven-Noord. In the mean time Van Steenbergen conducts business on the cutting edge. When he smells money he does not hesitate to start into a whole new branch, such as the agricultural sector. Like now with Nistelrode and the manure processor in Sterksel. A little more than a year ago, Van Steenbergen - who made a name for himself with 'piepers' last decade – got attention in the national media with a lawsuit against KPN. This Telecom giant would have unlawfully gotten the paging customers of Euromessage, a company the entrepreneur had sold. During interim proceedings the judge ruled different and for the time being KPN was vindicated. Van Steenbergen says that main proceedings will follow. A few months earlier Van Steenbergen had more success: the judge agreed with the bankruptcy he had applied for from the same company: Euromessage.  Van Steenbergen also has political ambitions, as it turns out. His first cautious steps in the political arena however seem to have come to nothing. The political movement Politiek Correct, established in 2012 with Van Steenbergen as sole board member never submitted an electoral list, according to the Electoral Council.  To be continued – that is for sure.
