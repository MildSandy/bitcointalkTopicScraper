Despite his colloquial speech and foreign accent, he has amassed an impressive 741 876 views on his channel.  His Description page states: “Instead of recording business guides and tips, now I would like to implement blockchain technology and search for gold ICO projects…and only record those projects that I like.” In the review, he started by claiming that ETFs since 2015 had become the most popular type of exchange-traded product and that it ‘bodes well’ for Kryptoin for taking the ‘good aspects’ of ETFs and Cryptocurrencies and marrying them together.  From there, he went through Kryptoin’s webpage highlighting and reading from their features, which was pretty straight-forward. He also noted that by the time of creation of this review, there was no other system as efficient or decentralized as Kryptoin.  He was also expectant that the financial community would take notice of the project for its unique and patented system.  Also noteworthy was the fact that there was a Private Placement Memorandum, Token Auction Document, Regulation D 506 Filing, and ‘optimal’ Whitepaper.  He went on to praise the explainer video as ‘really nicely executed’ and being ‘enjoyable.’ He opined about how the Winklevoss ‘brothers’ who have been rejected twice will further enhance Kryptoin’s uniqueness and value. The timeline was praiseworthy for being ‘focused’ and ‘controlled in its growth’ which was indicative of the quality of the project commenting: “It seems like it’s not another cash grab project that just slaps ‘blockchain’ over any industry like plenty of projects that had been surfacing lately…So I am really glad to tell you guys that it’s not the case this time!” He concludes his review with a recommendation by “wholeheartedly…giving these guys a look!” To see the full review please follow the Youtube link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAFNU5RTY-8&feature=youtu.be).  https://blog.kryptoin.com/2018/08/11/crypto-master-youtuber-reviews-kryptoin-as-the-best-opportunity-for-this-month/",True

Bitcoin Indicators Suggest Price Outlook Is Improving Bitcoin looks to have fought off a recent bear market breakdown that saw prices landing just above the yearly low of $5,755. Bitcoin dropped to $5,858 yesterday at 02:00 UTC, just $103 shy of this year’s bottom, according to Bitfinex data. The suffering has been even worse for much of the altcoin market, some of which have been bleeding out to new yearly lows and seeing drops between 2–15 percent. Major cryptocurrencies such as ether and XRP dropped by 2.95 and 9.6 percent respectively, before the world’s largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization took an about-turn, stabilizing prices and reversing some of the damage from yesterday’s chaos.

BTC closed on Sunday (as per UTC) above a key falling trendline resistance level, signaling a short-term bullish-to-bearish trend change. A bullish crossover between the 5-day and 10-day moving average (MA) also favored a short-term positive price action.  However, bitcoin suffered a rising wedge breakdown (bearish pattern) in the U.S. hours on Monday, signaling that the corrective rally from the recent low of $7,040 had ended.  In the end, the failed breakout was no surprise, as low trading volumes had warned of a bull trap.  At press time, the cryptocurrency is changing hands at a four-day low of $7,426 on Bitfinex, down 2.5 percent over 24 hours.",True
