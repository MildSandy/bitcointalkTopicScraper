Part of the posts are bots, other part is hired teenager trolls, paid to post useless and meaningless positive comments to create an impression of big positive interest by community. There are still quite a lot genuine people in the threads of older coins though. But many old members have left the forum already. This forum is at the edge of dieing. This is sad, as this used to be a good place to discuss projects, to find the truth, and to expose scam projects. I don't think there is other media where you can initiate discussion with the team and ask non-pleasant question with anticipation of answer. Twitter, facebook, even reddit are just places for the scammers to lure people, as there is almost no real discussion there, but just ""announcements"". I do not imply this particular project is a scam, I just don't know, as there is no open discussion at all. Maybe you can use their Telegram/discord channels instead, typically ICO holders prefer such way of interacting with community, because they can moderate there easily, and those discussions are not visible for outsiders.

Inflr has created the first platform that connects advertisers to influencers within a marketplace using blockchain technology. With Inflr, advertisers can promote their products and services using the influence of social network users.  Always looking to create balanced relationships between advertisers and influencers, Inflr has developed an algorithm called proof-of-influence to evaluate accurately the efficacy of influencers through the use of artificial intelligence and through technical analysis of collected data such as influencer posts, scope and nature of audience reaction, longevity of post relevance, and size of “friend” networks. The analysis of these data is used to generate a score that aides in assessing the utility of different influencers and connecting the right advertisers with the right influencers.   ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ How does Proof-of-Influence work?  “Proof-of-Influence” is an algorithm that uses machine learning to analyze the big data extracted from influencers social networks to identify their followers and the main subjects that they cover and produce an Inflr ScoreTM, which measures the reach or level of engagement of the influencer.  Content Identification Inflr categorizes influencers using artificial intelligence, which identifies the main subjects of posts, photos, and videos, (such as “applying makeup” or “playing football,”) and can even analyze the emotional context of a post by detecting facial expressions in images. The algorithm also helps identify potentially unsafe or inappropriate content in images and videos.  Audience Identification The makeup of an influencer’s audience in their social networks is identified using a machine learning algorithm, which analyzes videos, photos, posts, and profiles of followers. Faces in pictures and videos are analyzed to determine attributes such as gender, age group, and ethnicity. The geographical location of an influencer’s audience is determined via geolocation obtained from followers who interact with the posts generated by the campaigns within the platform.  ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ What problems does Inflr solve?  FOR THE ADVERTISER  PROBLEM: Problems with exchange and payment methods. SOLUTION: Inflr accepts several methods of payment, including its own cryptocurrency: Inflr Coin. This ensures not only the profitability of the investment, but also facilitates the payment of influencers worldwide.  PROBLEM: Difficulty finding influencers. SOLUTION: The Inflr platform has a complete search with more than 10 filters to find the right influencer for your campaign.  PROBLEM: Lack of clarity or accuracy in influencers’ rates and values. SOLUTION: Inflr has an intelligent algorithm that determines a coherent value for the remuneration of the influencers based on their reach and engagement.   FOR THE INFLUENCER  PROBLEM: Difficulty being found by brands and agencies. SOLUTION: By registering in Inflr, the influencer will have access to various advertising campaigns created by companies that fit his/her profile.  PROBLEM: Difficulty in communicating with brand representatives. SOLUTION: With an automated and intuitive campaign management process, influencers receive all material from the advertiser through the platform, create the content, and submit it for approval. In case of doubt, the influencer can talk to the advertiser within the platform, facilitating the entire process and helping to forge relationships.  PROBLEM: Dissatisfaction with compensation, or undervaluation. SOLUTION: With Inflr Score standard values are established for each type of post so that influencers will know they are being paid fairly.  ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ INFLR TOKEN  INFLR is an ERC20 standard token utility that will give token owners the ability to access the Inflr platform with its many features and unique data on influencers and brands. Inflr Token plays a key role within the Inflr ecosystem and is designed to balance the interests of all token owners, creating incentives for everyone to actively participate in the token economy.
