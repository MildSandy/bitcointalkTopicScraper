Welcome to the start of another week with CyClean. CyClean’s ICO is officially happening, so visit our website for more information if you don’t want to miss out! While the CyClean team likes to talk about the strengths of our platform, we also think it is our duty to tell you guys more about blockchain technology. After all, it is the foundation of CyClean’s project.  Today we are going to talk about something called “decentralized applications,” or dApps (or DApps, as you may have seen online). A decentralized application is an application that is built on a network of computers instead of just one. dApps are programs that ensure that one single person does not control the application. Recently, as more dApps are built on blockchain, people are beginning to catch on. However, decentralized apps have existed before blockchain technology. You may have heard of P2P programs, such as BitTorrent and BitMessage. These are examples of decentralized apps where there isn’t one single controller of the application. https://medium.com/cyclean-coin/learning-with-cyclean-what-are-decentralized-apps-17baa8fd4df9",False

Acquisitions and mergers are quite common, however we are going down in history to be the ﬁrst to purchase a company using cryptocurrency.  On June 29th, CyClean acquired 60% shares IMUSIC THINGS LIMITED, Ketch’Up’s hold- ing company. Notably, Ketch’Up holds the #3 spot as the preferred shared bicycle plat- form in Hong Kong. Both companies are excited to embark on this exciting journey for a cleaner Earth.  How does Ketch’Up work? Ketch’Up provides bicycles on rent and is focused on reduction of overall carbon emis- sions. It connects Hong Kong’s citizens by providing them with an environmentally friend- ly public transport. Users can purchase a Ketch’Up bicycle and rent it to other users.  Ketch’Up bikes come pre-equipped with a ‘smart lock’ system which allows station-less management which revolutionary for shared bicycle. These bikes feature GPS tracking which allows bike owners to easily locate their bikes. A dedicated app allows the users to check the distance travelled and the fees that needs to be paid.  This system is designed to beneﬁt both owners as well as renters. The initial investment is roughly $1,600 which includes one year subscription for Ketch’Up’s services. The people who plan to rent can travel the city for a nominal fee. This removes the need to purchase a separate vehicle and the maintenance costs associated.  The acquisition is part of an expansion plan on CyClean’s part. CyClean presently oﬀers an electrical bike rental and sharing community operating in South Korea. The nature of business allows these companies to join forces towards a common vision of renewable energy. By expanding operations to Hong Kong, CyClean aims to accelerate the move towards clean air and energy.  The acquisition was completed through CyClean and JPAY tokens. Even though Ketch’Up was approached by multiple large businesses, they selected the Singapore based CyClean. Following the deal, CyClean also signed a MOU with Brighten, details for the agreement are yet to be revealed.  “In the future, with a reward system and coin valuation, we will continue to accelerate the green revolution and protect the health of humanity and our ecosystem.” – Executive Member, CyClean.  CyClean thanks it’s users for their continued support and trust.  (Visit CyClean on cyclean.io for more information)",False

Adoption of eco-friendly vehicles continues to rise as the technology continues to mature.  Fossil fuel powered vehicles are known to be the most significant contributors to the rising global pollution levels. They have caused toxic smogs in China in the past. Pollution affects us as a whole as the health and well being of our near, and dear ones are at risk. To read more about why vehicle exhausts fumes cause harm to human health checks out this article by Scienceabc National Geographic recently published this article stating that by the year 2040, electric cars may rule the world.  Recent news published on Engadget says that the existing electric cars can be charged up to 5 times faster, with minimal impact on internal temperatures. A heated battery will lose charge as dissipation and. Though the batteries that fast charge will last for a shorter time. This breakthrough has the potential to bring a lot of gasoline and diesel car owners to electric cars. Link to the article.  When Tesla announced their first electric cars to the market, they broke the audience’s mindset about eco-friendly vehicles. They launched a car which looked as good as a sports car, if not better. This car featured all the accessories and conveniences that one can find in a high-end vehicle.  The renewable energy game has been upgraded and has got a few tricks up its sleeve.  CyClean’s platform promotes the mass adoption of eco-friendly products. Their recent acquisition of ketchup has expanded the company’s reach to international markets like Hong Kong. What’s more, it gives the users an opportunity to reduce environmental impact while earning tokens as a reward; this results in a win-win situation.  CyClean offers users a platform where they can easily purchase and rent eco-friendly bikes.

We have CyClean’s indoor bike, outdoor bike, electric motorbike, wearable band, sunlight panel, and our electric vehicle, which is currently in the research stage. While we have this spectrum of products, each serving a different purpose, they are members of a common mining system. The products are the generators of the data that is transferred to CyClean’s server, which sits at the very top of our system.  The second layer is the wireless network. If our products function as producers of data, the network is the messenger. The data that is created by our products is delivered to our server via the wireless network.  Then we have CyClean’s mighty servers. The servers pay out the rewards according to values entered into the reward emission equation. They determine how much to pay and who to pay by matching user ID to product ID. This eliminates any concerns about double rewards or abuse of the system.

I already introduced two partners: Dogu and Seol. I’m sure you read my posts about them. There are common factors about our partner organizations. All of our partners are pursuing new technologies and technological progress. Many scientists have suggested that blockchain technology and automation are going to play a huge part in the 4th Industrial Revolution. Interestingly, Eautobahn is putting a lot of effort into creating driverless cars, and we are proud that Eautobahn is our partner.  CyClean is a blockchain project, but there is more to it. We also provide vehicles for our customers. Our ultimate goal is to provide a clean environment for those who ride vehicles, but we also know that we can’t do this alone. That is why we are partners with Eautobahn, who is well known for its car producing technologies.  Eautobahn is a leader in driverless vehicle technology. The company was born in 1992 as a developer of audio parts for KIA Motors, and throughout the years, the company has taken part in various projects, eventually focusing on autonomous vehicles. Since 2010, Eautobahn worked on driverless vehicles, and in recent years, the company has produced its own models.  If you look at Eautobahn’s partnerships, it is really impressive. Hyundai, Samsung, and Seoul National University are among their many partners. Also, they have conducted a lot of research in order to improve their technology and products. With a strong technological foundation and a mission to develop the safest autonomous vehicles, Eautobahn has participated in various projects that we will see below.  Eautobahn is in the business of modifying cars and making them autonomous. The pictures you see above are projects done by our partner. They install autonomous driving tech into existing vehicles to make them even better.  By collaborating with Eautobahn, CyClean combines blockchain with the most advanced driving technology.
