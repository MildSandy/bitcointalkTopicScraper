Collective here means that everyone can invest in the fund, not only the top 1% or rich institutions, which by the way are the major clients of big hedge funds. Our idea here is to let the average investor have the opportunity to profit with very little, or rather, controlled risk. If you want to know more please do not hesitate in contacting us directly at https://hcoinvestments.com/contact/. Thanks!",False
