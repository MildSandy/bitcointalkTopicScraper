About FemaleToken Let’s be honest – about 80% of all ICO are generated by man. They took themselves blockchains, cryptocurrencies and numerous tokens.  And what about women? How much of our culture is based on patriarchal assumptions?  We have equal rights in contemporary society! So we want our own cryptocurrency!  Join us! Together we can do everything!  Stop this oppression of women! Be independent!     TOKEN USAGE and FUNDS DISTRIBUTION During ICO and bonus distribution FEM tokens will be inactive: you can buy it from Contract Address Wallet but a transaction functions will be inactive.  After bonus distribution ends all functions will become active and total supply of existed tokens will become fixed. So even a creator of the contract (FemaleToken) could not add a new tokens to anyone. You could sell/buy FEM tokens at exchanges.  As a token holder you also could vote for a sponsored projects.  The main purpose of token sale is a support for our sisters in Feminist Ideas, Beliefs, Movements!  Stop street harassment, rape culture and male privilege.  After bonus token distribution our team will prepare a list of projects that support our ideas and are looking for a donations.  You can add your project to our list by sending its description at info@femaletoken.org.  All collected funds will be transferred to that sponsored projects.  Funds are released from escrow in batches only after the projects are chosen and a token holders vote for the projects.  Later (see roadmap) we are going to create an app with special voting functions.  Every token holder could add her project to the Feminist Foundation and if another token holders vote for this project — even get a sponsor support.  And at last our main dream to create a female cryptocurrency with unique algorithm and mining process. All dev fee (2% from total tokens) will be invested in development and programming. As a future bonus: all token holders will be rewarded with equal amount of new cryptocurrency.  After all we are a support fund. And we are here to support our ideas and beliefs, help our sisters.

Maybe it's being ignored because you're publicly offering a TIMES TWO bonus to females only...geez I wonder why no 'men' want to get involved?  If you think that Crypto is so saturated with penis then why are you advertising here, a Crypto enthusiast forum? This is quite literally the worst place you could have chosen to begin a gender revolution. Why don't you go share your vaporware token via a Snapchat story instead?  PS. Is proofreading also misogynistic? This post and your website is a violent assault on the Queen's English.  EDIT - Upon reading through this again, I've decided there is no way this is serious and it has to an ICO scam. Nice try, Pajeetina.",False
