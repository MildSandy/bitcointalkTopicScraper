Just they have some unexpected legal barriers in the wide realization of their product. But continues working hard under the product and it's an expansion on market.  3) In the past few months, all cryptomarket goes down. And the price of all coins and tokens too.  4) CIX100 is utility token (not security). And will be used for services in our platform. We have an MVP for a long time. Please see https://cryptoindex.ai It is a useful tool to see some predictions and optimize your portfolio (to reduce risks in investment and increase profits).

A RNN composed of LSTM units is called an LSTM network.  A common LSTM unit is composed of a cell, an input gate, an output gate and a forget gate. The cell is responsible for ""remembering"" values over arbitrary time intervals; hence the word ""memory"" in LSTM. Each of the three gates can be thought of as a ""conventional"" artificial neuron, as in a multi-layer (or feedforward) neural network: that is, they compute an activation of a weighted sum. Intuitively, they can be thought as regulators of the flow of values that goes through the connections of the LSTM; hence the denotation ""gate"".  The expression long short-term refers to the fact that LSTM is a model for the short-term memory which can last for a long period of time.",False
