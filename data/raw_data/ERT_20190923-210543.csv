Ethearnal is a peer-to-peer (P2P) system for the interaction of employers and freelancers. Labor relations between the employer and the attracted remote executors are built on the basis of a smart contract, through which the employer initially deposits the amount of payment for the work of the freelancer in Ethereum (ETH). The main criterion for assessing the level of qualification of freelancers within the Ethearnal platform is the ERT in-system token. The number of ERT on the participant's balance sheet directly affects the number and complexity of projects in which he can participate as an executor, employer or moderator.  The system commission is a 0 to 1% and depends on whether the transaction was disputable. If the terms of the contract are successfully executed by both parties, then there is no need for arbitration and there is no fee . To resolve disputed situations, the moderators are involved in the role of arbitrators. To participate in the dispute, the moderators transfer their ERT to the balance of the smart contract and choose the side that they think is right in this situation. The winning moderators get back the ERT they contributed and, as compensation, the ERT of the losing party, as well as the tokens of moderators who voted for this side. 1% of the ERT balance of the winners’ controversial smart contract is written off and distributed proportionally among all holders of the ERT token within the Ethearnal system.  A study by McKinsey & Company of the global market for remote work showed that in 2016 only in the US and Europe there were more than 160 million freelancers, for 50 million of them, remote work was the main source of income. More recent data for 2017 was published by Upwork, in which the number of freelancers in the US is 57.3 million people, that is 36% of the working population of the country. The chosen market niche for implementing the Ethearnal project is highly competitive, but in demand and has a great growth potential. At the moment, there is a large number of centralized services on the remote work market for the interaction of freelancers and employers. Also, with the development of blockchain technology, many decentralized projects are entering this market: Blocklancer, Coinlancer, Bitjob, Jury.online, Wordcoin, FreelancerCoin, Gems. Currently, ICO Blocklancer has already attracted 4 thousand ETH, and the completed Bitjob ICO - 8 thousand ETH. The price of the Bitjob token after the release on the exchange showed a steady growth of 120%, but then fell below the original price. It should be noted that the Ethearnal project can compete with Jury.online, which is not a direct competitor, but has functions for solving Ethearnal's tasks. A significant advantage of the Ethearnal project is the introduction of the ICO 2.0 concept, which enables investors to monitor the expenditure of borrowed funds by the project team.  The main advantages of the project over competitors are:  – low commission fee for participants of the system (0 to 1%);  – the funds raised during the crowdsale in ETH are blocked on a smart contract and transferred to the Ethernal project team 10% each after the positive voting of ERT holders (ICO 2.0);  – if investors’ expectations in evaluating the performance of the Ethernal team are not met, owners of ERT tokens are able to return the remainder of blocked ETH on a smart contract;  – the project team intends to collect profit from the project on general terms, as the holder of 20% of the total number of ERT.  There is MVP on project’s website, the source code of the project is published on GitHub. Safety audit of the smart contract was carried out by Authio and is available on the website. An indefinite bounty program to find bugs in the Ethearnal system is announced. One of the project's founders has an extensive experience in freelancing and has positive feedback. The disadvantages of the project are the absence of the test results for non-recognition of ERT as a security and the insufficient elaboration of the competition methods. The project is popular and widely covered in thematic media. The main factor for the success of the project, and, accordingly, the demand for ERT is the detailed ""aggressive"" marketing strategy for popularizing the project, taking into account the narrow segmentation of the market and targeting its audience.  More information about the strengths and weaknesses of the project can be found in our review. https://digrate.com/uploads/investment_overview/Ethearnal_ER_eng_mhRXCAH.pdf",False

Please note that in this case, the only “loss” of money compared to a case where participants don’t use our system is 0.5%. The freelancer gets 99% of the contract value in ether and 0.5% in ERT tokens, which he can sell if he prefers money over reputation. So, he is 0.5% short.

I am glad you appreciate our project. Quote from: hashtag on January 12, 2018, 10:32:17 AM Quote from: hashtag on January 05, 2018, 07:49:26 AM Quote from: TheNerd on December 29, 2017, 11:35:38 AM Quote from: FruitAvenger on December 28, 2017, 09:22:03 PM Loads fine for me. Tell us more about how the disputes work? Seems complicated.   Here is explanation from the whitepaper, probably can't explain it better:  Quote When the dispute is concluded: The winning side gets the contract value from escrow, his staked rep back, and the rep of the minority voted mods. The losing side loses only his staked rep if the freelancer and the staked rep AND the money in escrow if the employer. The majority vote mods get proportionally to their stakes the rep of the losing side. The minority vote mods lose their reputation at stake to the winning side.   and here is the detailed explanation  Quote So how does it all work? Freelancers can create listings presenting their services and push them on the network using a web client. On the backend, we use IPFS (interplanetary file system) to keep and distribute their listings on a peer-to-peer basis. No servers needed. They don’t have to keep their web client online; the offers just live in the cloud. (Note: In the beginning, we might need to run our own nodes to boost that, while the network gains enough traction to take care of it on its own.) Employers can search all of the listings from the same web client, or publish their own offers searchable by the freelancers. There might be a need for insignificant fees to publish a listing in order to prevent spamming the network. It will be negligible if using the system as intended, but it will add up to non-insignificant cost if spamming. If there is a need to implement that, all of the income will be distributed proportionally to the token holders. Once they find each other, they enter into a smart contract where: The employer has the contract value locked in smart contract-based escrow. Pre-agreed amount of reputation tokens are staked from each side. Each listing has a predefined amount of reputation tokens that needs to be staked in order to enter into smart contract-based agreement with. The listing creator sets that value. Both sides have to stake the same amount. The side taking the listing needs to accept that condition and stake the required amount of reputation tokens. Predefined timeframe upon which if none of the following outcomes have been met, it self-releases everything back. That is just a safeguard to prevent funds from being indefinitely locked.  Ethearnal Reputation Tokens (ERT) can be earned in two ways: •  Directly buying them on the free market. That way, anyone can start right away and avoid the egg and chicken problem of new freelancers who need reputation to get contracts, but need contracts to get reputation.  • Taking jobs on the network and being rewarded reputation tokens upon successful completion.  In both cases, the participants have invested valuable resources (e.g. time or money) to gain that reputation, so it is valuable to them, and thus, they have initiative to keep it. Even if they don’t appreciate their time, the reputation token has monetary value on the free market. The creator of the listing, being a gig or job offer, decides how much reputation stake to require for entering into a smart contract. So, he has the freedom to decide based on the overall contract value and his personal risk assessment. There are three possible outcomes of this smart contract: Both parties are happy. (They execute the contract on their own, no 3rd party intervention is needed. Both are awarded reputation tokens proportional to the contract value.) At least one part is unhappy. (A pool of moderators steps in and decides in favor of one of the sides based on simple majority vote.) Both are no longer willing to work together. (The contract thus self-closes after preset amount of time and returns everything in escrow and at stake.)  The tricky one is case two since only it needs involvement of a 3rd party decision. The other outcomes can be solved by the participants themselves.  OUTCOME 1: If both parties agree on the successful execution, 99% of the contract value in escrow goes to the freelancer. The remaining 1% is used to buy rep tokens on the free market (automatically by a smart contract) at market prices, and distribute them equally to the employer and freelancer. This gives 0.5% of the value of the contract to each side in ERT tokens.  This serves two purposes: Gives to each participant reputation proportional to the value of the project. Creates demand for the token. The demand for the token is necessary because this is fundamental for value, and token value is needed for this system to work. If there is no token value, the freelancer won't have anything valuable at stake, and will not have an initiative to act honestly. Please note that in this case, the only ""loss"" of money compared to a case where participants don't use our system is 0.5%. The freelancer gets 99% of the contract value in ether and 0.5% in ERT tokens, which he can sell if he prefers money over reputation. So, he is 0.5% short. That is his cost to use a system where he is protected and can be found by employers. The employer gets what is basically 0.5% cash back, but in ERT tokens. This is a slight incentive for them to use this system. Having more employers on the system is beneficial for the freelancers. This benefit might or might not outweigh the fee.         OUTCOME 2.             If one party is unhappy with the execution, he can open a dispute. This action automatically opens a queue for moderators for the case. Every moderator can stake at minimum 5% reputation tokens of the predefined stake value in the job listing, and no more than 33.4%. So, effectively the employer, freelancer, and pool of moderators all have the same total reputation at stake. (Note: All moderators collectively need to have the stake amount at stake). Once enough moderators have entered the pool, so that their collectively staked ERT tokens are equal to that of the other parties, the moderation process starts. In the beginning, we will be participating in moderation as well, to ensure there are no cases with insufficient moderators. Also, 5% of the tokens that we leave for ourselves will be used for initiatives where needed, including getting moderators. Moderator can be anyone who hold enough ERT tokens to cover the stake minimum. A stake minimum is necessary to prevent sybil attacks where someone creates lots of mods with just one ERT token each in order to dominate the moderator pool and decide in his favor. The listing creator decides how much reputation he wants at stake from the other side and the moderators pool. The minimum moderation stake is 5% from that, so the higher the stake value, the more expensive the sybil attack. The max stake of 33.4% is necessary to ensure we have at least three moderators in every case. That is needed to make the decision more objective and less likely to be manipulated. Each moderator has a vote weight of one, regardless of how many rep tokens he stakes. If the vote was weighted proportionally to their staked rep tokens, just 2 “whale” moderators could be enough to solve any dispute. However, what they earn from solving the dispute is proportional to their rep at stake. So, people with more rep can stake more, and naturally, can earn more since they have more at stake. This also incentivizes them to judge honestly. If they do, they gain more, and if they don’t, they lose more. On top of that, this is another initiative for people to hold tokens, since they can use them earn by moderating. When they decide the winning side in the dispute by simple majority (51%), the rep at stake of the losing side is distributed proportionally to the moderators based on their rep at stake. Only the moderators who voted with the majority (the winning decision) get rep tokens. The mods that voted with the minority lose their stake to the winning side of the dispute. The logic is that, since they tried to rule unfairly against him, but he turned out to be right, he deserves some rep. What is fair is decided by the vote of the majority. This is necessary to give moderators an incentive to act justly.  The mods who failed to vote within the determined timeframe lose their rep at stake. This will eliminate non-active mods automatically since they will be losing their rep at stake each time until there is none left and they can't be selected for mods anymore. In case the moderator votes are at odds, only then the system looks at the tokens behind the votes to decide the majority. We can’t simply force odd number of moderators, since some of them may fail to vote, and we still get an even number.   Any feedback is welcome, we are always looking for a way to make it better.   wow, this actually looks pretty darn good to me  What about this ICO 2.0 stuff? Anyone else doing this?   Please tell me more about this ICO 2.0 how does it work exactly?  0)Dynamic cap increasing each hour +1000$ to prevent whale bots and buyers. 1)The funds, will be distributed over time after we deliver milestones, and the token holders are voting with them. 2)You dont trust single team, you can refund anytime if its majority. 3) The token holders can vote, and leverage wisdom",False

We collide reputation and economic initiatives into one by tokenizing reputation and giving it value. Thus, all parties, moderators included, have strong and aligned initiatives to act honestly, since everyone has something of value at stake, as well as something to gain if the desired outcome is achieved.  Quote from: RaptorusKing on December 26, 2017, 09:22:56 PM When you decide a dispute successfully you can more than double your staked tokens, hence make money/rep by being moderator - sounds a bit like a ""justice for sale"", tbh. But i'll prefer to read the wp before judging hard myself. Thanks for the answer.  Not at all. There is economic initiative for the mods to judge honestly. What is honest is decided by the majority. And if you judge against the majority you get a penalty. So, moderator has to be careful in his decisions if wants to be successful. Rewards and punishments are build on the principles of game theory. Basically, everyone is better of if they don't lie.

The losing side loses only his staked rep if the freelancer and the staked rep AND the money in escrow if the employer. The majority vote mods get proportionally to their stakes the rep of the losing side. The minority vote mods lose their reputation at stake to the winning side.   and here is the detailed explanation  Quote So how does it all work? Freelancers can create listings presenting their services and push them on the network using a web client. On the backend, we use IPFS (interplanetary file system) to keep and distribute their listings on a peer-to-peer basis. No servers needed. They don’t have to keep their web client online; the offers just live in the cloud. (Note: In the beginning, we might need to run our own nodes to boost that, while the network gains enough traction to take care of it on its own.) Employers can search all of the listings from the same web client, or publish their own offers searchable by the freelancers. There might be a need for insignificant fees to publish a listing in order to prevent spamming the network. It will be negligible if using the system as intended, but it will add up to non-insignificant cost if spamming. If there is a need to implement that, all of the income will be distributed proportionally to the token holders. Once they find each other, they enter into a smart contract where: The employer has the contract value locked in smart contract-based escrow. Pre-agreed amount of reputation tokens are staked from each side. Each listing has a predefined amount of reputation tokens that needs to be staked in order to enter into smart contract-based agreement with. The listing creator sets that value. Both sides have to stake the same amount. The side taking the listing needs to accept that condition and stake the required amount of reputation tokens. Predefined timeframe upon which if none of the following outcomes have been met, it self-releases everything back. That is just a safeguard to prevent funds from being indefinitely locked.  Ethearnal Reputation Tokens (ERT) can be earned in two ways: •  Directly buying them on the free market. That way, anyone can start right away and avoid the egg and chicken problem of new freelancers who need reputation to get contracts, but need contracts to get reputation.  • Taking jobs on the network and being rewarded reputation tokens upon successful completion.  In both cases, the participants have invested valuable resources (e.g. time or money) to gain that reputation, so it is valuable to them, and thus, they have initiative to keep it. Even if they don’t appreciate their time, the reputation token has monetary value on the free market. The creator of the listing, being a gig or job offer, decides how much reputation stake to require for entering into a smart contract. So, he has the freedom to decide based on the overall contract value and his personal risk assessment. There are three possible outcomes of this smart contract: Both parties are happy. (They execute the contract on their own, no 3rd party intervention is needed. Both are awarded reputation tokens proportional to the contract value.) At least one part is unhappy. (A pool of moderators steps in and decides in favor of one of the sides based on simple majority vote.) Both are no longer willing to work together. (The contract thus self-closes after preset amount of time and returns everything in escrow and at stake.)  The tricky one is case two since only it needs involvement of a 3rd party decision. The other outcomes can be solved by the participants themselves.  OUTCOME 1: If both parties agree on the successful execution, 99% of the contract value in escrow goes to the freelancer. The remaining 1% is used to buy rep tokens on the free market (automatically by a smart contract) at market prices, and distribute them equally to the employer and freelancer. This gives 0.5% of the value of the contract to each side in ERT tokens.  This serves two purposes: Gives to each participant reputation proportional to the value of the project. Creates demand for the token. The demand for the token is necessary because this is fundamental for value, and token value is needed for this system to work. If there is no token value, the freelancer won't have anything valuable at stake, and will not have an initiative to act honestly. Please note that in this case, the only ""loss"" of money compared to a case where participants don't use our system is 0.5%. The freelancer gets 99% of the contract value in ether and 0.5% in ERT tokens, which he can sell if he prefers money over reputation. So, he is 0.5% short. That is his cost to use a system where he is protected and can be found by employers. The employer gets what is basically 0.5% cash back, but in ERT tokens. This is a slight incentive for them to use this system. Having more employers on the system is beneficial for the freelancers. This benefit might or might not outweigh the fee.         OUTCOME 2.             If one party is unhappy with the execution, he can open a dispute. This action automatically opens a queue for moderators for the case. Every moderator can stake at minimum 5% reputation tokens of the predefined stake value in the job listing, and no more than 33.4%. So, effectively the employer, freelancer, and pool of moderators all have the same total reputation at stake. (Note: All moderators collectively need to have the stake amount at stake). Once enough moderators have entered the pool, so that their collectively staked ERT tokens are equal to that of the other parties, the moderation process starts. In the beginning, we will be participating in moderation as well, to ensure there are no cases with insufficient moderators. Also, 5% of the tokens that we leave for ourselves will be used for initiatives where needed, including getting moderators. Moderator can be anyone who hold enough ERT tokens to cover the stake minimum. A stake minimum is necessary to prevent sybil attacks where someone creates lots of mods with just one ERT token each in order to dominate the moderator pool and decide in his favor. The listing creator decides how much reputation he wants at stake from the other side and the moderators pool. The minimum moderation stake is 5% from that, so the higher the stake value, the more expensive the sybil attack. The max stake of 33.4% is necessary to ensure we have at least three moderators in every case. That is needed to make the decision more objective and less likely to be manipulated. Each moderator has a vote weight of one, regardless of how many rep tokens he stakes. If the vote was weighted proportionally to their staked rep tokens, just 2 “whale” moderators could be enough to solve any dispute. However, what they earn from solving the dispute is proportional to their rep at stake. So, people with more rep can stake more, and naturally, can earn more since they have more at stake. This also incentivizes them to judge honestly. If they do, they gain more, and if they don’t, they lose more. On top of that, this is another initiative for people to hold tokens, since they can use them earn by moderating. When they decide the winning side in the dispute by simple majority (51%), the rep at stake of the losing side is distributed proportionally to the moderators based on their rep at stake. Only the moderators who voted with the majority (the winning decision) get rep tokens. The mods that voted with the minority lose their stake to the winning side of the dispute. The logic is that, since they tried to rule unfairly against him, but he turned out to be right, he deserves some rep. What is fair is decided by the vote of the majority. This is necessary to give moderators an incentive to act justly.  The mods who failed to vote within the determined timeframe lose their rep at stake. This will eliminate non-active mods automatically since they will be losing their rep at stake each time until there is none left and they can't be selected for mods anymore. In case the moderator votes are at odds, only then the system looks at the tokens behind the votes to decide the majority. We can’t simply force odd number of moderators, since some of them may fail to vote, and we still get an even number.   Any feedback is welcome, we are always looking for a way to make it better.",False

You can buy reputation or earn it by completing jobs. It's a token  Idea being is that right now when someone starts fresh on a freelance platform he has no reputation and it's hard to find jobs. If you can't find jobs, you won't earn reputation. It's closed cycle that you have to break either with patience or by working way under paid.  With us, the choice is yours. You can jump start your career by buying some reputation.  Of course if it wasn't for the following, people would take advantage of that immediately to scam others. We have implemented game theory based system, where each participant stakes some of his reputation to participate in a contract. You lose your stake if you behave maliciously.

We appreciate it!  There is plenty of competition but it's $1.5 trillion market. We have no illusions that just one decentralized solution will rule them all. There is plenty of road for the centralised ones as well, we are in no doubt that there will be a lot of time before all people switch to decentralized solutions. Hence we have heavy marketing roadmap and we do the ICO, so we have enough funding to ensure traction for the project after it's done.  We realize that even if the technical execution is hard enough, it is only fraction of the end game. Even the best tech is dead in the water if nobody knows about it.",False

Well, i haven't finished reading the whitepaper yet, but it seems like they bult self-sufficient, self-regulating system or something like that. It's kinda like a protocol. What really impressed me is how clever the dispute system is. I mean like conception it seems close to genius. Now implementing is whole different ball game though and unfortunately I lack the knowledge to judge if it could be implemented or not. If they show before the ICO that they can do it, i might invest an ether or two  Actually I'm not sure if I completely understand how exactly it works, might have to read that part again.

Only 10% of the collected funds are released to us upon completion of the ICO. The rest money and the founders tokens remain locked in the smart contract. Once we run out of the initial 10%, we initiate a smart contract based voting process. We inform the community what we have done so far and for what we need the next 10% funding increment.  Every token holder can vote proportionally to his tokens if we should get another round of funding or not. If 51% vote no, we don’t get any money and continue working until the investors are satisfied enough to vote yes next time we initiate a voting process.  Every token holder can start a refund process!  At any time, anyone holding at least 1 ERT token can initiate a refund voting process. If 65% of the tokens vote for refund, the project is terminated and all remaining funds refunded proportionally. So, at any time, we are in possession of only 10% of the funding and if we stop delivering on our promises you can get back the rest of your investment.  Dynamic hourly ICO cap.  Dynamic investment cap that increases every hour! $1000 worth of ether cap the first hour and then increased with $1000 every next hour. ($2000 cap per unique sender the 2nd hour, $3000 the 3rd hour and so on) This makes it inefficient to have huge gas fee to make your transaction go first and out place the smaller investors. You have new chance to participate every hour! That way a whale will have to compete with thousands of regular investors every hour. Leveling the playing field as much as possible (not bulletproof though) without invasive and bureaucratic onboarding process.  @TimeTeller About the other competitors, I dont really mind we have seen anyone else trying to do exactly what we do. bitjob.io is more about education and other current freelancing platforms attempts on the blockchain aren't really free. + We are the first Token to give you dividents and profit share from all the transactions through Ethearnal! +You can use your ERT tokens to ensure you will get hired and have ton of work withourt marketing + You can't be banned, unless burn all your ERT balance by not giving quality work. On platforms like Fiverr and Upwork, you can be banner for so many reasons. I know a lot of people with banned accounts for communication outside the system or abusing system review, etc. On Ethearnal its all solved and backed up by the token economy.   No limits, just business! There is no middle man, its the blockchain community that takes all the decisions.
