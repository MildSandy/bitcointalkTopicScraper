However, Tettix takes Metamask as wallet, which means you can keep your wallet’s private key and no need to worry about its usability.  Our Vision Tettix is creating a REAL decentralized exchange. Our goal is to remove redundant constraints on digital currency transaction. In the short-term, we aim for providing a reliable and convenient ethereum-based trading system. In the long-term, we hope that Tettix can replace all existing centralized exchanges and give everyone a whole new trading experience.  About TIX token For now, TIX is Tettix's internal token.
