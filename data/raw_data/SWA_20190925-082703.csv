Paulius Kaminskas: Kaminskas is a senior software engineer at NFQ, a software development company located in Kaunas, Lithuania.  Advisors Andrew Barros: Barros was a senior adviser at Perpetual Limited, a financial services company. Alain Heureux: Heureux has worked at CPM UK, a sales agency, for three years.  Partners Bancor Network: Bancor is a decentralized liquidity network.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Swace.  Risks The existence of so many similar projects creates competition. (-1.5) High bonuses offered to private pre-sale contributors. (-2.5)  Growth Potential At least 17 international companies have signed contracts with Swace, implying high corporate interest in the project. (+2.5) Rewarding users for their engagement with brands is a good and trending idea to increase brand awareness. (+2) According to the roadmap, Google Play and App Store applications will be released before ICO. (+1.5)  Disposition Standard digital advertising methods seem to fail to reach to brands’ target audiences. Rewarding users with tokens to increase brand awareness and user engagement has become a trending approach to solve these problems with digital advertising. Swace is a social gaming platform which rewards its users not only for digitally engaging with brands but also for completing daily quests and becoming an influencer. Many international companies have shown interest in the project, which is definitely a good sign. Yet the ICO investor should note that earlier stage investors have been offered high bonuses up to 60%. Swace receives a 2/10.
