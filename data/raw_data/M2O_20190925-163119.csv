Mileages to opportunities!🚀,"PRESS RELEASE Travel easy: Blockchain startup M2O won’t let your miles burn   What is the most popular way of traveling? Obviously, by air. Just imagine that over 5,000 air companies flew 4.1 billion passengers in 2017. What’s more, this year the world hit another record, 200,000 aircrafts took off in a single day.  However, the ‘air travel’ boom has another side of the coin: the more passengers, the severer the competition becomes. So, air companies continuously develop their loyalty programs fighting for clients.  After every flight, passengers get points or miles, which can then be redeemed for some benefits. Moreover, air carriers try to collaborate with a wide range of travel-related companies to offer customers more privileges and bonuses. Still a significant number of passengers don’t use them.  M2O won't let your miles be wasted, check out the article on AMBCrypto, and give your bonus miles a second chance!",False

In fact, 43 percent of shoppers say rewards expire before they can be redeemed. What’s more, you can’t sell or exchange your points. As a result, clients miss the chance of saving money, meanwhile companies throw their resources away without achieving customer loyalty.  Korean company called M2O is set to solve these issues by relying on the blockchain technology and tokenizing points. For this, the project has created its own cryptocurrency called M2O coin. By substituting air miles, membership bonuses and all other rewards for the tokens, customers will be able to trade or exchange them for any product or service they want – both of this brand or any other.",False

The Oracle BCS platform runs on the business private ledger known as Hyperledger Fabric, an open-source project governed by Linux foundation, which makes it accessible from cloud and on-prem applications via REST APIs and Hyperledger SDKs. This means it will allow for automatic communication of business processes. Some examples are updating a user’s points and even helping with immediate conversions to M2O coins.

Mileages to opportunities!🚀,"Blockchain Startup M2O To Tokenize Loyalty Programs  Loyalty programs are often known for lost points by ill-informed customers and financial liability due to unclaimed rewards for businesses. This is set to change as Korean blockchain venture M2O ushers in a new paradigm that will integrate all loyalty programs under a single umbrella. To bring this vision to fruition, M2O is launching its crowdsale to raise funds.  M2O is seeking to create an ecosystem that will unite existing bonus programs from different companies and build a global membership services platform on the blockchain. This way, customers can merge all their reward points from various loyalty schemes into a single wallet. What’s more, the project has started a technical cooperation with global IT services leader Oracle to ensure high security and transparency of services.

Mileages to opportunities!🚀,"Mileage Points of the 21 Century: Spend, Sell, Exchange with M2O  Check your wallet or a card case and you will find at least ten loyalty, discount or membership cards that you have never used. But imagine that you have all points and bonuses in one place and you are able to exchange them for different products, services or even money. Sounds exciting, isn’t it? In the near future, it can become a reality as the emerging technologies come in.  Current air miles and bonuses have an expiration date, so you basically collect them and then lose. In fact, 43% of shoppers say rewards expire before they can be redeemed. What’s more, you can’t sell or exchange your points. As a result, clients miss the chance of saving money, meanwhile, companies throw their resources away without achieving customer loyalty.  Korean company called M2O is set to solve these issues by relying on the blockchain technology and tokenizing points. For this, the project has created its own cryptocurrency called M2O coin. By substituting air miles, membership bonuses and all other rewards for the tokens, customers will be able to trade or exchange them for any product or service they want – both of this brand or any other.
