Thanks for your question.  No it wont. Actually the project your refer to looks kind of scammy but let me explain what we are doing. Yes in fact. We are already an eSports ecosystem. We have more than 75 partners out of the eSports scene & online shops collaborating with eByte and the eByte is already used as price money in tournaments. You can see all partners here: https://www.ebyte.sale/en/  But we are more than that. Our vision is to become the number one blockchain for the gaming industry. There will be smart contracts which will allow players to sign for a team in a digital way and therefore receive an automatic compensation once they win an event or tournament. Moreover our blockchain will be build to allow people to realize eSports projects on the eByte Blockchain (maybe even with an own token) like Dapps...  The core ideas of eByte are explained here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=445W2I0aFy0  We are working on our project since the end of 2016 and are based in germany with a foundation that manages funds.  Just a quick overview. If you have more questions, feel free to ask!  Tim",False

With the eByte that is sold during the ICO is an ERC20 token you will be able to store it in a cold wallet like the Ledger Nano etc. The eByte cryptocoin, distributed with the blockchain release to the ERC20 eByte holder during the token swap, will be a coin on its own blockchain.  It will have a desktop wallet that you can install on an computer not connected to the internet and save your coins there for a cold wallet. On the other hand the support for alternatives like ledger wallets need to be negotiated with ledger, buts its definitely on our todo list once the blockchain is live.

As part of our token generation event, certain amounts of pre-mined coins can be purchased in advance as ERC20 eByte tokens.  The eByte Token used for the sale can already be used for payments and for price money in eSports tournaments. The eByte Cryptocoin instead will then run on our eByte Blockchain. Its used to create and execute smart contracts on this platform and to fuel the network. Also on this Blockchain one is able to create own token projects like on the Ethereum Blockchain.

The eByte whitepaper and executive summary offer valuable insights into the project.  Here is a short abstract out of the Whitepaper:  ____________________     eSports is a big business–ßand getting bigger. What started as a hobby or casual pastime for many people–ß  competing against other players in online video games–ßhas quickly evolved into a global business that generates  hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Yet, despite the rapid growth in eSports revenue, only a few recognized  professional players are well-compensated. Most players receive little or nothing in return for their skill and commitment.  At the same time, eSports teams often lack the resources to equip players with the latest technology.  And without guaranteed compensation, talented players frequently switch teams in search of better opportunities,  making it difficult for teams to manage their rosters and attract investors and sponsors. Similarly, leagues and event  and tournament organizers have no financial resources ‚Ä†to promote their activities or support the growth of their projects.  Therefore, people such as moderators, administrators, and service providers receive no compensation for their work.     The eByte project is developing a consortium blockchain, in cooperation with Draglet,  to establish the first international monetary system specifically designed for the eSports community...         PROJECT WHITEPAPER   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY               Despite the amazing market potential and growth, eSports currently lacks in possibilities that are fundamental for its future development.  Our vision with eByte is to contribute to the maturation of eSports by solving the following challenges:                                    Through simple mining, users contribute to the security of the network and the decentralized  creation of new eBytes, which enables them to generate revenue for their leagues, their teams or  themselves. With the new eSports blockchain, there will be a place where other eSports-targeted  crypto projects can be developed. With the project progressing there will be a technical Whitepaper  for detailed information about the technical specifications of the eByte project accessible for everyone.     Technical Specs of the eByte cryptocoin (not the ERC20 token for the ICO):     Coin: Proof of Authority  Block Time: 5 Seconds  Block Reward: 0.35 eBytes  POA block halving: none  Coins generated per day: 6048  Hash Algorithm: Ethash  Max Amount: 47,000,000  Amount Pre-Mined: 4,700,000 (10%)  Pre-Mine: Genesis Block  ETH Fork Version: Homestead     (more information can be found in the whitepaper and an additional technical whitepaper)                             The Roadmap displays the scheduled milestones for the eByte project since 2016.                            ____________________       JOIN THE MOST POWERFUL DECENTRALIZED ESPORTS GAME CHANGER  PARTICIPATE IN THE WORLDTS FIRST BLOCKCHAIN-BASED ESPORTS COMMUNITY PROMOTION SYSTEM        ",False

With the Blockchain and the upcoming eByte cryptocoin we will establish a widely usable compensation system for the eSports community.  A small example with one of our target audiences (Players):  Players will finally receive compensation for their time spent. Many hours of the week flow into planning, training and implementation. A lot of investment flows into eSports. They are giving their full commitment for this hobby. But only the top players and with that the tip of the eSport-iceberg receive any kind of reward for it. With the eByte ecosystem players can benefit from their enthusiasm and also enhance their gaming equipment through mining, mini-cash games, betting portals and eByte trading. So even when the most players arent compensated for their time right now, with the eByte there will be a simple and secure way of generating income via several ways (described in the whitepaper).  Another example is for the target audience ""eSports leagues"":  Currently there is a high administrative and financial effort when operating a league. The leagues usually have a lot of work to do and often also insufficient sources of revenue. Through the eByte now the very simple possibility to increase the attractiveness of a legaue exists by introducing price money. Start fees, license seats or shares of a leagues content can be established. By e.g. mining or donating additional sources of revenue for the free and sustainable growth of the leagues are created. Moreover the eByte Blockchain and Smart Contracts ensure safe transactions and trust, as well as transparent metrics that allow leagues to become more interesting to sponsors.   So both of those target groups benefit from the ecosystem AND they are obviously connected with each other. Besides them there are many other target audiences that will join our ecosystem like service providers (graphic designers), online-shops (gamers will be able to buy hardware etc. with eBytes) or people donating streamers (using eByte for it).  With all those audiences involved the whole eByte ecosystem will be possible, since we already have many partners out of the audiences I talked about, that will participate in the project (see our website). Additionally there will be dynamic smart contracts for automated compensation & player contracts as well as several in-house platforms that will give the eByte more possibilities of use -> Whitepaper  I hope this answer clarifies the idea of the eByte system.
