We are also only minting tokens that are purchased, so there is not a set supply where 'unsold' tokens are then burnt. So if x tokens are sold across both the pre-sale and the main sale, then we will mint x+(3x/7) tokens. This is because 30% of the tokens will be held back as per Section 8.2 of the whitepaper. No tokens will be burned at that stage.",False
