If BTC crashed after the ICO, the token would have skyrocketed in value in BTC and he'd likely have been at risk of collapse if he paid out all the BKB holders over time.

On the other hand, the way it was done, there was literally no reason for anyone to invest in the IPO.  The money you put in was converted to FIAT and then held for you in FIAT where you can only redeem at it at 10% per quarter.   You get the benefit of casino profit, but you could get that by simply buying BKB after the fact. Since exchanges will always have it at a discount, buying BKB in the exchange would always be done at a better price than buying through the IPO, under any circumstance.  In fact, lots of people investing in the IPO actually *lowers* the return-on-investment because a larger portion of the value of BKB is the original $0.092 that can has a rate of return of 0%.   If only 10% as many people would have invested, BKB would have started at $0.0096, but had the same absolute increase in value from casino profits, meaning 10x the percentage return.   I think it either *should* have been set up the way you describe (invested in the full bankroll) or there was no real reason for anyone to invest in the ICO. If you wanted, say, $1000 ownership in the casino, you'd have been better off buying it in an exchange at a discounted price.",True

Written on OP: ""The buy back price offered by BetKing will be based on the current total bankroll profit.So for example if the price of the token at the end of the crowdsale was $0.014 and the bankroll profit was $1,000,000 then the buy back price would be $0.024 (1,000,000/100,000,000 + 0.014).""

I have started paying out bounty rewards as some of you know. This is a slow process and I have to do everything manually.  Although it has already been a long time please understand that it will probably take another week to pay everyone.  Here are instructions for each campaign for you to claim bounty  Signature: I have paid out most people for this. There are sill people who haven't claimed yet. If you were part of the signature campaign you need to  1) pm my forum account with your BetKing username AND 2) pm me on the BetKing chat with your Bitcointalk username. I will then tip you BKB.  Translations: All but two people have been paid. To claim reward 1) pm my forum account with your BetKing username AND 2) pm me on the BetKing chat with your Bitcointalk username. I will then tip you BKB.  Twitter bounties: Most of the linked Twitter accounts were either bots or people multiaccounting. I checked all your Twitter posts, followers, following etc, score. I also checked everyones IP addresses, browser fingerprint and if on VPN/TOR etc.  There were over a thousand bot or multiaccounts that were banned.  If you were eligible you would have received an email to the address you sigend up with on the old bounty site.  There are still over 170 accounts that need to claim. I've paid many more. To claim 1) Create a new account on https://betking.io (your bounty.betking.io account will NOT work) 2) pm me on the BetKing chat I will then tip you BKB if your email address matches the one I sent to.  Bug bounties: From around April until September there were a lot of people that reported bugs. I will be going through all chats and will be in touch this week and next with details on how to claim. If you reported a bug please pm me or email admin@betking.io with details to speed up the process.  Blog/article/videos: People who posted blogs or articles will be contacted this week or next with details on how to claim. If you just copied and pasted the text from translation threads and pasted on a blog that no one visits then you will not get reward.  Facebook: Facebook was cancelled in the first week and there are no rewards for Facebook.  Payments: Understand that I stated many times that the campaign was cancelled early, 5 weeks early, and that the total reward would NOT be 1% of BKB tokens. I have paid each campaign an amount I think is fair. If you think your reward was low, please remember that there were thousands of accounts to split the tokens between.  Finally, sorry for the very long delay. There was a lot of work to be done to get the site launched in time and also to distribute tokens to buyers and allow withdraw to wallets/exchange.  I will try to make sure everyone who participated in the bounties is paid within a week. Again, this is a manual process.  In the mean time feel free to come and try the new site for free by claiming our Bitcoin faucet https://betking.io If you have any suggestions to improve the site let me know and if you find any bugs let me know. There will be rewards for new reports.  Thanks  Dean",True

Bitcointalk does not send me notifications.  As others said the main thread is in the gambling section and I'm mostly on BetKing.io's own site chat and also Discord or Telegram, all links can be found on https://betking.io.  Regarding bounties I explained many many times that bounties would be lowest priority due to the fact that the bounty program ended after two weeks of seeing no results. Not to the fault of the legit participants but just the almost all the funds raised came from my own network of past investors and poker players. All $ spent on marketing during ICO was in fact a waste but it's done now.  Bounties will be paid this week though for the people who took part in signature campaign, translations, bug bounties and qualified articles and non multi accounting Twitter users. These all need audited.  Top priority was the launch and adding things for players and actually distributing tokens for the people who bought them.  For people who might still read this thread not just to see when bounties are paid, here's a guide for how to trade your BetKing Bankroll tokens using the site chat  https://betking.io/how-to-trade-betking-bankroll-tokens/  Withdrawals to own wallets will also be done this week.  If you need questions answered go to the main thread or discord or site chat not here, I'll not see it.  Thanks.  P.S. for people with account problems, accounts created on the old bounty.betking.io site were not imported to the betking.io site because 95% of them were fake twitter spam accounts, you will need to create a new one.",True

There is no team page because all my team are contractors and some prefer to remain anon. Listing some developer names or profile pics would not add any credibility to this project.  All the trust comes from me and the fact that I ran BetKing for 3.5 years without any issues and returned 6000 Bitcoin to investors when I closed instead of doing an exit scam or running with the funds.

The initial plan of allocating 1% of all tokens will not happen as the program is ending 5 weeks early.  However I will still keep the bug bounty program open and split 0.5% of tokens to the reporters in there.  The two most costly campaigns, in terms of management time, were the Bitcointalk signature campaign and the Twitter posting campaigns. They also brought the least amount of traffic of any other marketing being done.  Also the recent forced rule changes on the forums and closure of threads made the whole thing even less effective as the ANN thread is never able to be on the front page. Even though every other ICO has allowed this.  I will be sticking to the paid advertising on larger media sites instead.  The bounty website will be taken offline and the bounty thread closed later today.  I will update the OP and main site with these details now.  Thanks to everyone who supported the ICO so far.

About BetKing  BetKing opened in April 2013 and by the end of 2014 quickly became the most popular crowdfunded Bitcoin casino.  From 2015 BetKing had the most wagered volume of all crowdfunded gambling sites, 400,000 Bitcoin, almost more than all competitors combined!  With a 6000 Bitcoin crowdfunded bankroll BetKing was the most trusted dice site with the highest betting limits. All 6000 Bitcoin were returned to investors when we closed in December 2016.  What's new?    The new platform will offer new updated provably fair casino games such as Blackjack and Roulette as well as all your favorites.  We will support multiple cryptocurrencies including Ethereum and Litecoin betting.  We will also allow casino websites and app owners to integrate with our platform. We'll take care of user accounts and betting and let casinos develop their own unique games and promos while not having to worry about bankroll funds or security issues.  Soon after launch we will add sports betting, more casino games, poker games and tournaments and native mobile apps.  We also have some unique new games and social features that will be announced next month that players will be able to try on the beta site.  Why join the ICO?  BetKing made a profit of almost 7400 Bitcoin in a little over two years!  This was with one simple game and minimal marketing.  We will be launching and marketing brand new exciting games and services.  We have a list of 3rd party partners already interested in integrating with our new platform.    BetKing Bankroll Token Crowdsale  Distribution  100,000,000 BetKing Bankroll Tokens will be created as Ethereum ERC23 tokens and issued after the crowdsale ends.  70 million will be available for sale to crowdsale participants.  30 million will be retained by BetKing for ICO bounties, testing bounties, advisors, hiring, future marketing and development.  BetKing Bankroll Tokens can be purchased with Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. All funds will be held in cold storage.  Use of funds raised  After the crowdsale at least 50% of the funds raised will be used for the house bankroll that players bet against and winnings are paid from.The remaining funds will be used for marketing, promos, seo, design, development, server costs and legal.  Profit Distribution  A percentage of the profit made from bankrolled games will be used to buy back BetKing Bankroll tokens from holders.All profit made on bankrolled games will be audited and made available to token holders as was done in the past with the crowdfunded bankroll profits.  Bankrolled games are games where a player plays against the house such as dice, blackjack and other casino games as well as 3rd party partner casino games.Player vs. player games such as poker are not.  Early Discounts 1st week 15% 2nd week 10% 3rd week 5% 4th week no discount An extra 5% discount will be available for previous BetKing bankroll providers regardless of what week they buy.  Pre-sale  You can purchase tokens with a 25% discount in our pre-sale up until the 17th of July 12am UTC.  The pre-sale has a cap of 1000 Bitcoin. Email admin@betking.io if you would like to participate.  Pre-sale participants are not eligible for the 5% extra discount for being a previous BetKing bankroll provider.  Token Price  The total funds raised will determine the price per BetKing Bankroll token.We will take the total value of all funds at the current exchange rate at the end of the crowdsale to determine the total raised funds.E.g. If we raised $1,000,000 then the price per token would be $0.014 (1,000,000 / 70,000,000).  The buy back price offered by BetKing will be based on the current total bankroll profit.So for example if the price of the token at the end of the crowdsale was $0.014 and the bankroll profit was $1,000,000 then the buy back price would be $0.024 (1,000,000/100,000,000 + 0.014).  Every quarter BetKing will offer to buy back up to 10% of a holders tokens at the current buy back price.  Token holders may choose to sell offsite to 3rd parties or on any exchanges that may list BetKing Bankroll Tokens if they require more liquidity.
