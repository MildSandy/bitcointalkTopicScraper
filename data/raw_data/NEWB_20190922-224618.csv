We were notified today by Google that our app has been suspended from the playstore.  Our app was a progressive web app (PWA) modified so that it could be listed in the playstore.  It seems that Google was not happy with our modifications and removed the app.  I want to make it very clear PWA's are not suppose to live in the playstore but are to be installed directly from our site by Google.  The play store offered an additional distribution channel which in respect to PWA's was a step backward.    By installing the app directly from our site Google removes the need for users to search and find our app in the play store.  Now when a user visits https://chat.newbium.com using an Android phone he will be prompted to install our app.  The installation is done by Google and the app appears on the users phone as any app would if installed from the play store.  So although we would have preferred to be in the play store it does not change our situation very much.  Because we have build Newb chat as a progressive web app (PWA) we gain the advantage of a native app from the app stores without the need to actually be listed there.

Far from being a negative this event opens up a great opportunity for us to simplify the NEWB market.    Since the beginning NEWB tokens have existed on two separate blockchains. 51% of tokens on NXT Blockchain and 49% of tokens on Ethereum blockchain.  This situation was complicated and caused confusion for the community.  To fix this problem we plan to migrate both the 51% of NEWB on NXT and 49% of NEWB on ETH into a single Ethereum token with 100% of coins or 100 million tokens.    This move will bring major benefits for our community:  1. One Wallet (Ethereum). 2. NEWB market becomes united. 3. Marketing becomes easier. 4. NEWB token integration into Newbium platform becomes easier.   Timeframe: 4 months  We plan to complete the migration before September 30th, 2018.  The majority of the time will be taken up with R&D specifically contract code but also deep study of new ERC standards for example ERC777.    NEWB_NXT to NEWB_ETH Swap  If you have NEWB token on NXT blockchain or on C-Cex exchange then you will need to swap your tokens for NEWB tokens on Ethereum blockchain.

Indeed, most companies may have an opportunity to leverage ICOs to raise funds via advance sales without giving up equity—if they structure their ICO correctly.  This article explains how to do this, with a case study on an “Initial MemberCoin Offering” Blockchain Business Consultants are now working.  Kickstarter and sites like this allow people to buy products and services in advance to support a business launch or expansion legally.  But they are full of restrictions on the type of projects they will support, are for relatively small amounts of funding, and of course charge fees.  A business that can do an advance sale of a product, services or membership and wants to raise millions of dollars may be better off using an ICO with a tradable cryptocurrency token.  For big projects where current and future customers may be eager to help you finance the expansion (with a discounted price offer) but want the flexibility to bail out of buying in down the road (i.e. they need to be able to readily sale their utility token right to buy your service) this is a potentially huge, revolutionary application of blockchain and cryptocurrency.  due to size limit can't post all article, go to bchainconsult.com blog page to read the full article",False

If you have suggestions to make this better (but not longer), please let me know.  How to Explain Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, and ICOs in one short paragraph Elevator Pitch   A blockchain is a secure distributed ledger or database where past “blocks” of entries are “locked in” so securely that you cannot alter them.  It is not run by a company or any trusted party—but a computer network.  A network of computers reach a consensus on the current block of transactions and once a majority agree, the new block of transactions is locked onto the blockchain database.  It’s a virtually unhackable, highly secure distributed ledger that can replace intermediaries like banks, or any company and authority now relied on as “trusted party” or controller of an information system.  With “Smart contracts” in the blockchain system, executed by the computer network when agreed upon conditions are met, you can conduct transactions without lawyers and middlemen.  Blockchain is used for virtually unhackable digital currency to pay for online transactions (cryptocurrency—like Bitcoin, Ether, others) and for a new means of raising funds:  an “Initial Coin Offering” where you produce a “token” you can trade on a blockchain that, combined with Smart Contracts, provides rights to buyers to use services or buy products.",False

Users will require NEWB if they wish to make announcements that send mass notifications to all Newbium chat users (site-wide notifications).    Normally on Slack you can use the @channel to notify those on your team which maybe a handful of users or a large group.  In any case this is still much smaller than the total population of slack users.  Now imagine if you could target all users across every slack team with a general announcement that would greatly increase your reach and would be very valuable.  Unfortunate it would also generate much more notifications than there are even now with slack for example.  To control site-wide notification spam users will need to pay to use the function, they will have to pay in NEWB.  The amount of NEWB to use this function will not be as high per say but since many coins need to make important announcements then we foresee strong NEWB demand because of this simple use case.    There are technically no limit to how many site-wide (mass) notifications can be sent but ad space is always limited due to real estate constraint on the site.  ",False

Yes, I think so. The research on prediction markets shows an interesting effect: While opinion polls need huge statistics of many many participants for good answers (because opinions are cheap), the situation is changing drastically (to the better) if people invest their own money on the outcome of difficult-to-answer questions.  Then the group answer converges much quicker to the real empirical future value, with much less people needed to already ""know"" the right answer collectively.  Our brains function better when the question is connected to our own resources.  So please everyone: Invest some thinking what will be the next peak of the BTC price, and pay a mere 71 dollarcents in NEWB, to be eligible to win the jackpot.  Just imagine the collective advantage for us all, if we get a good prediction of this important question. For that, let us cooperate.

The best projects don't always make the coins great or profitable, especially when the coin isn't involved in day to day activities. I know this. Look at NXT, XCP vs ETH and Lisk.     Nxt and XCP have way more current capabilities and use than ETH and Lisk but the market value swings towards the latter. DGB is kind of in the middle. What this coin needs is some hype and a MarketMaker, to provide liquidity and make sure we don't get delisted from exchanges.

Actually, investors have put BTC in the project because they believe in it. However, this post bounty ""distributes"" those BTC to NEWBIUM platform users. Then, investors may think those posting users take the current bounty for a cash machine, and that the project has no more interest and will die.  However, NEWBIUM is a long term investment, people who went in early know it, and are holding. Only few people sell, or because they think the bounty is killing the project, or because they changed their mind about how to make profits (or many other possible reasons).  Even if some users may take NEWBIUM as a cash machine, this doesn't matter too much considering they only are a few, that non original content aren't rewarded, that the higher quality the higher the reward, and that those users are needed (to make the platform known) and will forever exist. This bounty gives datas to NEWBIUM's team to adapt the reputation and reward future system. This also is, if we think in a short term vision, a bad thing, because the team is ""loosing money"". If you however think long term, you should see this post bounty as an investment, this is a pretty good thing because reward and reputation system will have strong bases, strong enough to last long.  By the way, something to remember is that what will make NEWBIUM successful and profitable on the long term, is NEWBIUM brain. But for this brain to work, there are several steps to cross that can make fluctuate the price. This is where we will see who will panic sell, even maybe at loss. People thinking long term, and believing in the project will be then free to increase their NEWB bags at low price.  Finally, everybody should remember than NEWB_ETH have been distributed, but there is no exchange yet. I guess that NEWBIUM team will do its best to have a good exchange (bittrex currently being targetted), and then to put light spots on those tokens, and necessarly on the project.",False

Check this out: https://coins.newbium.com/  Then, you'd ask ""why would people share that kind of informations or their analysis""?  Well, they would do this because they would be rewarded for this; see what landomata posted on the forum much earlier:  Quote from: landomata on May 11, 2016, 06:59:48 PM  A large portion of the market data & visualizations on Newbium will be free, but we shall also have premium services for paying customers.

We can climb much higher then steemit.

Roadmap : http://www.newbium.com/newbiumwhitepaper.pdf (It really deserves a look).  To be short, Newbium aims to:  Newbium ( http://www.newbium.com/ )is a platforme providing in real time and historical datas about crypto market.  It will also give the possibility to buy and sell coins.  NEWBIUMs are coins which will give revenues as (non-exhaustive list): 1) Paid subscriptions for specialized data/services. 2) Sales of Index products (NxttyACCI). 3) Providing data feeds for third-party plugins (Wordpress), widgets, etc. 4) Providing human generated data feeds to robotic traders, DAO, etc. 5) Access to historical data in Newbium database.  Newbium will propose some kind of ""chat"" ( http://www.newbium.com/social/ ). The idea there is to offer the possibility to Newbium's users to share their analysis, and to somehow be paid for, by others users. Considering the tiny part of human using or just aware about crypto, it lets predict that millions (not to say billions) might use Newbium. Furthermore, if you consider that Finance world (traders, hedge funds...) will slowly have to move into crypto world... Well, those analysis shared by Newbium users will find their public pretty easily.  You can of course use NEWBIUMs as pure speculative investment, even if i guess long hold is definitely the best.  Finally, Newbium is based on a dual blockchain, NXT and ETH. NEWB-NXT tokens have been sent and already are on c-cex ( https://c-cex.com/?p=newb-btc ). NEWB-ETH tokens currently are being distributed by the team.   My personnal opinion on Newbium is that it's very promising, the project in itself looks sensed and will offer something new and interesting to crypto-world. The team is actually doing good job, and is present to answer questions (here on the forum and on slack). I invested in both blockchains, and i'm already in profits with NEWB-NXT tokens and sure it will the same with NEWB-ETH tokens.   By the way, if anybody sell NEWB-NXT tokens, contact me i'm much interested in",False

So with real time crypto market information + crypto related user generated content, we are already seeing something very unique taking shape.  The rewards system is still being fleshed out but it will definitely reward those who provide content.  We have not decided if voting will be used but sharing is one action which is already confirmed.  So users will be rewarded for sharing content to social media even if they are not the original posters of the content.  The reputation system will also be integrated into the rewards system....we intend to build a meritocracy so that only those who provide the best content (analysis, news, information, etc) will have the best ranking.  Although we can see various monetization options our focus at this point is to get the content generation cycle started.  The more high quality content we generate on the platform the more our organic reach increases and the more users we will attract. The more users we have the more we can monetize....revenue streams we have already highlighted are subscriptions and commissions from shapeshift trading.     ",False

New functions implemented  v0.7.4   The top20 can now be sliced to show only the top:  Top 1  (click for larger)  The past 24 hours of Bitcoin price changes, in one simple image. http://www.newbium.com/beta/top/1/   Top 2  (click for larger)  Bitcoin (BTC) versus Ethereum (ETH) Some people say, they are often moving antiparallel - now you can check that hypothesis visually. http://www.newbium.com/beta/top/2/   Top 10  (click for larger)  The top10 (currently BTC ETH LTC XRP DAO DASH LSK MAID DOGE DGD XEM STEEM) Together they make up 97.42% of the total crypto marketcap. (So the remaining 562 coins (on ranks 11-572) together ... are 38 times smaller!) http://www.newbium.com/beta/top/10/   Top 20  (click for larger)  Not new. The image that you already know. But sometimes it was just too chaotic, that is why - you can also access coins in the acronymlist on the right - and additionally now, with above URLs, can reduce the number. http://www.newbium.com/beta/top/20/   Click, and Doubleclick  In the above graphs, when clicking, the (WOB+CMC+SS) was opened in the same tab, the graph disappeared, made place for the histogram, the ""gray Laptop"" with CMC data, and the BUY/SELL buttons.  Which is actually not what I personally prefer -  I want to open several coins in one visit.   Solution found and implemented:  CLICK = open in SAME window/tab DOUBLECLICK = open in new tab  The (single)click only works in the acronym list on the right - because otherwise, on tablets  each touch of the screen would immediately open the new page.  The reason is that the Voronoi Tesselation assigns every single pixel of the graph area ... to a coin. So touching any area ... will always open the coin whose curve is nearest to your fingertipp.   Vocabulary:   Voronoi Tesselation?  Some of you might have wondered what the ""Show Voronoi"" checkbox is for. Now, with the new single BTC curve (it is not necessary but) easier to understand:   (click for larger) (see live on http://www.newbium.com/beta/top/1/ enable 'Show Voronoi')  ""A tessellation is the tiling of a plane using geometric shapes, with no overlaps and no gaps.""  In maths, ""a Voronoi tesselation is a partitioning of a plane into regions based on distance to points"", and it is named after Georgy Voronoi.  With that algorithm, any pixel of the whole rectangular graph area can be assigned to the ""nearest"" curve - and in our case, that allows us to click NEAR a curve, and still HIT a coin. Very practical.   Timing: This is not a new function, but you might not have noticed yet:  Every 5 minutes, the page refreshes itself, automagically.  Why is the auto-refresh useful?  Put it in in a separate small browser window, zoom out (Ctrl-Minus), and leave it open. Then you are among the first who might notice when a top20 market goes boom:   newbium.com   Best of luck in your trading!     EDIT: retweet please - thanks.",False

Sorry for the delay, I have restarted the 'queryblockchain' routine - next update will probably be online around 13:30 UTC. In general:  I have lowered the pauses between two blockchain scans now. Each scan already takes a whoppping 55 minutes, because we are asked to query the blockexplorer only every 10 seconds. Then I make a pause of 2 hours. So:  Approx every 3 hours, you find the updated totals & prices on www.newbium.com/crowdsale. And your personal status is then updated too, on your investor page (see email inbox).

For the whole post, see the DASH thread. For you, I am extracting from it the ...  WOB explanations pt2  Let me motivate the summing scheme:  Imagine what a buy order means: I am locking my BTC into the order - I cannot spend it anymore for ice cream, or helicopters. Even if I hope to get DASH at a really low price - my order-locked BTC is not only showing my ""price hope"" - but it is also showing the absolute amount of real money that I had been willing to lock into orders.  Same for sell orders: Transfering my DASH to an exchange is risky, I give up my property in exchange for an IOU. And I declare that I want to sell them. Might be at a really high price only - but I show my willingness to sell them, not using them to buy something, or fund projects, or save for my children - but by offering them in a sell order.  And as both sides get totalled in the same way, we CAN actually compare them. Or rather: We DO compare them ;-)  My own scepticism got smashed when I did cross-comparisons of different coins. They do differ in this new WOB indicator, and they differ much. I suggest you start observing it over time, for 3 very different coins - and you might find out that it will help you to assess how ""long-term realistic"" the current price of a coin is, compared to our quotient of totals of the (most of the) biggest, available order books world-wide.  I am querying 30+ exchanges! With our current ""bittrex bleutrade bter ccex exmo livecoin poloniex yobit"" in BTC and 2 fiat currencies - am I sampling enough of your field? [i.e. DASH]   Anecdote: When I tried my simple base calculation for the first time, about 1.5 years ago, and only with the orderbooks of poloniex ... I was surprised to see that LTC stayed totally OB-balanced over a very long period of time - and with varying current prices. As if the total order book volumes (""the whole market""), and the current marketprice (""the day traders"") are well-coupled - at least for those ""relaxed systems"" with high volume, and long past - like Litecoin. (Right now, the situation of LTC looks less rosy, actually. But the better is the enemy of the good, I guess.)  ...  I am interested to see which other knowledge our newbies & pros will be compiling collectively - about all of the most advanced & really successful currencies ... once our 8-steps system is complete. Read the whitepaper & medium blog if you want to. And simply start using the beta already.  May it help your trading!      --> http://www.newbium.com/preview    ",False
