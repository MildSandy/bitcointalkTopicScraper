The Waves token ""Tokes"", being the native currency of the platform, was the initial currency to be used.  We then decided to add support for a select number of the most popular cryptocurrencies which for the moment includes Bitcoin and Litecoin.  The only two major cryptocurrencies supported by the Merchant Gateway during this initial phase.  With time we will likely roll out other payment options as well, as our system starts being used and tested in Nevada dispensaries.  In terms of buying products for international delivery with cryptocurrency.   We currently do offer a line of Tokes themed clothing online through the store Crypto Bantam.   You are able to pay for these items either with cryptocurrency or with dollars.   Shipping is free when you choose to pay in crypto.   Tokes is one of the supporterd currencies accepted by the crypto payment plugin Mycryptocheckout.  So you can in fact use Tokes to buy something at that store and have it shipped anywhere in the world.  That would include other ""non-tokes"" products such as a Litecoin shirt.  https://www.cryptobantam.com/product-tag/tokes/       ",False

The intention being to solve the problem that occurs for legal cannabis businesses that are forced to deal only in cash.   They accumulate reserves of paper cash which can make them targets for thieves.   There are also numerous other problems and challenges they face in dealing only in cash along the entire supply chain.  The customers who would use the Tokes token in these stores would for the mosst part have very little background with cryptocurrency.    They would most likely have never heard of Bitcointalk, for example.  They would have only received the bare minimum technical information needed to use this cryptocurrency to purchase products in a dispensary, using the Tokes Wallet on their smartphones.      More broadly, Tokes is also a cryptocurrency in the more general sense, which people with a cryptocurrency background will understand and relate to.   That is to say, it does trade on the exchange Bittrex, with the trading pair BTC-TKS.   If you have a Waves wallet, you are able to log into your Waves Client or Waves app and acquire Tokes on the Waves Decentralized Exchange.  In certain countries you are able to connect your bank account to your Waves Client and move funds into your Waves wallet.   This is one way of funding your wallet.   Alternatively, you can acquire Bitcoin or some other major cryptocurrency that trades on Waves and then send it to your Waves wallet.   You can use it to buy Waves, which is the currency that serves as the major trading asset to acquire value tokens on the Waves Decentralized Exchange.   You can also acquire a certain amount of Waves for the sake of leasing to a Waves Node, which will earn you a small passive income in Waves and other tokens.  So typically, there is at least some small investment made when someone is going to set up and use a Waves wallet for practicfal purposes.   Let's say moving $50 or $100 into BTC.   Then sending that to your Waves wallet.    Then buying your first Waves with the BTC.   Performing some trades on the Waves DEX, for instance, in order to buy your first Tokes tokens.  You could also buy the token CoffeeCoin and use that to order coffee.   This is another Waves project that has developed a practical use case for their token.    https://medium.com/tokesplatform/legislative-progression-in-blockchain-and-cannabis-359a9bb9a3fc        ",False

If you get a chance, check out the newsletter from Dec. The team has been busy at work to become compliant within the state of Nevada and begin offering their seed-to-sale solution. They are in one of the best positions to actually be adopted for use within the state. Not only is there a working POS (one of the only in the industry atm) but their partnerships this year have been the best in the biz.  While all the other cannabis coins have been aching during this bear market, the Tokes team has focused on development. This will give them an obvious leg up going into next year. It's easy to find problems with startups and young businesses but cryptos are of particular target for fud but it's important look at the big, long term picture. What have the other cannabis coins done this year? Sent a baller to North Korea and received a Cease-and-Desist order from the SEC.  The team has also said multiple times that exchanges are not the main priority and there's years of runway left before the team even needs to consider capital. If things start taking off in Nevada expect Tokes to become the leader in the industry. Once legalization happens federally the team will already have been working with states for years so they again will be in the best position compared to any competitor.  I have to disagree that the competitors have a better product offering. Do they have partnerships that can track products genetically? Are they integrated with dozens of ATM's and do they have their own proprietary POS that can compete with the likes of Shopify? These are the types of things governments will be looking for as the industry develops and these are the reasons Tokes sticks out compared to other, current cannabis projects.",False

The past month has been a busy time for the team, primarily focusing on continued development efforts around the tokes transactional protocol.  Along with this we have a number of other related announcements around marketing, deployments of software, and token adoption.   Merchant Gateway and Mobile Application  We have been in final quality assurance testing for our merchant gateway software over the last few weeks and polishing the full release of the software for public use.  While quality assurance testing has extended longer than initially projected, it is of the utmost importance that we ensure that any payments flowing through our merchant gateway software are secure and that no loss is incurred due to software bugs due to insufficient QA or user acceptance testing (UAT).  These final stages are proceeding in parallel with final passes of our mobile application which we will be submitted to both the iOS and Android stores once QA is finished.  Demos of both the gateway (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQz9UxmYlHw) and mobile application (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fkoSGTgzF4) can be found via our YouTube channel.  Additionally, the API integrations of the merchant gateway are still being developed.  Specifically, this functionality will allow merchants with existing inventory control software to import products from these systems, and in turn allow updating of product stock directly from the Tokes Merchant Gateway.  This feature will follow after the initial public release of the merchant gateway.     Herbology Tours  Some of you may recall our partnership with local cannabis tour company and shuttle service Herbology Tours here in Las Vegas, NV.  We are excited to announce that with the upcoming rollout of the merchant gateway, tourgoers will soon receive an allocation of tokes to spend at stops along the tour, both broadening our user base and adoption of tokes by dispensaries.  Herbology was the first in Nevada to obtain the needed support licensing requirement to function as a full-fledged cannabis tour company and shuttle service between dispensaries.  The Herbology Bus can be seen below sporting our logo…     Exchange Listings  We are very pleased to announce that Tokes can now be purchased on CoinSwitch (https://coinswitch.co).  For those unfamiliar, CoinSwitch offers an easy way for users to obtain multiple cryptocurrencies at the lowest cost by aggregating the average price across multiple exchanges.  CoinSwitch’s easy to use interface provides one of the easiest methods for new cryptocurrency enthusiasts to obtain an array of tokens and diversify their holdings without the usual difficulties associated with managing funds across multiple exchanges.  On a related note, we regularly see a plethora of our users asking about additional exchange listing of our token.  While this is an important component to any tokenized project within the blockchain space, our focus for the past year has largely been on project development and strategic partnerships, and less on marketing pushes and additional exchange listings.  Once our development projects are launched and gaining traction on both a consumer and business level, then we can refocus efforts on matters such as exchange placements.  In the interim however, most exchanges have token request forms, and we encourage our users interested in these listings to inquire themselves, and request/vote for our token to be listed on your favorite sites.   Smart Contracts  As you may be aware, the Waves team launched smart contracts to the Waves testnet earlier this month, beta testing this functionality for deployment on the mainnet in future releases.  As tokes is a Waves asset, this functionality can serve to benefit our users in a number of ways.  The upcoming smart contract functionality will allow for multisignature wallets – that is, the requirement of two or more parties to private keys in order to move funds from a wallet – an important feature for businesses adopting tokes as a primary form of payment.  Additionally, the new smart contract functionality will bring Turing complete decentralized applications, time-based token freezes, and atomic swaps, allowing more complex processes to be undertaken in a trustless on-chain manner, independent of off-chain applications.  Many readers might be scratching their heads at this point thinking: “so what?!  Ethereum has had this functionality for ages!”  Keep in mind however, that at its core, Ethereum and chains like it are primarily smart-contract and DApp centric platforms.  Waves however is a transactional blockchain with asset creation capability, possessing the speed that makes it an ideal chain for consumer-to-business transactions (i.e., Waves has fast block times and the lowest fees).  This added smart contract functionality on a fast chain improves the overall feature set of tokes, and allows for us to implement more robust feature sets to our offerings like the merchant gateway, soon with on-chain smart contract functionality.  EPCIS Open-Source Blockchain  The world’s largest blockchain and cryptocurrency focused conference, Consensus 2018, concluded last week in New York.  Tokes founders Michael Wagner and Gabriel Allred were in attendance.  This year, there was much discussion around blockchain as a disruptive force in supply chain management.  For the curious, see the articles on pages 35 and 40 of this year’s program (“Manufacturing and Blockchain:  Prime Time Yet to Come” & “Making Trade Wars Obsolete”).  This recent buzz around supply chain management and the provenance of production data with blockchain only reaffirms our commitment to building projects like the EPCIS blockchain discussed in last month’s newsletter.  To recap, EPCIS (Electronic Product Code Information Services) is a global standard for structuring event data across industries and tracking “objects” as they move through a supply chain.  Utilizing Quorum (https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/Quorum) for this development, our specific deployment serves as a backend integration to conventional enterprise resource planning software.  We will soon release the initial version of our EPCIS Blockchain, an open-source project designed for storage of Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) information on the blockchain.  While many large players like IBM have already thrown their hat in the ring of supply chain management blockchain implementations, the opportunities for blockchain deployments within the cannabis space and beyond are limitless, as the need for the provenance of data within supply chains spans disparate industries from fishing, farming, shipping, medicine, to industrial manufacturing and beyond.  Even capturing a small percentage of any industry’s data on the blockchain is a win for the tokes team, and while the cannabis vertical is our primary focus, it is important to note that the EPCIS chain (as well as all our other product offerings) are essentially industry agnostic.  Keep an eye out for an announcement regarding the soon to be available public EPCIS Blockchain repository.     Lastly, Brave New Coin (link) published a great two-part article on the intersection of cannabis and blockchain, with a fair amount of discussion around Tokes.

Direct quote:  ""Many investors are looking into making big returns on their initial investment. The coins currently ranked in the top 20 may not get you the 10x return you’re hoping to see.  Fortunately, there are many smaller projects with small market caps that still have a lot of room for growth and ultimately a higher market capitalization.  Seeing cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin grow a tremendous 8000% in 2017 alone makes you ask what the next booming cryptocurrency is.   This article discusses 5 cryptocurrencies that are currently below the $25 million market capitalization mark which have the potential to grow and sustain a larger market capitalization in the cryptocurrency market.  Tokes Market capitalization: $7.4 million  Tokes is cryptocurrency project that I believe could have a big ROI (return on investment) in the future. Keep in mind that this token likely won’t see a 10-20x return within a month or two, but as a long-term hold, Tokes has a lot of potential to take off.   To give a brief background on this token,Tokes is a Waves-based asset (it trades on the Waves decentralized exchange platform) that focuses on the booming marijuana industry. Tokes currently see a majority of its trading volume on Bittrex and the remainder on the Waves Decentralized Exchange. Tokes has secured big partnerships within the marijuana industry and looks to solve real world problems with the use of their token.  One of the features that makes Tokes interesting is that it aims to create a fiat gateway. Many marijuana dispensaries currently operate as cash-only businesses because of the non-acceptance of banks and the issues associated with working within the traditional financial system. Tokes looks to peg the USD to their TKS token on a 1:1 basis, meaning that US$1,000 worth of Tokes can be withdrawn as $1,000 in USD. This mean there is no risk of volatility.   By operating in Las Vegas, Tokes chose a very good location to work on their project. The marijuana laws and regulations in Las Vegas are quite lenient compared to other locations in America.   They commenced their pilot program better known as Herbology Tours with a partnership with Pisos, a marijuana dispensary operating in Las Vegas. The partnership provides an e-payment solution for the dispensary by using the TKS tokens. This is just the first step towards mainstream adoption as the team looks to expand to work as a point-of-sale system (a fiat gateway) in various other dispensaries.  The market capitalization of Tokes is roughly $7.4 million with a small circulating supply of roughly 1.5 million tokens in the market. As the marijuana industry continues to grow and see further acceptance, the Tokes project envisions providing a real-world use case to allow seamless, efficient and non-volatile electronic payments through the use of their tokens.  Where to Buy TKS TKS is available on the following exchanges: Bittrex and Waves DEX.  Pros:  Provides a real world use case in a growing industry that has a lot of potential. Secured partnerships with big players in the marijuana industry.  Cons:  Is only listed on Bittrex and the Waves DEX (volume is lacking). Ambitious project that has a long way to go before receiving mainstream recognition.""",False

Tokes has been accepted at Pisos as part of a pilot program for making the token spendable.  This pilot program was launched in August.   During the initial phase of that partnership, Tokes were accepted as a form of payment at a point in time in which the point of sales software was under development (beta testing) and had not yet been deployed in commercial use.   As such 1 token was accepted as $1 USD, and the remaining market value of the token was refunded to the customer in cash.   This was just a temporary solution to get the token in use while the payment system was still under development.   During this initial phase, The Tokes Platform wanted to remain conservative and delay launching new dispensary partnerships until a point in time where they will have the payment system fully ready to handle the volume of payments that will be processed by multiple locations.  https://twitter.com/pisoslv  The Tokes Platform has recently redesigned their website, and now includes regular updates published in the ""News"" section:   https://tokesplatform.org/news/  https://tokesplatform.org/therev-tokes-platform-newsletter-november-2017/   In the first draft of the whitepaper, it was hinted at that Tokes would pursue selling a line of products.   That is no longer a part of immediate plans, since core development of the project has led the team to focus on new opportunities, as the legal cannabis space has continued to grow.   The whitepaper has recently been revised, and a number of changes have been made to the initial vision.  ",False

I post the original private newsletter that came out some days ago: (I am lazy to fix all the cope paste problems but you get the idea  A Booming New Opportunity in Legal Marijuana Payments Just like the online auction market of the ’90s, there’s a booming new industry suffering from a payments  problem: legal marijuana. In this month’s issue, I’ll show you how an up-and-coming payment provider is positioning itself to become the PayPal of this exploding industry.  Today, 28 states and the District of Columbia have legalized some form of marijuana sales. Analysts project the industry will rake in $6 billion this year alone. And the well-respected research rm  Cowen expects legal cannabis sales to reach $50 billion by 2026—that’s a 700% increase.  American attitudes about legalized marijuana have changed radically over the years. According to an October 2017 Gallup poll, nearly 65% of Americans support legalizing marijuana. That’s a record high. (For comparison, in 1996, only 25% of Americans supported legal cannabis.) This legalization movement has been a bonanza for the 50,000-plus growers and the 3,189 marijuana dispensaries that have popped up around the country since 2012. But this growth came with a dark side. In 2013, three criminals kidnapped a marijuana grower in Fresno, California. They used a blowtorch to torture him and mutilated his genitals... all in a (fruitless) e  ort to uncover his hidden cash stash. This gruesome example shows just how dangerous operating a marijuana business can be. You see, marijuana sales are still illegal under federal law. And that means banks can’t accept deposits from cannabis-related businesses. That has forced marijuana growers and sellers to hold stacks of cash—in some cases,  oor to ceiling. That  makes dispensaries juicy targets for criminals. Aside from the obvious safety problems this poses for marijuana businesses, there is an economic one as well. One industry insider I spoke with told me that cash-handling costs are eating as much as 30% of gross revenue for some dispensaries. That means as much as 30 cents out of every $1 earned goes toward paying for guards, armored trucks, guns, surveillance gear, etc. Although banks won’t work with marijuana businesses, some credit unions will. But the costs are prohibitive. They charge 3% on cash deposits. In addition, credit unions demand a checking account fee of $7,500 per month. Even then, they place limits on how much cash they will accept from marijuana businesses. As already mentioned, Cowen projects the industry to grow to $50 billion by 2026. There’s no safe or cheap way for the industry to process $50 billion in cash. A change must be made. Cryptocurrencies to the Rescue Bitcoin would seem like a natural solution for the cannabis industry’s cash woes. It’s secure, practically unhackable, and its fees are lower than using cash. However, bitcoin has one serious drawback... con  rmation times. Normally, it takes 10 minutes to con  rm a transaction on the bitcoin network. That’s far too long to wait in  a retail setting.  Imagine going to Wal-Mart to buy groceries... and the cashier makes you wait 10 minutes for your credit card to clear. That just wouldn’t work in a store where you’re doing thousands of transactions per day. What the marijuana industry needs is a highly secure cryptocurrency that can process transactions immediately. It should be easy to use. Plus, it must be integrated within the existing payment structure already used by cashiers and clerks. The cryptocurrency that can solve this problem will become the PayPal of the marijuana industry. We’ve identi ed a project that lls every one of the legal cannabis market’s needs. It’s cheap to use, it  scales, and most importantly, it offers almost instantaneous conrmations.",False

I'd actually encourage you to read through our Newsletters, as that's where we post the majority of the content. We maintain this thread for some basic questions. And regarding adoption, we actually DO have it. You can currently purchase cannabis with tokes as Pisos in Las Vegas. We've processed over $1300 in transactions in the last month and a half. While that number isn't a blockbuster, it's better that most cryptocurrencies can claim, let alone one dedicated to the cannabis industry.  Why are they using tokes? Well, because we are doing the business development necessary to get that integrated. Believe it or not, crypto is not exactly intuitive to implement into a business. It doesn't make sense to a lot of people. And they are intimidated by it. Particularly given the unfortunate cloud that surrounds bitcoin's use in the early days on sites like Silk Road. Many people still think the only people that use it are those that want to purchase illegal things on the internet anonymously. And who is going out there helping change that image? We are. And we're helping them set up and secure wallets. And we're also educating them on the numerous benefits that this technology brings to their business. The result is that they trust us, and they adopt our currency. Because guess what else, when something goes wrong, they have someone they can call direct via cell phone.  And, as we've clarified in newsletters and in slack, it would be redundant for us to build out our own mobile app for the time being. We've refocused that energy on more productive components of the project, namely a merchant gateway and building relationships. Those transactions through Pisos I referred to...they're all processed through the Waves mobile app, which is accessible on both iOS and Android. And the fees, they cost less than a penny per transaction, and blocks process in less than 30 seconds on average. So yea, that functionality is in place. We'll put some focus back on the dispensary locator and strain index when we scale up the team and have more resources to allocate there.  So next time, I'd suggest doing a little research before you post derogatory information erroneously. Just makes you look foolish.   Edit: We're also ahead of schedule on most items on that roadmap.

We're currently targeting and supporting Las Vegas (NV) exclusively from a 'company' perspective due to licensing and manpower requirements. However, tokes is an open-sourced platform, built on the waves blockchain, so there is nothing preventing you from adopting the technology in your business. When our merchant gateway is complete, it will provide a turnkey solution to accept tokes online for payment, as well as several other supported cryptocurrencies as we build them in. We have an internal alpha in testing, but I suspect it will be a few weeks/months until we're ready to deploy a beta to the broader community. However, it's functionality includes a LOT of beneficial features for ANY merchant interested in accepting tokes. We'll be producing an explainer video for this in the coming weeks.  If you're transacting legally online, I have to assume you live in Canada? Obviously there is huge market potential in Canada, and a region we will aggressively move into as soon as possible. I just read an article over the weekend that puts early estimations on revenue across the country at $22 billion, and I can assure you we want to assist with processing those transactions. Working as quickly as we can, so hopefully have more for you in the near future. If you have general questions on how to implement the tech, I'm more than happy to connect with you directly.

We're ironing out the details of our relationship with Herbology Tours and determining the logistics of token distribution, sale, and redemption. Once this is complete there will be 3-5 dispensaries in town running in our beta program. The TOKES beta program will be accessible to these early adopters until we can be sure that there are no catastrophic bugs in the system. Since we're introducing this technology to people who are largely unfamiliar with it, we want to avoid damaging the image and prospect of it going forward with an unrecoverable mistake.  One challenging part of that equation is the market mechanic. Part of the dilemma is the relatively low current liquidity on Bittrex. It's a bit of a 'chicken and egg' problem, determining what comes first. When we get ready to push for broader adoption beyond our beta program we'll need to ensure there is sufficient liquidity to absorb sales the merchants make when they wish to move back into fiat. They will largely have no interest in bearing the volatility risk of a speculative instrument like TOKES, so most sales will be converted back to a stable asset quite quickly (instantaneously, if desired, once we are fully launched). So it's difficult for us to bring on numerous dispensaries without that liquidity in place. However, people interested in investing in TOKES also want to know that we have some user and dispensary adoption. To help resolve this dilemma, we're undertaking new marketing efforts to help spread the word on TOKES. Things like the new Ambassador program (see above), will help us accomplish that mission. We are also looking to engage with PR and marketing firms to get more people familiar with the project. The focus will initially be in the crypto ecosystem, and we'll expand to the cannabis industry when appropriate. We feel these are prudent expenditures to further our objectives.",False

Since we are an asset generated on the waves blockchain, we created all 50M units in genesis and made them available for sale during our ICO period. WAVES and all WAVES assets (such as TOKES), do not subscribe to a POW mining process. You can operate a full node for waves and process transactions in a POS capacity, or you can lease your WAVES out to registered full nodes under their LPOS system. Miners today are rewarded with transaction fees in blocks, as well as with MRT (miners reward token), which was created by the waves team to incentivize full node mining. MRT will also provide an incentive to miners to process fees paid in various sub-assets, like TOKES, instead of just with WAVES fees attached. That way a person would only need to carry one asset in their wallet, should that be their preference, instead of needing to own WAVES just to make transactions in an asset like ours.  Also, you might be interested in one of our latest blog posts about the supply of the token: http://cannabisrevolution.us/index.php/2017/04/28/648/",False

In the event that we hit only a portion of our target, unsold TOKES will go into a reserve account with a publicly-released wallet address. The rationale here is two-fold. First, we feel it's important to have this quantity of supply eventually available in the ecosystem, which argues against burning any unsold units. Secondly, project funding dictates that we ultimately sell the remaining units. What we will not do is dump these on the market. If at some point in the future we determine we need to undertake a secondary offering, we would release additional tranches of TOKES via off-market transactions (similar to AMP's secondary sale).

This is yoyoamigo from the WAVES Community. I am not from WAVES, not a member of their Team or Company.  this is a simple recap of all activities and news for the past week.  i am doing this out of contribution for WavesPlatform and to all ICO tokens using it. As well as for the communities involved.   Reason? Ever since the WAVES WEEKLY came to an end temporarily, i had thought it would be something good to have while waiting for it to come back. In addition, i feel that those that are on WavesPlatform shouldn't be left out of this. i would like to see WavesPlatform and all those who are part of it rise up together in full force. Not one without the others.  No payment is required. Also, all images used below are CC0 (Creative Commons) a.k.a. free for public use. Mostly from Pixabay.com and Dreamstime.com. And a few of my own. So rest assured  I only asked that you allow me to leave a logo of WAVES in the image you see below and a link to WavesPlatform website and to its recap as well. As you can see, you will not find any other cryptocurrencies here except yours and WAVES. This is done so as to respect your space and the community's attention. for the other cryptocurrencies as well.  if you feel the recap is good enough, you are free to share & tweet the 'Recap"" image below.

Thank you. For the community, please liked it or retweet it as well.  If you want to ensure that all news and activities are to be included into this recap, be sure to tweet it or blog it. If, however, there are no news for the entire week, i will not post any recap. So be sure to have at least one. news and activities are only inclusive of new information. old, duplicated or repeated ones will be excluded from the recap. However, do not trouble yourself about re-posting an old news. I will be able to find out if its new or not. So leave the work to me. =)  If you only a few news now, it's alright. this recap is not meant to put to shame. But in the future, you can rest assured that i will be covering those many news.

I would like to note you sold 648,623 TKS during ICO for 15k - 33k satoshis, which is the circulating supply right now.  Please tell us what you plan to do with the rest of the tokens. Let me remind you that Bittrex has this distribution chart which can clearly show the amount of tokens in each TKS wallet.  Let's keep things professional, ok?  If you do this right, the market could be stable at $1 per TKS ($648,623 marketcap, fair?) which WILL improve your next crowdsale in the future.

We've submitted a request for addition to CoinMarketCap with those figures in mind.  We've extensively discussed the unsold units throughout this thread, and in fact have a question dedicated to it in the FAQ. Nevertheless, I'll repeat here that those units are retained in a reserve account, and can later be sold via private sales to institutional investors, or via a secondary offering. Of course, any future sales would be based on financial status of project reserves, budgetary needs, and would not be executed in a fashion that negatively impacts the market (no dumping). I'd encourage you to continue monitoring the Bittrex distribution chart, as it simply validates the statements we've been making that our interests in this project are long-term in nature. We are still just in our seedling stage, with huge potential for growth in both the blockchain industry as well as the cannabis industry.

While we have always stated that this is a secondary priority to us (behind development of our revenue generating business segments), we appreciate that it does lend an air of legitimacy to the project, and will provide additional exposure  and increased interest in the platform.  For these reasons, we have dedicated time and resources this month to engaging with exchanges. We have reached out to several exchanges, including: Poloniex, Tidex, Liqui, NovaExchange, CoinQX, and Bittrex. Of these conversations, the most fruitful were with the owners of Bittrex and CoinQX. While this is not an official announcement, we are confident about obtaining a listing at both sites. However, given the current infancy of WAVES’ codebase, the implementation of listing WAVES assets (like TOKES) will take some time. We have a member of our development team working closely with members of both exchanges, actively implementing the adoption of WAVES assets. It is likely that we will make an official announcement about a Bittrex listing within the week.  Your efforts as a community go far in getting TOKES listed.  Many exchanges have responded by instructing us to push our community to make requests for a listing at their exchanges. Emails, Tweets, and Facebook posts all will assist in getting more listings sooner.",False

For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Wagner, founder of the Tokes Platform. I would have preferred for Rob and I to navigate this conversation privately, but as the Incent team has announced a 'discontinuation of support' for our ICO distribution, I'm compelled to provide a response.  For some background, the terms of our MOA included a 5BTC deposit up front, 5BTC closing payment, and 2% of total funds raised as a share of revenue. In return, we were to receive a functional investment management backend portal along with a component of technical support for our users. We made payments on the initial deposit, as well as an interim payment based on funds raised (~1.8BTC). If you were a participant in our ICO, you can attest to the fact that the execution of distribution of tokes proceeds left a lot to be desired, and in fact was never officially completed. Our ICO closed on January 15th, and our investors are still waiting on distributions to be processed by their team.   For additional context, this is the email message I sent to Rob and Peter following our call earlier in the evening. Please note that this went out at 8:05PM PST, and the 'discontinuation of support' post was released in the early hours of the morning, without having any additional communication with me.     While I made an appeal to them regarding the payment amount to them proportional to funds raised, this is not about us 'not raising enough money'. This is about inadequate execution of their side of the agreement.   An earlier attempt to communicate with Incent at the beginning of February:   From: Michael Wagner [mailto:michael@tokesplatform.org] Sent: Monday, February 6, 2017 12:23 PM To: 'Peter Godbolt' <peter@bitscan.co>; 'Rob Wilson' <rob@bitscan.co> Cc: gabriel@tokesplatform.org; jon@tokesplatform.org Subject: ICO and Bounty Distributions  Gentleman,  Hope all finds you well following the weekend. As we near completion on the Tokes ICO, I just wanted to follow up on a few final details…  1.   Jon has completed the reconciliation for bounty distributions and prepared a spreadsheet with waves wallet addresses and their respective payouts, which I’ve attached. Please let me know if you still plan on adding these payouts to the remaining distributions or if we should process manually.  2.   Remaining investor distributions…not surprisingly, a few members of the community are getting a bit restless about receiving their tokes. I understand that you’re being methodical with the distro, but just wanted to get an idea of when all members with withdrawal addresses will receive their full payouts?  3.   Tokes Reserve Address: given that the majority of ICO payments have gone out, you should be able to process the tokes reserve distribution. You can retain some units as necessary to ensure complete distro, but ~95% of the reserve can be sent to: 3P5WW7ebPaZF5NXDm1ZZYmrbgFm784tsRPw  4.   Per my communications with Fran, we’ve released escrow including the 2% payment due to Incent. I can pull transaction details if needed, but you should have received that payment late last week.  5.   Incent bonus: several members have inquired about the 1% incent bonus to be paid to ICO investors. I assume those will be going out along with the final tokes distributions, or should we be preparing for a different scenario?  6.   Customer testament: I’m sure you’re eager to further promote the ICO technology. Per our earlier conversation, I’m happy to write up a customer statement for you, pending completion on the remaining items above.   I think that just about covers everything from our end. Looking forward to getting everything wrapped up from an ICO perspective, and potentially continuing the conversation regarding POS development. I’ve loosely discussed this with Peter, but we might have an opportunity to jointly develop a mobile app and point-of-sale system, as our projects have some overlapping interest in that technology. In any case, look forward to hearing back.  Best, Michael   In essence, we paid for a product we thought was robust and complete from individuals we felt were professional. What we received was complete garbage. It would be irresponsible from both a company perspective, and in considering the impact on our investors, for me to relegate additional funds from our operating capital to pay a non-performing contract. I would caution anyone considering the use of Incent ICO technology to strongly reconsider the other options currently available in the ecosystem. If the Tokes team did anything wrong, it was engaging with Incent on this feature.   Given the fact that we are terminating our relationship with Incent, I don't feel that the Incent ANN thread is the most appropriate channel to continue this conversation. If you were a Tokes investor, or have interest in our project, I encourage you to join us in slack (you can register at: https://tokes-slack.herokuapp.com/ and join us at http://tokesplatform.slack.com).   For those who invested in Tokes Platform, know that we will be making you whole through the issuance of a new asset on Waves, with the name Tokes, but under a new asset ID. Any exchange listings will be based on that new asset ID. The members in our slack channel have requested that the initial 1% Incent bonus that was offered be replaced with a 1% Tokes bonus, which we will honor. Feel free to reach me direct at michael@tokesplatform.org. Bear in mind that we might be inundated with emails initially, so please bear with me on response time. I'll begin processing the replacement asset today.",False

Some suggestions: 1. Do what he said, recreate / reissue TOKES through waves, but why when creating Tokens through Ethereum is so easy. 2. Refund everyone and redo the ICO. 3. Redo the ICO through Ethereum.  With ethereum, you can easily create any token you want.  I think it's best for the community and because partnering with Incent had failed, it's best to do a full refund.  Then move forward and redo a new ICO through Ethereum.  Acknowledge and take responsiblity that because Incent didn't work out, this is the best path forward.  Same thing with Etheroll.  They refunded everyone with their failed ICO and months later, did a NEW ICO because of the DAO failure.  Because they did that, folks see it as credible and the right thing to do and trustworthy.  The NEW ICO they did was even more successful.   When folks see you to be trustyworthy and doing the right thing, people will take part.   ",False

Bear in mind, the primary opportunities of cash onramping and electronic transaction processing are semi-reliant on federal illegality. In any case, that article states that there MIGHT  be additional pressure on recreational use, but almost strangely accommodates and approves its use medically. More importantly though, if you're invested in this space, you have to expect legislative changes in the pipeline. It's the very nature of a budding industry.  This was similar to the article about Washington state banning the use of bitcoin as a form of payment for that industry. @gbdesai  recently linked a follow-up to that in which the senator dropped support for that bill.

We've been busy out in the field working on getting tokes placements with dispensaries here in town, so apologies for not being as proactive here on BCT. As a few members have mentioned, we're posting most news and updates in slack, so I recommend you join us there for the latest. However, I'll give a quick update here:   Distribution  As has been noted, Incent is our partner for the ICO management portal and distribution management. They've completed somewhere around 90% of total distributions, but we still have a few issues to work through. Some members have not received their full amounts, but most people have received one or more tranches of distro. Please ensure you have an accurate waves lite or full node address to receive your tokes at. We've also approved and submitted our bounty sheet to Incent, so those will go out as early as possible.   Exchanges  While we've noted that this is not our primary use of time, we can appreciate that people are looking for liquidity, despite being very early in development. We have conversations open with all of the major exchanges and are looking at potential listings soon. The most likely cases are Bittrex and Tidex, but we've reached out to Poloniex and Bitfinex as well. The Bitfinex conversation is actually focused on multiple facets and would require significant advancements, but we had a positive conversation nonetheless. For those looking for exchange listings, we encourage you to reach out to your preferred exchange to request that as well, as many of these exchanges want to see interest from the community.   Marketing Collateral  With the assistance of one of our dedicated community members, we have produced a professional investor deck and one-pager (attached below) we can leave with industry prospects. We've also reformatted our website to focus on our 5 key initiative areas. The website (http://tokesplatform.org), presentation, and one-pager now send a solid and consistent message. And finally, I've been working on the initial newsletter in between business development efforts. We're looking to have monthly issues sent out on the 20th. You can sign up at the website.",False

As I noted above, please ensure you have a WAVES wallet address documented on the platform. To enter your address, log in to the ICO portal -> ICO Dashboard -> Waves Addresses -> Enter address in this section. I'm attempting to have Peter create a section that outlines a desired withdrawal address for BTC contributions; however, due to the method in which we receive and record waves contributions, tokes distributions for waves investments will be sent to the address recorded on the blockchain. So, if you sent from a waves address, the tokes will automatically be sent BACK to that waves address. If you sent BTC, you can have the tokes sent to any waves address of your choice.  2. Please DO NOT use a Bittrex waves wallet for your tokes distribution, as you'll be unable to recover the tokens at that address since you do not control the private keys.  3. Despite the warning and instruction on the portal, if you contributed to the ICO from a Bittrex wallet, please reach out to me as soon as possible so we can make accommodations for a separate distribution address. Note here that we'll need to verify transaction ownership via a secondary transaction in a specified amount, from the exact wallet you sent from previously.",False

During the course of the ICO, in the rare situation where you have sent waves from multiple addresses (ie. multiple Waves Lite client from different computers), it would be important to insert each waves address for the sole purpose of helpîng the dashboard to track the transactions and give you a proper count of tokens.    Then that info is used to organize the distribution.

In the event that we hit only a portion of our target, unsold TOKES will go into a reserve account with a publicly-released wallet address. The rationale here is two-fold. First, we feel it's important to have this quantity of supply eventually available in the ecosystem, which argues against burning any unsold units. Secondly, project funding dictates that we ultimately sell the remaining units. What we will not do is dump these on the market. If at some point in the future we determine we need to undertake a secondary offering, we would release additional tranches of TOKES via off-market transactions (similar to AMP's secondary sale).",False

We aren't simply operating a digital currency on a foundation of cannabis-grow experience, we're talking about translating our business and marijuana experience into a profitable legal business venture. This has never been done before in crypto. And our project extends well beyond the underlying digital token, tokes. That transaction layer, which will encompass asset pegging and anonymous sending (also not done in any of the established cannabis tokens), is just a single component of our project model. I mentioned the business segment, which is a second component. And third, our mobile application will facilitate transactions and provide a wealth of information to cannabis enthusiasts.   I've addressed the question of merchant and consumer adoption fairly exhaustively throughout this thread, so I'll mostly summarize here:  1. Education. This is perhaps the most critical aspect of user adoption, and has been largely overlooked by other projects. We are operating in a relatively technologically advanced space. Although we understand the mechanics of cryptocurrency, it's no secret that 95% of the population does not. We're going to be undertaking huge efforts to educate and inform partners at the merchant level on how to adopt and implement our technology right into their dispensaries. We'll further those efforts by similarly teaching the consumers on how to use it as well.  2. Technology support. By providing a free point-of-sale system to our merchant partners, we minimize the barrier to entry and adoption by providing a seamless, free, easy tool to begin accepting digital currencies. A portion of funds raised are dedicated to this cause, and part of the reason we are running an ICO.  3. Promotion and Marketing. We have several offers designed to increase user adoption, which has been discussed thoroughly before.  4. Industry relationships. We have immediate access to approximately 85% of the local dispensaries in Las Vegas. It will be the base of our operation, and a kicking off point to develop a systematized approach to adoption in other cities and states. As I've said, we're going to be strategically and intentionally slow to promote the fact that we're accepted at these dispensaries until we have solid wallet application in place, and POS systems distributed to dispensaries. It would be counterproductive to build momentum with customers until the infrastructure is in place. This is probably the reason most other cannabis tokens are failing - they're failing to grasp this component.",False

This is the same as asking people to buy your stock so you can turn around and use the money to buy your own stock later with the same money... which is just absurd.  I'm going to skip the first two points because your counterarguments lack all substance. However, regarding number 3: there is a very important and significant difference you're clearly missing. We're not using funds raised during the ICO as a price support mechanism. Instead, we're proposing that we take profits from the business segment to repurchase tokes. This is akin to conventional corporations using profits from their business operations to go out and rebuy stock. In fact, there is a term for this, which is a stock repurchase plan. Here is a link that describes it in greater detail. We'll also be the first in the crypto-space to incorporate this mechanism into our operations.",False

But I would be curious if you could address a concern of mine.  Page 10 of your whitepaper notes a plan for anonymous transactions.  You are planning to operate based in an U.S. (Nevada) facility while offering anonymous transactions.  Miners and end-users of cryptocurrencies are exempt from relevant FinCen regulations.  However, your company would rather be classified as an administrator of a cryptocurrency:     https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/new-us-treasury-fincen-ruling-clarifies-money-transmission-status-renting-bitcoin-miners-hashing-power/  So you will be required to register as a Money Services Business (MSB).  That means you will be legally required to enforce anti-money-laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) measures within your cryptocurrency, as far as I can tell from reading about federal regulations.  Now you might think you could skip everything AML/KYC if you did not convert fiat to crypto or vice versa.  Even that may be iffy.  Not only definitely New York's law but also apparently federal FinCen now may expect AML thresholds (like $3000 and $10000 or whatever) to be applied to the equivalent value in cryptocurrency, even when merely transacting in crypto without fiat.  Anyway, in general, here is an example quote from a million-dollar court judgment against Ripple:   After 180 days of the date of this agreement, Ripple Labs will (1) prevent any existing Ripple Trade user who has not transferred to a wallet or account with customer identification information from accessing the Ripple protocol through the Ripple Trade client  https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/shared/Ripple_Remedial_Measures.pdf  In other words, the U.S. government forced Ripple to agree to implement anti-privacy measures.  I really do hope you have a way around the regulatory situation, but here is a question: Do you know of any privacy-protecting cryptocurrency with a blatantly U.S.-based administrator company, other than some tiny ones simply slipping under the radar?  I don't.  Most cryptocurrencies are either started in Europe or elsewhere, or more decentralized.  Bitcoin is decentralized with no single target for regulators to go after, not dependent on any particular company.  Satoshi Nakamoto probably disappeared for a reason.  Before the Bitcoin era, the electronic currency E-Gold reached $2 billion a year transactions.  E-Bullion and Liberty Reserve were other top privacy-protecting currencies.  What all three have in common is that their founders or top people ended up with federal criminal charges.  Like the rest of the badly managed drug war, just how bad FinCen regulations can be seems about impossible to overstate.  With that said, if you somehow really could pull this off legally, it would be great, especially as a volatility-free coin could much help business adoption of cryptocurrency.",False

There is no 'registration' process to utilize the tokes wallet and decentralized software. Typically we see AML/KYC in those entities that need to store transactor information and facilitate trades, as is the case with many of the digital currency exchanges. However, decentralized wallets are not subject to the same requirements. Now, I'm not an attorney, and not stating de facto that this will be the case, but it's my initial interpretation on it.  All that said, considering the necessity to onramp fiat into the system at some point, this is all going to need to be thoroughly vetted prior to us assisting with that process. And in fact there is a good chance we'll need to proceed with MSB registration and the underlying KYC/AML. But even if that is the case, I foresee it only applying to that specific stage of the onramp cycle in which capital is brought into the system. Once it's converted in to tokes, the transactions on that blockchain are free to process anonymously.  Given how fastidious you were in your line of questioning, you might have an expertise in this area. If that's the case, perhaps we can discuss the potential challenges in more detail. I've said this numerous times, and I can't stress enough that everything we intend to accomplish will be done so with full compliance of the legal framework of the U.S. If there is something we're overlooking, I want it corrected before it causes any complications. Feel free to jump on slack if you'd like to chat. https://tokes-slack.herokuapp.com/ for registration.",False

Truly I lack the expertise for a firm conclusion either way, but your reply covers intent on the matter well enough for me to plan to contribute a bit more to the ICO.  After all, the type and magnitude of expected measures in a MSB's required AML program is supposed to be influenced by whether actual money laundering potential is high or low.  It does seem possible (and hopefully the case) that FinCEN might take a common-sense approach in regard to how, if the fiat ramp is controlled, that does limit money laundering potential.   Given how fastidious you were in your line of questioning, you might have an expertise in this area. If that's the case, perhaps we can discuss the potential challenges in more detail.  The thought is appreciated.  Unfortunately my comments were drawn only from an incomplete personal investigation (originally for another project), not extending much beyond what is already mentioned.   Among some other sources, I read part of a giant AML publication.  ( https://www.protiviti.com/sites/default/files/united_states/insights/guide-to-us-aml-requirements-6thedition-protiviti_0.pdf )  But I am not a professional in a related field.  My browsing did come across, though, a number of cases when state and federal agencies responsible for MSB regulation have replied to letters from companies asking for clarification.  So, as you may already be quite aware, completion of your other research might be followed by an optional last step of contacting FinCEN itself, if any uncertainties were left unresolvable otherwise.  Yet, of course, you are dealing with non-regulatory business matters as well, one step at a time.  Anyway, thanks for the reply.  After all, seeing quite active developers tends to be a good sign.",False

We also linked an interview with the folks over at Coin Interview in the OP, and I respond to many questions from Christian, Alex, and Evan, as well as the community.   edit: Regarding 'profit' in 3-6 months...I really can't make any claims as to where we'll stand at that time, but I can say that we'll be working aggressively over that time period to get our mobile app released (stay tuned on this topic - some UI mock-ups are coming out soon), begin work on customer and merchant adoption of tokes, and launch our initial products targeting edible CBDs and tourism.

The issue of cash onramps and offramps is at the core of our platform, and something that should be at least partially mitigated through Waves' proposal for direct fiat gateways, which is one of the reasons we selected them for asset issuance. I know we're being vague in some areas, but that is by design, and should be of value for anyone purchasing tokes in ICO. That's because a part of our value proposition is the proposed solutions to these very problems. More information will be released by our team as we approach ICO close, and as we move towards the implementations of those solutions. We want to maintain our competitive advantage in this niche.  As far as asset pegging goes, I would just ask what your familiarity is with the mechanism in general? It is effectively a two part system: one being the floating token (tokes), and a secondary unit that will be fixed at the value of $1.00 USD. Anyone with a desire to 'lock in' the value of their tokes against USD will be able to freely move between the two units. Again, early development, but the pegged unit will need to be fully capitalized and serve as a true USD-backed asset, in digital format. Think Tether.",False

Incent's technology does this quite well, and is supported by a strong team who just completed a successful ICO of their own on the same technology(they raised over $1MM USD). I'm not concerned about them going out of business any time soon. However, even if that did happen, we control the wallets along with our third-party escrow signatories, so no funds would be lost. It would certainly complicate things in that we would need to retrace all of the transactions on the blockchain and identify the people behind those investments, but not impossible. In any event, Incent is a team of professionals with project experience under their belts.   edit: just a comment on satoshi's vision... I'm afraid that's the natural evolution of things.

A couple of things here: first and foremost, we're going to be starting local, and we're going to be starting small. This is not the type of promotion we would rain down on the entire US. We'll be targeting 5-10 local dispensaries with this promotion to test its efficacy. Even then, we're going to be starting with a small number of units - the specific amount of which has not yet been determined. It will be less than a few hundred dollars each initially, though. Second, these dispensaries are not going to have immediate access to or understanding of how to go openly sell these on the market, as this is not a space they're very familiar with. Which leads to point number three, and most importantly for you. You're assuming we are going to hand out the tokes for this promotional offer and simply let the dispensaries turn around and re-sell them. Our actual plan here would be to support that promotion as a true 'company' cost and act as a repurchaser of the units used by the dispensaries. In that sense, there is no market impact as a result of these marketing efforts. We would bear the burden of paying those costs in order to foster initial relationships.  I do think it's important for me to emphasize here that this project is going to be unlike just about anything you've seen in the crypto ecosystem. We approach this more from a financial perspective than a technology one. Our actions are going to have token holders in mind, and we're going to be acting in your interest, not entirely our own. It's going to take many small steps to gain traction with the concept, but with dedicated and strategic execution, we can succeed here.",False

I'll respond to them in order:  1. To restate, we do have small scale experience with cultivation through medical licensing, but we'll certainly want to employ the appropriate specialists in the industry to ensure we can produce crops that meet or exceed industry expectations. If you review our funding objectives, full scale cannabis operations would be dependent on our highest tier of funding at $5MM USD. Assuming we reach this objective, we'll certainly be able to build a team of botanists and experts that can help us achieve that objective. For the lower tiers of funding, we're primarily going to be developing CBD and tourism based products that would be reliant on externally sourced cannabis from cultivation relationships.  2. The anonymity features are in development and might not be available on our initial launch of the token. However, our preference is to utilize a technology similar to crypto-notes like monero. We're also considering newer anon tech like zcash, but that would need to be significantly vetted before doing so. I also have concerns about the complete lack of accountability with the genesis block, so we're leaning towards crypto-note.  3. Our blockchain tech can ultimately be scalable world wide. There is nothing preventing us from having broad adoption, just like every other token tech out there. Our efforts will first be focused on Las Vegas, then to the US southwest, and ultimately the US states with legal cannabis as a whole. Depending on the progression of cannabis legalization worldwide, we'll be working to integrate in those cities, states, and countries as well.  4. We personally have not delivered a mobile app, but our team includes people who have. Tim Deneau will be lead on the mobile application development, with specialties in frontend and creative. He has at least 4 large projects in mobile development, including Audi's application. Additionally, I have conversations open with my brother, who is a lead designer with POSSIBLE mobile, based in Denver, CO. This is an aspect of our model I have no concerns about executing on.  5. I can't name names, but the partner dispensaries include locations already operating in Vegas, and 2 select locations in Oregon.  6. Again, can't go into specifics here, as this is a unique concept that will play out specifically in Las Vegas. Once we get business registrations and foundational groundwork laid, we'll release more information. Suffice to say, it is not specific to cultivation of cannabis, but does operate based on success of the industry.  7. Unfortunately, no ownership of the 'company' will be exchanged. This would be a clear violation of the SEC rules regarding unlicensed securities. We're operating our ICO in the same method as alternative coin technology. You could consider ownership of the tokes token to be an indirect proxy to owning a portion of the company though, since company profits will support the technology stack. However, no ownership, dividends, or other value will be provided directly to ICO investors. We execute a return of value to investors initially through our Tokes Repurchase Program, which involves tokes repurchases from the open market. We'll in turn use those repurchases to support marketing efforts with our industry partners (i.e. giveaways).",False

First, we plan on distributing a small number of tokes to our dispensary partners, who in turn can use those to attract new customers via tokes giveaways. This will attract new customers for the dispensary, gain exposure for the platform, and nurture business relationships.  2. Educational and tech support efforts to assist the dispensaries with the implementation of our technology.  3. I've alluded to the tourism business concept we're pursuing...this will tie directly into our business development efforts with industry partners.  4. Building out point of sale systems in the form of computer tablets that can run our application and facilitate tokes transactions.   Those are a few, to start.

Because Waves does not yet have this functionality built in, Waves contributions will not be managed under this escrow agreement, but held in trust directly by the Tokes Platform team.   edit: plus you should rethink your position check out the estimates for the growth of the cannabis industry.

We've had some great internal discussions on direction of the project as well as some early development on the mobile application.   Mobile Platform  The mobile platform is designed to serve as both a portable tokes wallet, as well as a database with various cannabis related nuggets of information. One of the big challenges we face, in cryptocurrency as a whole, but also within our project, will the the onramps/offramps between fiat currency and the digital currency. One advantage we see to building on top of the Waves Platform is the potential for fiat gateways to increase accessibility into digital assets. However, pending a delay on those gateways, I've already opened a discussion on how we can incorporate a direct bank-to-tokes transaction. We feel it will be incredibly important for the standard cannabis enthusiast to utilize the currency, without the need to go through the sometimes difficult road of acquiring btc, transferring to an exchange, and converting to tokes, just to be able to spend it at dispensaries. We are working through the technical components of getting cash to btc, but we feel we can easily facilitate the transfer to tokes using a partner app like shapeshift. Finally, we have some early development work on UX/UI being completed, and we're hopeful to release some mockups for this content in the next week.    Merchant Adoption  We've initiated conversations with all of the dispensaries local to us in Las Vegas to discuss the platform and early acceptance of tokes as a form of payment. We're seeing some mutual value due to the promotional benefits they could receive by signing on to the project, so we're optimistic on getting some agreements on early adoption. Part of this initiative is going to be assisting the dispensaries with accepting tokes, through both educational efforts as well as technological assistance. Our solution to the technology problem is a subsidy provided to those dispensaries that sign on to the project via a hardware package. With much broader adoption of tablet tech for POS systems, we plan on procuring a large supply of devices with the Tokes Platform app preloaded, which we can provide to the dispensaries free of charge. To this end, if you are a dispensary that would be interested in taking advantage of this offer, please reach out to me at michael@tokesplatform.org    Marketing  We're working on getting some additional press releases out, as well as cross promotion with Incent and Waves. We also just inked a deal with the folks at BraveNewCoin to enhance our exposure through their media outlets. Keep an eye out for some promotional materials to come from them. We still need to enhance our presence in both the crypto-space as well as exposure to cannabis enthusiasts. We're looking for some additional adoption on the social media campaigns as well. If you think you can help out in these areas, please reach out to TokesPlatform here on BCT with info.  We'll be providing project updates here as items develop. Thanks for all the support!  And finally, approximately 4 hours remaining on the 24 hour bonus period. Some great benefits to getting in at this stage.",False

Coupling this industry with the cutting edge technology of blockchain and digital assets offers various competitive advantages over current operations in the field. We do additionally have deep enthusiasm for cultivation and the rewarding nature that growing anything from seed to harvest can produce. We have some experience in the area, but more importantly, we have a robust network of entrepreneurs already operating in the field. We'll release more information on this as we become comfortable announcing those partnerships.  It's important to remember that we're undertaking a huge initiative here. Our objective is to create a tangible cannabis enterprise that supports the tokes platform and tokes digital currency. That's more than most cryptocurrency projects can claim. We need to be strategic in our utilization of human resources. Having a botanist on the team at this stage is not realistic. After funding and procurement of licenses and facilities we'll undertake team building. That would include bringing on any specialists necessary to facilitate the growth of our operation.

It might be a good idea to get the legal side of dividends sorted before the ICO starts. In the US where you are based this could be a particularly problematic issue for both Tokes and Token Holders. Different for many countries.  Additionally - some numbers on % split of profits to token holders vs Tokes entity is needed.  Investors need to have some idea of potential value/return. Is Tokes value pegged to USD? If so how can value rise?  So these dividends might be the main focus for any investor.  Equity - assume there is no equity in Tokes entity by token holders - state that clearly if so.

You're spot-on with respect to the dividends being potentially problematic due to financial regulations. For that reason, we're not considering direct dividend compensation until we can exercise a fully legal avenue to do so. However, that does not prevent us from utilizing a mechanism we're calling the Tokes Repurchase Program, in which we are allocating business profits to make open-market purchases of TOKES in support of the token.  Also for legal purposes, it's really difficult for us to specify an exact amount of profits dedicated to the repurchase. I can tell you that we've internally discussed 25-50% of net operating profits, but it's not something we can commit to steadfastly. Business operating cash flows and working capital requirements will be considered prior to making the open market purchases, but I can assure you that we intend to maximize our support of the platform.  You are correct that company ownership is not included with the purchase of TOKES - like all other digital asset ICOs. Selling ownership would likely be an SEC violation. Investors can expect a similar value proposition to that of other tokens, in that value is derived largely by supply and demand. We'll be driving value on both ends by accumulating supply and driving demand at retailers. The asset pegging mechanism will function similarly to BitUSD and BitShares, in that the peg will be an option asset to be used by the retailers who desire protection in the value of their holdings based on $USD.  We share your sentiment that it's incredibly important to be above-board and function under the letter of the law. It's the reason why we've formatting the ICO in the way that we have. Hope that alleviates some of your concerns...",False

I see now that the market price of Tokes is not pegged - just retailers who desire protection.  Additionally - buy back supports price and direct dividends in TOKES may be possible after you check legalities (they certainly would be in some jurisdictions).

Yes, that is correct.  2. Correct - we'll be paying all bounties, promotional, and marketing rewards out of the founder's share.  3. Unsold TOKES will go into a reserve account with a publicly-released wallet address. The rationale here is two-fold. First, we feel it's important to have this quantity of supply eventually available in the ecosystem, which argues against burning any unsold units. Secondly, project funding dictates that we ultimately sell the remaining units. What we will not do is dump these on the market. If at some point in the future we determine we need to undertake a secondary offering, we would release additional tranches of TOKES via off-market transactions (similar to AMP's secondary sale). It's also very possible, depending on business success, that we identify methods of releasing these into the market via giveaways or strategic alliances. The alliances are particularly appealing because they would enable us to enhance our overall competitiveness, further improve TOKES presence and demand, and recruit additional businesses to spread our message. This is great for every holder of TOKES.  4. We've touched on this briefly before, but I'll summarize here. Due to the nature of our multi-pronged approach, we have flexibility in our capital raise. In order to execute on the Cannabis Revolution terrestrial business, we need to raise approximately $250-$500K in USD-equivalent digital assets. The Tokes Platform, with very little overhead, can be executed with significantly less capital in the neighborhood of $50K. With that said, we have an entire backlog of innovative concepts we'd like to begin true development on following the ICO. For that reason, and because it drastically improves our chances of success, we're targeting a significantly larger capital raise of $5MM.   Thanks for the questions pugilist555.",False

I have a couple more:  1. Is $5 million the total cap for the ICO?  2. Just doing rough maths is not adding up and if you may kindly clear it. This is a hypothetical situation:  You mentioned 50m total supply. 2.5m of which is the dev fund so the total distribution is 47.5m Tokes.  Say if you have a very successful lauch and collect 6849.31 btc (ico objective $5 mn - @ btc = $730 each) on Day 1.  Based on your day 1 price 7500 tokes/btc the total you will have to sell is 51.37m tokes (6849.31*7500) but the total available for distribution is 47.5m.  Am I correct or have i calculated incorrectly? This situation can get far worse if btc price drops to $700.,False

There is no hard cap on the ICO outside of the 47.5MM units for sale.  2. Your math is essentially correct. There are many variables out of our control, i.e. btc/usd rate and the time at which people purchase tokes in the ICO structure, so we're not trying to raise exactly $5MM. However, given current exchange rate, and in the hypothetical scenario in which we sell out completely on day 1 because of the significant bonus, we would raise 6,333 btc, or roughly $4.6MM. While that is half-million off target, given time value of money and our ability to immediately go to work, it's acceptable. The more likely scenario is that we sell out throughout the campaign, with the majority of investment coming in at the beginning and end of the ICO (based on our observations of other ICOs).",False

Yes. We're utilizing a 3-party mutli-sig wallet with two independent third-party signatories. The escrow signatories include, Fran Strajnar - Co-Founder and CEO of Brave New Coin, and Collin Crypto - the second highest ranked escrow on BitRated.com. All bitcoin contributions and altcoin contributions processed through our shapeshift plugin will be managed under this escrow. Because Waves does not yet have this functionality built in, Waves contributions will not be managed under this escrow agreement, but held in trust directly by the Tokes Platform team.  Q: How do I register for your Slack channel?  Use the following link to begin registration: Slack Registration  Q: What is the distribution of ICO funds?  What is being budgeted for license acquisition versus business infrastructure or platform development?   This is nearly impossible to determine until we have a solid estimate of total ICO proceeds. License acquisition can be relatively inexpensive, with the demonstration of a business plan and $250K-$500K in liquid assets. These figures can change depending on the state's new requirements, but it is a solid baseline. The licenses are technically the smallest component of the budget. Locating a facility and outfitting it with the necessary equipment to undertake our objective will be a larger portion of funding. Again, our ambition here will be limited only by our capital raised. We cannot guarantee a specific return to investors, as that would very likely violate a law in some capacity.   Q: How soon until the mobile and point of sale applications are developed utilizing TOKES?   Software development will begin at ICO close, we expect a mobile app with transactional capability will live in Spring of 2017, with more features being added shortly thereafter.   Q: Is there a minimum ICO target?  What happens to the funds if minimum is not reached or licensing is not obtained?  We do not currently have a minimum on the ICO, as we can continue work on the TOKES Platform with relatively low overhead. However, coupling our platform with the business operation offers tremendous opportunity for TOKES holders through market buybacks facilitated with the business revenue.   Q: What is your contingency should regulations allow cannabis banking operations to occur? What happens to your value proposition? What are the risks to your business model that you have identified?   Given the current political environment and status of state legalization, we don't project legalization at the federal level for at least a decade. Probably two. We expect our platform to be well ingrained in the industry by that point. Also, to reiterate specifics from the whitepaper, we are preparing for more than strictly a digital currency. There are going to be numerous features built out in time that will provide value to users.   With the revenue stream generated from the cannabis business we are proposing, even in the off chance that banking regulations upon growers/dispensaries soften, there will still be value to holding TOKES in the quarterly buyback program we are offering.   Q: What about the other cannabis coins already out there?  Why is this different?   Simply put, we have a superior platform to the digital assets currently out there, and we believe we will execute with greater success than the alternatives. Not to be overly critical, but given the length of time that the other coins have been functioning, they have seriously disappointing results. We have a strong team and solid concept, and we've already laid the groundwork for our initiative within the industry.  Also, our core business will be in Las Vegas, NV, where recreational cannabis just passed via ballot measure.  It is highly likely Vegas will be THE cannabis destination in the United States, and we intend to capitalize on that.  Q: What happens to the TOKES that are not sold?   In the event that we hit only a portion of our target, unsold TOKES will go into a reserve account with a publicly-released wallet address. The rationale here is two-fold. First, we feel it's important to have this quantity of supply eventually available in the ecosystem, which argues against burning any unsold units. Secondly, project funding dictates that we ultimately sell the remaining units. What we will not do is dump these on the market. If at some point in the future we determine we need to undertake a secondary offering, we would release additional tranches of TOKES via off-market transactions (similar to AMP's secondary sale).  Q: Why can't cannabis dispensaries and customers simply use bitcoin or another cryptocurrency to transact? Why should they use TOKES?   Adoption is a large factor here.  No teams within the crypto ecosystem are currently facilitating the relationships necessary to entice dispensaries to accept cryptocurrency.  Part of our budget will be utilized to facilitate dispensary adoption.  If this requires us to physically install point of sale tablets running our application, even going out of pocket for the hardware, then that's what we will do.  We are also planning a first-time user promotions (i.e., a free gram for your first TOKES purchase at any qualified dispensary, much like Lyft's $50 first ride credits).  Second, we are offering asset pegging, which allows the dispensaries to retain the fiat value of their transactions.  This is something not offered by bitcoin, and while coins like Bitshares offer this function, it currently does not exist in a form that facilitates easy pegging from the point of sale side.  We are going to implement a user-friendly access point within the point of sale application to peg any incoming funds.",False

The first is the development of a terrestrial business entity that will generate consistent capital and allow us to repurchase TOKES on the open exchanges.  Anonimity and a functional mobile platform are an added benefit.  This isn't just some simple mineable scrypt coin in fancy packaging.  We're in Las Vegas, NV, which recently passed recreational pot, and sandwiched between two other states with legal recreational cannabis.  As such we will have significant partnering with business for point of sale systems utilizing TOKES.  We feel our execution of this initiative will be superior to that of similar offerings in the marketplace.",False

That's a good question, and it's important that we clarify here. We're working with Incent and utilizing their ICO management portal, but the Tokes Platform is a completely separate project. Our ICO starts on December 2nd and runs through January 15, 2017. This is completely independent of Incent's ICO timeline.  Hope that helps!",False

While the process is relatively straightforward, in terms of applying with the state and demonstrating a feasible business plan, all individuals interested in entering the business right now are forced to acquire licenses by purchasing another business listed for sale. With recreational use passing in the state of Nevada in the last election, we're eagerly anticipating a new set of guidelines to be released for recreational applications. Timing of the ICO is (semi-coincidentally) closely aligned with what we foresee to be the recreational application process. We do know that current medical business license holders will have the first opportunity to apply for recreational licenses.  While acquiring licenses via a business acquisition is not our ideal method of execution, it's a strategy we've not ruled out. We'll await the state's release of recreation license application guidelines to make a determination in that regard. As a fallback, we do have close connections in the industry who are already operating with full cultivation, production, and dispensary licenses. We have loosely discussed an alliance with them in which we can create and market the products that are already in development. We're not going to be able to disclose those partners' identities or business name at this time.  I do want to point out that while the business model is an integral component of our project, we'll be developing the Tokes Platform and digital asset independently of the cannabis operations, so TOKES holders can expect to see progression on both fronts simultaneously, but likely at different intervals.",False
