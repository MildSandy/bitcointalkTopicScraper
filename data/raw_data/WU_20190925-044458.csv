Vladimir has recently started to work with WULET and is closely working on smart contracts implementation. We asked him a couple of questions on the integration and here is what we found out. Hey Vladimir! We are very excited to have you as a part of WULET! Welcome on board! Hi! I am very excited to work with WULET and help with the technical part. Together we will definitely do something big for the community. True! So, as a smart contract guru, please, tell us what‚Äôs going on this side in the WULET platform in particular? I probably won‚Äôt tell you anything new, but WULET needs some stable and smooth operation in order to function properly, so it is necessary for the smart contract to work as determined and independent as possible, not depending on the external blockchain world. It is needed for the consistency of the operations on the blockchain and also it significantly influences the speed of the block formation. It is a tricky task for the smart contract to send direct request to any outside web course, this is where Oracles come into hand. They are so-called ‚Äòconnecters‚Äô between a smart contract and the outside world for obtaining external information. Such services track events from the certain blockchain contracts, and in the event of a special request, the information will be carefully sampled and transferred to the contract using a standard blockchain transaction. The contract itself is ‚Äòsmart‚Äô enough to determine the timing when the data is needed. This action is divided into two separate transactions: a transaction that initiates a data request (can be created both by the client and another contract), and a transaction that returns data to the contract (initiated by the oraclize service). All external modules of the WULET platform work in the same way: they scan network blocks, detect events, react to them, execute logic outside the blockchain, and then enter data into the blockchain through the transaction (if required). Thanks for the explanation, Vladimir! We hope to see you soon!

But do you know that the term ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù was first used in the United States to describe a financial crisis in 1869?  Interesting fact: the first time Black Friday referred to shopping the day after Thanksgiving was in 1961 via a Philadelphia Police Department newsletter to keep shoppers from flooding the roadways to get to retail shops in the downtown area.  But in the past few years, Black Friday has extended well beyond and prior to the Friday after Thanksgiving. In many cases, it starts in early November and travels on until right before the big day.

At the beginning of November, we arrived in Malta‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa nice, warm place by the sea with a big event taking place called ‚ÄòMalta Blockchain Summit‚Äô. It all started so promisingly: VIP speakers, an exhibit show and an attractive heading on the website, calling Malta ‚ÄòThe Blockchain Island‚Äô.  The event was supported by CoinTelegraph, CrunchBase and CryptoCompare, which definitely added weight to the seriousness of the event.  The Summit held 8,500+ attendees (they promise to increase the number next year), including Scott Stornetta, John McAfee, and even Hon. Joseph Muscat, the Maltese Prime Minister. There were 200+ blockchain geeks participating in a Hackathon at the venue, competing for a total prize of ‚Ç¨50,000, and Sophia, the Bot, was a central figure of attraction‚Ä¶  The speakers included some well-known names, such as Cristopher Obereder, Carla Maree Vella, Eva Kaili, James Catania, Max Krupyshev, Gordon Einstein, Alex Lightman, Joseph Cuschieri, and many more. Despite the calibre of speakers and robots, the exhibition area (the place that we had high hopes for) was so tightly packed with teams and their booths that it was very hard to move around and do some networking.  It all went ahead as planned, but sometimes things just spiralled out of control. It would be unfair to compare the Malta Blockchain Summit with the Las Vegas event, but we have to admit it was on the chaotic side of the road. It was strangely arranged, too busy, and the meetings they organized were with investors that no one knew about. We hope that they will make a good showing in the crypto world in future, but from our side, we neither benefited from the Summit, nor did we secure any new partnerships for WULET.

Whether it‚Äôs a new toothbrush or a bus pass, we are always driven by the need to buy something. It‚Äôs inevitable that this lifestyle leads to incredible waste. Did you know that the average person creates 1 kg of waste a day?  Companies are motivated to create loyalty programs to differentiate themselves in the market, and to collect data about their consumers. But if a company doesn‚Äôt want their consumer to forget about them, they have to leave them with a piece of paper or plastic. Even if you aren‚Äôt a shopaholic, I bet your wallet is stuffed with discount cards, loyalty cards, and cards with little holes punched in them working towards your next coffee. Let‚Äôs be honest, how often do you really remember to use that piece of plastic or paper lost in your wallet? I know you fear that one day you‚Äôll need to buy kitty litter (not that you own a cat) and you won‚Äôt have that pet store card with you, or you‚Äôll decide to bring your grandma flowers and you‚Äôll miss out on that half-off deal coupon you saw in the Sunday paper. But is it really necessary to contribute to this waste? Over 2.4 million trees are cut down each day to support the paper industry, and plastic takes 500-1000 years to decompose! Let‚Äôs stop creating more waste!  Thankfully, Wulet is one step ahead. And the beauty of Wulet is that it not only helps reduce physical waste, it also minimizes financial waste. Maybe you were an avid coffee drinker, decided to quit, and now feel like all those reward points are useless. But what if you could help kick your caffeine habit by using those points to buy juice at the supermarket? Or imagine you had saved up thousands of points by buying gas, but decided to go green and buy a bicycle? The Wulet exchange allows you to do all of that, by not only storing your cards in one easy app, but also providing you with the opportunity to exchange points from one program to the other momentarily and with incredible ease!  Wulet will revolutionize how you shop and help you to make the most of your resources. Wulet is a company committed to helping the consumer maximize the purchasing power of their reward points and minimize the time and resources spent trying to accomplish that goal. Since we are all consumers, this is a hefty task. Wulet aims to compile all loyalty programs in one app on your smartphone. Not only can you access your loyalty points anywhere, you can also exchange them before they expire and put them towards other purchases which are more relevant to you. Each point can be converted into WU-tokens, or else exchanged directly to use as currency in store of your choice.

Hello there! My name is Alex and I am the CTO of Wulet. I know that using blockchain is a trendy thing nowadays because not only is it a technology of the future, but it also raises project prices in the eyes of investors. What I‚Äôm trying to say here is that projects often lack the argumentation of why they need blockchain for their integration, except for launching an ICO and collecting funds. Here at Wulet, we are sharp and transparent with our statements and are always willing to talk openly about our goals, values and development process. Let me explain to you why we, at Wulet, decided to stick to blockchain as the basis of decentralized solutions. Loyalty programs are usually referred to cash back, bonuses, points etc. However, as the payments and withdrawals stay low, a large amount (40%) of bonuses remain unused while users are not even aware about the existence of bonus calculation ‚Äì not to mention the fact that most of the services are centralized and are subject to shut down at any time. User data is usually stored in a database, while bonus balances, the timing of their burning and accrual history are not available, and users only have limited access to them. All of this leads to a bad UX/UI for the end user who cannot monitor their balance and use their loyalty points efficiently. Working with the gaps in the market niche makes Wulet an innovator in the industry. Not only do we aim to create a decentralized ecosystem of loyalty points, but we have also set our minds on making all loyalty points tradable, as WU-token acts as a universal measure for all loyalty points. WU-token is compatible with the standard EOS token and can be traded on external exchanges. We are about to bring loyalty programs to the next level with cryptocurrencies, decentralization, better service and convenient UX/UI. Loyalty programs will be more accessible, tradable, and user-friendly. This will be implemented with the help of our dedicated team and an EOS-based backend. Join our token sale to improve the loyalty program industry with the help of blockchain!

In previous posts we mentioned that the Wulet team was pondering existing blockchain platforms that could be the most efficient and beneficial for our crypto project. Here are 7 reasons why we decided to stick with EOS blockchain:        Speed. EOS blockchain can already proceed up to 5000 transactions per second. In the near future, this value will increase 10 fold. Moreover, the network infrastructure will allow users to scale it up to a million transactions per second. In addition, EOS supports asynchronous communications and the separation of authentication from execution. For the EOS approach, it is standard to make interactions among smart contracts, moduled through messages in transactions. It also eases the process significantly.        Cost. EOS is cheap. Compared to QTUM, where the transaction of QRC20-tokens will cost around $7 for just one token transfer, the transaction fee on EOS could be as low as $1.        Long-standing on the market, EOS was founded in 2017 and launched its open-source software on June 1st, 2018. When we were deciding on a blockchain platform for building Wulet, we looked into Radix: promising up to 1 000 000 transactions per second and functioning on PoS and EMV algorithms, it looked like the blockchain of our dreams. However, Radix platform had not yet been launched, so we had to stick with EOS.        Decentralization. Unlike NEM, EOS blockchain is fully decentralized. NEM was rejected by our team because of its centralized nature: NEM smart contracts are deployed outside of the blockchain which reduces decentralization and leads to a decrease in security level.        Flexibility. If an error is found in the EOS application, the block manufacturers can freeze it for a while until the error is fixed. The code can then be updated without any other network applications‚Äô forks or stops getting in the way. In addition, EOS allows the node not to have the entire block - only the data that is needed.        Usability. EOS includes a set of web tools for developing interfaces and database schemes, as well as a declarative permissions scheme that allows users to easily delegate permissions to other accounts.        Management. EOS is an open-source platform that is built for its users‚Äô freedom and trust. Token holders can choose block manufacturers, which increases the degree of mutual trust. Disputes are resolved by a majority vote.  So, we sat down, compared a couple of platforms and came to a conclusion that these 7 reasons are just enough for choosing EOS. More of that can be found in our Whitepaper.

Hey, I‚Äôm Leonid, the CFO of Wulet. Today, I want to talk about the financial part of the Wulet product.   I want to be clear about our token model, trading and exchanging. Let me tell you more about our Internal Exchange, which forms a crucial part of the Wulet ecosystem. I will quickly take you through main peculiarities of the Internal Exchange: tokens, trading, commission, and the exchange process.  The WULET Exchange is made specifically for buying and selling loyalty program points that can be transferred to the platform. External loyalty points can also be connected through the gateway.  The Exchange provides a set of mechanisms that are standard for exchange software, but also specific for loyalty tokens: the purchase and sale of loyalty tokens on the market and the limit orders issue.  The Exchange is basically a contract that works as an indirect exchange of loyalty tokens between their holders. It allows the token holder to put their assets on the stock exchange and withdraw loyalty tokens. Partners (owners of tokens) are allowed to release loyalty tokens on a stock exchange and establish restrictions on exchange pairs. In this case, the exchange of one type of token to another is realized through an intermediate exchange for the WU token.  The WU token is fully compatible with EOS and makes the Internal Exchange operation possible. Due to this compatibility, the WU token can be traded on external exchanges. The maximum emission of a token is equal to the emission launched on the Ethereum platform and distributed within the ICO.  In order to convert tokens to a currency other than Ethereum, you‚Äôll need to release the tokens via an oracle. This is possible within the WU token function and the Wulet ecosystem. The exchanged amount must be equivalent to the tokens blocked in the Ethereum network.  The platform takes a commission of exactly 1% of the transaction amount (in the WU tokens). The commission is charged for both parties at either end of the transaction. The offered tokens and the commission stay ‚Äòfrozen‚Äô at the time of their offer placement. That means the user will not be able to use them until the offer is withdrawn as a result of the transaction, the offer is withdrawn by the user, or the offer expires.  These are the main points of Wulet Exchange‚Äôs economic model. You can find more info on the WU token and its distribution in the coming blog posts!

To highlight the gaps and issues in the market of loyalty programs, our team has made a thorough research. We now have a comprehensive picture of all the positive and negative aspects, so our project can be developed by gathering all these aspects together. We‚Äôll introduce you to the most significant researches (in our opinion), so you can deeply understand the current agenda that is happening on the loyalty market nowadays. The loyalty market has become very common, yet fragmented. This is reflected in low levels of engagement and redemption of customers. Modern LPs are inefficient, lacking in alternative offers or suggestions, but are excessive in points outside of the brand context. According to COLLOQUY Loyalty Census enrollment in loyalty programs across various industries in the US grew by more than 20% in just three years and has more than tripled since the turn of the century. It seems like customers are interested in joining. LPs, but are their expectations met? Only 22% of loyalty program members perceive their experience as positivecompared to non-member customers. At the same time, 87% of Americans are willing to have various details of their activity tracked by a brand in exchange for a more personalized and relevant relationship with the brand or program. Having this data on hand will help Wulet to better understand the target audience of a brand and enhance customer experience. We found out that changing strategy to meet customer expectations results in a 7.5x lift in member satisfaction. On top of that, attracting a new customer is a much more expensive process, than keeping an existing one, so companies need to pay as much attention to retention as they do to acquisition. Boosting customer retention rates by just 5% can increase profits by between 25% and 95%. In order to improve the industry if loyalty origrams, Wulet has to create a more relevant and timely experience by incorporating data science and using innovative techniques. We agree with. the authors of Deloitte‚Äôs research piece ‚ÄúMaking blockchain real for loyalty‚Äù, where they claim that new digital technology could be the unique solution. To change the strategy of LPs is a challenging task, but we are ready to meet with the difficulties along the way for bringing some outstanding decisions: a positive customer experience and the increase of engagement in loyalty programs.

Hi, I‚Äôm Alexander, CEO of the Wulet project. I am a true believer that in order for a project to prosper it is important to set up goals, develop concept and mission at the very beginning. Seems very generic, huh? Well, this important detail is not always transparent and obvious in a any project. Let me introduce you to our freshly made concepts and achievable goals.  The main mission of Wulet is simple ‚Äì to create new possibilities on the market for the users to collect and trade loyalty points freely and simply.  We are all familiar with cashback and loyalty programs. Time to bring it to crypto! With the Wulet ecosystem it will become easier to shift the points inside and gain mutual benefits both for the customers and the brands.  Wulet‚Äôs team strongly believes that traditional loyalty schemes need renovation, not only because of changing consumer expectations, but also because they have become expensive to run and difficult to adjust. Loyalty is the brand‚Äôs ability to be at the forefront of the customer‚Äôs mind, as well as to provide an ultimately pleasurable customer experience. This is much harder to achieve when every consumer has different expectations and responds to different triggers when it comes to engaging with a brand.  In order to achieve the explicit combination of pleasurable customer experience and loyalty for a brand, a detailed strategy needs to be developed, while taking into consideration such a crucial fact as the minimal amount of customer actions.  Grouping the two big factors: cryptocurrency and loyalty programs, Wulet brings a new wave into a developing blockchain market, while thoroughly thinking of the end users and delivering an explicit UX and UI. Not only it makes the clients to come back to the platform, but also encourages businesses to attract new customers while keeping the current clientele.  I hope, I made our vision nice and clear to you. Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me on Telegram and let‚Äôs bring crypto in the game of loyalty programs.  And join our Telegram chat @wulet_io  If you have any questions you can write to our Telegram channel: @wulet_io   You always can find detailed information on our website: wulet.io",False

The market value of loyalty points exceeds hundreds of billions. In the meantime, the amount of expired unredeemed points exceeds $100bn in North America only. Book value of loyalty points is about to reach $500bn in 2019.  The majority of loyalty programs (LP) are inefficient. Operational inefficiencies such as account inactivity, low redemption rates, low client retention rates and high acquisition costs are the main problems of loyalty programs. Programs are not compatible with each other. Customer activity is limited by offers of loyalty programs.  There is no technical opportunity to convert points of various loyalty programs to the points of other loyalty programs. The creation of a loyalty points exchange may be a solution to this problem and there are projects already that are moving in this direction. However, they have significant drawbacks, as some of them include a very limited number of bonus programs, some require the presence of all bonuses in a certain amount, some do not have a convenient interface, some do not have confidence from users.

Moreover, EOS supports asynchronised communications and the separation of authentication from execution. Flexibility.

Convenience. EOS includes a selection of web-instruments for the creation of interfaces, self-describing interfaces and database schemes, as well as declarative enabling circuits, which allows to easily delegate them to other accounts. Management. In EOS, tokenholders themselves choose block authors, which increases the level of trust. All conflicts are resolved by a majority vote.

The Wulet team strongly believes that traditional loyalty schemes need a rethink not only because of changing consumer expectations.

Loyalty provides an ultimately pleasurable customer experience. Although, such an experience is much harder to achieve when every consumer has different expectations and responds to different triggers when it comes to engaging with a brand.   Getting the customer experience right has become the differentiating factor for many successful business models.   With Wulet each company will have the right loyalty strategy which requires the minimum amount of actions from a customer and provide maximally joyful customer experience.
