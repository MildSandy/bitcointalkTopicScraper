With Oceanus Foundation we propose a comprehensive, industry wide, approach. We present the Oceanus Foundation to create and oversee development of a community within the shipping industry. The backbone of this work will be a blockchain and token that allow the industry to reinvest in itself and return value to actors who make significant contributions to the community and industry. Our Actions a.Trading platform for vessels bookings The OCEANUS Foundation will develop a decentralized booking platform that connects small and medium sized shipping business to clients actively seeking to fulfil shipping contracts. The OCEAN coin will be the currency that facilitates commerce on the platform. It will also form the basis of an innovation platform on which further technologies can be built A marketplace to match shipping offers and requests Freight Tracking Brokerage Logistics Dashboard b.Industry accelerator based in Piraeus Port A core responsibility of the OCEANUS Foundation will be to administer a venture fund supporting startups in the shipping, maritime and port technologies. The fund will provide dedicated expertise with experience across the shipping and maritime industries - to provide insight and support to new ventures. BTCTo encourage and support innovation in the shipping industry, the OCEANUS foundation will run regular Hackathons and provide innovation bounties. Hackathons will be conducted in collaboration with industry leaders and groups traditionally outside the maritime sphere.  The core of this initiative is the funding of an innovation hub in Estonia. Estonia was chosen for its startup friendly regulation, economy and labour market, along with friendliness to cryptocurrencies and blockchain innovation. The technical arm of the foundation will be funded to provide bounties to encourage developers to solve key problems for and improve key aspects of maritime technical infrastructure. d.Seafarer Academy Based in Piraeus the OCEANUS Seafarer academy will set new standards in Seafarer training and assessment. Practical training courses will contain shipboard, shipyard and dockside training. Programs will be designed and conducted in collaboration with shipping, harbour and equipment providers to ensure practical and up to date training for the world’s seafaring workforce.  Tuition at the Seafarer Academy will be paid in OCEANUS tokens. This is a unique industry self-supported model. This model is central to the concept of the coin and institute - using industry activity to invest back into the industry.  In combination with the OCEANUS Maritime Institute the academy will implement and assess new standards and best practices in shipping. This will provide marketable skills to seafarers and a skilled and capable workforce for the industry. e.Seafarer Insurance Company The largest component of these welfare programs will be the establishment of a seafarer's insurance cooperative. Seafarers deserve the same care and concern, the same right to benefits, the same access to the best medical treatment, the same security expected and enjoyed by those who work ashore. This is the vision that has inspired Oceanus Foundation.  For too long the tough life of the seafarer has gone unnoticed. This is slowly changing. Legislation is bringing reform and improvements to working conditions, and Oceanus Foundation Insurance will support this moment in a tangible way. Oceanus Marine Insurance is a single insurance policy embracing today’s needs and benefits; personal to the seafarer, yet paid by the employer. A seafarer’s insurance can, finally, match that of the shoreside employee.  Already in development, from the outset collaboration with the Maritime Community has been fundamental to Oceanus Marine Insurance’s development. Discussion with representatives of both employers and employees has engendered enthusiasm and support, and the collegiate approach will continue to underpin Oceanus Marine Insurance’s future growth.  We will develop Insurance products that recognise the needs, concerns and differing legal requirements of seafarers and from those who serve in the commercial shipping community and those aboard pleasure yachts. f.Maritime, Shipping, Port Studies College in Piraeus Greece Degree and post-graduate courses in all aspects of the maritime and shipping industries. Particular focus on new technologies and maritime law.  The foundation will also provide scholarships and financial support for students wishing to undertake studies in the area. This will help provide a diverse and skilled workforce for the industry for the future. As with the Seafarer Academy, tuition will be charged in OCEANUS tokens, supporting the industry from within.  Our intention here is not to compete with other cryptocurrencies and innovation groups in this space. Rather we intend to cooperate wherever possible to produce the best outcomes for the industry. We also understand the size of this project, and the incumbent issues it faces. We are confident that what we propose here can be the first mile across this ocean.
