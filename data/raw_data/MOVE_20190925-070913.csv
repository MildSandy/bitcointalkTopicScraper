Some of the messages that our team received were not as nice, unfortunately, and we received some straight up threats from several community members. The most distressing one was:  Quote from: cryptastic on November 16, 2017, 02:28:06 AM Hi there mr. ""SmokeMcPay"",  I bring you some unfortunate news today, the game is over.  You have done a great job in producing the narrative for your project, it's a shame that you have been sloppy in quite a few regards. I was waiting for confirmation but I have just received several sets of evidence that will undisputely dispel the honesty within the foundations of your project. It's good to have friends in different sectors  I must say, you have been ambitious in setting this up, at least I will give you props for that.  To my disposal are several crypto related Youtube accounts ranging from 1K to 20K subscribers. Next to this, I am in contact with a 80K subscriber Youtuber. And if this isn't enough, I have an insider group on Bitcointalk that will absolutely stampede your project into the ground. Together we range just over 200 accounts (Full member -> Legendary) and I am certain you do not want to experience what we are capable of. Although just one account should be more than enough to put the definite nail in the coffin.  As of now, you have 3 options:  1. Discard your project, explain how you have ran into a few major bumps along the road and you can not continue the project at this point in time. It is still early days, there is no need to incriminate yourself over a few bad decisions.  2. Continue the project, act as if everything is smooth sailing and come to grips with how your life, offline and online, can change in an instant.  3. Pay the amount of 1.337 BTC to 3NUvk6B82VzDCxwxK57zu3jPiMp5taSmXy and regain a second chance in making this project a success. There will be no further actions, doxing or consequences, all plays set in motion will be scrapped.  Consider this your one and only warning.  Since these options might cost you some time to consider or prepare for, you have until Friday 6:00 AM PST to make your decision. I hope you do not make the wrong one.  Should you choose option 3, the amount is expected to be received no later than Friday 10:00 AM PST. Should you fail to comply, Option 2 will come into effect.  Sincerly, c0mrade127  It seems like the ""gentleman"" is so frustrated that we completely ignored his ""offer"" in addition to what 1.337 BTC cost on November 16th and what they cost now, that he deemed it most urgent to start spreading fud about our project. All of our files are hosted on AWS S3 (Amazon Cloud Storage), we're also using their CDN - CloudFront, and we use an AWS Lambda Function for several other mechanisms in our ICO. In other words, we have a fully functional AWS account that requires confirmation through a phone number, id and a credit card.  Even after this post had been made, the ""respectable gentleman"" made another ""offer"":  Quote from: cryptastic on December 15, 2017, 03:05:43 AM I am sure you have read my messages. It's a shame you don't listen.  You can pay the 1.337 BTC to 3NUvk6B82VzDCxwxK57zu3jPiMp5taSmXy  We did an extensive work with the Russian ICO advising companies, ICO marketing firms and Eastern Europe hosting solutions. Given how many successful and transparent ICOs come from Russia and Eastern Europe in general and their cheap service costs it seems like a better deal to us than paying for artwork, marketing and server in the United States. I'm not surprised that some of the graphics have Russian symbols in the file descriptors due to the fact that these graphics resources were ordered from a Russian company.  To sum it up: A regular FRAUDSTER demanding money decided to start spreading angry fud news about this project after we had IGNORED his threat. I do not see how any of the information that cryptastic posted shows us in any bad light.",True

It is supported by the price of an existing asset.  Second, manufacturers and sellers will not receive RUN coins, you're right. RUN coin is just an internal mechanism for calculating physical activity and claiming rewards. We expect the main revenue source to come from the ads and monetizing huge userbase, the way facebook, twitter, Spotify, etc do. After you spend RUN coins in the store they are basically ""burnt"" which will prevent a RUN coin inflation.

MOVE token can be traded, sold and trasfered on the Ethereum network. During the crowdsale participants will receive MOVE tokens to the wallets they contributed from. The number of tokens is limited by the smart-contract. There will be a certain amount of RUN coins deployed daily that would be allocated between users according to their stakes (amount of MOVE Tokens). MOVE token will raise in price proportionally to the number of platform users. The more people use the platform the more demand to buy MOVE there would be.

The idea is that when accelerometer and gyroscope register some number of steps we want to use GPS to verify that the person has actually moved. Let's say you made 10 steps, it would be reasonable to check that your distance changed by 10-30 feet.  So the answer to your question would be: ""Yes we use GPS but not as a step recognition mechanism but as a verification mechanism"".

First of all it is important to state that Mangocoin does no longer exist. It launched in 2014 and was closed by 2016. Because of that we had no chance to study their system properly. We can declare some issues they faced with, though: Since it was launched 3 years ago they faced with some difficulties such as wide ability to deceive smartphones sensors as well as high technical requirements to a smartphone (Mango app needed at least 1GB of free space on your smartphone device) which wasnâ€™t too much but still a lot for the smartphone with total amount of 16GB memory or even less.  We could state that Mango project proved that such system could work and attract a lot of interest. The difficulties that the project faced are no longer a problem so we will do our best to succeed.",True

The only concern that government could have with this project is the financial aspect, I agree. However, we can only be talking about the financial aspect when an individual ""cashes out"", in other words, converts the cryptocurrency into fiat money. Any transaction of cryptocurrency inside the decentrilized application is usually outside the interests of the government in a practical and legal sense. For example, you bought MOVE tokens for 10$ and sold them for 15$. 5$ would be your income and in the United States, it is considered to be a taxable event. To be more precise, we should use such term as the ""Short Term Capital Gain"" (I'm sure that anyone who sold a considerable amount of crypto in the US heard about this). After you pay the tax on the Short Term Capital Gain to the government of your residency, citizenship or the governing entity that you're considered to be a taxable subject to, your financial obligation with the government is generally considered to be satisfied.  Now in more common terms: Pay taxes, when you cash out into dollars, euros or whatever your currency is and GENERALLY you will be fine.  However, I should put a disclaimer that this might not apply around the world and am mostly speaking from the perspective of US citizens/residents. One should consult with the financial lawyer in one's home country to get a more concrete answer. I'm not giving a legal advice here.",True

RUN coin is unlimited and the daily created amount is regulated by the revenue generated by the project daily, it is also distributed among the runners/people who exercise. The amount of RUN coin each person receives depends on their stake, that is where the Proof Of Stake comes into play. MOVE tokens act as proof of stake and are designed to give investors the leverage/advantage across. MOVE tokens are the ones that are offered to investors during the PRE-ICO and ICO.

I want to clarify that our model is very similar to a pretty popular blockchain project called NEO (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/neo/). NEO currency is used as a PoS for generating GAS (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/gas/). Gas, on the other hand, is used only inside NEO network to power the transactions and reward the miners.  In our particular case, MOVE is similar to NEO in a sense it is used to generate RUN and creates the investment potential.  RUN coins are bounded by the ecosystem of the project. The more people come, the more revenue we will generate in the Movement Sports Store and ads, the more coins the platform will give away to the public. If you're concerned from the investment angle, don't be. Supply of MOVE tokens is FIXED and in fact, will deflate slightly after the ICO (we're going to burn the rest of tokens from PRE-ICO, ICO and BONUSES funds).  I hope my response makes sense to you.",True

Initially, we're planning to span the mobile devices and smartwatches because those have pretty well-established libraries and APIs. But I had a private conversation with one of the investors who were interested in such things as Fitbit, smart treadmill, hell, even smart dumbbells (if you have ever been to the Google office in Mountain View, you know what I mean - https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/15/smart-dumbbells/).

The monetization comes from building up the user base, applying targetted advertisements and revenue from the inApp store. Let me clarify, as more users use our app the more advertisement funds will be earned daily. These funds will be used to reward the people running and exercising with the focus on PoS rewards for early investors.",True

It is an area of active research (http://www.cis.fordham.edu/wisdm/includes/files/sensorKDD-2010.pdf) but current technologies allow either already established frameworks such as CoreMotion (from Apple) or low-level custom sensor data. Please note that the research article that I referred to is from 2010, the time at which iPhones couldn't even dream about counting steps, nowadays (almost 8 years later) CoreMotion is so advanced that it combines data from all the possible sensors + gps, which makes incredibly hard or unpractical to deceive such system.

The coins that user generate while using theis apps could only be spent on in-app store. None of these apps use ERC20 Token or any token at all. Their currency could not be traded into fiat money or any other crypto. (Runister use PayPal, their issues are described in detail in our WP). We did analysis of these projects and provided detailed information in our Whitepaper. This is the main benefit of the Movement App, because we consider that  there is a great potential of using Ethereum blockchain for creating a comprehensive economic environment which will allow users to have FULL control of their tokens.

This thread describes how we use blockchain technology and smart contracts to implement economic dimension to the Movement App that motivates users to workout or to use walking as a main mode of transportation. From now, all the time that people spend for running, jogging or even walking to work/classes and back home will become profitable.     Every registered user will be given a wallet inside the Movement App. All the data, as well as earned coins and purchased tokens, will be safely secured in it. The user will be able to operate with the wallet via smart-contract. Wallet will also show the real-life exchange rate and give the user the ability to exchange RUN coins into MOVE Tokens.  As could be seen from the scheme above, the system will have the following operation principle:  As user runs, jogs, walks and beats the distance RUN coins are being added to his account in real-time. The number of coins rewarded depends on several factors such as total distance, time spent, calories burnt (if synchronized with apps with such calculating functions) and the amount of MOVE Tokens in usersâ€™ wallet.  The main feature of MOVE Tokens in Movement Economic System is to form an efficiency multiplier and serve as a bonus coefficient applied to the amount of RUN coins rewarded by the Movementâ„¢ App API.  Movement App will support Smart Watch technology as well as integration with all most popular smart accessories and apps for sports and health & activity tracking such as Fitbit, Google Fit, Apple Watch, Apple Health Kit, etc.  Gained RUN coins could be spent at in-app shop or exchanged for MOVE Tokens.  EXAMPLE: USER 'A' HAS 0 MOVE TOKENS IN MOVEMENTTM WALLET SO THE COINS MULTIPLIER IS x0. USER â€˜Aâ€™ BEATS THE DISTANCE OF 1km AND GETS REWARDED WITH 100 RUN COINS. USER â€˜Bâ€™ HAS 1 MOVE TOKEN IN MOVEMENTTM WALLET SO THE MULTIPLIER IS x0.5. USER â€˜Bâ€™ BEATS THE DISTANCE OF 1km AND GETS 150 RUN COINS FOR IT. *all the numbers stated are arbitrary                  International  Russian ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2385627.0 Filipino ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2400944 Spanish ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2414274 Indonesian ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2419109.0 Italian ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2419494.0 French ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2485890.new#new Portuguese ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2488347.0 Dutch ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2409012.0 German ANN Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2444983.0   FAQ  What is Movement App? MOVEMENT â€“ is a new ecosystem, where everyone would be able to get coins for beating the distance. It could be running, jogging or walking, outside or using a treadmill. Users will be able to spend their coins in Movement in-app Store by purchasing sports goods, sports nutrition, sportswear and online Fitness & Yoga courses. Or they could simply trade it into tokens and exchange it to any cryptocurrency or sell.  What differs Movement App from competitors? Movement App is the first decentralized fitness app that was developed by implementing blockchain technology & smart-contracts. It gave the ability to give a real-life value to in-app RUN coin, which was not achieved by competitors.  What is the difference between RUN coin & MOVE Token? RUN coin is and in-app currency that is given to users as a reward for beaten distance. It could be spent on in-app Store or exchanged to MOVE Tokens. MOVE Token is an ERC 20 Token which appears to be a part of the Ethereum Network, deployed & controlled via smart-contract. MOVE Tokens will act as an efficiency multiplier and serve as a bonus coefficient applied to the amount of RUN coins being rewarded. MOVE Tokens will be sold during pre-ICO and ICO phases.  Do I need to have MOVE Tokens to use the App? No, you can simply download the app, sign up and start running or walking, RUN coins will be automatically added to your in-app wallet. MOVE Tokens act as efficiency multiplier and give bonus coefficient to the amount of RUN coins. Itâ€™s very simple: the more MOVE Tokens you have â€“ the more RUN coins you get.  How do you prevent cheating? Weâ€™ve developed a security and anti-fraud system that has the following features: 1. It uses all the sensors of the smartphone such as accelerometer, pedometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, GPS etc. to form a unique signature of walking or running pattern and improve the accuracy. 2. Automatically compares the data of all users to reveal suspicious activity. Full description of the system is available in the Whitepaper and here  Why invest in Movement App? - MOVE Tokens at a price that is way lower than the potential market price after the token sale and listings. - Early-access to the Movement App for Alpha & Beta - Tests - The unique economic system that was developed by our team has a potential to become a basis for a new â€˜mining rushâ€™ which causes rapid price grow. - Ability to participate in discussion with developers about improvements in platforms performance. - Due to popularity of running as a sport & walking as a main mode of transportation, the App has a potential to grow a large audience in a short period of time. That will stimulate Token value.  What currencies are accepted during pre-ICO and ICO phases? Pre-ICO phase â€“ ETH, BTC, LTC. ICO phase â€“ ETH, BTC, LTC, BCH",True

We did in depth market research and included it to our Whitepaper. I am going to quote this section of the Whitepaper below for you to easily study it:  Quote In this this section of the whitepaper we are going to review the main market participants and the potential competitors of the Movement App. It is very important to mention that the Movement App will be the only platform it this segment to use a blockchain technology and smart-contract.  Sweatcoin Platform was released in 2016 and now holding the top 5 positions in AppStore & Google Play in Health & Sports section in US Store. The App has a 4+ rating and supports Apple Watch. This platform was one of the first to get rewards by counting steps, but the platform does not offer any chance to transfer generated coins into fiat money. The only way to use in-app coin is to spend it on the in-app shop, where the range of goods is short. This platform is only available in USA, Great Britain and Ireland.   Sweatcoin Advantage: - Already working product with over 1mil. downloads - 4+ rating in AppStore & Google Play - Smart Watch support - Well supported by development team (last update 28 September 2017) - Ability to spend your coins on charity Sweatcoin Disadvantage: - No real economic system which has real-life value. The only way to spend coins - is an in-app shop, where range of goods is very short. - Servers and technologies of Sweatcoin Platform are centralized and have a full control over database and coins. - Available only in (USA, Great Britain and Ireland) - GPS and accelerator are the only technologies used platform that calculate and control the number of generated coins, that means that coins could only be earned during a real outdoors walk with no chance to use treadmill etc. - No ability to convert generated coins into fiat money or other coins with real-life value. - Only English language supported.  Runister â€“ a platform that provides a service that rewards runners with real money using PayPal account. The platform was launched in 2016 and has 4 rating in AppStore. It does not support any type of smart watch. To use Runister, user should always be ready to participate in short surveys and to agree with data processing. Runister Advantage: - Fiat money payments. - Convenient software with handy interface. - Supports a wide variety of languages (English, Spanish, Slovak) - Well supported by development team (Last update 18 September 2017)   Runister Disadvantage: - The only way to withdraw funds â€“ is PayPal account which makes it uncomfortable for a big number of users due to a specific withdrawal PayPal rules for some countries. - Servers and technologies of Runister Platform are centralized and have a full control over database and coins. - Does not support Smart Watch. - Need to participate in surveys to use the app for free. - Need to give the agreement for data usage and processing about usersâ€™ health status etc. - If user denies participating in surveys and does not agree with personal data usage the app is only available for $4.99/month. - Too much negative responses from users which state withdrawal problems. - GPS and accelerator are the only technologies used platform that calculate and control the number of generated coins, that means that coins could only be earned during a real outdoors walk with no chance to use treadmill etc.  It is also very important to mention that we are developing a unique economic system at the moment that will be used for calculating rewards as well. This economic model is well described in current Thread by the scheme and the description of it.  Regards.",True
