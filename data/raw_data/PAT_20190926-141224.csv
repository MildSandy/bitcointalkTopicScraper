That is why brands and companies increase their expenses on digital marketing. For ads, however, it is becoming increasingly difficult to reach their goal and come under public notice. Users actively apply ad-blockers to hide annoying ads. According to the Statista data, ad blocking user penetration rate in the USA grew from 15.7% in 2014 to 27.5% in 2017. This figure is expected to rise to 30.1 percent in 2018.  The Linqia‚Äôs report on the State of Influencer Marketing 2018 shows that 39% of marketers plan to increase influencer marketing budgets in 2018.

The influencer marketing has been used in the entertainment industry for years until the large companies engaged in other branches appreciated its value. Even small companies are interested in the cooperation with popular bloggers influencing the choice of potential consumers.
