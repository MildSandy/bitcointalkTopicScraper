I am instead working on MoonRunner.io and once that is off the ground (much easier project to develop than the ZUWP) it will help me generate interest in getting everything situated to revisit the Zempa Wallet project in the future and integrate it into Moonrunner.  Anyone who purchases the Zempa Coins on the WAVES DEX now will still be able to transfer them into Zempa later if we in fact get it off the ground but right now its just a token sitting on the WAVES DEX, unloved and untouched. hah  I've been caught in a situation with having two great ideas but no backing in place to support them. $500k and I'll set the world of crypto on fire.

If by some stroke of miracle we happened to sell out of Zempa Coins through the first phase, we will create enough ERC-20 coins to support the goals for the Zempa Universal Wallet/s reward system while being able to double the value for early adopters and we will cancel the final phase token sale.

With that, we decided to hold off on social bounties and the like until the next phase. We are honoring our agreed upon translation bounties because we had several people participate in those and they deserve what we promised. We just didn't see the active involvement we were initially hoping for and managing it was more time consuming than we had involvement.  If we saw an uprising of interest for an affiliate marketing program again, we would bring it back before the final token sale for everyone to utilize.  From our perspective, leading into the final token sale, the best thing for everyone is for people to contribute what they can and then spread the word. The more support we obtain during this phase, the more we can accomplish in preparation for our final token sale and the better off everyone will be.  We want to launch the final token sale with all of our initial eco-system sites built, running and being marketed. We want to have our free Zempa e-Commerce Plugin completed and distributed for people to use. From here, we will decide if we can complete an initial prototype of the Zempa UWP prior to the final sale based on the support we received during the first sale.  For us, our early adopters are very special. 1. Because those who believe enough in our project to participate means they weren't sold by expensive hype around the project and they truly believe in what we are trying to accomplish for the blockchain space. 2. Early adopters truly want to see our project succeed, not just turn a quick profit. As such, we want to take care of our early adopters and empower them to achieve more within our eco-system and contribution efforts. There will be many surprise perks provided to our early adopters (please make sure you click the CLICK ME Red Bubble on the right of Zempa.io and register there so we have your contact information). Early adopters will be contacted for beta testing sites and features and be given special benefits on these sites such as free advertising, free featured listings and much more.

As was said earlier, you can't use a sum of another currency that is greater than the sum of another currency you already own as you will ultimately pay back the contributor of the currency you used instantly with the currency you have.  Maybe take coins out of the picture. Imagine having a piece of chicken that weighs ten ounces. You want to trade it for a box of matches but the seller will only accept 10 ounces of jelly beans. You buy the matches using someone elses jelly beans and give them your chicken...make more sense?

To try and explain here most easily: Users deposit cryptocurrencies into their Zempa Universal Wallet. Using their GUI, they can select which currencies they want to contribute to the Pool to be used by others.  User A deposits $400 worth of Currency A into the Universal Wal let as well as other currencies.  They select Currency A to be accessible by the system for transactions.   User B deposits $600 worth of Currency B into the Universal Wallet and selects their currency to be accessible by the system for transactions.  User A initiates a transaction online requiring Currency B, which they do not currently own as confirmed by the system first. The system calls the Universal Wallet to locate an available sum of that currency matching User A‚Äôs desired amount.  The system then calculates User A‚Äôs current holdings against the current market value to ensure they can replenish the value of the desired currency‚Äôs value, wherever it may come from.  Once User A‚Äôs holding value is confirmed, the system looks to internal stock of the desired currency to complete the initiated transaction. If the internal stock is depleted, the system looks to contributing user holdings for the desired currency at which point User B‚Äôs available Currency B is calculated against current market value.  Once the desired sum of Currency B has been discovered and calculated, the transaction is completed on behalf of User A. The value of Currency B is reassigned from User A in Currency A to User B as well as a reward in Zempa for having the desired currency available.   User B may then go to the ZempaCoin.com business directory to spend their hard earned rewards on products or services at a discounted price, hold them or trade them on various exchanges.  User A saved a great deal of timeavoiding what could be multiple transaction confirmations as well as fees typically incurred during such an exchange in order to obtain the desired token.",False

Imagine 100 users connected to this Universal Wallet. Each user has deposited a different crypto. Lets say one of those users decides they want to purchase something online using LTE, but they dont have LTE in the ZWU (Zempa Universal Wallet). The product they want to buy costs $100 worth of LTE but they have $100 worth of ETH in the ZWU. So they open the Zempa GUI and proceed to send the LTE to the vendor by plugging in the vendors address and select LTE. The system calls the pool to locate the LTE starting with the person that initiated the transaction, not finding it there, it calls the internal fund stocked by us. Supply is low because LTE is in high demand so the rest of the contributing pool is called until a user is found with $100 of LTE selected as a contribution. The transaction is completed on the first users behalf and $100 worth of ETH is reassigned from them to the LTE contributor to replace the LTE that was used and because LTE is in high demand, the LTE contributor is rewarded a sum of Zempa.  *exhales*  It sounds more complicated than it is really. Everything happening very quickly within the system. Ultimately, rather than having to wait out multiple transactions and associated fees to obtain the currency you need, you have one transaction and one small transfer fee\ and with some higher market cap currencies rising in value faster than others, contributors of those currencies (based on initial system settings followed up by practical use algorithms within the system, those users will be compensated in Zempa according to those factors and based on the sum of each transaction etc.  This is the fundamental use of the system, though once this has been established we have many ideas on how to expand the system with more uses and functionality.",False

As you acquire more, you will move up in Rank.  You begin as a Follower Leader - 50 Total Referrals - Reaching this rank gives you 500 ZEMPC and a 50 ZEMPC Bonus Influencer - 100 Total Referrals - Reaching this rank gives you 1,000 ZEMPC and a 100 ZEMPC Bonus Zempafied - 150 Total Referrals - Reaching this rank gives you 1,500 ZEMPC and a 150 ZEMPC Bonus  If we see Hunters encroaching on the highest rank, we will launch additional ranks so as now to slow your growth momentum with even larger rewards.

I've been getting a lot of messages from folks offering services in exchange for Bitcoin. While I understand the effort and appreciate it, I dont have a Bitcoin budget to spend on various things. I have a Zempa Coin budget.  This project is something we feel very strongly will change the way a lot of people use Crypto. It will make it easier for newcomers to get into Crypto. We aren't doing this with the expectation of making $100m, we are doing it because we believe there is a need in the market and a problem to be solved. that being said, we didn't go after angel investors for seed capital. If the crypto community is willing to stand behind and support what we are doing, then we know its a worthwhile effort. If not, then maybe it isn't.  If you have an interest in helping Zempa accomplish its goals and have the means to support our effort, then offer your support in exchange for Zempa. We aren't looking to support Bitcoin, there is plenty of that.  By accepting Zempa Coin, you are:  A. Showing us you believe in what we are doing. B. Laying the foundation for the Token's future growth. C. If your services offer solid results, those results will be reflected by not only the popularity of our token sale, but the value of the token moving forward. D. More likely to go the extra mile knowing your effort will be rewarded with a higher return on the increased value of the Token.  Overall, if we had 50 Bitcoin to spend on random services, we wouldn't be bothering with a Seed Capital phase for Zempa, but our goals right now are in acquiring public support and awareness while generating enough seed capital so that we may launch the official Token Sale with prototypes ready for demos and the like.  If you have a way to help and you're interested in accepting Zempa Coin as payment, I would be happy to work something out.  Thanks all!",False
