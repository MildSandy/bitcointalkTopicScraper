They call it the ICON of India all over youtube. Some big names there are saying it's the next 100x coin of 2018. I just hope it gets on to OKEX or some other biggish exchange to do it justice. You can all vote for ZEBI oon the OKEX twitter here:     I also hope Idex comes back soon as there was huge volume trading there.  ZEBI GOT THROUGH ROUND ONE: PLEASE GO HERE AND VOTE AND SAY WHY YOU LOVE ZEBI SO WE CAN GET ON OKEX EXCHANGE..It will be huge if we do! also add in the tweet: ""$ZCO @zebidataindia  https://twitter.com/OKEx_/status/993440169435906048",False

They wrote that they expect profits of $ 60 million by 2022. With today's capitalization, this does not seem like a hundredfold increase. And it's strange that developers do not have an official thread on this forum. Then how did they conduct an advertising campaign?",False

I am going to read up more on the whitepaper tonight but what I found most interesting that TORQUE, a venture capital company has invested in ZEBI. So for me,a  company like that to invest in ZEBI, means that thorough due diligence was done by that company already, so I have more trust in it. I also purchased around 10k ZEBI on idex exchange but my Wife she went in more heavier than myself.",False

Five projects reached the final and among them there are ZCO. The owners of the exchange with representatives and developers have already contacted via the official communication channel and negotiations are under way. I think they will all be listed, everything will depend on the requirements that will need to be met. If Zebi will be listed this exchange, then it will be the first decentralized exchange, which means that the trading volumes will increase  ",False
