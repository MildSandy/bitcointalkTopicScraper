On the one hand, the project is based on the existing service for the DeskBell hotels and, on the other hand, on the Ethereum blockchain technologies.  Mobile service DeskBell for tourists and hotel business is presented mainly in regions and has been tested in the local hotels. DeskBell has been a completely free service accessible to every user and hotel in the world. However, it is necessary to meet the challenges of the further development and monetization of the service.  We found a solution in the development of the blockchain technologies, as well as in the status and possibilities of digital values - cryptocurrency. Developing the project DeskBell Chain, we wanted: To get a truly viable solution; To get away from traditional monetization mechanisms, for example, in the form of direct advertising; To take part in the life of the blockchain community and get the degree of the platform universality, creating new smart contracts, as the project develops; To develop a modern and legally stable system for users through a detailed study of the legal component of the project.

The ways of interaction can vary. The key task of the project is to create a platform for implementing flexible marketing programs, from active and motivated participation of the clients in events distributed in the partner network, to the socialization of services and user content.  https://i.imgur.com/XLOTSlk.png  https://i.imgur.com/GtCMXEd.png   https://i.imgur.com/FaAJcr3.png  We live in the era of localization of services. The market has more and more targeted solutions that can help you wherever you are. Our project successfully combines all aspects of these approaches, where blockchain technology is a huge support in terms of motivation and user convenience.  It's time for global cross- integrations for applications and distributed registries - and we're building it today.
