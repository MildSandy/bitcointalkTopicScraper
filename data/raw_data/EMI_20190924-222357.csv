We always welcome feedback from the community on the characteristics of the platform and we plan to constantly improve the platform to make it completely safe and transparent. Upon completion of the primary placement of the tokens (ICO), all participants will receive EIP20-compatible EMP tokens based on Ethereum. After launching the EIP platform on its own blockchain platform or blockchain platform, which will be selected from the list of suitable alternatives, a personal token will be developed for this platform. EIP20-compatible EMP tokens will exchange at the rate of 1-to-1 for their own EMP tokens. Main part of the decentralized platform will be implemented as a set of smart contracts responsible for the functionality described in the «INS platform» section of this document. Official smart contracts will be published with open source on GitHub and include the implementation of the following functions: ● Basic functions, such as trading tokens between addresses; ● Placement of goods for sale; ● Reporting on the implementation process; ● Rewarding mechanisms.  STAGE No2. DEVELOPMENT OF APPLICATIONS AND WEB INTERFACES  If at the first stage the main focus will be on the operational component of the system, the second stage will focus on developing interfaces for interaction with users. We plan to launch a customer website, a sample implementation of the application for the audience, and an application for Brands and Companies. We plan to use React / React Native technologies to maximize the mutual use of the code base by the web applications and mobile applications. Applications will include a thin client based on development standards with open source code that will allow the application to interact with various smart contracts on the EIP platform. Web interfaces for Brands and Companies will work in a web browser without need for a local installation.  STAGE No3. EXPANSION OF ECOSYSTEM  By that time, major part of the technologies needed to launch the system will be ready, so our focus will be on developing the platform. We will not delay investing in the development of the platform until the development is complete, but will intensify our efforts in this direction as soon as there are release versions of applications and interfaces for pre-launch are ready. Growth of the network equally depends on Brands, Companies, and the audience of the global Esports market.  BRANDS AND COMPANIES  EIP ecosystem is concerned in attracting the maximum number of producers of quality goods and services. Brands and Companies publish a range of goods, services, funding the advertising companies, and also attract traffic to the ecosystem. Brands, Companies will use EMP tokens to implement rewards for various programs. Channels for attracting Brands include the addition of companies already supporting EIP, direct proactive contacts with Brands, participation in relevant events and conferences, developing business relations with associations of manufacturers, marketing specialists and ensuring step-by-step guidance and support for new Brands concerned in joining the ecosystem, with the purpose of making this process more convenient and simple as much as possible.  AUDIENCE   The more active users are in the EIP ecosystem, the higher the efficiency and profitability for Brands and vice versa, the opportunities for access to the budgets of Brands and Companies are increased for the audience. Greater engagement increases the value of the ecosystem. Customer base expansion channels include the marketing and promotion of EIP applications and a website for a wide audience, advertising of possibilities for monetizing own activity and engagement, and the EIP ecosystem as a whole. Attracting a large volume of audience is not the only tool for growth; improvement of interaction with the existing audience and participants of the Esports market is also very important. Keeping of clients in the ecosystem will be achieved through continuous improvement of the main product.  PLAN OF GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION  We plan to select cities to launch the system based on the population size, income level of consumers and the level of development of the esports market. Map below shows a preliminary list of cities, which can later be changed as the project advances.",True
