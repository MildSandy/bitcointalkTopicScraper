Brick Coin applies cryptocurrency to the tangible sector of real estate, to provide real world value to cryptocurrency.  ICO Website: https://thebrick.io    Whitepaper: https://thebrick.io/brick/static/whitepaper/BrickWhitepaper.pdf Telegram: https://t.me/thebrickico Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thebrickico Twitter: https://twitter.com/thebrickico Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thebrick_ico/ Medium: https://medium.com/@thebrickico YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS64M-fS4KxmfWYADYzaQ3Q  BRICK Coin ICO private sale started on June 1st, 2018!  WHAT IS BRICK The Brick will implement its own blockchain and smart contracts platform, that has a native token the BRK token that is used for all transactions in the decentralized, real estate ecosystem established by BRK. The BRK Blockchain is a key component that implements the protocol for making a decentralized, trust-free real estate ecosystem possible. It is designed to provide a decentralized ledger tailored for the real-estate industry along with a smart contracts platform that allows implementing rules and regulations specific to real estate transactions and record keeping. Our blockchain implements a Proof of Stake (PoS) based consensus protocol. This allows implementing a protocol that provides a balance between holding the coin and using it for real estate transactions. It also avoids unsustainable mining expenses associated with Proof of Work (PoW), or takeover by ASIC based mining devices. PoS is especially suited to a real estate ecosystem, in which real estate owners have a natural tendency to hold onto their assets for them to appreciate in price over time. At the same time, rental transactions require regular use of tokens for the renter to pay the property owner. This is therefore modeled so that real estate owners hold onto their tokens to maintain their real estate assets and can stake transaction confirmations. Renters spend BRK to pay for their long term or short-term rent. People also use BRK for related retail transactions, such as buying meals or merchandize at hotels or resorts. People are therefore encouraged to maintain their real estate holdings in BRK token as they can earn block rewards by staking transactions. People who maintain enough BRK coin are also able to operate masternodes and additionally earn masternode rewards. In addition to the value appreciation of BRK toke, people also benefit from the price appreciation of the BRK token and the staking and masternode rewards they get from the network. PoS is used for confirming transactions, Proof of HODL (PoH) is used to track and reward people for maintaining BRK tokens, and Proof of Care (PoC) combines holding and spending BRK token to reward people based on how much they care for and use the BRK ecosystem. These novel proofs combine to provide an ecosystem that incentivizes people to use and maintain BRK, thereby growing and securing the BRK network.  The foundational components of the BRK platform are: 1. The BRK Portal: A real estate portal that brings a decentralized market for real estate to life. It allows owners to tokenize their real estate assets and publish them for selling or renting, and customers to rent or buy real estate tokens. The BRK portal will initially be implemented on the Ethereum blockchain for achieving speed to market and then will be transitioned to the BRK blockchain to provide more complete and robust real estate specific features. 2. The BRK blockchain and token: a customized blockchain protocol for implementing a trust-free real estate ecosystem, with real estate specific features for tokenizing real estate assets, tying ownership and trade related rules and information to real estate tokens and keeping electronic records on the blockchain of real estate transactions. 3. Novel Proofs for managing the BRK protocol: The BRK blockchain is a Proof of Stake (PoS) driven blockchain, in which “stakers” confirm transactions. We additionally implement a Proof of HODL (PoH) that rewards people for holding onto the BRK token and a Proof of Care (PoC) that rewards people for caring for the platform, a combination of holding onto the token, and using it for real estate transactions. BRK therefore incentivizes people to hold onto the BRK token or use it for sales and rental of real estate. 4. Verifiable, decentralized market for Real Estate: We establish a verifiable real estate market that allows owners and buyers/renters to come together for real estate transactions without a middleman. The BRK platform verifies ownership and   that rights are transferred (for sales) or allocated (for rentals) when payments are made. 5. Crypto Village: To drive adoption of the BRK platform and establish a model, we are planning to construct a crypto village in the Caribbean that will provide vacation rentals on the BRK portal using the BRK token. Additionally, all services in the Crypto village will be available using the BRK token. Free time in the Crypto Village will be provided to people for buying the BRK token, and also based on how they score on PoH and PoC on the BRK network.   WHY ARE WE DIFFERENT The BRK Blockchain network keeps in mind the stumbling blocks faced by Bitcoin, Ethereum and other major cryptocurrencies, and solves these problems by providing a cryptocurrency that is: 1. Truly decentralized, and resists control by a few parties that can acquire more mining power 2. Highly scalable, to handle high transaction loads efficiently 3. Sustainable, by having a truly democratic governance and reward system that will sustain the network in perpetuity   BRK will be an open source and fully autonomous cryptocurrency that places a strong emphasis on the building    blocks required to provide a complete and successful cryptocurrency for the real estate industry. It is secure, anonymous, trust less, with a very low-cost transaction profile and designed to have features required for real estate transactions. It is designed to embody all that Bitcoin as well as more advanced cryptocurrencies   have grown to become   as well as to capture the economic value that is thus far inhibited by the systemic constraints faced by these cryptocurrencies. It also implements features and functionality specifically required to make it conducive to real estate businesses and technology platforms.

Our platform will provide community collaboration features that will allow reviewers and appraisers to provide their services on the platform.
