Aside from the fact that you provide no details about the amount of tokens to be issued, cost per token, or the amount of money you are hoping to raise, you also provide no details on how you hope to achieve this amazing rich man's rescue service. For something which would obviously be quite costly and difficult to implement, you provide just a vague proposal, ""We'll build something for you to stay in and get a Seal team to collect you by helicopter"". You don't even need crypto or blockchain technology to do this, people could just prepay with fiat, so the whole thing looks like a cash grab, especially with your dodgy profile pics, your Singapore registration, and your long disclaimer section giving yourselves every get-out clause imaginable, which we have seen all too often on this forum. Or it could be something else entirely....  ""There are multiple cryptocurrency millionaires that have undeclared wealth"" - This is true, and it's just how they like it.  ""Tokenholders will purchase services and good via the marketplace anonymously, only sending personal data when absolutely required""  ""This approach enables us to protect token holders and their identities. We cannot be forced to disclose this data, as we simply never collect it""  But you DO collect it, or at least intend to. ""Please register in advance on the site, and be prepared to submit authentication documents.""  So you're trying to use the fear of things like war, financial collapse, natural disasters and EMP's to get crypto-millionaires to divulge their identity documents. Nice try G-man. Close, but no cigar.     ",False

Let's have a look at your complaints.  1) amount of tokens to be issued, cost per token, or the amount of money you are hoping to raise: >> This is very common with announcements. The detail likely comes sooner to the event itself.  2) You don't even need crypto or blockchain technology to do this, people could just prepay with fiat >>> It's in the Whitepaper FAQ. I skimmed and found it. Blockchain is primarily for privacy and stops the person from who delivers the service from knowing the identity of the contact holder in advance. That makes sense.  3) your Singapore registration What's wrong with Singapore? Have you read the IRS revenue recognition issues that are driving companies into the Swiss Tezos situation ?  4) your long disclaimer section Needed as part of SEC rules to allow qualified investors. I just read 5 more ICO white papers today, the the non-Soviet ones have them.  5) But you DO collect (the information), or at least intend to That's because Singapore, the USA and other developed economies have KYC in place. It's required for anti-money laundering, and only for the ICO section. Once the tokens are bought, I imagine it's wide open. Anyone can buy contracts and the platform doesn't record the information. There's no reason for the token sale and platform identities to be linked, so I think it's a false assumption. Also they probably outsource the KYC information to Civic or someone similar, so they may never ever see it. With the privacy background of the people involved, that's 95% what I imagine ill happen.  6) G-Man? I doubt it. Probably very anti-G-Man",False

Yes, there's a LOT of ex-G-Men, they're job is to make sure we can deliver on what we promise: If you try to send in helicopters to rescue people in a US disaster zone, you have to work that out with law enforcement (and it helps if the people on your team speak that LEO language to get approval). When doing missions outside the US, the experience of the Department of State is super-helpful.  We're not building an iphone app, or a browser plugin, we have a serious mission. For that we need people with decades of deep experience to deliver on it. No offense meant to those who ARE building an iPhone app or browser plugin: Their team requirements are better understood and less controversial.  We HAVE that team and are very proud of it.
