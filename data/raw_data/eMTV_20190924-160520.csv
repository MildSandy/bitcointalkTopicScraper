Patience has always rewarded the great and true investors, even in traditional markets; after the ethereum ico users have waited 18 months for their token and another 12 to see the first results ... after the ico of Tezos its investors have waited about 12 months to have the tokens in their wallet and at the moment it is about its price of origin.  Better to wait for the token for another 6 months but it is preferable that they go on a more stable market!

This is most critical stage in the development of a relational and relatable blockchain and we are poised to have this ready by the end of October.  Development RoadMap  ✅Release candidate 2.0 is on track for early July and even as the founder and active participation in development, the progress we've made has gone beyond my expectations. Currently, all that is left is the creation and management of the NameSpaces - which should take about a month - and the Proof of Integrity, which should take  another month. August, unfortunately will be not very productive - communication wise - as we devote ourselves to hitting all the milestones ahead of us. Kindly, keep it in mind!  ✅We’ll also need another month to integrate a PKI / service ledger to manage public keys. Following this, our fully-fledged testnet should be operational.  Future Milestones Targets After TestNet includes:  📈2 months for the accounting system and the cost of  nodes operations (pay per use). 📈3-4 additional months of testing and consolidation  ✅Following this, our Mainnet will be released!  The dev guys are far more capable and motivated than I dared to hope. Thank you so much to my team. Real professionals  Economic Roadmap  ✅Simone (the company’s administrator) has personal issues to attend to, which  has made him unavailable to execute his functions. Personally, I know this is not his intention.

This is the AirDrop regulation you can read on your personal page, dedicated section for AirDrop:  AIRDROP SYSTEM  The Airdrop will reward the token holders: those that will keep their tokens in the Multiversum Wallet (my.multiversum.io, “MTV Wallet”, from now on).  According to the holding time in MTV Wallet, proportional bonuses will be obtained.  The system will start working before one month from ICO end.  Each user, until the day before the Airdrop System starts running, will be able to decide how many tokens to hold in MTV Wallet through the dedicated page on the dashboard my.multiversum.io  In case the user does not take any decision during this period, all of his tokens will be assigned to MTV Wallet. Once the Airdrop System starts running, the assigned tokens will be locked for one month and not withdrawable.  The unassigned amount will be, instead, promptly withdrawable.  The users that will move some or all of their tokens to an ERC-20 wallet WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO THE ONGOING AIRDROP!  If the user buys back or moves the tokens back to his MTV Wallet, his airdrop count will be the same as those who bought in after ICO despite the previous assigned bonuses.  The amount of tokens destinated to airdrop system (and therefore locked) can be increased anytime: the bonus yield of the addictional locked tokens will be accordingly calculated on the newly locked fraction.  Every user will be able to check the estimated airdrop yield from his dashboard my.multiversum.io  Bounties, contests and prizes will be dedicated to “Top Holders” that will not withdraw their tokens.  NOTES  There is the chance that the airdrop will finish before 18 months, according to how many will benefit from it.  In case this does not happen, the remaining tokens will be distributed proportionally.  A live support system will be available when Airdrop System will be activated.

The word spread even without advertising: that's a further confirmation of the scope of the project and its reception by the investors. Dubai, London and New York were thrilled by our presence, and along with congratulations came notable deals. But now, as you can see, Multiversum ads are starting to pop one by one on the major crypto showcases, and most probably on your Facebook profile: our global marketing campaign is starting to sort its effects!  To involve our supporters even further, we decided to give you the chance to become a patron of our cause! Every person that will register with your referral code will get you 2eMTV and start with a bonus of 5MTV. All of this on top of the classic 5% referral bonus percentage.

Let me know if you enjoy it!  Multiversum (“MTV”) is, and I quote, a “4th Generation Relational Blockchain”, but what does that actually mean?  First generation is the original, Bitcoin and its forks. Based on Proof of Work mining. The second generation, Ethereum et al., introduced smart contracts and the possibility of tokenisation – consider how many cryptocurrencies run on the Ethereum blockchain. The third generation looked to build on previous generations and considered the issues of scalability and speed and making mining more energy efficient. Different approaches were considered, including Proof of Stake validation rather than mining and the possibility of off-chain routing.  However, the fourth generation – and MTV in particular – is aimed at improving all of the previous generations, whilst also tailoring blockchain technology to the business environment. The team at MTV realise that for mass adoption to take place, blockchain technology must be applicable to real-world scenarios: that is their primary aim.  MVT will utilise horizontal scalability: an increased number of processes, rather than the same number of processes, but completed faster. This is the same principle that the quad-core processor in your computer utilises – four processors running at 1.6Ghz instead of one processor running at 6.4Ghz. Four processors is more efficient.  Another of the attributes that distinguishes MTV as a 4th Generation blockchain is that it will allow interconnection with other infrastructures, such as Ethereum. This innovation will allow a token on the Ethereum platform to be utilised on MTV’s platform, a move with will ease mass adoption.  Arguably the most functional, real-world applicability of MVT comes through its ability to create and maintain Relational Databases.  Simply put, Relational Databases mean multiple data types existing and working within a single blockchain. In previous iterations of blockchain technology this would lead to congestion (consider the massive congestion in the Bitcoin network and resultant high transaction fees). However, with MTV each data type will split from the blockchain whilst the transaction is performed, before re-joining once completed to be validated. This will allow for parallel transactions occurring simultaneously, meaning that far more information can be sent in a much shorter amount of time.  Simply put, instead of having one blockchain processing 10,000 blocks of data very quickly, MTV will instead split into 1000 conjoined blockchains, each processing ten blocks of data almost instantaneously, before autonomously re-forming into a single blockchain.  This will allow companies and businesses to not only store varying types of information, but to do so securely, and almost instantaneously. The data could be anything from customer transactions, stock levels, human resources functions, the quality assurances procedures from their product creation and myriad other types all on the same blockchain. This interrelationship will allow for MTV to be a one-stop solution for businesses, saving them both time and money. It is difficult to overstate quite how valuable this will be to a business: time and money are the two most important things to a business and so for MTV to be able to save both could be massive.  Not only will the data be created and maintained simultaneously, but, due to the inherent technology of the blockchain, there will be a ledger storing every movement of every aspect of every piece of data contained within the Relational Databases.  Therefore, once a company looks to audit its books, or its stock levels, or the files of its employees, it will have instant access to every element of the information, with no worry about files being lost, or human error in accounting. Everything will be stored.  Of course, inherent in previous generations has been the possibility that a node may go down, either paralysing the blockchain, or the data becoming lost or fragmented.  To combat this, MTV also introduces data sharding, which effectively allows a single piece of data to be split into multiple fragments and shared between and across multiple nodes. The benefit of this is that should a node – or even multiple nodes – go off-line, there will be no data loss because the data will exist simultaneously on various other nodes, allowing the system to continue to function until the broken nodes are operational once again. This will make MTV more reliable, and therefore – again – more suitable for mass adoption.  Data sharding, combined with the ease and sophistication of Relational Databases, will allow a business to consolidate many of its back-end functions into one primary system, with no need to have separate systems to create the information, store the information and access the information.  MTV is staking a claim to be the future of the blockchain and, should they be successful, they will be.",False

The second generation, with Ethereum leading the charge of smart-contracts-enabled blockchains, is instead more heterogeneous, allowing easy tokenization of assets. Both architectures have extremely low energy efficiency and medium-low block validation speed and transactions per block.  Solving the scalability, speed, and energy consumption issues is the goal of third-generation blockchain solutions, using different approaches and techniques like Proof of Stake validation algorithm, off-chain routing, graph-chains, and complete or partial centralization.  The fourth generation is going far beyond this, achieving faster and more scalable solutions and trying, at the same time, to become competitive from a business perspective; simple chains of data are not flexible enough to fulfill corporate environment needs, in which complex data structures need to be organized in tables (as in relational databases)",False

At the same time, we pay for this in terms of huge processing power, unacceptable pollution, high transaction costs and slowness which can hardly represent current technological progress standards, and give a reasonable technical answer to modern financial and commercial use cases.  This slowness is caused by the lack of horizontal scalability, i.e. the increase of computation capacity obtained by merely adding processors instead of replacing them with faster versions. Another cause of this slowness is inherent to its current blockchain safety mechanism, designed to prevent anyone from taking over the majority of the clusters by making it very expensive to achieve in terms of calculation power and/or cost (Proof of Work and Proof of Stake).  Furthermore, current blockchains are simple concatenations of single data entities state changes; reconstructing the actual states of these entities implies a whole chain scan, which causes an even greater system slowdown and resources usage. This simplification makes blockchains inadequate for scientific and industrial purposes, as requirements in terms of data structures can become extremely complex. Moreover, security measures stop at data level as they don’t ensure user safety, making it impossible to recover lost or stolen coins and tokens even if they are located on the chain, or to block malicious accounts.  At last, another issue is fragmentation and in homogeneity among cryptocurrencies, that are unable to communicate with each other and live in unrelated universes.",False

""The pioneer of cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, together with all its various clones and forks based on Proof of Work algorithm for transaction validation, are considered first-generation blockchains.  The second generation, with Ethereum leading the charge of smart-contracts-enabled blockchains, is instead more heterogeneous, allowing easy tokenization of assets. Both architectures have extremely low energy efficiency and medium-low block validation speed and transactions per block.  Solving the scalability, speed, and energy consumption issues is the goal of third-generation blockchain solutions, using different approaches and techniques like Proof of Stake validation algorithm, off-chain routing, graph-chains, and complete or partial centralization.  The fourth generation is going far beyond this, achieving faster and more scalable solutions and trying, at the same time, to become competitive from a business perspective; simple chains of data are not flexible enough to fulfill corporate environment needs, in which complex data structures need to be organized in tables (as in relational databases). At the same time, those structures need to be validated and made immutable with blockchain-based techniques, increasing traceability and security.  In other words, fourth generation blockchain brings this technology to a complete primary production application, and expand current business-oriented offer in terms of data storage, application decentralization, auditing, security, reliability.  Multiversum offers complex data organization instead of data sequencing, chain splitting and rejoining to allow for greater scalability and parallelism, and the concept of Proof of Integrity validation (i.e. cryptographic proof of server code) instead of existing Proof of Work or Proof of Stake solutions.  Furthermore, Multiversum will feature ERC20/ERC23 integration, allowing coins and tokens from other solutions to be hosted on our chain and vice-versa, with notary services as an external confirmation method.  Meanwhile, together with these innovations, we are certainly going to make use of several good solutions that our colleagues already implemented over time.""",False

Also to make our coin going out will use the same principle. Yes, it is quite similar to what happens on exchanges.  /*Transaction at 1000 tps per core sound alot more impressive than a static number, as you can scale it up when needed! But this does make it centralized? Yet we have pol which is decentralized?*/ All the nodes are part of the escalation process, so when the number of request are high they will use parallel processing. There are also some ""Coordination nodes"" but they are elected by the cluster itself.  /*How will the roll back be handled to avoid people being able to use this anti scam/hack feature to actualy scam/hack?*/ This is a feature that is implemented on the Multiversum System itself, and the applications that use it (as for NEO or Ethereum) may want to allow or not in their logic. Versum, our coin will not use it.
