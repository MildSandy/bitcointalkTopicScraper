Dataeum aims to become a reference for all market players dealing with physical data, enabling them to drastically reduce the data acquisition cost by using one trusted provider. To become this reference, one must be able to prove transparency on the way data is generated. The blockchain brings this transparency and accuracy as all data collected are stored in it and the validation of each data is realized through a decentralized process. To ensure data accuracy, the collector will get a ‚Äúquality score‚Äù for his or her collection actions. The more collectors initiate, update and verify data correctly, the higher their ‚Äúquality score‚Äù will be. A higher quality score leads to a higher level of ‚Äútrust‚Äù, and thus a quicker reward and attractive incentives. This score is unique to Datateum due to the innovative Proof of Trust technique used to ensure  the verification of 100% of the data collected. To prevent abusive or fraudulent behavior, the quality score will also be taken into consideration to determine which collector will carry out the action. Also, an incorrect collection can lead to a retroactive decrease of the collector‚Äôs quality score.  In regards to your second question, one of the main features offered by Dataeum is the decentralized marketplace. It aims to democratize access to all physical data in the world. In addition to that, it offers XDT token holders the following possibilities:  üî∏LICENSING of the data for use and exploitation üî∏ACQUISITION of the data ownership exploitation (DOE)  The licensing (or rental) of the data will be addressed to different types of market players, like maps, private companies, urban planning companies or even local authorities. In order to exploit the data available on the marketplace, these players (or data acquirers) will have to license (rent) its use. The licensing price will be calculated according to a market value, which depends on the type of data concerned (name, geolocation etc.), use (consultation, one-time etc.) and average rental cost in the area. The platform will thus propose all available attributes for each physical data: type, date of collection/update, exact location etc. From the platform, data acquirers will be able to specify their needs and directly obtain the desired data. The decentralized marketplace establishes a link between the collection on the mobile app and the availability of the data to the market players. The revenues generated by data rental will be reused to finance new collections, verifications and updates. Dataeum will also charge a commission to ensure proper functioning of the network and its development.",False

First of all, Dataeum is dealing with the physical data generation, thus no personal data. So the GDPR does not enter in the blockchain-based activity of the platform, so there are no privacy issues in regards to that. The collectors who initiate the physical data collection will be offered a priority option to acquire its DOE (data ownership exploitation). If they use it, once the physical data is validated, they will become DOE holders and beneficiaries of the revenues generated by the data exploitation. On the other hand, if they do not use the option, the DOE will be proposed to the collectors that verified the data.

One of the points raised was to make data flexibility coexist with immutability because these two notions come into conflict. Indeed, immutability prevents the updating and deletion of data, common to any ""traditional"" database. BigchainDB responds to this conflict by implementing the CRAB (Create-Read-Append-Burn) method. It allows data to be updated by creating a new version of the data.

Have a look at this one:  Each physical data collected requires at least an image linked to the visual element concerned by the collection. Media storage will be supported by a new technology layer, IPFS. It is based on a peer-to-peer system that provides decentralized resource hosting in each node of the network. Thus, each resource is duplicated and versioned, making the infrastructure infallible.  To summarize, Dataeum will use the following interoperable modules: üí° The Dataeum XDT token, ERC20 Token based on the Ethereum platform; üí° Wallet of the Dataeum platform where tokens created during the TGE (Token Generation Event) will be stored; üí° BigchainDB-based data storage spaces (https://www.bigchaindb.com); üí° IPFS-based media file content storage space (https://ipfs.io);  Dataeum will not exclude the possibility of new technical choices since other solutions under development promise similar functionalities and benchmarks (TiesDB, Parity, etc.).

If you‚Äôve grasped the idea of what the platform is going to look and function like, you should also understand some of the most important steps in its workflow.  The first step consists of collecting and storing attributes of the physical data through the mobile application directly on the blockchain. A part of the previously collected attributes are reused in order to give minimum and already pre-filled inputs to the collectors in the verification and update phases.  The stored data will then have its status updated, pending or validated if there is a match. Once ‚Äúvalidated‚Äù, a new version of the data is created to replace the previous one in the blockchain. The validation of a data triggers the remuneration of the collectors via an oracle and using the Smart Contract Technology.  Validated status also makes the data available on the marketplace. The data is then made accessible for any token holder for different actions: consultation, licensing, DOE. These actions are triggered from an interaction with the Smart Contract Token.",False

The collectors will also be evaluated and rated along the process. In order to conduct these procedures, the following techniques will be used: Proof-of-Existing Data, Proof-of-Constant Data and Proof-of-Trust. For more detail on how these techniques work, please refer to the whitepaper, start from pg 14 https://www.dataeum.io/white-paper.pdf  üî∏ Proof-of-Existing Data technique is used for creation / verification of data. It compares the collected data from two different collectors. If both data match, the data will be considered as valid. If not, the data remains invalid until a further collector validates it.  üî∏ Proof-of-Constant Data technique is used to update data. To ensure constant accuracy, data will be regularly updated. The accuracy rate of the data will decrease progressively on a monthly basis (X% per month). An algorithm will guide the collectors to maintain up-to-date data.  üî∏ Proof-of-Trust technique is used for evaluating the collector. The collector will get a ‚Äúquality score‚Äù for his or her collection actions. The more collectors initiate, update and verify data correctly, the higher their ‚Äúquality score‚Äù will be. A higher quality score leads to a higher level of ‚Äútrust‚Äù, and thus a quicker reward and attractive incentives.  By linking crowdsourcing to the blockchain and using these techniques to provide proof for the generation of physical data, Dataeum‚Äôs solution makes it possible to collect and verify 100% of physical data in any part of the world.  - - - - - - - - - -  CROWDSALE üëâ November 5, 2018 -  December 9, 2018 üëâ 1 ETH = 12 000 XDT tokens",False

The licensing (or rental) of the data will be addressed to different types of market players, like maps, private companies, urban planning companies or even local authorities.  In order to exploit the data available on the marketplace, these players (or data acquirers) will have to license (rent) its use.  The licensing price will be calculated according to a market value, which depends on the type of data concerned (name, geolocation etc.), use (consultation, one-time etc.) and average rental cost in the area.  The platform will thus propose all available attributes for each physical data: type, date of collection / update, exact location etc.  From the platform, data acquirers will be able to specify their needs and directly obtain the desired data.  The decentralized marketplace establishes a link between the collection on the mobile app and the availability of the data to the market players.

Delineating between structured and unstructured data comes down to whether the data has a pre-defined data model and whether it‚Äôs organized in a pre-defined way.   3 - Time-stamped data A dataset which has a concept of time ordering defining the sequence that each data point was either captured (event time) or collected (processed time).   4 - Machine data The digital exhaust created by the systems, technologies and infrastructure powering modern businesses.   5 - Spatiotemporal data Describes both location and time for the same event -- and it can show us how phenomena in a physical location change over time.   6 - Open data Data that is freely available to anyone in terms of its use and rights to republish without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control.   7 - Dark data Dark data is digital information that is not being used and lies dormant in some form.   8 - Real time data The term used to refer to instantaneous computing that happens about as fast as a human can perceive.   9 - Genomics data Data that involves analysing the DNA of patients to identify new drugs and improve care with personalized treatments.   10 - Operational data Companies have big data, they have application logs and metrics, they have event data, and they have information from microservices applications and third parties.   11 - High-dimensional data Data that are multi-faceted enough to be able to handle computations that are capable of describing all the nuances and individualities that exist across out facial physiognomies.   12 - Unverified outdated data Data that has been collected, but nobody has any idea whether it's relevant, accurate or even of the right type.   13 - Translytic Data An amalgam of ‚Äòtransact‚Äô and ‚Äòanalyze‚Äô, translytic data is argued to enable on-demand real-time processing and reporting with new metrics not previously available at the point of action.

And not without reason: a constant Internet connection, geolocation services and social networks don't exactly help to hide from the public. However, privacy, as we understand it, is only about 150 years old. For 3,000 years, cultures have nearly always prioritized convenience and wealth over privacy.  Most homes didn't even have walls separating rooms until the development of brick chimney, which needed support beams (c. 1500 AD)  Silent reading was not popular until the Church mandated confessions for the masses; the concept of private salvation ushered in a new habit of silent learning and contemplation. Silent reading would become popular with non-elites ~500 years later when books were cheap enough for individual ownership (c. 1215)  Beds used to be extraordinarily expensive; many homes only had a single large bed that was shared with the entire family and guests. Sex with others in the room was common (c.1700)  Information about citizens was often public, including the first American census. Even though the post office had introduced the first information privacy laws in the 19th century, postcards (without envelopes) were cheaper, and therefore often more popular. The Right to Privacy was coined in 1890, inspired by fears of the camera. (1900s)  When AT&T offered a $30 premium service that allowed users to opt-out of browser tracking for ad targeting, few users took it. This portends a future where most people will increasingly choose ever more invasive tracking in exchange for money, health advice, and entertainment. (2015)",False

In this way crowdsourcing occurs when an organization outsources a work project or creative problem to a large group of people. It's a process of co-creation between an organization and ‚Äúthe crowd‚Äù.  But what is it exactly, and how does it benefit companies and their customers? We'll try to illustrate it in 5 fascinating facts:  1. The Crowd gets to the truth fast and accurately  On the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, the audience‚Äôs accuracy rate outperformed that of the experts, 91% to 61%.  2. The Crowd does really good work  For 9 straight years Doritos commercials have ranked in the top 5 of USA Today‚ÄôsAd Meter rankings for best Super Bowl commercial, ever since the chip-maker began crowdsourcing commercials with its Crash the Super Bowl advertising contest.  3. The Crowd produces fast results  Since its launch in 2008, Starbucks has collected more than 216,000 ideas on its website mystarbucksidea.com, an online platform whereby customers share ideas on everything from beverages to ambiance, payment to social responsibility.  4. The Crowd is big‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs everywhere  In June 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook reported there were over 9 million registered app developers and 1.2 million iOS applications on his company‚Äôs App Store.  5. The Crowd can tackle a wide variety of tasks  In 2013 alone, the USA government crowdsourced over 85 prize competitions to find creative solutions to vexing governmental challenges, from improving astronaut gloves to blocking unsolicited ‚Äúrobocalls.‚Äù   Paired with technology, crowdsourcing produces meaningful results faster, more affordably, and more broadly than traditional approaches to work. This is why it's the best fit for Dataeum and our missionüôå",False

Why is it even necessary to know? Well, if you‚Äôre an investor, the most important thing to understand is the long term value behind a token, something that depends on its type a lot.  Currency Tokens are what started cryptocurrency (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum). Their worth is determined by supply and demand. Bitcoin value goes up, but the supply is limited because of it‚Äôs codebase. One of the difficulties that currency tokens have is generating a demand.  Asset Tokens represent an actual product or asset. These types of tokens are currently growing rapidly. But if the asset they represent depreciates, the token will as well. They should be approached with caution.  Utility Tokens are unique and they give those who own them access to do something that a particular network allows an individual to do. Dataeum‚Äôs XDT is a utility token!  Equity Tokens provide ownership of something. They are very similar to that of a stock and the more people buy them, the more successful they can be. Equity tokens can mean that someone has part ownership in something like a particular product or even a business.  You have to know the ropes before you rush out and invest a lot of money in tokens, and this is a good start. As you become more comfortable with how tokens work, you can surely take more risks if you wish so.

The collectors will also be evaluated and rated along the process.  To achieve that, Dataeum will use the following techniques:  Proof-of-Existing Data (creation / verification): the collected data from two different collectors will be compared. If they match, it will be considered as valid. Once it happens, both collectors split the reward.  Proof-of-Constant Data (update): to assure constant accuracy, data will be regularly updated. Its accuracy rate will decrease progressively on a monthly basis. The collector who updates physical data will be rewarded based on the data‚Äôs collection value and its accuracy rate.  Proof-of-Trust (evaluating the collector): the collector will get a ‚Äúquality score‚Äù for his or her collection actions. The more collectors initiate, verify and update data correctly, the higher their ‚Äúquality score‚Äù will be. It helps gain ‚Äútrust‚Äù, get quicker reward and attractive incentives.  By linking crowdsourcing to the blockchain and using these techniques, Dataeum‚Äôs solution makes it possible to collect and verify 100% of physical data in any part of the world üôå  Don‚Äôt forget to join our Telegram chat: https://t.me/dataeum",False

Despite the term itself being relatively new, data dates back to as far as the last era. Back then it was about calculating, analyzing and cataloging data about the contents of libraries or the number of troops. As the information volume substantially increased, these processes got more complicated as well.  The 19th century became a turning point for the ways people registered and stored data, considering the commonly known ""Avalanche of Numbers"" in the years 1820-1840. Along with writing and painting, it became possible to record data in the form of sound, using vinyls and magnetic tapes.  20th century marked the transition from analog media to digital: 1956 ‚Äî IBM introduces the first hard drive that weighs approximately 1 ton; 1982 ‚Äî Sony and Philips produce the first optical disc; 1989 ‚Äî The term ‚ÄúData mining‚Äù emerges.  In this day and age, the volume of Big Data keeps increasing exponentially. Brand new technologies emerge to allow for its collection, analysis and storage. It also happens to be the **cornerstone of Dataeum** ‚Äî the first collaborative and decentralized platform for physical data generation.‚ú®",False

It does this throughout a mobile app and by using a distributed workforce of ‚Äúcollectors‚Äù who are incentivised in XTD tokens to submit physical data. Once validated, thanks to a decentralized collection verification process, the data is accessible on a Marketplace.

Here are top 10 facts about it you should definitely know:  üëâüèª Big Data is literally Big Data: McKinsey defines big data as referring to ‚Äúdatasets whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to capture, store, manage and analyze‚Äù. üëâüèª Big Data is top priority for business companies: for a typical Fortune 1000 company, just a 10% increase in data accessibility will result in more than $65 million additional net income. üëâüèª Facebook stores, accesses, and analyzes 30+ Petabytes of user generated data - Facebook users send on average 31.25 million messages and view 2.77 million videos every minute. üëâüèª Big Data Could Add 6 Million Jobs to U.S. Economy üëâüèª Big Data is not only about businesses: the London Olympic authorities were using Big Data to enhance traffic conditions. üëâüèª Big Data could save your life - with Big Data, doctors are able to assess the effectiveness of therapies and match patients with suitable trials. üëâüèª Decoding the human genome originally took 10 years to process; now it can be achieved in one week. üëâüèª The amount of unstructured data is growing rapidly - every 2 days we create as much data as we did from the beginning of time until 2003 üëâüèª Bad data or poor data quality costs US businesses $600 billion annually. üëâüèª Governments use Big Data too - the Obama administration has invested $200 million in big data research projects.  Whether you like it or not, Big Data is taking root in our lives pretty fast. About time to take control of your Data with DATAEUM. üëäüèªüëäüèªüëäüèª",False

It only applies to EU citizens‚Äô data, but the global nature of the internet means that nearly every online service is affected.  Let‚Äôs see how: üëÄ  1)  Any entity ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù personal data by collecting it, storing it or disseminating it, shall follow these rules. 2)  The GDPR applies to what the EU has determined to be ‚Äúpersonal data‚Äù - that which can be linked to a person. By the way, it means that Dataeum, dealing with the physical data generation, is outside the scope of this regulation. 3)  Companies will have to post clear notices for users and get their ‚Äúunambiguous‚Äù consent to collect data. No hidden ‚ÄúOK‚Äù buttons, no ‚Äúterms and conditions‚Äù that must be agreed to, no collection of data on children under the age of 16. 4)  It‚Äôs going to cost firms ~$500K/$1M. 5)  Companies with 250+ employees will have to hire a data protection officer responsible for making sure the rules are followed. 6)  Non-compliance will cost up to ‚Ç¨10M in fines, or 2% of annual worldwide revenue. 7)  Consumers will have free access to the data collected on them and more information on how it‚Äôs being used.

Basically, yes.  The collectors who initiate the physical data collection will be offered a priority option to acquire its DOE (data ownership exploitation). If they use it, once the physical data is validated, they will become DOE holders and beneficiaries of the revenues generated by the data exploitation.  On the other hand, if they do not use the option, the DOE will be proposed to the collectors that verified the data.  If none of the collectors use their option, the DOE will become accessible from the marketplace to any XDT token holders.",False
