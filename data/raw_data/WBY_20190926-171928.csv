It is most of the time ineffective and expensive, leaving buyers and sellers frustrated and alienated in the process. Even when ads are targeted, just because someone was interested to buy a product a week, a month, or a year ago, doesn’t mean that he/she is still interested today.  These challenges and the fact that monopolies (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc.) pretty much control the digital advertising industry, contribute to a situation where a great number of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) choose not to advertise online. This, while there is in excess of 500 million SMEs globally that could greatly benefit from the marketing of their products and services online. We live in a digital age, but shockingly, as a result of the challenges faced due to monopolistic behavior, it is said that about 90% of all retail purchases are still made offline.  Why not reverse the advertising process?  Enable a buyer to describe the product/service he/she wishes to buy in real-time via a global, blockchain-based, on-demand advertising platform. Make it possible for relevant sellers within a buyer’s geographical area to see the description. Make it possible for sellers to communicate and promote their products or services to the buyer in real-time by paying a small advertising fee. Pay the buyer a portion of the advertising fee to encourage ad views and spending. Make sure that the on-demand advertising platform used is owned and controlled by buyers. Allow for a native token that makes cheap, fast transactions possible on a global scale in support of both online-to-offline commerce and online advertising.  Will this not be a way better alternative to the status quo?",False

Firsthand experience has shown that the ETH network struggles to handle traffic during times of high traffic - leading to high gas prices and slow transaction times. For example, CryptoKitties almost brought it down.  On the other hand, Stellar offers significantly cheaper and faster transactions.  Furthermore, we see no need to adopt the risk of Ethereum’s Turing complete programming language when only a basic token in support of basic smart contracts is required. Stellar’s transaction model leaves less room for bad actors to exploit vulnerabilities. This makes Stellar cheaper and more secure than what Ethereum has to offer.  In addition, it takes a lot of time, money and effort to get ERC20 tokens listed on centralized exchanges. Stellar offers an in-house decentralized exchange where newly issued XLM-based tokens get listed from day one - ready for instant trading. This is without the hassle and expense associated with trying to get your token listed on centralized exchanges.  Let us know your thoughts below.",False

Unfortunately this gave rise to many scam projects - projects that were either outright scams (fake teams, fake partnerships and other shenanigans.) or simply couldn’t deliver on false, outlandish promises made.  Ultimately this attracted the attention of regulators and negatively impacted the public’s appetite to fund new blockchain projects - and rightly so. This in turn contributed to the start of the 2018 crypto bear market that we are still largely trying to shake off today. This is not to subtract from the progress being made by blockchain projects that did use and are using funding obtained during the ICO craze of 2017 responsibly.
