It combines many of the features that were critical for us. OpnCT platform supports:  •    Proof of Duration (PoD) OpenCT created it’s own proof algorithm which when used in combination with PoS (Proof of Stake) or DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) provides for a more democratic approach to mining and consensus. •    A block production rate that is exceptionally fast – 100,000 TPS (Transactions Per Second). For comparison: Bitcoin - 3-7 Transactions per second (TPS) Ethereum - 15 TPS Visa Credit Card Network - 60,000  TPS",False

White Listing registration for the pre-sale — Click Here:  https://www.openct.io/buy-oct-token. Note: for a limited time registrants can purchase at the original pre-sale price of $0.75. Current token price: $0.90. The last 90 days have been an amazing journey. We have pushed through some significant development hurdles — driven in large part by serious telecom partner interest in OpenCryptoTrust’s killer apps. We can hardly wait to share the details of these global partnerships — which have resulted in a shift in priorities and therefore strategy.  We are proud of the fact that we have a real product that is beyond MVP — and a real go-to-market strategy. We know that it will be incredibly powerful for investors and our community to see our project generate big global partnerships, large customer adoption, and revenue BEFORE our public crowdsale begins. The excitement that our project has generated globally — and with very little advertising — has been humbling. We are listening to our partners and have been asked to customize aspects of OpenCryptoTrust’s “killer applications” in order to make our revolutionary blockchain based telco services available to market SOONER. We’ve decided that this approach will ultimately benefit our investors and community as a whole!  How it will work OpenCryptoTrust will postpone our public token sale set to launch on August 2nd, 2018, and extend the private pre-sale to November 1st, 2018. In addition the public sale (ICO) will be live for 90 days (rather than 60) and will extend beyond the holiday season — ending January 29th, 2019. We will hold the current price @ $0.90 through the private sale. As indicated in our white paper the public sale pricing is determined by a linear function that begins at $0.93 and ends at $1.31. There’s no minimum participation in either the pre-sale or the main sale and the white list registration is open now (you can get updates by joining our Telegram). OCT will be listed on exchanges following the close of the main sale (January 29, 2019), meaning the tokens will be liquid from the outset. If you’re interested in participating, you can register now for the pre-sale!  What this means Since a high of $1,389 in January, Ethereum (ETH) has lost nearly 70% of its value leading to large sell-offs and causing investors and crypto-enthusiasts alike to take a more cautious approach to token sales and the cryptocurrency space as a whole. Rather than launch our token sale at this stage, we will finance ourselves internally and focus on product development and closing trial partnerships prior to launching our token sale. We will continue to update and grow our community as things develop and as the markets become more bullish — as is predicted by many analyst to happen (much like last year with bitcoin) towards the end of the year. If you have already registered for the pre-sale, there’s nothing you need to do, your registration will still be valid when the sale launches at November 1st, 2018.  Regulatory statement The coming regulation (from FINMA, SEC, and other financial governing organizations) should be embraced by all who are not bad actors. It means that there will be protection for ICO participants and investors. Most people are aware that a large number of ICOs will fail — often because the projects themselves don’t really require a token or blockchain technology itself — but in many cases because they miss the point of why an ICO is needed in the first place. It’s goal should never be JUST to raise money. The goal of an ICO should be to build a sustainable community — the goal should be to build an ecosystem of support for a powerful decentralized network.  Following the general premise that if you are raising funding for a platform/project/solution that isn’t yet built (with the expectation that what you build will have greater value) well then you have a security! For those unaware OpenCryptoTrust’s public sale is compliant with SEC Rule 506(c) of Reg D. In the US the “public sale” will be for accredited investors only; outside the US it’s subject to local requirements of the jurisdiction of the investor. As indicated in our original White Paper (published 2nd quarter 2017) and for non-regulatory reasons (purely technical) we decided that after the ERC-20 based token sale (a security) — that we would migrate tokens 1 for 1 to our own hybrid blockchain platform. This was necessary to support an extremely high volume of telco based transactional activity on our highly robust and scalable network (you can’t have clients waiting for block production in order to get their email — lol). Once migrated to our hybrid blockchain platform the OCT token will act purely as a utility token. Exciting to see the rest of the ICO industry begin to take similar steps!  Thank you for your continued support as the entire OpenCryptoTrust team works hard to bring our modern telecommunication solutions to the world!
