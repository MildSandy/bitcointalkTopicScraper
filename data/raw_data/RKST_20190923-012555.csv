We are continuing with another project, all original investors from the ICO have had ALL of their funds returned INCLUDING gas fees as a gesture of good will. This was done a long time ago in September and everyone has had their funds returned - there is nothing suspicious with this process and we have kept our word.  We are moving all the original bounties into the new campaign next year and you will have been sent an email around two weeks ago confirming this. There will be nothing issued for around 12months when our new project is live but everyone will be compensated for their previous work.  Please email hello@rakugo.co if you didn't get this and we will make sure you are in the system.  I want to be clear, we are not scammers, we are not stealing money. We are taking care of the community that supported us last time and we really appreciate your support.  Thanks,  The Rakugo Team",False

Do you have some previous product to show us?”  We are a balanced team of developers and growth professionals who have known each other for a long time professionally and personally. We have developed the team to reflect the technical and business problem we are solving – meaning we have the perfect blend of technical, publishing, and growth talent. Our team has worked on several big products in San Francisco (https://radius.com/, http://dronedeploy.com/, https://www.fullfunnel.co/) ranging from machine learning AI platforms to the Verizon app store, apps for Toyota, and NASA. Blockchain and Distributed systems expertise is strong on our team. We are looking to release a proof of concept (POC) of the publishing platform Rakugo before the close of the ICO and will start onboarding content producers to the platform from out 20K database of writers and content creators. The ‘Kenzo’ POC will be released after we start building our publishing community and thus readership base in September/October. Our team and experience is a major strength and upside to our ICO.  2.   “Why to choose Rakugo when there are monsters in the market like Medium, Steemit or even BAT? What's your fundamental difference?”  We are fundamentally very different to all of those platforms and offer a much different value proposition. Therefore, we have structured our token sale to have a clear roadmap and pathway to value for our token holders and the community. We are building a revenue generating platform that is not dependent on the adoption of blockchain technology to build an active user base or generate returns for investors. Further, we are partnering with large publishers to bring an Enterprise platform to the market based on ‘Kenzo’ and ‘Shogun’ APIs. Giving 20% of all revenues generated by our platform to token holders provides a very clear return on investment and growth in token value. Further, you can convert Rakugo Seed Tokens 1:1 for an equity token when regulation allows us to issue one. A revenue paying token is innovative and safer for investors.  When comparing Rakugo directly to Steemit it is our view that their platform is generally built for crypto enthusiasts and is not accessible to a wider user base which is limiting for growth. We do not see Steemit integrating with Buzzfeed or The New York Times, with Rakugo this is on our roadmap and is part of our horizontal growth strategy. In addition, Steemit is more of a Reddit style platform which is not what we are going to be. We expect the same users of Steemit to come for our platform to get payments in ETH for their content on top of a broader, less crypto savvy audience. In addition, Steemit relies upon internal economics to provide revenue to their system which we feel is self-limiting in terms of revenue and growth of contributor rewards. We are going to be capturing a 0.20% market (very achievable) share of a $250BN global digital advertising market, which would give Rakugo revenues in the order of $484M by 2021. Due to our strong links into the publishing and content industry, as well as proven track record in growth and user acquisition, we will have a rapid adoption of users and viewers to Rakugo that come from crypto and non-crypto backgrounds. This is in fact far more desirable than other platforms as discussed above. This in effect creates a high value onramp for new users to the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. Users will be able to use Rakugo tokens within the ecosystem to pay for services if they wish as well as transact BTC and ETH to make micropayments within Rakugo.   When comparing us to Medium, for example. We will be offering a deeper and much more comprehensive suite of publishing, copyright protection, and monetization options. None of which are currently available on Medium. There is a very active community of users who are against this lack of copyright protection on Medium – read this blog (https://medium.com/@Haje/copyright-just-because-i-have-an-rss-feed-it-doesnt-mean-you-get-to-steal-my-content-c8ea505a8b07). It is also important to note that Medium grew from 140% to 60M users in under 12 months – read this article (https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/14/medium-grows-140-to-60-million-monthly-visitors/), therefore our growth targets in this market are in fact not that aggressive given the market size and opportunity. Medium does not have a clear strategy for revenue and growth – we do!  BAT is fundamentally different as a platform, we are not redefining the ad market and believe that there are people better positioned than us to solve this problem. BAT being a great example. We are going to be looking to establish partnerships to bring this technology to Rakugo as and when the time and opportunity is right.  I hope this addresses you questions and feel free to ask any more. I will also be publishing your questions on our blog for the community to read.  Best,  Brendan",False

The name comes from the Japanese word Rakugo (The Art of Storytelling) which we thought was apt given that we are building a platform that allows publishers to showcase and tell their stories.  We are designing the product and UI/UX so there will be little to no barrier to entry for people who have no experience in crypto and knowledge of crypto will not be needed to publish on Rakugo. Therefore, publishers on the platform will not need to have deep experience in crypto to benefit from its features. Royalty payments will be made in cryptocurrency and we will be partnering with payment processors to offer different payout options for publishers where they want it. We expect to have to work on education and onboarding for some of the deeper features in the product such as the marketplace. We think that there is a great opportunity for a company to build blockchain intrinsically into a product in the way that we are that gives a steady on-ramp for new people getting exposure to cryptocurrency.  Thanks for the questions and I think that it is worth doing a blog post on the question you asked. I will a write and post one this week and publish a more in depth answer to your question. Feel free to join our Slack or Telegram to get in touch directly.  Brendan",False

Digital Copyright - with our platform we sign all content that is published with a digital fingerprint that is stored on the blockchain. This creates an immutable record of copyright that can be transferred using blockchain. This is a big pain point for all online publishers, where content is repeatedly used without permission, reducing its value and impact.  2.  Monetization - for a lot of online publishers the barrier to entry for monetization is very high. Using decentralized a transparent system such as blockchain to process payments of royalties it is more efficient and simpler to scale royalty distributions in a secure way.  Again I will write an in depth blog post, and do a quick video blog about this so there is more details and in depth answers.  Best,  Brendan",False

We are designing the product to have two tiers of user experience.  Tier 1 will be a fully integrated experience for the user, whereby the benefits of being built on blockchain are an implicit and integrated feature in the product. This will mean that users will start to understand what blockchain technology is by experiencing its benefits as an integral part of using our platform. We can see a huge opportunity here for education and user adoption into the blockchain space on a mass scale.  Tier 2 will be for power users, people more familiar with blockchain technology, and enterprise publishers (we are in discussions with one of the biggest publishers in the US about forming a development partnership at the moment).
