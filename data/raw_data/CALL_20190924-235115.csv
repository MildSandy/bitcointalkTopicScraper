Recently they were trying to move from Erc20 to a Komodo blockchain and their Telegram had a bot with instructions.  So they disappeared and yesterday a Komodo community member tried to contact them. He received the answer that what was stated on the website about the 12 million dollars was not true. Nobody actually invested in the Ico and that they were trying to get this project off the ground in hopes of gaining more interest and developers but it never happened, so just simply closed everything down. The few swaps from Erc20 to Komodo, they say, were just bounty hunters and not from real investors in the ICO. People in Telegram were fake.  Personally I find it hard to believe that there are no real investors scammed, even if the amount is way way lower than 12 million. Is it possible?
