Implementing AI at the heart of the Blockchain NeuroChain is Intelligent ecosystem more secure, more reliable and much faster than Blockchain  What is NeuroChain? NeuroChain is an evolution of the Blockchain that integrates machine learning and AI to drastically improve the performance and capabilities of distributed systems. It’s a technological platform specifically designed to carry collective AI applications.  NeuroChain is the future of Blockchain NeuroChain’s cutting edge technology is based on years of extensive scientific research. It relies on 4 key concepts to go above and beyond the regular capabilities of Blockchain.  ✔️ It’s powered by INTELLIGENT, ultra-fast, secure and reliable bots The bots act independently and use machine learning algorithms to get better and better as time goes by.  ✔️ It’s an ECOSYSTEM of collective artificial intelligence The bots work seamlessly together thanks to the Proof of Workflow protocol. The whole network of bots makes up the NeuroChain environment, an ecosystem of connected AI that get more virtuous as it gets used.  ✔️ It performs better thanks to a clever DECISION protocol Instead of relying like Blockchain on Proof of Work – that requires an enormous amount of brute computing power –, NeuroChain uses a Proof of Involvement and Integrity protocol to achieve the best performance from a limited number of bots.  ✔️ It’s an OPEN SOURCE initiative NeuroChain is designed as a base on which to build intelligent applications. The power lies in the community that unites under the NeuroChain banner.  NeuroChain’s strengths Intelligent Applications: Forget smart contracts, which force you to lay down all the possible outcomes in advance. Think intelligent applications, where AI is now embedded into the contract. NeuroChain’s architecture was designed to carry intelligent applications from the start. The scope of potential intelligent applications is endless. Reliability: NeuroChain favors quality over quantity, Intelligent bots over brute computer processing. Incredible Speed: Thousands of times faster than the regular Blockchain. Security: NeuroChain doesn’t rely on external validation (i.e. mining farms), the consensus comes from within the NeuroChain network.  ICO DETAILS **ICO has ended** NeuroChain ICO WAS LIVE until the 15th of April, 2018. Token Price: 1 NCC = 0,10€ (ETH was pegged at a price of 502€ in order to protect our investors from the market fluctuations) Token Supply: Post-ICO, the circulating supply started at 156,000,000 with over a 4,374,000,000 total supply created.  About us Based in Paris, France (EU), the NeuroChain project unites experts in their fields – Blockchain, distributed systems, machine learning, big data, security, marketing,… – around a common goal: to make the world a better place by leveraging the power of NeuroChain. Two core members of the NeuroChain team wrote the first extensive French language book on Blockchain back in 2016. NeuroChain relies on cutting-edge innovations in consensus, communication, analysis, distributed abstraction and security. Keeping a very close technological watch is therefore paramount in order to track the latest technological evolutions. Moreover, NeuroChain is designed to be very flexible, allowing for a swift implementation of technological innovations. A NeuroChain prototype is already up and running on GitHub.

Even though the roadmap is longer than most ico’s, in which many over promise and under deliver, it appears necessary for an undertaking of this magnitude. If successful, this could be one of the next major advancements of the blockchain.  Risks     The launch of the main net isn’t scheduled until March 2019. In other words, investors can expect a very long business cycle before NCC starts making waves. -2     Only 15% of tokens are available for purchase. This means a lot of tokens will flood the market in some way, lesseningthe value by increasing the supply. Token n holders can therefore play a huge role in moving token value one way or the other.  –1.5     The team, similar to most ICOs today, has outside obligations that will detract from full attention to NeuroChain. In fact, it’s a bit concerning that so many people treat ICOs – which are full-fledged businesses – as side projects.-1  Growth Potential     NeuroChain has a large team with sufficient knowledge and experience capable in all aspects of developing and bringing the project successfully to market. That being said, we need to keep in mind of the team’s outside obligations and whether this will detract from the overall project. +4     The project is developing new technology that could smart contracts with intelligent applications that can learn dynamically from operations.
