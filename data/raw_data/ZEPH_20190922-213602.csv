Our last product update was the release of Sendy's closed Beta. You gave tons of positive and constructive feedback which we included in our new release. Now we bring you Sendy 2.0 (Beta) available on the Google Play store - open for public download for everyone.  For those of you who don't know, let us give you some background.  Sendy is a financial freedom App for the unbanked using crypto. This journey began in 2014 having conduced the world's first cash in, cash out money transfer with Bitcoin. Sendy's purpose is to enable anyone world wide to send, receive and earn money all from one App. Since our official launch in 2017, it was time Sendy was improved to match what our customers wanted.  Much of the reason crypto is not used by many is because it has blatant usability issues. Crypto products for the unbanked miss that they aren't tech people. They are very much everyday people trying to transfer value as cheap and easily as possible. Not a small feat even for the existing money transfer space - we have all experienced the exorbitant costs of Western Union and others.  Sendy fixes the fungibility issues making crypto transactions real to the everyday user. By removing adoption hurdles and prioritising experience and function - sending, receiving and crypto liquidation has been made easy for everyone.

The Bitspark platform was created in Nov 2014 after the team conducted the world's first cash in, cash out cryptocurrency transfer.  Fast forward, the Bitspark network now connects eight high vol remittance countries including Philippines, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ghana, Vietnam and more ensuring customers can leverage the low costs of cross boarder remittances via crypto through our products without any tech knowledge necessary.  In October, Bitspark launched its Zephyr ICO which raised 1.3M. The tradable rewards token has a positive feedback loop where Bitspark grows its network by issuing $ZEPH as rewards to Money Transfer Businesses = more transactions and Bitspark using 25% from the profits per txn to buy back from the $ZEPH market.  So what now? Bitspark is in the midsts of integrating $ZEPH / buyback mechanism into products and services in time for the first United Nations Tajikistan pilot. The buyback and integration is not contingent on Tajikistan going through. E.g as soon as the mechanism is ready it will be using any transactions through Bitspark's  existing network .   Lots in the pipeline! Stay tuned.",False

Problem  Money Transfer Operators (MTOs) are bricks and mortar cash locations to send and receive money on behalf of their customers and are the backbone of the $600billion remittance industry. As banks continue ‘de-risking’ worldwide they are shutting down MTO’s bank accounts at no fault of the MTO who, without a bank account, has little access to world currencies and cannot send money for their customers ultimately being forced to close their business.  Solution  Project Zephyr will enable MTOs and remittance customers to have access to 180+ fiat pegged cryptocurrencies through Bitspark’s existing mobile app Sendy (2017) and web platform (2014) which is switching to Bitshares for settlement.  Participants of Project Zephyr will be rewarded with Zephyr tokens for doing economically beneficial actions for Bitspark’s remittance network such as sending and receiving money, referring others, top ups and liquidating MTO balances. With every successful transaction on Bitspark’s network, 25% of the service fee will over time be used to buy back Zephyr Tokens from the market on the Bitshares DEX creating positive price pressure.      ->Website<-  Social  → Telegram Discord Reddit Twitter Facebook BitcoinTalk BitsharesTalk <--  Project Zephyr has already begun   This May, Bitspark with the United Nations Development Program did a mission to Tajikistan, a country with poor banking infrastructure, large internet and mobile penetration and a steep reliance on remittances that makes up on average 30% of its GDP. After extensive research in the region, Bitspark announced that Tajikistan will be the first country to be added to Project Zephyr with Tajikistan as its first pilot country in collaboration with UNDP.

The sale is capped and has tiered pricing, 30% of tokens will be available to public as per the white paper schedule with the remainder held by the company to issue Zephyr as a reward or for sales related activities. A small amount will also be available for the team on a set 2 year vesting schedule. Accepting BTC, ETH and BTS as payment for Zephyr during the sale period and as Zephyr will be launched on Bitshares we will enable wallets for buyers to deposit their coins to make the purchase rather than a standard Ethereum sale with a contract address. All customer deposit addresses are unique and payments should ONLY be made to the address in your zephyr.bitspark.io account.  The Zephyr token sale accounts, balances and logins are functionally separate to our existing accounts at Bitspark.io until such stage as we may merge them after the sale but please note Zephyr will only be available at zephyr.bitspark.io during the sale. Following closing of the sale, Bitspark will be enabling withdrawals where we will advise our customers to withdraw Zephyr to their own Bitshares account.",False
