On March 1st, 2018, LeadCoin had a successful Token Sale reaching the hard cap of $50 million within minutes of opening the crowdsale.  Turning leads into secure digital assets, LeadCoin produces a collaborative business economy by empowering consumers to share their data, and businesses to sell their unused leads, and buy hot leads from other businesses. LeadCoin’s matching algorithm analyzes and matches leads to buyers. Leads who didn’t match one business, can now be the perfect match for another. Blockchain technology and Ethereum Smart Contracts enable these transparent, secure and trusted transactions between anonymous businesses to be performed in real-time, with no middleman. All transactions are done using LeadCoin’s token, the LDC, hence, every token holder has an interest in the growth of LeadCoin.
