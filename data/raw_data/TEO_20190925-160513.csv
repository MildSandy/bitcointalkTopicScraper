Here's an example of how the community itself will resolve the price.  Hipothetically we collect 1000 BTC during the ICO. It means now that final price of our TEO token is 1000btc divided by 100'000'000 which equals 0,00001 BTC per TEO. Ff we collect twice the amount the price per TEO will be 0,00002 BTC and the reason to this is fixed supply, all tokens will be premined and sent to investors' wallets after the ICO ends.
