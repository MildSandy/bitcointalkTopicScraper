We are here to level the playing field; We believe small, personal, local changes are bound to lead to bigger shifts in the society. Thatâ€™s why we want to make sure every voice has a chance to be heard, every idea has enough fuel to get off the ground.    To remove any barriers for the spirit of giving, we created a place where ordinary people can raise money without actually paying money from their pockets. PowerShare is where crowdfunding meets mining for cryptocurrencies - simply by keeping a browser tab open, visitors can convert unused computing power to fund ideas and causes which are important to them or others. And while our algorithm runs to power up a chosen cause, supporters also generate a steady stream of income which turns helping others into a mutually beneficial enterprise. By revolutionizing fundraising, we exist to provide means to change for anyone willing to do so.  powershare.fund",False

Also backers have full control over their CPU contribution. Thanks for this interesting question and sorry for delayed answer as we are small team and super busy, sometimes we cant keep an eye on every platform.
