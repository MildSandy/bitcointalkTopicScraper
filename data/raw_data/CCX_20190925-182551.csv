As the first on the market, we have introduced a system of sharing profit with active members. The product is ready in beta version.  The shareholders of our exchange are the owners of our CCX tokens, which are based on the decentralized Ethereum blockchain (ERC-20). The CoinCasso project is a holistic and democratic solution created for the community. One of the ways to implement this idea is rewarding users for their actions and developing the industry. In this situation, we have decentralized and democratized management of a quick centralized exchange. Bitcoin mining works in approximately the same way - users are rewarded for maintaining the network.  CoinCasso.com - It is a partially centralized exchange, where the users have the decentralized, democratized impact on operations.  CoinCasso gives users democratic opportunities to add their coins and personal tokens. It helps with promoting both personal and corporate tokens. What‚Äôs more, CoinCasso is more than just an exchange, it is a multi-layer product. The profit which we share with active users will come from the following parts of the project: ‚ñ† CoinCasso Exchange 2.0, ‚ñ† CoinCasso Pay Wallet App, ‚ñ† Quick exchange, ‚ñ† Payment gateway, ‚ñ† A network of ATMs, ‚ñ† PoS - payment terminal.   Core features of CoinCasso Exchange 2.0: ‚óè A powerful number of transactions per second with the possibility of increasing this amount in times of overload ‚óè Trade margin ‚óè 9 Types of order in a trading ‚óè Optimised UI/UX ‚óè Trusted ICO/STO Provider ‚óè Profits and bonuses for CCX holders ‚óè Currency FIAT, Corporate/Personal tokens supported ‚óè 24/7 Users Support ‚óè High-Security Level  Quick buy and sell This service will give the opportunity to express the exchange of FIAT and digital currencies. Next, it will be connected to our proprietary API, which will also facilitate the exchange and processing of transactions with merchants and our ATM network. It will be also the most friendly exchange environment for beginners.  Fee Structure  Low transactional percentages for our users will allow for a large number of transactions. Standard commissions for each transaction amount to 0.25%. - Taker fee: 0,25% - Maker fee: 0,25%  CCX-POWER holders and partners will exempt from trading fees up to 50%  FIAT Currency  We will accept PLN, USD, EUR, GBP but in the future, we plan to add even more FIAT currencies. The project is fully licensed, which gives us a lot more possibilities in the field of FIAT currency exchange. The ability to exchange all tokens on FIAT with just one click.  Payment Gateway  Fully compatible with API, it will change virtually every website, including this built on WordPress, to the possibility of making payments in cryptocurrencies. Our development plan has the scope of creating our own payment gateway as well as plug-ins for the most popular and extensive merchant systems such as WOOCOMMERCE, PRESTASHOP, SHOPIFY or OPENCART.  Acceptable tokens  The platform enables and supports the conduct of Trusted ICO. We help companies wanting to bring tokens into the world with sales. CoinCasso guarantees ICO control of the company, obtaining tokens and reviewing smart contracts to meet ICO conditions. After a successful campaign, the tokens go to the exchange for bidding. All new coin lists outside the initial ones require additional evaluation. CCX holders will have the right to vote and decide which of the planned tokens they want. Coins of an entirely new project or less known in global markets will be added on demand in the first place in pairs to CCX. If you or your project is based or a token or coin and you have a problem placing it on the market, this is another reason why you should get a CCX.  Affiliates - partners  The promotion costs are very high, which is why we have created an affiliate program for our verified users who, by recommending our platform, will be able to benefit from participation in profits generated by registered members. By this feature, we will be able to gain even more customers faster and expand the society, finally grow volume and we will generate higher profits for the whole company.
