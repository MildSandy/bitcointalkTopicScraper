During the planning stage we made the decision to send out VIP rewards (which includes the DEV rewards) every 1000 blocks, which would be just shy of 1440, or every 24 hours.  This was in consideration of the fact that had we sent every block, it would be unneeded blockchain bloat.  Instead we multiplied the per-block VIP reward * 1000 and baked in all of the addresses - including the dev payout.  Later on in testing, we decided we could safely pay out every 100 blocks.  The rewards were adjusted in the list of VIPs, however the dev fund was not.  What this means is the DEV rewards have been overpaid an amount of 40,000 KINGS. We were aware of this shortly after the change, but did not want to interrupt the release of the new updated client. In the latest update this issue has been fixed. At the time of writing this announcement, we are on block 40559.  The KINGS supply is 7493852.53421276.  Because of this we are announcing that 45,000 KINGS will be burned shortly after this post. After the burn, the KINGS supply will reflect the burnt amount.  We will be making a post after the burn has taken place with the new KINGS supply. Also, you can type 'getinfo' in your wallet and the KINGS supply has now been added in. We felt that being as open and transparent as possible would be the best thing for the community.

The process so far has been this: step 1) working wallet/staking/masternode functionality to insure all payouts (vip, pos, masternode) are working in a stable manner, while working on backend/frontend logic for decentralized betting on a sandboxed environment. step 2) rebranding from xsb to kng, continued work on backend/frontend logic. step 3) initial work on full rebrand of website in addition to finishing betting skin for the first pass of design polish. step 4) rollout of new kng client that has betting functionality but not 100% of the games and lower max wagers for user testing step 5) bug fixes and feedback which will influence first pass of design polish step 6) release of first pass design polish + major public rollout  (higher betting cap all sports etc) step 7) more features + more design polish based on further feedback  We are currently at step 4, which should not be that much longer away, to the MVP based on the work that has gone in. Hopefully by the end of the month if things go well. Please keep in mind however, users are already able to stake/run masternodes and everything, so it isn't as if the client is not working or anything.  I hope this gives everyone a greater understanding of where we are at. As far as screenshots, we feel that showing anything too early might not present the best face, but once we have the MVP up and get user feedback we will be able to start a much better dialog regarding this, because we imagine once we release there will be great many changes.  Please join us in our Telegram chat https://t.me/kings_ag if you would like to talk more, also please download the client and take a look at it since it is available already https://github.com/betkings/kings-core/releases",False

We will be ending the ICO on december 20th at 11:59pm EST, at the moment the release schedule for the wallet is still on track.
