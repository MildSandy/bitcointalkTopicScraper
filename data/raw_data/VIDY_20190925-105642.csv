Our tri-layer solution built on the blockchain will be the win-win-win that this broken industry needs to fairly reward all participanrs, augment video ad relevance, and cut out the troublesome middlemen that have erected an opaque, fraudulent, and abusive status quo.  In 2017 the Vidy team found a way around this decades-long problem,  end  we’ve  been racing ever since to make our solution a reality. We believe  we can allow  the online  ad ecosystem to have its cake and eat it too by aligning incenrives for all parties. With our answer, people won’t need to unwillingly forfeit rheir privacy anymore, can rightfully be rewarded for powering the ad industry with their attention, and ad publishers  will  make  more  money  than they do now on video ads by unlocUng a whole new frontier for video ad inventory.",False

Publisher / Advertiser Dashboard  Publishers and advertisers get acccess to a dashboard where they can manage their campaigns and upload their video advertisements. They can adjust live campaigns, view statistics on each campaign and individual video ad’s performance, and see analyrics on users and publishers to evaluate how they are performing and iterate copy and creative accordingly.   Video Ads  Circular hyper-relevant tiny videos that pop up while holding down on Vidylinks.  Application Layer  The application layer is the consumer-facing distributor of video ads across the web, encapsulated in an SDK that can be installed with just a tap by any publisher.  Indexed Websites  Vidy indexes hundreds of millions site pages and parses the natural language on screen for matching against the NLP Protocol. This becomes the total available inventory for ad placement on live ad campaigns.  Consensus Layer  The consensus layer receives user data along with ad performance information from the data layer and processes it as inputs in the placement-scripts that it runs. This is done in conjunction with decrypting the smart contracts that are handed off for user-data target application.  Data Layer  The data layer is the foundation of the Vidy Ad distribution platform, concurrently communicating with the application consensus layers, and transparently maintaining all incoming data in the immutable Vidy ledger. The data layer maintains a record of all embed placements, hold times, VidyCoin payouts, VidyCoin staked balances, and all VidyCoin transactions via the application layer’s one-tap purchase modal.  Hold To Earn VidyCoin  For the first time ever, when you see a Vidylink and hold down to watch that vidy ad, you earn money.Vidy compensates you with VidyCoin (VIDY) for each second that you hold down. The longer you hold, the more you earn. You can even make a purchase on that video using your VidyCoin with just one tap.",False

On both mobile and desktop, now advertisers have a one-size fits all model to creare and upload their creatives, and publishers don’t need ro worry abour a pleAora of inventory sizes and specifications that they must bend their own web page to accommodate for. Users have just one way of viewing NLP embedded video ads and know exactly what to expect every time they see a Vidylink on the text of a page they are reading.   How Vidy solves, slow Page Loads  Vidy’s invention has no requirement to immediately load visible banner ads into open spaces on an integrated publisher page. Instead, all of Vidy’s video ads are pre-loaded behind the text of the page as Vidylinks, and therefore beyond the field of view of the visitor. This allows Vidy to employ measures such as smart caching strategies, and anticipatory queue downloading as a user scrolls on the page. Slow page loads are one less thing publishers need to worry about for their digital experience with Vidy.   How Vidy solves, Irrelevant Ads  Vidy employs a purist approach to the distribution of video ads, letting natural language protocols determine all contextual matches that it makes. The consensus layer then integrates a decrypted smart contract of each visiting user’s profile data to determine which videos from the NPP-designated set of matches are the most relevant for that user on that page. By containerizing all user data in smart contracrs, Vidy safeguards and validares user information and ensures that user profiles can never leak ro a third party, and can never be sold via the platform’s data layer. With a sysrem of checks and balances like this, communication   between an advertiser and publisher is secure and precise not because some tompany in the middle tells us so, but because we know it to be so through trust-less decentralization.   How Vidy solves, banner Ad Stigmatization  With Vidvlinks, users get to choose what they want to hold down and watch, and what they want to skip as they consume the content on a page. By empowering people to choose, yet incentivizing them financially to hold down on what they are interested in, Vidy can capture the hearts of users who otherwise do not trust advertisers anymore. Users can now rest assured that there is a decentralized buffer operaring between the advertiser and publisher via the embed layer, thereby ensuring that their hold will always deliver a video in the same format, UX, and appearance that they expect. When you trust something, you have a greater proclivity to use it more.",False

Users can now collect VidyCoin based on their respective activity and repeat engagement on the embed layer.

The advertiser then gets access to a dashboard where they can manage their campaigns and upload their video advertisements. All uploaded video advertisements are transcribed ro determine the words said in them, and subsequently run through a convolutional neural network to segment out speakers in preparation of being embedded into corresponding text.  The advertiser then lists up to 10 keywords that embody their video advertisement, and designates the campaign dates, preferred target demographic (if available), and how much ad spend to allocate to its campaign. All ad spend is automatically credited from their VidyCoin wallet balance at the end of each day. If they are a Platinum tier advertiser, they can also designate which publishers that they prefer to advertise with, and which they prefer to avoid. When the campaign is ready, the advertiser hits the “Go Live” button and from there the consensus layer has access to advertiser X’s new video ads for adjudication on placement in available publisher inventory.  On the dashboard the advertiser can adjust live campaigns, view statistics  on each campaign and individual video ad’s performance, and see analytics on users and publishers to evaluate how they are performing and iterate copy and creative accordingly.  Publisher Y signs up to Vidy, connects their wallet and selects ‘Allow’ to share all pages on their site with the Vidy indexer. The Vidy indexer powers the consensus layer’s matching script by scanning for natural language on each publisher page against  the keywords  and  transcriptions of possible ads. Publisher Y is then prompted to enter keywords of ads that are most relevant to their platform as a whole, as well as specific keywords relevant to each individual page they publish with Vidy’s application layer integrated. These keywords become another input for the consensus layer to evaluate when matching relevant ads to the natural language of a publisher page. The publisher receives a similar dashboard  to that of the advertiser where they can see all pages indexed, all currently embedded vidys, and add and remove vidys at any time. The dashboard will show performance statistics of each embed and allow any page ro have ads turned on or off. When user Z visits Publisher Ys page, Publisher Y shares user Z’s demographic information via a secure smart contract with Vidy’s consensus layer. This handoff occurs as soon as the user reaches the site, so that the consensus layer has time to use the decrypted user data to filter ads for placement behind the text before the user or the publisher experiences a delay in experience. Miners driving the consensus layer then place the most relevant ads behind the linked text that they will be activated on within that publisher’s page.  As user Z holds down on the video ad, the application layer records hold  time and  reports it to  the data layer’s ledger for calculation of VidyCoin payout to both the publisher and the user. The advertiser’s VidyCoin balance is subsequently credited at the end of the day based on hold time performance. The data layer also stores and processes data on which ads were held and which were skipped to then pass along to Vidy’s AI engine for further user profile precision learning.",False

The advertiser then gets access to a dashboard where they can manage their campaigns and upload their video advertisements. All uploaded video advertisements are transcribed ro determine the words said in them, and subsequently run through a convolutional neural network to segment out speakers in preparation of being embedded into corresponding text.  The advertiser then lists up to 10 keywords that embody their video advertisement, and designates the campaign dates, preferred target demographic (if available), and how much ad spend to allocate to its campaign. All ad spend is automatically credited from their VidyCoin wallet balance at the end of each day. If they are a Platinum tier advertiser, they can also designate which publishers that they prefer to advertise with, and which they prefer to avoid. When the campaign is ready, the advertiser hits the “Go Live” button and from there the consensus layer has access to advertiser X’s new video ads for adjudication on placement in available publisher inventory.  As user Z holds down on the video ad, the application layer records hold  time and  reports it to  the data layer’s ledger for calculation of VidyCoin payout to both the publisher and the user. The advertiser’s VidyCoin balance is subsequently credited at the end of the day based on hold time performance. The data layer also stores and processes data on which ads were held and which were skipped to then pass along to Vidy’s AI engine for further user profile precision learning.  ",False

Vidy is the first decentralized video ad distributor that embeds video ads behind the text of web pages via an NLP consensus-layer.  FOREWORD  Vidy aspires to bring the 600 million people using ad blockers back into the market. We will accomplish this by decentralizing a new form of innovative and judicious video advertising.   WHAT IS THE VIDY LAYER?  Vidy has invented the first single-page invisible embed layer for video, run on the Ethereum blockchain.Vidy constructs a ledger system that measures how long a user watches an ad thanks to hold tracking technology on its embed layer. Vidy then rewards publishers and users accordingly for holding down on ads with VidyCoins, taken as a fraction of the VidyCoin payout made from advertiser to publisher for that video ad impression.  With just a hold, users can now reveal tiny hyper-relevant videos hidden behind the text of any page on the web, unlocking a whole new dimension to the internet.   VIDY'S TRI-LAYER SOLUTION  Vidy has built the world’s first invisible embed layer that rests silently atop any website in the world, powered by the Ethereum blockchain. Vidy’s patent-pending invention allows publishers to embed a tiny video into the text of their site, letting their users hold down on that linked text to reveal supporting video for literally anything that is printed online. The user never leaves the page.  Vidy constructs a ledger system that measures how long a user watches an ad thanks to hold tracking technology on its embed layer. Vidy then rewards publishers and users accordingly for holding down on ads with VidyCoins, taken as a fraction of the VidyCoin payout made from advertiser to publisher for that video ad impression.   THE FIRST OPEN NLP PROTOCOL  Vidy’s ad placement mechanism is a proprietary open-source NLP protocol that automatically places video ads on a massive scale into the hyper-relevant text of millions of publisher pages.  This open NLP protocol is run by miners who are compensated with VidyCoin for each successful placement and corresponding decryption of a visitor’s data profile which is locked in a smart contract. Vidy analyzes and indexes trillions of words of text on publisher pages across the internet and matches them through its AI-powered deep natural language understanding models with parsed and transcribed advertiser videos.   SELECTED PARTNERS  Some partnerships are for specific countries or with specific terms or pre-terms stage.    WHY WE CREATED VIDY    HOLD TO EARN VIDYCOIN  For the first time ever, when you see a Vidylink and hold down to watch that vidy ad, you earn money. Vidy compensates you with VidyCoin(VIDY) for each second that you hold down. The longer you hold, the more you earn. You can even make a purchase on that video using your VidyCoin with just one tap.    USING VIDY  VidyCoin (VIDY) derives its utility in 3 main ways. You earn VIDY every time you hold down on an ad, you use VIDY to make purchases in one tap on ads, and VIDY is required to stake as fuel for all ad campaigns on the platform .     VIDY DISTRIBUTION    USE OF PROCEEDS    THE VIDY TEAM  The Vidy story begins at Harvard, where Patrick Colangelo founded the company in his dorm room.  Today, Vidy boasts a world-class engineering team based in San Francisco with team members who have previously sold their own companies, amassed 10s of millions of users, patented multi-million dollar inventions, and have enjoyed decades of successes in the software development world.  The Vidy team has been together for years, bonded by mutual admiration, friendship, and ambition to build a platform that can truly change human lives for the better.    ADVISORS     ROADMAP",False
