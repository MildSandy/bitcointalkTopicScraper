The first was that Decentralized Autonomous Organizations are the most important use case of the blockchain after currency, and the second was that it is impossible to predict what these DAOs will look like, and that there will be a fast evolution of them. As a consequence, we decided to build Arc, a platform for launching DAOs on the Ethereum network similar to ERC20 tokens for ICO projects.  https://medium.com/daostack/the-arc-platform-2353229a32fc (For more information on Arc)  More exciting news from DAOstack HQ:  1.

There is no staking for airdrops or other token rewards, but you can stake GEN to boost proposals within our voting protocol (or prevent the boosting of proposals).

I remember when Lisk fell after the ICO, people got mad at the team for not doing anything. There were even people demanding that the Lisk team would put up buy walls with the collected funds to keep the price from dropping. Here's the thing, though: devs have no business getting involved in price action. Yes, they probably should get involved in exchange listings, but they'll most likely sign NDAs, so you can't know what the current status is. Maybe they are negotiating with exchanges, who knows.  This is a very complex matter. Let me point out that I am well aware of your disappointment as ICO investors. You have a right to be disappointed. But you don't have a right to deny your own responsibility and take it out on others. You chose to invest in this project.

Because of this problem, GEN has lost more than 80%. Many ICO investor just wants to save his/her money which they have invested at GEN. They don't care about the current situation of the project. They will sell and never return again. If there is no community the quality of the project doesn't make any sense. The community and the quality of the project are strong with together. GEN was the only red coin in my portfolio yesterday and still no hope for the rise of the price. 40-50 ETH daily total volume is unacceptable. Nearly no one is aware of the project.  After the ICO the team didn't want to (or not make enough effort) list the token. And during the ICO there was no personal cap. The result is low volume with high sell pressure without demand and 80% lost.  In the future, no one will remember the quality of the project. The only thing will be remembered will be the loss.",True

Decentralized autonomous organizations or DAOs are the company of the future - there is no point of failure, no downtime, no need for office or formal employees. One big problem with top-down hierarchy is that they contain concentrated failure points, because the individual can be subject to bad influence, bad actions, or poor judgment. Also, the interests of some powerful people are often out of alignment with less powerful people, so decision-makers often provide incentives to act against the common good. An interesting alternative has emerged in the form of a movement toward decentralization, in which peer networks organize themselves to act collectively without such concentrated centers of power. One such type of organization has been known as DAO, or a decentralized autonomous organization. In DAO, peer networks encode their protocols for decision-making into blockchain, and that depends on smart contracts - usually run on the Ethereum network - to become referees who count and carry out the will of the people.",True

The conceptual angle here is that DAOstack is an open-source modular framework that can be used like a toolkit for other projects depending on their needs.
