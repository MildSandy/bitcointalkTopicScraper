Website | Discord | Whitepaper | Facebook | Twitter | Reddit | Telegram chat | Telegram ANN | Medium | GitHub  BUFF‚Äôs decentralized gaming loyalty platform is a groundbreaking crypto-economy ecosystem-based only on gamers‚Äô merits, in which gamers earn and allocate BUFF coins in direct correlation to their progress, achievements and time spent gaming, regardless of their hardware capabilities.  --------------------------------------------------------  Through its extensive network of co-operation with different gaming platforms, BUFF will enable holders of BUFF tokens to purchase virtual goods across multiple gaming brands; trade with other holders and gamers, and easily convert the BUFF coins to other currencies via BUFF‚Äôs wallet, which is based on blockchain technology for maximal security and transparency.  BUFF is using Blockchain Technology to build its own decentralized ‚Äúmileage/token economy‚Äù for gamers across all games worldwide, fueled by its own issued cryptocurrency: the BUFF coin.  --------------------------------------------------------  BUFF has decided to join forces with Overwolf, a world-leading provider of open software platforms for mobile and desktop gaming apps, as a major strategic partner in the gaming industry.   --------------------------------------------------------  WHY WE BUILT THIS  The gaming industry reaches billions of users across various channels ‚Äì mobile, desktop, and consoles  via thousands of gaming brands, each with its own ecosystem of rewards, experience gains, and in-game purchases. However ‚Äì there is no existing platform in the industry that functions as a Global Loyalty program which rewards participants across the various platforms and brands.  --------------------------------------------------------  The BUFF logic  1. A gamer joins the BUFF loyalty plan/ecosystem via mobile or desktop app- it‚Äôs free, secure, anonymous and inclusive for all.  2. The initial onboarding will allow the BUFF platform to access the gamer‚Äôs account and track experience and achievements, adding coins the more the user plays and allowing the redemption of coins as the balance permits.  3. From now on, each action in any BUFF-aligned game will seamlessly reward the gamer with BUFF coins.  --------------------------------------------------------  Roadmap  BUFF MVP product is already in development with a version 1.0 scheduled for release in May 2018. This version will already support major game economies from tier-1 publishers, with an emphasis on major eSports brands.  The BUFF ICO is scheduled for Q2 2018. The use of the raised funds is to complete, launch and promote BUFF.  The ICO soft cap is set at $10M and the hard cap at $30M.
