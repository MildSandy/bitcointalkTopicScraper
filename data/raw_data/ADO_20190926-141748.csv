Publishers will have to buy ADO tokens via exchanges in order to run an advertising campaign.  Quote from: penoze on March 16, 2018, 12:59:40 PM Watching adCircle now, the idea is further cool. Alone the softcap of 25 million dollars is a lot in my opinion.  Is there already an working beta product to show and when there is an product is it then easy to use for to take an example for WordPress sites  Thanks for your interest. We plan on releasing a beta version around May to help us test the platform before the public release in July. For your second question, using adCircle will be very easy. Publishers will be able to login to their dashboard where they can copy a piece of code and add it to their website where they want ads to appear. Much like you would do if you was to use google adsense, a similar process.",False

They can buy ADO tokens from an exchange or via the adCircle website for the current market price. Once they have funds in their adCircle account they can then create an ad campaign by filling out a simple form about the product they want to advertise. This gathers information about their product like ad title, URL, images etc. If an advertiser runs out of funds in their adCircle account their ad campaigns will automatically pause until they topup their account with ADO.",False
