On a closer look it will be a bit more complex as we combining also the power of an upvote system as Steemit.com uses it (maybe in a different way than Steemit)  with the power of licensing your media (videos & photos) to sell the license for commercial usage (you don't have to license your media but you can do that).  But the most important part is that no one than you (the uploader) will own the media,  if you compare that to the big companies out there as you mentioned for example Instagram then you see that we want to change the pure monopoly and the fact that the photos you upload to Instagram are free to use for Instagram as you give them some rights of your media.

Current blockchain technology doesn't offer fast solutions which could match existing client server technologies and be scale-able enough. This is why our solution will be a hybrid of client server solutions and blockchian.  Blockchain application will only be responsible for important and crucial components like user registration, upvoting, rewards and financial transactions. In addition every blockchain data already in existence will be mirrored on client server components in essence cached for quick access.  As solutions like bigchainDb and Swarm mature, we will possibly integrate them. We are also in the process of researching of our own blockchain Pos solution to allow for fee-free usage of blockchain. Obviously with millions of users, even small fees would be adding up.  We will be also adding an affiliate program to our platform which will pay rewards in tokens easily convertible into other crypto currencies. I've bee involved in affiliate programs for last 15 years.  Bogdan Fiedur",False

Let me clear some things up:  1) We know about Social yes. We didn't know about Social when we started this project.   Discussion ended, Social is a competitor and competitors are good for business.   You can as well list Steemit.com if you want or Instagram.com to not focus too much on Social.  2) About the pictures, we love the style. If you don't like it fine.  Connect with me via Linkedin https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianjosephs/   .  3) We are not perfect yet you are right, but we far away from a SCAM.  4)  Self MoD is needed as you see how competitors FUD your post hard.  I told my Team not to delete 99% of the bad posts here, but we will not allow people to promote their ICO (Social).  Let's have a constructive discussion here please.  Thanks, Christian",False
