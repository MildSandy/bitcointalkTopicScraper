Betmatch offers the original social solution for players and betting-related community by combining two (betting house and social betting) business models, aimed to build a durable solution for the emerging cryptocurrency-based betting market.  Unlike pure peer-to-peer and social betting platforms, Betmatch users will be able to place bets against other people or the Betmatch itself, and they will get a guaranteed payout in case of win. This will be possible due to existence of Betmatch liquidity pool, which allows the platform to back up any bet placed by the user, unlike peer-to-peer betting platforms, where players need not only to place a bet on the winning team, but also have others players place bets with the same amount of money on the opposite outcome.  Another major advantage of the Betmatch solution is the ability of players to place bets in generally accepted cryptocurrency, not in platform-specific tokens. All transactions will be secured and executed using smart contracts feature of the Ethereum blockchain.",False

Within the system, the customers' funds can be withdrawn back only to their ETH wallet in case of a win or a return of the bet. In the event of a bet loss, the funds are transferred to other players who have won within the given market or liquidity pool.

People in and out of the industry spread rumors, half-truths and straight lies about betting just because they sound right in their opinion and it can help saving face while explaining the reasons for unsuccessful  bets. It is much easier to blame somebody else for losing than accepting that your analysis was wrong or that the luck was not on your side today. These myths and misconceptions distort the true idea of sports betting, and it becomes difficult to delineate myths from actual truth and useful tips. Ability to distinguish fiction from facts can help any bettor to make reasonable  decisions about betting. We tried to gather some of the most common myths in the industry and to dispel them.

Unlike many of its competitors, Betmatch uses Ethereum for placing bets and does not restrict players from betting by using platform-specific tokens. XBM tokens native to Betmatch platform are means of additional functionality and a foundation to a unique social system on the platform. In other words, players can use Betmatch betting solution without XBM tokens, but the benefits they possess make them worth purchasing for several reasons.  XBM token is a discount token, and it assures a discount on all system commissions on bets for token holders, including the opportunity to have completely commission-free bets within a certain limit. Betmatch also offers token holders an opportunity to lease tokens to players, who do not own them, but want to take advantage of their benefits. They will receive up to 50% of all system commissions saved by the players, who used their XBM tokens for betting purposes.  Interested in details, exact figures and simple explanations of the XBM token functionality?

Players can choose from different game modes, which include playing against computer-controlled heroes or other players. Initially, no heroes are permanently available for use; however, players may choose from a list of heroes that are free to use from a weekly rotation. By using gold coins, the in-game currency, or through microtransactions, they can gain permanent access to a hero. As of July 2018, there are 80 heroes in the game, divided into four separate roles: Assassin, Warrior, Support, and Specialist. These heroes include one multiclass hero. In addition, there are currently 15 maps available to play, each of which has different objectives to secure, with some having different victory conditions.  Experience points, which can be gained by being nearby enemy units when they're killed, are shared across the entire team. When a team reaches a certain experience point threshold, every hero on that team levels up, acquiring slightly amplified powers. Every few levels, players may select a talent which offers a new ability, or augments an existing one. This leveling system emphasizes the importance of teamwork and planning, since a player's action can affect the whole team.  Players can also mount different animals, such as horses, lizards, or unicorns, to increase their movement speed, automatically dismounting when attacking, receiving damage or using any ability.",False

Yes, we have one interesting article about the prop bet for you!  A proposition or also called prop bet is a bet placed on elements of a game🏉 that don’t directly affect its outcome. Prop bets have two purposes in the sports betting world. Firstly, they can be a great source of entertainment and fun especially for bettors who are new to a sport or don’t fully understand all the nuances of the games. Secondly, they can serve as a crucial piece of a long term profitable and winning🏅 sports betting strategy. For instance, earlier people placed bets on the color of sports drink that would be dumped over the winning coach’s head, or whether or not a streaker would run onto the field.  Prop bets allow you to use every piece of knowledge and every prediction you have about how a game will be played to your advantage. You have the flexibility to profit off💵 the predictions.",False

He is free to lend his betting limit to other players who may be interested in saving on the house commission fees of 5%. So he can charge other users less than 5% to use his betting limit. If he charges 1%, then the token holder would earn $1,000 from other customers who used his limit.

Token holders may want to lend their tokens in exchange for monetary compensation.    - On the future stages of the product development, token functionality would be extended by the opportunity to bet on these tokens (without house commissions) and stake them to provide valuable information for the system.
