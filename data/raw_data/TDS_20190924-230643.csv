What is your opinion?,"Dear bitcointalk community,  we, the TokenDesk team, are highly concerned about these totally irrelevant, zero fact based negative comments that we have now seeing spread by one or two persons. Creating a number of new accounts to specifically post false facts about TokenDesk. It is something new to us. Here we will provide more inside facts about our project to clear the fog and to state the obvious - why the false facts are false:   Why this bad publicity happening in the first place?  TD: We had a single issue with a single person, who was supposed to be an expert of public relations. Instead, we got a negative PR campaign when we stopped partnership with that person, so called freelancer, who did not deliver what she has promised whatsoever. Her effort to create a negative vibe about our ICO shows what kind of person we had to deal with and we wish nobody else would ever get to employ that person so the very same reasons. Unfortunately to us, she knows a few journalists in Lithuania (not anywhere else, really, which she lied us about) who decided to join the Muppet show and write some irrelevant, zero facts about TokenDesk business based articles. If you translate them, like a few ""enthusiasts"" suggest here, you will not find a single negative fact about the TokenDesk. Please do, we have nothing to hide here.  1)   No smart contract?  TD: This is our smart contract on Github: https://github.com/TokeDesk/TDS  Feel free to contact gintaras.tamosiunas@tokendesk.io for the bounty program that is available for all improvements of our smart contract.  2)   Why there are no refunds?  TD: No refund is our and the 99% of other ICOs policy. This is not Zara, it’s the financial technology business and if a person decide to invest in it, it must be done carefully with necessary analysis and commitment. Our whitepaper always stated that we will deliver the TDS tokens in January.  However, after the increased interest in our project, we decided to put extra effort, invited more professionals to join our team. This will result in delivering TDS tokens in the end of NOVEMBER, just a bit after the launch of our alpha platform version. The latter is planned to happen on the 15th of Nov.  3)   Do we censor our communication channels?  TD: We have blocked around 5 people for spreading irrelevant or negative information for no reason. For example - the Telegram channel is for TD community to share ideas, ask relevant questions and generate a positive vibe. Haters do not provide any added value so we reserve the right to block these commentators. No person, who ever had a decent question has been blocked. This is the way we will proceed.   4)   Is TokenDesk team experienced enough?  TD: Absolutely yes. We currently run the biggest ticketing platform in the Baltic states for over 12 years. It has generated over €71mln. revenues last year. We also have enough Blockchain experts so that we could deliver our smart contract much earlier than we planned initially (uploading to Github today, just to remind you). Fintech is another fancy word to describe a general business. We have decades of experience not only in finance based business and IT, but a lot more than that. Check backgrounds of our team members before writing such nonsensical posts, please.  5)   The whitepaper says we will deliver tokens on January 22nd.  TD: Actually, we will start delivering tokens in the end November. Just after we finish with the smart contract, tokens will be delivered to everybody.  6)   When did you plan to launch alpha?  TD: True is, we haven't planned to launch the alpha and simply go straight to beta. However, we decided to introduce our platform alpha version on the 15th of November. We made this decision due to increase of our team resources as well as the interest in TokenDesk project globally. Our team agreed to put some extra effort and show our first stage of development of the platform.  It will benefit all parties - the investors, as they will see our first steps, the general blockchain community - to  7)   Who comments on TokeDesk threads in Bitcointalk/Reddit?  TD:  9/10 negative comments we have here is created by newly created accounts. From what can be easily seen - these accounts are created a few days or weeks ago to ONLY spread negative comments on TokenDesk. False, irrelevant and misleading information is spread provoking us for no reason.  This is a part of negative PR campaign by our competitors and other time wasters. Unfortunately, there is no way for us to control the spread of this information.  We always appreciate constructive remarks.  ----------------  TD: If anyone has any questions regarding TokenDesk business, please contact our CEO directly. The team is more than happy to provide more information about our project. Here’s the email you can always drop a line: gintaras.tamosiunas@tokendesk.io  It is unfortunate, that some people have such poor business ethics and spread absolutely false facts about TokenDesk throughout the internet. We cannot stop that, nor we will, but what we can (and will) do is answer all your questions and show that our business is transparent and open to everyone.   Couple of important facts:  1.   We have uploaded our smart contract on Github TODAY, here is the link: https://github.com/TokeDesk/TDS 2.   We will be launching the alpha version on 15th Nov. 3.   We will start delivering the TDS tokens to our supporters in the end of November.",False

TD: This is our smart contract on Github: https://github.com/TokeDesk/TDS  _____  You can talk about this on fb, or on media, to a stupid users, but not to the community.

On the more positive note, here is the important facts from TokenDesk:  1. We are launching our alpha platform in 2 weeks. 2. Every ICO publisher who wants their project to be on our platform FOR FREE - contact us now. We are giving away free positions for the ICOs that will be launched together with our alpha version. It's a win-win situation. 3. The distribution of TDS tokens will start in the end of November as well. We will be announcing all the news through our media channels, so stay tuned.

I don't see much value of showing this smart contract which is not even deployed. Not having a smart contract before the token sale shows your lack of transparency.   2) Tokendesk is not transparent thus they should refund investors. See 1) and 4).

For example he told (we dont use smart contract for sale, because it is not safe, its safer not to use it, cause overwise team will have many tokens and can start selling them and kill the price of a token. sounds logic? NOOOO.)  - Payment company throw which they were collectig money baned them, actually they not allow ICO at all, but somehow they masked their campaign.  - You making payments to the unknown company, which isnt on a whitepaper  And from myself ill say, they made this stupid promotion, which is also against whitepaper...  This is legal scam I think.. You will get a shit project, just to show ""we did it"".  DO NOT INVEST.",False

Quote The Air Ambulance Support Community Interest Company, St Anthony Trading Co (formerly Air Ambulance Service Trading Co Ltd), and St Anthony Repatriation (formerly Air Ambulance Service), were closed on 2 November after targeting residents in the South Midlands in ‘charity bag’ collections claiming to raise funds for local air ambulances. Over £1m was extorted in the scam.  Quote Anthony Joseph Durkin, who was director of both St Anthony companies, and Tomas Mickauskas, a former director of Air Ambulance who worked as a leaflet distributor for the two St Anthony companies, were named by the Insolvency Service for investigation.

Why did you ask an investor to transfer money to a spices company? That sounds like fraud. (see new article at the start of this post)  Why is the new Director of Tokendesk LTD, Stuart Poppleton, a 77 years old, director/former director of over 300 companies in the UK. Who is this guy? Tokendesk Messiah? It looks like the same Stuart Poppleton from this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=216717.0  If you google and search for Stuart Poppleton (company house etc...), you will see that he usually becomes a director before a company shuts down. That's what we call a director for hire.  http://www.printmonthly.co.uk/News/Business/5342/rogue-trading-of-pandemic Quote Former clients of John’s companies including Houseprint, along with more than 800 shell companies listed in Companies House as having John (or his alias Poppleton) as a director, have come forward with information to ICSM Credit and the Official Receiver.  Source: https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/lrUZPitEQMdiU0oB1Nlt76IxQeE/appointments This looks very strange........  Did you hire a random director to avoid any liability before you close shop?  Not a single person mentioned in the TD whitepaper is a director of the UK company. Can you please explain? You also don't have a bank account but instead used 3rd parties such as paysera and revolut to accept fiat transfers. Those accounts are now frozen / shut down.  Please stop this Joke ICO. Refund investors. Change career. Go home if you still have one or else go to the nearest shelter.",False
