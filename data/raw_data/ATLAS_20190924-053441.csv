Try telling the encyclopedia industry that their pay model was not permanently destroyed by crowdsourcing. I'm comfortable with calling a successful displacement of the subscription model 'permanent'. Young doctors raised around a trustworthy free medical resource will never go back.   Who gets to decide who is 'qualified' enough to participate.  Well at first I do, along with Brad, and we're physicians. ""Qualified"" in this context means a medical degree, most likely an M.D. or equivalent. Yes we are inspired by the spirit of Wikipedia, but PeerAtlas is not Wikipedia, so don't get it twisted. Medical decision making and treatment is every bit as serious as the military. Wikipedia doesn't have peer review. ""Peer"" is literally in our name   How to you plan on separating the qualified community from the unqualified community?  By evaluating their...qualifications. We are doctors. Doctors are public figures. And again, the peer review process is a further safeguard   will each article be a true peer review from qualified individuals?  Yes.    I see that you have civilian accounts.  Are they able to take part in such votes?  No.   Even sites like UpToDate tie each individual amount of CME to each article that you search for on their site.  Are you implying that one could simply buy enough CME for the year and not have to read articles, takes quizzes, etc?  You can't 'buy' CME. You have to earn it through research and use of the platform, the same as with the gold standard, UpToDate. Once healthcare professionals have earned the CME, we will redeem them for ATLAS tokens.   BRAVO!  This was a welcome part of the paper!  PeerAtlas anticipates a shifting focus towards the use of AI (Artificial Intelligence).  Brad's personal interest is reducing physician error and improving outcomes though eventually introducing machine learning to medical treatment and decision making. In the fifth century A.D., Saint Patrick cast all of the snakes out of Ireland by driving them into the sea.

I imagine it is smart to make an impactful opening line to grab the attention of the reader.   Well at first I do, along with Brad, and we're physicians. ""Qualified"" in this context means a medical degree, most likely an M.D. or equivalent. Yes we are inspired by the spirit of Wikipedia, but PeerAtlas is not Wikipedia, so don't get it twisted. Medical decision making and treatment is every bit as serious as the military. Wikipedia doesn't have peer review. ""Peer"" is literally in our name  Thank you for this response.  I did not intend on getting it 'twisted'.  Touche' with the 'Peer' is literally in our name.  Wikipedia has appointed fact-checkers, but you are correct in that it is certainly not a peer review.   How to you plan on separating the qualified community from the unqualified community?   By evaluating their...qualifications. We are doctors. Doctors are public figures. And again, the peer review process is a further safeguard  Do you plan on accepting other disciplines for different conditions?  There are multiple 'doctors' in the medical field: MD/DO, DPT, OD, PharmD, DNP, ect. I would expect a multidisciplinary approach to the medical decision making as is the push in the medical field currently.  As you are well aware, the typical hospital rounding team in a teaching hospital consists of an attending physician, residents and interns, clinical pharmacy specialists, nutrition, charge/floor nurse, and associated students in those fields. The 'push' was apparent at my school at least.  Interprofessional care is the future to ensure the best care is given to the patient and that is what I preached to my students.  I see this as a tool to encourage contribution from multiple specialties and sub-specialties in order to get the most appropriate decision.   Yes. No.  Thank you for the clarification regarding who is able to vote.   You can't 'buy' CME. You have to earn it through research and use of the platform, the same as with the gold standard, UpToDate. Once healthcare professionals have earned the CME, we will redeem them for ATLAS tokens.  Forgive me, but from your wording in the whitepaper: 'Secondly, medical professionals using the site will accumulate continuing medical education (CME) credits that will be redeemable through the site in exchange for ATLAS tokens.' I see this as only being able to redeem the CME by losing ATLAS tokens.  Are you saying that it is the other way around?  You earn CME through the site and then get a to-be-determined amount of ATLAS tokens for earning said CME?   Brad's personal interest is reducing physician error and improving outcomes though eventually introducing machine learning to medical treatment and decision making. In the fifth century A.D., Saint Patrick cast all of the snakes out of Ireland by driving them into the sea. My personal interest, to keep our platform free from special interest dollars, is a smaller task.  I honestly hope that you can cast out the snakes of the big industry and allow a comprehensive platform free for the general public.

In general, having attained a high level of education in a specialty is best when writing articles about that specialty, although simply having a degree is not enough to make a fantastic resource. Let me elaborate.  The information has to be high quality, and the information has to be trusted by professional users. I can say at this point that we will accept contributions from users that create trust from civilians and professionals alike in areas which they are qualified. Additionally, I am very aware that midlevel care providers can be far more competent in certain areas than the attending physicians because they benefit from specialization and hands-on experience.  To repeat myself, a contributor needs to be both correct, and trusted. In the real world these do not always overlap. People should feel a sense of relief when they use the encyclopedia. I'm being vague on specific degrees at this point because they need to fulfill these two requirements.   I see this as only being able to redeem the CME by losing ATLAS tokens.    That's correct. Professionals send ATLAS to the foundation and then the foundation redeems CME hours that professionals have accumulated with their boards.

Correct and trusted is also a little vague, but I would assume that the expert panel from the community would determine this.  I look forward to seeing how things will be implemented.  Now, you shed some more light on something regarding the CME hours in your statement.  You only get the ability to redeem CME for ATLAS IF you have contributed to the project and that article/algorithm/etc was deemed appropriate as above.

Issuing a token is the only way that I have figured out how to offer a paid resource for free worldwide, and I've been on this project since 2011. Everybody wants us to not have a token but no one is going to wire me $15MM, and I designed ATLAS as a very efficient, fixed supply token using the very best technology we can get our hands on.  There's conflicts of interest with the advertising-funded and subscription-funded models. ATLAS allows us to not offer subscriptions or sell advertising.  2) Why a token?  ATLAS is: Borderless - Doctors across the world can tip each other with no restrictions (unlike sending fiat)  Incentive - Holding a significant minority of ATLAS tokens gives the PeerAtlas foundation the ability to fund its more ambitious long-term goals if it is successful in its short-term goals (unlike using someone else's token, and unlike if someone wired me $15MM)  3) How will we protect patient data?  PeerAtlas is starting out as an open source medical encyclopedia. Another more fancy way of saying this, is that it is an evidence-based clinical decision support tool to help medical professionals make decisions.  At this stage in the project, we won't use patient data at all. We aspire to have the high quality of the peer-reviewed resource UpToDate (uptodate.com) but without a subcription-based paywall.",False

CryptoWhaler, the ATLAS token has many great features: (1) No inflation, (2) 50% of the tokens go to the crowdsale because we believe that the only way this project will be successful is if we have complete and total support of the community, (3) We will be profitable by redeeming CME credits for physicians in exchange for physicians sending ATLAS tokens to the PeerAtlas foundation, this is our main profit mechanism. For example, I am a board certified radiologist and every year I need to send CME credits (continuing medical education) to the American Board of Radiology to legally practice medicine in the United States. When doctors use our website they will accumulate CME credits, and we will send the credits to their respective boards in exchange for them sending ATLAS tokens to the foundation.

SAME DATE!!!  July 2017: Dr. Mattson becomes a board-certified radiologist.  This is a scam.  First off, nobody finishes a residency a year early and there would be a fellowship following residency for radiology.

I do indeed feel bad about myself.  I'm sorry.  You have to admit the roadmap wording is a little off though.

I went trough the whitepaper and have a number of questions/concerns.  Overall, I am excited for this project as  I see a great need for it.  Please take my comments in stride.  They are only meant to aid in furthering the understanding of everybody involved in the project.    This is pretty intense for an opening line.  The content costs money because they have to monetize its upkeep or it will remain stagnant.  I like this project's idea, but 'permanent' is never the case with anything.   Because of its highly independent design, the PeerAtlas foundation can direct its community to reward qualified individuals that help its mission in a transparent and ethical manner.  Who gets to decide who is 'qualified' enough to participate.  I'm worried that this could turn into another Wikipedia where anybody can change anything.  You wouldn't want somebody going around and saying the medical treatment for every sort of pain is jelly beans would you?    ATLAS will transact in two major pathways that directly benefit the project. Firstly, direct donations of ATLAS will be enabled for verified creators of medical articles and algorithms that the community finds useful.  Using UpToDate as an example, they look over multiple peer-reviewed articles, studies, and guidelines before writing their recommendations.  How to you plan on separating the qualified community from the unqualified community?  Just because somebody went to a professonal school doesn't mean that they are an expert in everything.  I don't pretend to know everything and I practice within my scope.   This allows contributing professionals to receive compensation for their time and effort.  Will this be based on a 'community' vote or will each article be a true peer review from qualified individuals?  I see that you have civilian accounts.  Are they able to take part in such votes?  I see this as a possible source of collusion.    Secondly, medical professionals using the site will accumulate continuing medical education (CME) credits that will be redeemable through the site in exchange for ATLAS tokens.   How does this work for claiming CME?  Typically, these are tied to specific activities that have to be vetted.  Even sites like UpToDate tie each individual amount of CME to each article that you search for on their site.  Are you implying that one could simply buy enough CME for the year and not have to read articles, takes quizzes, etc?   These direct transfers of ATLAS from the community are the best long-term strategy for PeerAtlas to offer paid content for free.  Now, I see this as a good idea in the long run if you answer that the general civilian population is unable to vote for quality of posts as I stated above.  This makes collusion pointless and the donations would be anonymous.   This is to avoid indirect donations to PeerAtlas from drug companies and other special interests that would benefit from influencing the library.  PeerAtlas Co-Founder Ling Wu is currently employed by a pharmaceutical company as a chemist, and will submit her resignation at the completion of crowdfunding.  BRAVO!  This was a welcome part of the paper!   PeerAtlas anticipates a shifting focus towards the use of AI (Artificial Intelligence) to create individualized treatment recommendations and algorithms for specific patients through the use of the patientâ€™s existing EMR data. AI could work with anonymized EMR data to offer a worldwide live rolling clinical trial for evidence-based recommendations.  Now this is definitely interesting.  The HIPPA regs would likely need to be circumvented, but who knows what sort of regs will exist in 20-40 years from now.  I could see anonymized EMR data being used in the near future for such a project.  There are number of current projects that are attempting this such as Medibloc and Medicalchain.",False
