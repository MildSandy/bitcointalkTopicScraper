Rigoblock is proud to announce GRG, the only token that will power the Rigoblock network, and it will be available through a public token sale.  Token Sale: Public TokenMarket Sale Opens December 18th 2018 and is scheduled to close January 28th 2019 Please see ‘Rigoblock Token Details’ below for a full overview  Sign up to the TokenMarket whitelist process here  VISIT OUR WEBSITE  READ OUR WHITEPAPER    About Rigoblock   What is Rigoblock? Rigoblock is a blockchain protocol for decentralized asset management which can be adopted by any existing marketplace and offers a complete range of solutions. Thanks to its modular architecture, external service providers can build their own platform on top of the Rigoblock protocol, or even create their own forked version of a decentralized asset management platform. This can be achieved by using just some of the modules, leveraging the protocol and the Rigo token incentives mechanism. Platforms built on top of the Rigoblock protocol enable users to set up and run their own token pools (aka crypto funds). Furthermore, the protocol offers a revolutionary type of incentives for managers and investors by aligning their interests through the Proof-of-Performance algorithm. In that way management and performance fees are no longer needed.    Watch Our Explainer Video Here   What is the GRG token? The Rigo token, which is built on top of the Rigoblock platform, allows users to; establish a meritocratic and incentives-based framework for traders, separating the fee logic from the funds and create an incentive mechanism on top of the token. All of these elements will allow the Rigo token to become easily accessible and more cost effective for traders to use, which aims to reshape the $63 trillion dollar asset management industry.   What problems does Rigoblock solve? Today’s asset management industry requirements are strict, tedious and bureaucratic. Also, all the legal procedures require costs and time. That automatically excludes a wide range of single individuals and small/medium entities that are willing to build their own funds. Rigoblock makes it possible for literally anyone to create their own token pool (the digital equivalent of an investment fund) in seconds. At the same time Rigoblock brings transparency and full auditability in a sector historically dominated by informational biases.   JOIN OUR OFFICIAL TELEGRAM CHANNEL    HOW RIGOBLOCK WORKS  Applications for Asset Management The Rigoblock protocol is designed with applications in mind, meaning developers have the opportunity to create fully customized applications on top of it. Rigoblock makes it easy for anyone looking to build applications for asset management, i.e. pooled token vehicles. The protocol can be accessed either by using the API libraries, or by using a fontend: the Rigoblock platform offers easy token pools creation; soon third parties will be able to offer token pools on their marketplace. High level partnerships, like the Ethfinex marketplace, have been already announced. Rigoblock has developed the first two applications: Vault, which acts as decentralized custodians; Drago, which acts like traditional investment funds.   Vault: Vaults are the first fully functional application by Rigoblock and acts as trustless custodians for anyone looking to securely store Ether for multiple parties through smart contracts technology. Any user can create one or many vaults. In the future, the vault concept will be extended to ERC20 tokens as well.    Drago: The key component of the Rigoblock solution are dragos. A user can create as many dragos as he or she wants. A drago’s managers is then able to pool funds from third parties and trade on non-custodial exchanges, without having direct access to the pooled tokens. Trading is only allowed to an approved trader through a governance system. Furthermore, the portfolio of each trader is publicly available. This brings full transparency on the activity of each Drago manager.  External Applications:  Developers looking to customize the solution have the possibility to do so and leverage on the Rigoblock incentives system. This will result in any developer being able to speed up the application for asset management in a sharply reduced time-frame and having the possibility of providing a service on blockchain without the need of running an ICO themselves.  Proof-of-Performance: the RigoBlock Incentives System  The disruptive model allows for neither management nor performance fees to be charged to the token pools. Instead, the rewards come from a moderate inflation of the network (projected around 1 to 2 percent per annum) and the managers are rewarded in GRG tokens. The reward is calculated by an algorithm, called Proof-of-Performance, which is embedded in the protocol and is a smart contract itself, thus being fully auditable and transparent. The managers must hold a dynamic minimum of GRGs to be eligible for Proof-of-Performance rewards, which is set by the token holders to balance demand and supply. Users of the platform are also required to hold some GRGs to unlock premium features or services.     TOKEN SALE DETAILS:  The public token sale will start on December 18, 2018 and is set to close January 18, 2019.
