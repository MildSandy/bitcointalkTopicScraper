And ArcBlock, a Bellevue, Wash.-based startup, is part of the evolving world of this new technology.  cover  The company, which launched in 2017, is engineering a platform that developers can use to build new applications or a better blockchain.  “We are like [Amazon’s] AWS for blockchain,” said founder and CEO Robert Mao. “It’s a foundation service.”  Mao previously worked for Microsoft Research, and has launched three other startups, two in China and one in Seattle. He took the role at Microsoft in part to learn what it’s like be employed by a big company. He was there for more than five years, discovered that he prefers smaller operations and learned a surprising lesson.  When Mao was building startups, he’d fretted about competing with big corporations. He’d thought, “they have huge resources. What if I have to face the competition with a big company?” Then he realized that startups and tech juggernauts face similar changes, just at a different scale.  “There is no magic there. We’re all facing the same problems — and they’re bigger and slower,” he said. The corporate boogeyman was vanquished.  arblock team  ArcBlock has 18 employees and is a steering committee member of the newly launched Washington Technology Industry Association (WTIA) Cascadia Blockchain Council. The company was selected for the WTIA Founder Cohort Program for venture scale startups, and participates in Microsoft for Startups and AWS Activate for Startups. Mao is also a founder of the Seattle Entrepreneurship Club.  There are other companies forging a path in blockchain 3.0, which Mao described as the “Wild West.” He said it’s a challenging space for entrepreneurs. U.S. regulations in the sector are more stringent than in Europe and parts of Asia. But Washington state is something of a leader and in April passed legislation encouraging the development of blockchain.  ArcBlock’s customers include a mobile app developer and a company making next generation games where players build their own worlds, like they do in Minecraft or Second Life. Using blockchain technology, the world’s people create can be maintained indefinitely, regardless of the fate of the gaming company.  “The best way to do that is to put the data of the game in a blockchain,” Mao explained.  Customers pay for ArcBlock’s services using the company’s cryptocurrency, which is abbreviated ABT. The per month prices are based on the level of usage, including support, training and analytics. The company could eventually expand its pricing approach to include subscriptions, licensing or a sort of hybrid model.  “Blockchain is not just about the cryptocurrency. People are looking to blockchain to solve real problems,” Mao said. “We think the blockchain as an application platform is going to be huge.”  One of the company’s bigger competitors, he said, is Silicon Valley-based Cosmo.  We caught up with Mao for this Startup Spotlight, a regular GeekWire feature. Continue reading for his answers to our questionnaire.  arcblock team 2  What does your company do? Give us your 2-to-3 sentence elevator pitch. Your entire blockchain development journey — from code to the user experience — is easily managed with ArcBlock’s blockchain development platform making it easy to build, manage and deploy decentralized applications, or Dapps.  Inspiration hit us when: In 2013 when we were building Bitcoin mining machines we began reimagining the internet as it was originally intended, as a completely decentralized ecosystem where the user is in control and free to use the services they want, and to give users the ability to share only the information that they choose to share.  VC, Angel or Bootstrap: ArcBlock’s first round of funding was $1.5 million raised through an angel investor. In January of 2018 we completed one of the most successful initial coin offerings (ICOs) to date.  Our ‘secret sauce’ is: At ArcBlock, we use what came before us as inspiration by creating tools that do one thing and do it well. And that can then be connected to each other to build powerful tools and ecosystems.  The smartest move we’ve made so far: Staying focused on the user experience and ensuring that our platform and tools are accessible, useful and solve real problems by using good design in combination with our technologies.  The biggest mistake we’ve made so far: Not converting all our Ethers (Ethereum’s cryptocurrency) to cash when it was at its high.  Which leading entrepreneur or executive would you most want working in your corner? Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s biggest hedge fund firm. Whether as a startup or as we grow into a larger company, we believe that his ideas of how to build a strong and effective team to steward the company forward where anyone can speak openly and honestly is critical to our success. We want an environment where collective decision making is the standard and we give everyone the ability to be radically open and transparent with their opinions. We want a company where everyone’s opinions are valued and no one hides from their failures because whether a failure or success, it is always an opportunity to learn and become better.  Our favorite team-building activity is: We enjoy a good game of laser tag and taking long hikes.  The biggest thing we look for when hiring is: We are always looking for people who are willing and are able to continuously improve.  What’s the one piece of advice you’d give to other entrepreneurs just starting out: Make every experience a learning experience — that way you get value out of failures and successes equally.",True

First off, we wanted to say thank you for being an important member of our WeChat official groups and Telegram groups. We have been listening to you and want you to know that we are looking for new and innovative ways to improve our community governance, while also working to create a uniquely decentralized approach for our communities that will transform how our communities work. After completing our first year, we have learned a lot but nothing more important than the idea that supporting our community is one of our top priorities. We believe that we have now reached an important milestone and wanted to share the news with you all.  Since its inception, ArcBlock has been dedicated to building an innovative and potentially industry-changing blockchain 3.0 development platform that helps developers build, manage and deploy DApps. During the last twelve months, we have made steady progress. We recently opened our platform to developers and enterprises and shared our “ArcBlock 2019 Product Roadmap (Request for Community Comment)” to help our community see where our priorities were and to define our upcoming product releases. We believe that we are becoming an increasingly influential player in the developer community and our partnerships with leading technology companies is expanding. As many of you know, we have successfully launched new partnerships with leaders like IBM, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and other corporate partners during 2018, and held 4 hackathons that attracted nearly three hundred developers to sign up and develop twenty DApps. We also launched more than 20 very successful learning series and hosted more than a thousand listeners at local level events that were supported by 23 engineering blogs. These blogs received tens of thousands of views and continue to a great way to interact and show the technologies that ArcBlock is working on.  ArcBlock firmly believes that a decentralized user community is critical to the success of our platform. Many companies today simply run their online communities as a one-way publicity tool. However, at ArcBlock we are different. We believe that autonomous dialogue, discussions and forming a consensus are critical elements to the long-term success of our platform and more importantly our community. Starting today, we want to encourage and support our users to form an autonomous community and have an equal voice in the construction of the ArcBlock ecosystem. Of course, we don’t expect you to do it alone. We have a strong sense of responsibility to our community and want to work more closely with all of you to strengthen communication, helping to get your voice heard and to become active participants in building the ABT ecosystem.  We will soon be releasing several community-focused organization, governance and communication DApps that are built on the ArcBlock platform, and these new DApps will empower you to create your own decentralized communities that run on top of the ArcBlock Platform.  There have already been several success stories. In December 2018, some of our active members spontaneously created their own community and invited members of the ArcBlock team to engage with them. Through this engagement, the “ABT Consensus Community” was established that now includes daily interactions, comments and questions to our development team with a focus on conducting evangelism and community-building. In addition to the “ABT Consensus Community”, we have also seen the birth of other groups and want to encourage and support these efforts. ArcBlock has recognized that these decentralized community organizations are an impactful way to contribute to the development of the ArcBlock ecosystem. As a company, we are both willing to participate in these groups and are ready to help the formation and development of these communities including the establishment of governance and rules that the communities abide by including no spamming, spreading of false statements, and illegal behaviors in the community that could be a detriment to everyone. The ArcBlock team also has an obligation to supervise and promote the healthy development of the community.  As many of you know, our partner Krypital Group has been helping us to build and manage our communities, and as we move ahead they will no longer be involved in our communities. We want to take a moment to thank them for their important contributions to the development of our community. As outlined above, our mission moving forward is to transform our existing communities into fully self-governing communities in the weeks and months ahead. We excited about our continued transformation into becoming the leading blockchain 3.0 community that is fully decentralized. We welcome the “ABT Consensus Community” and other self-organized groups with open arms. We are willing to support you with the resources, the people and the capabilities to support and expand our community. We believe that decentralization is the future and we look forward to working with all of you!",True

Do you think from the fact that the token will be traded on all the stock exchanges it will immediately increase its price? It will certainly grow, but it will be a one-time increase, which, after listing, is likely to fall again.

This had to be expected. * With 60Gwei and 200,000 Gas limitation, it was pure luck whether or not your transaction would arrive on time * If it arrived on time, then you're fine now. You'll get your ABT. If not, your funds are under Arcblock's control until they decide to refund you * They now have way more funds than they intended to raise. This could or should have been done differently (using a smart contract for example) * My transaction took more than 11 hours with 60Gwei and 200,000 Gas. I knew of the risk but wanted to try it anyway. * They say that there is a minimal chance for contributions that arrived too late to still be counted. I don't expect mine to be among those so I'll now have to wait until they are done with all their calculations. * It's possible that contributions that arrived too late will still be counted purely because they are putting a penalty on those who went over the limitation of 60Gwei and 200,000 Gas. As far as I understand, these funds are going to be refunded minus the 20% penalty, thus opening spots for pending transactions. * The intent was to prevent a ""Gas-war"" where investors would pay horrendous fees just to get into the ICO on time. By putting a penalty of 20% they wanted to prevent this which of course did not work. A lot of people still went over the 60Gwei, 200,000Gas limit. * As a consequence, Arcblock is now sitting on a ton of funds they don't need. People did pay them probably millions without getting anything back. Plus they dare to keep 20% if you went over the Gas limit. Even if they refund all the transactions that did not arrive on time, they will keep a huge amount of ETH as a penalty. I think this is unacceptable.  I can totally understand the motivation behind this 20% penalty. ICOs have become really hard to get into. But I don't think that a company should be in a position to penalize people in that way. They just don't have the right to do so. I'm not criticising the project itself, just the ICO and this is yet another example for future ICOs to look at and do better.  I recommend the Arcblock team to be as transparent as possible about this and state exact numbers of how much funds they collected, how much will be refunded and how much they will keep as a penalty. And then maybe consider just giving people these 20% back. It's just not okay to keep it if it's not needed for the project itself.",True

Just because someone says there's specific guidelines to follow when making a transaction to invest, doesn't mean he can decide to keep 20% just because he says so.

Plus there’s a partnership between them and you can buy ABT tokens with CMT tokens instead of ETH if you want. CMT won’t stay below .40 cents for long, as the ArcBlock chat room is talking up CMT now too. And ArcBlock is gong to be a big fast gainer, as its planning the Blockchain 3.0 through the cloud. They have major backers before the ICO.. and their ICO is only lasting a week, but they’ll hit their 45 mil hardcap long before that. So we have an interesting and unique  synergy happening here between CMT and ArcBlock (ABT) Not a pump, but a combining of two new techs, as CMT plans on using ArcBlock’s tech.. it’s going to be a very interesting week here, I assure you. Arcblock will be one of the biggest ICO’s of the year. I’m not pumping either CMT or ABT because I don’t have to, they’ve taken care of it themselves, these two tokens hold real value way beyond the current price. Say what you want, but it’s out of our hands now.. and  CMT is a bit of steal here right now.. just my humble opinion of course.",True

It hasen't got a base, no code to prove they've actually started, excuses was they're doing it in a closed source project developement style where as almost all ICOs are open source and free for people to view the code and contribute / help out. I don't see a reason why they wouldn't make their project development open source. A reason like people stealing the code isn't a good excuse either because if you believe in your project to be successful then you have nothing to worry about.  Founder/CEO has a past as an entrepreneur with 4 businesses in the past, 2 of which was sold and one of them didn't go well according to what the CEO said. This could imply that this ICO is just a money grab and they might not deliver or produce the project poorly.  ALL the media mentions on their website when ArcBlock listed them wasen't true at all, CEO/Founder of ArcBlock even verifyed this during their AMA with Ian, saying that they did talk with the interviewers and that they haven't posted the articles about ArcBlock yet. The CEO said if he could do their marketing differently he wouldn’t of put those Media claimed coverage on their website before it was published, in short there was no article of them being mentioned.  Parnterships with IBM isn't what it seem like it seems to be, ArcBlock sighned up with a programm with cloud IBM which he said it himself that “anyone” could join and this makes them a partner. So it wasn’t a partnership you see with Stellar and IBM. I'm pretty sure IBM doesn't even know that ArcBlock is using their name and Logo on their website for that matter.  They only listed 4 people on their team with an excuse of not wanting to disrupt anyone on the team by putting them up on the website and only wanted to list the key members. This is a very weak excuse and why would it distrube the development team members if you listed them on the website? All ICO project did this, implies they're trying to hide something.  In conclusion ArcBlock CEO/Founder doesn't seem to have much transparency with us the communiity, unless what they claim is actually true and they aren't trying to obscure or hide anything. This makes ArcBlock ICO with a $45,000,000 starting marketcap a risky one to take as its a pretty large one at that and even further more risker as a long term hold.  I'm hesitant as to invest into this ICO. To sum this up the CEO/Founder might just be using this ICO as a cash grab, media mentions are none existant at the time it was listed on ArcBlock's website. Can't evaluate if ArcBlock can claim what they promise due to no listings of their whole team, if there is anymore than 4 people. Partnerships seems exagerated.  This is FUD because it is fear, uncertainty and doubt, which is what I felt when I looked into it and the responses I gathered on their reddit and AMA youtube video. I'm only trying to be honest here. Though I'm not saying this ICO won't make you money if you invest into it. Would like some thoughts on this.",True

Many Wall Streeters are laughing about open source ICOs. If your business and product is open source software, what value does your project have, they wonder? Anyone can clone it and take your user base.  With that reasoning open source is especially a big risk for ArcBlock because as far as I know there are few programmers on the team. Anyone with a lot of money could copy the idea and code, and put a rockstar coding team on it, for example Facebook.  That's one argument for closed source, protecting intellectual property.

The overwhelming KYC applications and the marketing hype surrounding this project indicates that it is very highly likely that the public sale will be sell out within a couple of hours. This is building up to be one of the fastest ICO sales.  For those who missed out of the KYC, the next avenue will be to buy from the exchanges once it is listed. If we do believe in the future of this project, we can buy the tokens from the exchanges and hodl it.  Looking at the ArcBlock Whitepaper, the next milestone is in Q3 2018 when they will release the Open Chain Access Protocol (RC1). That is one of the key milestone for ArcBlock for this year and I expect the price of ABT will rise multiple folds in Q3 2018. This means that there are still plenty of chances for us investors to support the project and profit from the rise from now til Q3 2018.  Lets all support ArcBlock!

While they are creating a very advanced platform that will not only help to incentivize and resolve many of the  existing blockchain issues, they also have a clear aim of making blockchain simple for the average user.  This is what is admirable about this project and I think the incentivization model of ArcBlock will help to bring more developers and resources onto  this platform and evolve ArcBlock to one of the most commonly used platform and protocol.  Being able to create blocklets and api to connect to different blockchain will mean that DApps developers will be able to increase their speed to  market as they can now use ArcBlock to deploy their DApps on various blockchain without having to rewrite their codes. They simply have to use  the Open Chain Access Protocol provided by ArcBlock.  This project is really getting a lot of attention and popularity and their KYC applications is now through the roof. They had over 100,000 KYC  applications which will translate to a huge sell-out TGE.  I foresee this to be one of 2018 top ICO.",True

After reading the whitepaper, a few very important things became apparent.  Arcblock is not only trying to solve some of the issues the older blockchains have such as speed and transaction cost, but also as you mentioned, that anyone even without the knowledge of the blockchain or Dapps, has the opportunity to use this technology. It will allow business to link their operations to the blockchain.  Furthermore it spoke on another important topic, there are so many different blockchains, and coins currently available, which makes it even more difficult for the layman to grasp what the benefits of crypto and the blockchain are. Arcblock looks to simplify that, as they are only looking to jump-start this platform and form a community that contributes to the platform and continues to grow it over time.  This project has great potential, it looks to fill the gaps left by the older blockchains, and make blockchain technology more accessible and streamlined.",True

It's a little confusing because its a new approach.  I hope you can answer my questions    Blockchain 3.0 can also mean an update to the already existing 1.0 or 2.0. Arcblock will implement these updates in its blockchain. Ethereum platform is only being used to conduct ICO and distribute tokens.

IMO, this particular tech segment will very likely be in high demand over the next two decades, given the mainstream recognition of blockchain tech value. There must be some order to the chaos.

I think the really bad issue here is the telegram admin just banning everyone posting tha reddit link. The admin should know that banning is just a way of pushing the investor away, and if he/she wanted to stop the FUD from spreading, well thats exactly whats happening, unnecesary FUD is spreading because the lack of moderation skills the telegram admin has when it comes to managing the chat. Is like blaming the cashier of a restaurant for the quality of the food. The admin shouldve reach the team to properly answer investors rather than just banning them.

Of course this is premised on the ability of the team to achieve their plans as laid out in their road map.  Their idea of incentive-drive marketplace, open chain access protocol, blocklet etc are seems to be very new ideas but to my opinion are generated from needs that has been lingering around the blockchain space for a while now. This team is creating a blockchain that will meet many of the trends for the future.  For example, the open chain access protocol will enable developers to implement their dapps over different blockchains as newer and better ones appears. This is a capability that will be attractive as it will reduce the workload in porting dapps to newer blockchains or dev.  all in all, i think the value of this ICO is premised on the future capability of this blockchain.

One that can adapt to future demands as well.  All these features will be important to assess the value of this blockchain, I think the most important 2 features will be the open chain access protocol and also the transaction speed of >100,000 Tx/s.  These 2 features are at the core of what dev needs. No one wants to be tied down to a single blockchain and will be keen to develop their dapps on Arcblock as they can easily use their open source apis to connect to other blockchain. And speed of 100,000 tx/s, this is the key problem with existing smart contract blockchain like ETH.

I'm eagerly awaiting any dev discussions about this case, and other issues with the greed in this ICO. If you respond in a sensible manner, then maybe you will actually have some real investors with big cash investing in this.

Like seriously, you're telling me each token you're selling is worth more than $1 USD or $1 EU,nonsense.  These companies are valuing their ICO's based on the current performance of a BULL market, not actually what it takes them to develop. When they go through the ICO and determine how much each coin is worth, they look at the current climate and gauge... investors can make an easy X2 return on this coin, because that's all that matters is ROI, and if investors are not making at least X2 on ROI within the first week, then it was definitely a failed ICO.  So, basically, they think investors can pull x2 profit from their coin (they left investors with skin and bones), with a total evaluation of around 500 Million USD for this ICO. If you mention something about a hardcap, you always ALWAYS invest based on hardcap of the ICO's, or you really have 0 clue on what you're doing, ESPECIALLY for the private investments.
