They’re marketing, building, and selling blockchain as if it’s a platform or a solution. They’re using the word “ecosystem” to describe what they’re building, but they’re not operating the technology in a way that gives life to that term.  If companies want to create an ecosystem, they have to spend time figuring out who belongs in the network and then bring everyone together to participate and collaborate on the challenges of governance.  https://hackernoon.com/why-blockchain-as-a-service-solutions-arent-blockchains-8d588b1f35ce  Since mega software vendors and companies like Walmart tend to consolidate their power instead of decentralizing their ecosystems, it might be challenging for decentralized supply chain solutions to succeed. My bet is smart government regulation (EU) as the only way to make true decentralised supply chain tracking happen.",False

OriginTrail (or TRAC) is built on industry standards for data sharing, like GS1 and IoT. These standards allow businesses to share information between supply chains, organizations, and customers.  Data-sharing standards like GS1 “form a business language that identifies, captures and shares key information about products, locations, assets and more.” The TRAC protocol can be used to create a “peer-to-peer network” of data. This data can then be accessed to increase the quality and safety of a product for both customers and business owners.  Currently, supply chain data is locked up in centralized “data silos,” due to security issues and lack of a protocol which can share information between networks. In this state, data cannot be freely shared or used! Unlocking this data with a protocol like TRAC will allow it to optimize a product’s entire production cycle.   Many industries will benefit from TRAC’s improvements to the supply chain. These industries include the automotive, pharmaceutical, food services industries, among others. Here we take a look at just a few of the reasons why OriginTrail is worth following. https://www.investinblockchain.com/why-origintrail/",False

One of the key achievements was the OriginTrail’s decentralized network launch as a testnet on June 29th, which opens a new area for the accessibility of the technology. With 33 B2B events, over 50 media mentions and multiple positive announcements in business development, we are comfortable that the business is definitely moving in the right direction. We are firmly fulfilling our vision of a decentralized future of supply chains powered by the blockchain, and we expect additional business opportunities emerge when the technology is out there, serving real businesses.

The minimum required amount of stake is something that is up to discretion of the DC node and can be adjusted depending on the use-case.

In order to participate in data exchange, the nodes involved need to stake a proportional amount of tokens to the agreed upon amount in the exchange. This staked amount is used to ensure the agreement success, as it further demotivates the involved parties to act against the system — the DH to remove or change the data it has committed to keeping and delivering, and on the other hand demotivate the DC node to falsely probe the DH nodes in order to try to obtain their stake.  This effectively means that in order to take on more work in the system and thus obtain more token gains and a larger reputation, a node needs to provide a larger cumulative stake, which ensures aligned incentives and motivation to deliver high quality of service.  The elasticity of this system allows both large and smaller token holders to participate on their own terms by being able to “monetize” their reputation and stake if they have a good historical track record in OriginTrail, but without limiting smaller players from entering the system and providing high-quality service. In this way, a data provider can choose to require a certain high level of reputation and stake (which would guarantee a higher degree of trust) from the nodes, which will in return be valued at a higher service price. In this way, the system stays decentralized and the distribution of data remains wide.  https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-alpha-node-v0-4a-mechta-release-is-out-ea31f3c4b872",False

My key point: The OT masternode architecture is so complex, that only IT-professionals and IT-staff will be able to operate them.  Therefore there is no use of the tokens for average Joes.  https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/wiki/OriginTrail-Incentive-model-v1  ""To mitigate this risk, a node will be required to deposit a stake. This stake will be stored in case it is proven that Data Holder tried to sell the data which is altered while Data Viewers will have a mechanism to check if all the chunks of the data are valid and initiate a litigation procedure in case of any inconsistencies. ""    Any thoughts about my points?  I went through the Github Wiki and I would like to share the following questions and findings:  1) Masternodes https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/wiki/Integration-Instructions  Due to the technical complexity of the masternodes architecture, an IT-staff will be required to operate it. It utilizes an ArangoDB database and a database needs an administrator to operate it for mission critical use-cases like food supply chain.  For example if the underlying masternode ArangoDB goes corrupt, will you lose your stacked tokens then because you provided tampered/corrupt data to the protocol?  https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb/issues/2049  If not, will OT establish a forensic IT department to judge if somebody manipulated the data in the database or if the database went corrupt due to software bugs?  In general how will OT rule out that data wasn’t manipulated by software bugs but by the operator of the masternode?  What happens if bugs in OT provided software will cause corrupt/tampered data?  What happens if the masternodes got hacked due to undisclosed exploits?  When will a detailed concept be published how OT plans to implement an arbitration board that decides if data was either tampered by the user or corrupt due to software bugs?  What happens if a masternode operator does not implement critical security upgrades or fixes?  What are the sizing / hardware estimates for a masternode?  As well, when will the OT IT-team publish an operations manual for the masternode software that covers my questions? This includes security hardening, user- and role management, backup and recovery, software upgrades, monitoring and health checks as well as high availability concepts.  2)https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/wiki/Supply-chain-data-sync.. (https://github.com/OriginTrail/ot-node/wiki/Supply-chain-data-sync.)  In my perception the OT developers admit in their wiki, that the OT concept does not work in practise. Why? Because to make the OT concepts work, all suppliers have to establish a synchronized master database for the relevant products-codes, e.g. unique master-data ids, beforehand. Everybody in IT knows that this universal master-data database concept is similar to demanding for the Holy Grail of IT to make a concept work.  “Those DC need to establish the same codes for the same products so ODN can validate them. This brings another new level of issues that we call ""master data synchronization"". Currently, ODN doesn't have mechanism or tools to resolve this problem. Participants in the supply chain need to establish common master database that will enable them to exchange data.”  Any timeline when a solution for this fundamental issue will be published?  3) The source-code in the Github does even not include a license in the header?  Is the totally free to use or proprietary?

Same nickname at Reddit as here I think it is beneficial to involve a larger community of OT stakeholder, not only the ones scanning the Github. Like I said: Average Joes should be aware about the use or value of their OT tokens. Github is not a place to ask questions, propose change request or roadmap discussions I don't do other people’s home-work by maintaining their Github   The protocol itself is the knowledge and expertise of OT, nothing I could contribute from a domain perspective. I am having a look at the more general IT-architecture setup. Proposal: The OT teams updates their inventive model to cover my questions. If my questions sound feasible to the community. Proposal: The OT teams creates a bullet-proof operations manual for their infrastructure to be operated by token holders. Proposal: Like for ICONOMI, an external consulting company like Deloitte will review and audit the technical infrastructure setup and token incentive-model.  I would recommend the audit before the mainnet go-live.  I am pretty sure that this audit is exceptionally beneficial for OT to be adopted by large customers.   Otherwise every IT-staff at large clients will start to ask the same questions as I did. https://www2.deloitte.com/si/en/pages/press/blockchain-industry.html  Cheers, Chief Architect    [/list]",False

This announcement marks the successful completion of the first phase of the pilot project — the data integration phase. In cooperation with Internet-of-Things (IoT) solutions provider DunavNET, the project will enable wine producer Plantaze to showcase the veracity of their premium, award-winning wine. This is the first project where OriginTrail will be used for data coming from smart tags and the entities engaging them, which will enable the tracking of more than 15,000 unique wine bottles with the company’s protocol and TagItSmart solutions.  Wine is one of the most counterfeited products in the world. This not only poses harm to brands and wineries that are producing wine of the highest quality, it is also a public health hazard, since some of the counterfeit ingredients can be poisonous. In China, by some estimates, as much as 50% of all wine sold is counterfeit or mislabeled to deceive consumers.  OriginTrail’s decentralized, blockchain-based protocol provides a foundation for tracking wine from the vineyard to the point of sale as a safety measure alongside TagItSmart’s anti-counterfeit technology, utilizing photochromic ink together with unique QR codes. TagItWine is one of the pilots of the TagItSmart project, which is devoted to brand protection and anti-counterfeiting in the wine industry. The project is being implemented in collaboration with the wine producer Plantaze from Montenegro, an up-and-coming wine region in Southern Europe.  Plantaze’s premium and ultra-premium wines, consisting mostly of red and sparkling wines, are sold in more than 35 countries all over the world. The company just expanded its distribution to the Chinese market which highly values European wines. That is why it was actively seeking a way to prove the veracity and authenticity of origin for each bottle. https://medium.com/origintrail/utilizing-smart-sensors-to-prevent-wine-fraud-origintrails-pilot-with-tagitsmart-1949dc62113f",False

TRACE is already a real-world success, it's well-known in the food industry, it has won many awards, and you're already in use. A real working token being used! This is head-and-shoulders above many other cryptocurrencies based on that fact alone.  AND the token can be used in other industries. You guys are going to be the name in supply chain across the globe, I have no doubt of it.  But so many people online haven't ever heard of OriginTrail and TRACE yet. Why not? It's not the end of the world but why aren't Doug Polk, Jimmy Song, Decentralized TV, and the other big Youtube names in crypto talking about TRACE or interviewing you? Being known in the real world was more important than being known in the online world at the onset, I don't dispute that. Now that TRACE has hit the market though and people have invested in it, why not increase that online presence and take it to the moon?",False

OriginTrail is a protocol that addresses the crucial challenges that need to be overcome to enable trustless sharing of data in supply chains. By introducing decentralized protocol we are creating a foundational technology for trusted supply chains. Our team is building on years of experience with product traceability and OriginTrail protocol was already recognized by the world’s largest retailer.   Winner of Walmart 2017 Innovation Award  What Is OriginTrail  OriginTrail enables seamless data sharing along any supply chain. The decentralized, blockchain-supported network protocol ensures trust, transparency, and security. It helps companies exchange relevant data seamlessly and in a secure way to build accountability, protect their brands and increase efficiencies. Token Generating Event will enable development of the OriginTrail Decentralized Network that will be scalable and applicable to any product supply chain.  How OriginTrail Works    OriginTrail is a purpose-built decentralized protocol running on a network of public nodes and enabling blockchain supported data sharing in supply chains. It enables seamless and automatic data connection and interoperability between IT systems and devices of different stakeholders in multi-organisation supply chains, with consensus mechanisms for ensuring integrity of data. Data exchange is based on globally recognised GS1 standards, while existing blockchain solutions are being used to keep fingerprints of the graphs ensuring immutability. This brings a profoundly new way of building transparency in supply chains and provides a necessary foundation to build new value - increased trust, optimised supply chain efficiencies, automated compliance and enforce quality assurance processes.  Using OriginTrail, all stakeholders can securely share their data and keep sensitive data fully encrypted at all times. By supporting global standards for data exchange (GS1, IoT, compliance standards), OriginTrail assures compatibility with existing ERP systems, making implementation process quick and efficient. Finally, it is fully decentralised. It removes the possibility of collusions and introduces full accountability for the data provided. OriginTrail is built on existing use cases.                 Token Generating Event will enable development of the OriginTrail Decentralized Network that will be scalable and applicable to any product supply chain.        Who Will Benefit  Partners in Supply Chains OriginTrail is based on industry-standard global GS1 standards which are needed for wide adoption of the solution and is also ready to incorporate Internet-of-Things (IoT) data. This will enable development of a wide range of decentralized apps for supply chain management, certification, brand protection, and much more.  Consumers Modern supply chains are complex and opaque, information can easily get lost. We have experienced a number of affairs in the recent years, leaving consumers concerned. OriginTrail solution will enable the brands to be more transparent to consumers, thus increasing the standards and trust in global supply chains.  Environment More transparent supply chains, with less risk for fraudulent behavior, bring benefits to the society in general. In addition to increasing efficiency and brand protection, trusted information, hashed on the blockchain, diminish possibility for bad environmental practices and poor labor conditions.  Supporters OriginTrail will issue pre-mined, non-inflationary utility tokens (TRAC), which will be used to safely store information on the OriginTrail Decentralized Network. Value of the tokens will increase with the use of the network.

TRACE is a utility token that will be required for any use of the protocol (adding data to it or reading from it). The most important function of the token itself is therefore to be used in the ecosystem. Because Trace is limited in number, higher demand for it driven by the users of the protocol will increase its value. A model showing the demand based on certain usage phases will be released in the next weeks for the community to see.   How does OriginTrail differ from similiar projects that address supply chain traceability issues through blockchain (Ambrosus, Modum etc.?).  OriginTrail protocol functions as a “middleware” built on top of different blockchain technologies on one side and applications for supply chains on the other. Our protocol adds to the blockchain layer through an off-chain decentralized network of nodes that provide an efficient way to store supply chain data and perform necessary data checks (consensus check between inputs of partners in supply chains, data replication checks, data quality checks involving a tailored zero-knowledge proof mechanism for sensitive data...). OriginTrail as a tailor-made protocol for supply chains therefore complements other platforms/blockchains/applications/hardware in the field by providing functionalities that currently don’t exist and will make building transparency in supply chains easier for them.  The crucial bottlenecks OriginTrail will help others address are: 1) poor interoperability of data within supply chains (or even within one organisation); 2) inadequacies of blockchains to efficiently store highly interconnected data needed for supplychain; 3) issues with sensitive data that make companies more reluctant to share data.   What is Walmart's role in all this?  Walmart has given us a great recognition by admitting us in their Innovation Pipeline. We were even more excited as our pilot project with Yimishiji (an online retailer) received a special Food Safety Award at the same time. In more tangible terms, being a part of this ecosystem will give us a chance to collaborate with other companies in the Pipeline and shape how food safety systems will look in the future. In the process, we will be working with a wide network of Retail & Logistics professionals from Walmart and beyond, with experience in implementation in global supply chains. We will shortly share more updates about this development.  Be sure to join us on Telegram to chat with the team: http://bit.ly/OriginTrailTelegram",False

TLDR: Yes, that would make a great use-case.  The protocol is both ERP-agnostic and blockchain agnostic. It is based on GS1 standards, so it can be set up with any product supply chain and can include IoT data from sensors. By providing integrity to the data sent from the sensors, OriginTrail can act as a foundation that supports exactly such cases.
