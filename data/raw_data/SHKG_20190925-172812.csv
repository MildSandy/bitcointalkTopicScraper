Victor Hugo  We have an ambitious plan to protect all the world’s websites from hackers by incentivising all sites to work together in mutual self-interest. Our existing technology is already one step ahead of the competition. With sites working together, utilising the blockchain, we can also ensure cybersecurity always keeps one step ahead of the hackers too. We are ready to protect every website in the World. The cybersecurity market is ready for disruption. Join us, as with the support of the people we can hit the speed of growth required to address the cybercrime crisis and change the status quo.   About us  SharkGate has been a registered UK company since 2014. Massive growth of 7000% in 3 years. Became one of the top 3 website malware cleaning and protection services. Over the last years, SharkGate has formed a flawless team of AI and security experts.   Current problem  The current SharkGate services are centralised using large cloud infrastructures. There are more than 1.86 billion websites on the internet and around 18, 500, 000 (1%) of these are infected with malware at a given time each week. It is predicted that by 2021 cybercrime will cost the world $6 trillion annually. That's double the $3 trillion tab cybercrime racked up in 2015. Traditional services/firewalls will never be able to keep up with the constant evolution of malware. We Need Change Now.     The Solution:  SharkGate is the World’s pioneering Cyber Security blockchain solution designed exclusively to protect websites against hackers. SharkGate protects any website by the simple installation of the 'SharkGate Plugin'. The plugin automatically protects a site from all malicious attacks using a combination of the collective intelligence of SharkGate's AI (""Deep Sea"") and SharkGate's Website Threat Defence Database (""WTDD""). SharkGate already protects 1000's of sites worldwide via both of these services packaged in a centralized form. We are now moving both of these to a decentralized model utilizing the blockchain where they will devour the Big Data and grow with an exponentially increasing rate.  In addition to website owners benefiting from having an infection and hack free website, they will also be incentivized by a tokenomics model to contribute value in terms for witnessed attack data to the distributed network.  SharkGate moves website cyber protection to a situation where an attack on one site in the network enables a global immunity to be immediately developed to protect all sites in the network from similar attacks. Where a solution does not depend on one solitary party or some paid subscription, but instead about a network of websites who all share in the evolving of the firewall, everybody profits, everybody contributes and actually uses the power of the hackers own attacks against themselves.

Okay, just to give some background info so as to help explain a little better... we currently run an existing malware removal company (https://www.onehoursitefix.com) that owners of websites come to when they find their site has been hacked. So they sign up with us at the OneHourSiteFix service and we clean their website from all infections (plus remove hacker backdoors, control panels, etc). Once the website is clean we place it behind our SharkGate Cloud-based web application firewall. So our current firewall is a centralized model, blocking millions of hack attempts every month. As well as our SharkGate firewall we also have an existing SharkGate plugin that can be installed on websites and aids our protection services by providing file modification, etc data directly from the site.  The future.... we are now moving to a model where websites are protected by the decentralized ecosystem. So to place a site behind the SharkGate protection, the websites will need to install the 'SharkGate Plugin'.  This is just a small application that can be really easily installed on a site with just a few clicks. For example on a Wordpress website (which about 30% of all the websites in the World are) it takes about 1 minutes to install (https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/). So there is a very low barrier to entry for site owners.  Actually, one of the key parts of our roadmap is to make sure this plugin is available in all the popular plugin directories for websites. Plus we will get hosting companies to recommend and guide owners through installing this plugin too. We have good links with hosting companies (due to being in this business for the last x years) so we will be working on having hosting companies even install our plugin by default on new sites. It is very beneficial for hosting companies to use something like this, so it is a win for them to as it causes them a nightmare is websites on their servers are hacked (due to issues such as cross-site contamination, hackers mining installations taking up all server resources, etc)  Once the SharkGate plugin is installed on a website it will provide unrivaled hacker protection to a website, plus runs a 24/7 malware scanner  (so basically recreating and building on our experience from our centralized model of keeping websites clean). The plugin will use the collective intelligence of the SharkGate AI (“Deep Sea”) and the SharkGate Website Threat Defence Database (“WTDD”). With site owners recommended to and installing the plugin themselves this also allows us to scale the take up of this solution. So this helps resolve any resource issues :-D  Websites using the SharkGate plugin will automatically provide threat data of attacks their site has received and malware found to the SharkGate ecosystem.  A simple example would be ... imagine a site using the 'SharkGate Plugin' is attacked by a hacker network that attempts a dictionary attack (20K logins on a website). The SharkGate plugin would block this attack for that site but also analyze the attack and send relevant threat details about that attack to the network. For example, say all these attacks came from a certain set of hacked sites on the AWS network and the hacker scripts had made a simple mistake on the UserAgent (missing bracket from the user agent string for that browser - that sort of silly mistake in hacker scripts happens more often than one would imagine). The plugin would feed that info back into the SharkGate data stores and AI so rules would be created to protect all other sites on the network from the same attack and the website owner would be compensated for helping grow the network of protection for all sites. Okay, this is a very simplified example but I  hope it helps show the process.  Ah, that turned into a very long answer, sorry for that :-) any questions or clarifications needed please don't hesitate to ask.",False
