Looking like a one-click purchase for an end-user, technically it would work like this: fiat => DMT => DMC, simply put. Asked about fiat and how they would exchange it to DMT... basically they will be connected to an exchange (unknown at the moment) and swap fiat for DMT via api calls instantly.

After thinking for a while I’ve decided to share my predictions of possible announcement:  - To start with, it can Unreal Engine partnership. Just follow my logic: what is their ultimate goal? Supporting widest range of games. They’ve already partnered with Unity, so next comes Unreal Engine. Before Unity I would say it’s just dreams, but these guys seem to know how to negotiate with giants in game industry.  - Another one is Xsolla integration. A while ago DMarket partnered with Xsolla and they planned to make DMT on of the currencies inside Xsolla’s payment system. That didn’t happen though, and now it can be a perfect moment for integration. Xsolla is really popular so this would be a huge step for DMarket.  - New game publishers connecting to DMarket platform. Obvious one, but still could be a powerful announcement with a big name like Blizzard.     What do you think about it?  Do you have any ideas what “big news” can really mean?",False

We're currently waiting for SEC to release the clarification statement regarding ICOs in the US. Despite having the best legal team in the crypto, we, however, can't push US regulators. Neither can our legal partners. The main point for SEC is to protect US citizens from investing in projects. As of now, SEC meticulously checks every single ICO project, where US investors could've been involved. That means, if the US citizen contributed to the project, SEC has all the rights to do their research and check if everything went according to the US laws. Our take on this one: it is true that we had a bunch of US contributors and now one of our key tasks is to omit any issues with SEC regulation. We've already spent hundreds of hours with the legal team to pursue our goals. Currently, our own deadline of hitting an exchange is the end of February 2018. Let me explain: the team is planning to present a full-fledged product by the end of Q1 and hitting the exchanges is essential for the platform. At the end of the day, gamers need a place to buy our tokens in order to start trading items. After all, our end users are gamers, not crypto people.  Hope I managed to shed a light on what's happening with exchanges.  Cheers",False

The reason I'm saying this is the horrible treatment I've been having from D-Market's technical staff over the past 3 months.  I made my purchase during the Pre ICO phase, and I sent them about 0.35 BTCs.  At the time I did my registration there was no KYC process, just register the email, do the confirmation of the email and the password and send the btcs.  But due to the long delay in the tokens distribution and all these bureaucratic processes made by the D-Market team, the email provider that I used to do my registration unfortunately closed the doors before I received my tokens.  When I realized I was out of access to my old email box I immediately sent a message to the D-Market team asking what could be done.  Their response was that if I had my login and password working I could continue accessing the D-Market Panel normally, and at the end of ICO I could remove my tokens for an etherium wallet.  But in the meantime the D-Market team has come up with this stupid new KYC process, where the first step to verification is to get a link in the email used to register.  As I said before, my email provider has closed the doors, and I no longer have the email account I used to create my account, even though I have the login and password to access the D-Market Panel, I can not access my mailbox to get this confirmation link.  Again I got in touch with D-Market support and what they told me is that to change my email I would have to send some data to prove that it was mine.  They asked me the TxIDs for the transfers of the BTCs. And I sent it. So they asked me to wait. I waited for several days. Then they asked me for the old email address, and for a new contact email. I sent. So they asked me to wait. I waited for several days. Then they asked me for a printscreem gives my wallet, proving my transactions. And I sent it. So they said they could finally exchange me email so I could get my account back.  So this morning the response they gave me was simply that it was impossible to change the email and if I wanted to participate, I would have to create a new account and lose my old account - including the funds.  In simple words: just because my email provider has closed the doors and I can not confirm the damn link they are stealing my money under the claim that it is not possible to change my email.   I asked them to revert the BTCs transaction, and send back the btc amount to the same buyer wallet - fees (what I think is perfectly fair for both sides), they said no.  I asked them to send the tokens to the eth address that I had registered in the D-Market Painel when I created my account and they said no (becouse I couldn't complete the KYC email verification > becouse my email provide closed the doors!).    That means, they offer no means of account recovery. Posting this on the slack and on the Telegram I have met other people who are having similar problems.  And I believe that due to this delay in the distribution, it is only a matter of time until hundreds of users also have their accounts frozen and can not redeem their tokens .  And that's why I think a lot of people are going to lose their money by buying D-Market tokens. Becouse the team seems interested in making the KYC and audit process much bureocratic as possible just to try to freeze (and steal) the funds of as many people as possible.",False

For those who say they must be honest based on the fact they do not gave a discount during the pre-ico,  is it a true proof ?. I mean most of the ICO know that now small investor do not want to feed whales anymore. Plus if Dmarket trully has two Ico would it not be better for them to reinsure investor that they are not trying to grab money   ?.  VV",False

However, let us explain why Dmarket is based on the technology. We'd like to point out that decentralization applies to virtual assets trading, not the games itself.  Decentralization principle of blockchain is a key feature for a couple of things:  1. When your in-game items stored on the blockchain, you become a real owner of the assets, meaning you are free to trade exchange and evaluate on any platform. You won't have any limits regarding the place you can sell your items. 2. In most of the games, in-game items are strictly attached to the economy of the game. By storing virtual assets on the blockchain, we allow users to trade their items between different game titles. 3. It is impossible to steal your items stored on blockchain as every single transaction is tracked, unlike any other gaming platform. No transaction will be valid, without your special wallet security key.    ",False

First off, thanks for asking questions! Those ones are very interesting and we hope that our answer will clear things out for all the investors.  Let us start with the first one:  ""what makes your project so different that you would need to be crypto startup?""  We have a completely different business model: DMarket is a whole a new platform that opens up a lot of opportunities for both businesses and gamers. We're in talks with major world game developers and publishers in a bid to allow gaming industry (gamers being a top priority, of course) to trade items from different games effectively. With our API, publishers can actually transfer virtual items to the blockchain, which make you OWN those items. Most of the time, gamers don't exactly own items earned playing their favorite games. There's always a third party that sets rules of trading for all the gamers. When the game developer adds our API to a certain game title, in-game items become real, meaning a gamer can exchange, trade or evaluate the price of the item.  Having that in mind, we're building our own marketplace, where players can exchange and sell in-game items BETWEEN different games freely. Let's say you want a new armor for your tank and are willing to sell or exchange some skins from your favorite MOBA. On DMarket, you can do this almost in one click.  As true proponents of decentralization and the spirit of the free market, we're going to open our API to other trading platforms, so they can benefit from our technology as well. Gaming community, however, will benefit the most: with us, you will own your items. No ifs and buts.  Last but not least: we will also offer our API to literally any marketplace out there. Just imagine the world where you can trade your sword on Amazon, eBay or taobao, while getting anything from real life: new gaming peripherals, cloth, anything. Truth be told, this is our ultimate goal.   ""And what do you think your main advantages over other competition are..."" We don't compare ourselves to any other project. Facts work for us. If you're wondering, what makes DMarket solid: 1. DMarket is created for the gaming community, that’s why we're selling 85% of the total amount of tokens. Other projects usually sell up to 50% of the total amount of tokens, which give them tools to control the market and the investors. 2. We do not offer any discounts or bounties, treating each investor equally. Numerous ICO projects, on the other hand, use the following token sales to cover discounts given during presales. 3. Most and foremost we already have a fully functioning blockchain, the Alpha and testnet versions will be released in the following days (before October 30th). 4. Some projects that find themselves as our competitors, won't be able to deliver, as it is technologically impossible to bring their ideas to life as of now.  Could you explain how will you host a database on blockchain?"" Do you mean the database we use in the node? If yes, then we are using levelDB and will transfer on rocksDB.",False

It's mostly what I already read in the whitepaper. But your answers don't explain why you think you need to use cryptocurrency, blockchain and ICO financing, while you think your competition doesn't. Correct me if I'm wrong but everything you describe could be accomplished without using blockchain. I understand using blockchain and colleting funds the ICO way is more convenient for your project aswell as for competition. So I don't think it's fair stating they don't need cryptocurrency, but your project does.  1. It's not true most other ICO's sell just up to 50% tokens. Almost no ICO does that. They tend to sell 60% or more.  4. 90% projects won't be able to deliver. That's true for any startup not just blockchain startups using ICO funding.  3. Do you have any documentation on your blockchain we could look at? What consensus will it use?  So every node will also have a role of database server? That makes more sense. I understood your quote from the website as you were saying you are going to store data on the blockchain. Because blockchains aren't suitable for storing large amounts of data. How do you intend to achieve decentralization of the database? How many nodes will host the database and who will be able to run the nodes?",False

Quote from: CYPER on August 18, 2017, 09:53:59 PM 1 - That makes no sense. You can still use a smart contract for the Ether payments and your own system for the BTC payments. The benefit for your investors is that with a smart contract your tokens will be automatically and certainly distributed, while with your approach there is only a promise and nothing else. The whole point of using a smart contract is to avoid the middle man, which is you. You offer a project based on the Ethereum network, yet you don't use the one benefit it provides. That is counter-intuitive and can be interpreted as a possibility to scam.  akhavr, please explain, why you don't use a smart contract to handle the token sale.",False

A smart contract doesn’t allow to work directly with other blockchains. As we’ve already noted, it can include only one cryptocurrency. In this case, ETH. Unfortunately, not all of the investors are working with Ether. Those, who prefer other options, have to search for a way to transfer their coins to Ether, create an Ethereum wallet and invest in the ICO. We believe that all the investors should have equal opportunities. We decided on the current method based on a unified approach for every customer and the simplicity of the investment process. Unfortunately, even the smart contract doesn’t eliminate the possibility of fraud or scammers. Moreover, recently there were safety concerns with the usage of smart contracts. 2) You can use other sources - they will show you the same numbers. Calling it “cosmetic” equals to calling every blockchain transaction “cosmetic” as there is no access to the account. 3) As the recent months demonstrated both smart contract and multisignature wallets do not guarantee complete security.  It all depends on who writes the code. We are creating safe and secure code for DMarket marketplace.

Thanks for the questions. We don’t use the smart contract technology on the first stage. We have developed our own service which allows us to process incoming transactions from different blockchains because smart contracts at Ethereum can’t control transactions on bitcoin blockchain. The decision to develop our service can be supported by the fact that the software used on the main computer has been developed for decades, while the Ethereum smart contracts appeared only a couple years ago. 2. Our service is monitoring all incoming transactions to our accounts. The service accrues tokens to the contributors’ accounts and saves this in the database according to the token sale policy, as described on our landing page. The contributors can see the amount of accrued tokens on their profile pages. If a contributor would like to check the accuracy of the token accrual, they can compare the correctness of the calculations with the information from the blockchain. In this case, the blockchain is the source of the primary data. 4. The service described above also helps us check every transaction twice before sending the tokens and therefore ensure the safety of gathered tokens. All transactions done by the rules of the service will be taken into account in full. 5. At that, we are planning on using a simplified smart-contract based on the OpenZeppelin framework (see GitHub V2) at the end of the second stage of the token sale, which will allow us to solve two main issues: 1) Implementation of the ERC20 interface, which will allow trading our tokens on the external stock markets. 2) Accrual of the tokens bought by contributors to their wallets using the smart contract feature. As a result, the combination of our service and smart contract technology of token sale will guarantee simplicity, reliability, clarity, and safety of the contributions and token accrual to the personal wallets of contributors.",False

Theese tokens you are refering to, are ment to represent some sort of Ingame-Item within DMarket and not its currency (DM-Coin) - is that correct?

Don't miss your opportunity to become a part of the new and exciting industry! Join: https://dmarket.io   https://dmarket.com/  DMarket is a global marketplace to turn every virtual item into a real commodity. This paper discusses how we combine blockchain technologies and seven years of industry experience to bring this billion dollar market into the global economy. All the time people spend playing on their mobile, PC, console or any other platform could be finally worth something. Essentially, DMarket is a new ecosystem where gamers, developers and entrepreneurs can efficiently and securely evaluate and trade virtual items. Without risk of technical bugs or malicious parties. Thus actually building a new economic cluster joining existing markets.  How DMarket Works    Game universes are not connected to each other in any way. There is no safe and easy way to trade between them. We are building DMarket - a global marketplace based on blockchain and smart contracts. It enables one-click sale, exchange or evaluation of every virtual item between all games on any platform. The blockchain will ensure 100% security and safety. Smart contracts are the bridge on blockchain to connect all game worlds and universes without any third party needed. They will log changes of ownership and automatically transfer payments. The DMarket Token is native to DMarket, it is the only currency used in the marketplace.    Over 2.2 billion people play games every day on different platforms and devices. The gaming industry reached $100 billion of revenue in 2016 and is booming. Only around 4,000 pro gamers are making profits out of their time and skills spent in games. Just a couple of games with 6% auditory already turn over close to $3 billion dollars trading in-game items. After seven years of experience in the gaming industry, we can actually see and feel the pain of the other 94% of gamers in the world. No existing technology can connect the many different game universes and platforms. Players were resigned to their items becoming useless, despite spent time and effort. Today with the booming gaming audience, VR and AR markets, this has to be resolved as soon as possible.  Current in-game items trading market    The ROADMAP of our company    2016 June: skins.cash was created October: Added Dota 2 & TF2  2017 January: DMarket idea February: DMarket market and technical research March: DMarket team creation April: Integration meetings with game developers May: skins.cash achievements June: token sale development July: dmarket.io August: token sale phase #1 August: Skins.cash distributes tokens September: DMarket brand awareness October: DMarket Alpha November: Token sale phase #2 December: DMarket token listing  2018 January: DMarket main development phase February: DMarket security audit June: DMarket API integration December: first steps of Global market influencing  UPDATE: The first phase of DMarket token sale is closed.

Total in-game items cost is more than $100 billion.  Token Functionality  DMarket token is represented by DMarket coins. It will be used across the DMarket platform, and will not be limited by the platform in the future. DMarket coins will be used:  1- As a currency, in case of buying/selling in-game items 2- For deducting fees for trading in-game items 3- To distribute profits among digital property copyright holders 4- For premium account acquisition for wholesalers and retailers 5- For BigData-analytics acquisition 6 -To postpone service fees, based on smart contracts which are sourced from one DMarket user to another  WHY NOW?  At the moment, game universes are not connected to each other in any way. There is no safe and easy way to trade between them. Players spend time, experience or even try their luck to get new items in a beloved game. And in the end, just leave them there useless.

The main difference is that we offer to trade or exchange items regardless of the game platform. You can gain tokens for trades and exchange them for real things. MobileGO is a platform that is concentrated on the mobile industry. EnjinCoin is a service that offers a custom coin for game items and assets. GameCredits offers a payment gateway without any option of getting a real thing. DMarket is the first decentralized marketplace, which connects different game platforms into one ecosystem and provides a way to trade in-game items with a one-click sale. Moreover, DMarket creates real value for virtual content, so the players would be able to exchange virtual items to real goods. As for the audience, there are more than 2B gamers, who would be interested in the product. We are already working with game developers, who are interested in our API, and will soon announce several names.",False

Is this equal to Max Supply, so that there wont be any more DM-Coins minted after ICO sale has concluded that Hardcap? My main concern here is, that DM does not claim any Coins for themself, like most ICOs with Max Supply do - which makes me think that I might buy a currency that will be subject to inflation.   DMarket tokens are created through the use of the API’s endpoint and a token factory, itself using a library submodule that can be optionally imported, thus giving great flexibility to asset creators.  Theese tokens you are refering to, are ment to represent some sort of Ingame-Item within DMarket and not its currency (DM-Coin) - is that correct? In that case you would be using the term ""DMarket Token"" with two spereate meanings withing your whitepaper and I would suggest to change that. Otherwise it may seem, like DM-Coin will be highly inflationary - on the other side, if thats the case, I'm sure investors are eager to know about that.  Thank you in advance.",False
