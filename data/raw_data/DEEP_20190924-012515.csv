World's First Virtual World - A Decentralized, Democratic Architecture, Built to Last Forever   Aiming to interrupt an already exciting set of revolutionary tech releases, The Deep is here. The Deep is a newly designed platform consisting of a virtual world, ran by complete decentralized democracy. It's economy is structured by the blockchain along with full user consensus.  The team behind The Deep are thrilled to introduce the first five-level, quintuple protocol structure in the industry, architected on a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPOS) algorhithm.      Additionally to engineer-precise architecture, The Deep is a square looped world measuring in at precisely 10,000 x 10,000 cells, with a complete vertical height of 100 cells. The virtual world of The Deep is a state of the art P2P world, operating on a decentralized, distributed storage along with all of it's content. Copies of the data are stored on all user machines, creating a ubiquitous existance of The Deep throughout. Using blockchain-based technology and modern error codes, all data in the virtual world is kept safe at all times.  By the virtue of freedom, all users move freely in the liberating world of The Deep, as a result of a bespoke designed protocol. As far as realism goes, an open source graphics engine with primary use of primitives is in place, contributing to the real-life like reality of the world. Virtual Reality (VR) development plans are in place and will be a priority option to add at a later stage.  Examples of possible user activities on The Deep include:  Digital Asset Collecion Creative Asset Collection Advertising Offering of Various Services Gambling Gaming Simply, anything contributing to the healthy virtual economy.       Following the start of the Pre-ICO Bounty Program, the team behind The Deep are rewarding early adopters exclusively via BitcoinTalk, since giving to the community is part of the core philosophy. The Pre-ICO Bounty Program will start on the 15th September, 2017 at 2.00 p.m GMT (timezone). A total proportion of 1% of The Deep will be up for grabs within the BitcoinTalk community, amounting to an accurate estimate of $48,000 US Dollars with potential estimations of a x20 fold increase just after a year. The bounty program will officially run until the end of the Pre-ICO stage.  The prize pool for all Bounty Campaigns is joint, eligible participants will collect points, resulting in proportionate token distribution amongst participants holding more than 200 points in total.  The top three participants will benefit for a 0.1% bonus in tokens.  Please do not discuss about bounty here in this thread rather click below to join the bounty.  ..Bounty thread..      The 15th of September marks the start of The Deep's Pre-ICO. The Pre-ICO will consist of the distribution of Ethereum Tokens as a means of embarking on the first stages of development. These ERC20 tokens will be converted and exchanged to Deep Tokens, once favourable conditions are met in terms of development and planned structure. The total number of ERC20 tokens distributed will be 100,000,000 with no possibility of mining. During the Pre-ICO process, users will only be able to buy Deep tokens over the Ethereum Network.  While the hard cap is at 4000 Ethers, 30,000,000 Deep Tokens will be sold during the Pre-ICO itself. Due to a lengthy contribution phase of five stages, early adopters have time to get a taste for The Deep as a team, as a vision and as the revolutionary virtual world it has the potential to become. Development will begin immediately after the closing of the crowdfunding stage.  ..Join The Deep Telegram Channel..  ..Join Our Pre-ICO..
