What is more: commercial traction is just around the corner. Its token sale has been carefully crafted to relate to the reliability of our innovative CleanTech offering.     The CYO token is designed as a utility token (ERC-721 on the Ethereum blockchain) and entitles the owner to purchase and use future licenses and therefore towards the value of the intellectual property of the “CLEAN LOOP” technology.    The primary goal of this token sale is to establish mechanisms for cleyond to efficiently execute its vision: ‘a scalable solution to a global problem: plastic waste’ and to align the interest of token holders with the interests of the team. Therefore ITinance GmbH, as well as OVERW8 Digital Agency, were chosen to work on, conceptualize and develop the token sale and all related activities. While ITinance GmbH is taking care of the tech and security quality, OVERW8 agency shaped the business model and the token as a product and is also taking care of B2B marketing and communication.     About The CLEAN LOOP Technology   Memmingen, Germany. Since 2012, an engineering team had been developing an innovative technology. This CleanTech technology splits Polyethylene/Polyamide films back into their original components Polyethylene as well as Polyamide in a nearly residue-free and economical way. It then returns them as so-called “recyclates” to the commodity cycle as a high-quality raw material. This technology and the respective plant was found and bought by cleyond AG last year. The early stage investors took care of finetuning the technology and preparing the now upcoming Go2Market.       In the very same year that the waste wave surfer was shot by photographer Zak Noyle, at Memmingen (Germany) a research and development team had started out to develop a solution. It’s been named the CLEAN LOOP technology. Now ready to go to market, scale and explore even more high-quality recycling solutions, the team decided to make this opportunity globally available through an ICO. You and your participation in the CYO token sale can help to get this done faster.  The CLEAN LOOP Technology Solution   Plastic waste and its harmful effects are in the media everywhere these days. Primarily since the beginning of this year, the awareness has spread: Single use plastics are terrible - especially if their recycling is not handled responsibly. However, the problem is not as new as it seems - also shown in the key picture of this ICO campaign. The surfer riding the wave of waste stems from 2012. The obvious solution would be not to use plastics at all. On the flipside, plastic is being used so much precisely because it’s got some fabulous advantages: It’s incredibly flexible in its use and forms as well as very durable. It also allows us to buy hygienically packed food such as meat. Against this backdrop, plastics processing companies are facing two significant challenges these days:   ● The new EU packaging law demands twice the amounts of plastic waste to be recycled by 2020: 63% instead of 36% = almost double! ● the trend shift within society/politics towards real sustainability respectively even more Corporate Social Responsibility.   Both factors cause procurement preferences, in general, to change towards the more ecological / ‘cleaner’ players (given a real choice B2B buyers will choose the more ecological partner/product). This effect also applies for the procurement departments of the plastic processing industry: Their job is to purchase the granulates used for the production of, i.e. yoghurt cups and they are now under more pressure than ever to procure the more eco-friendly alternative if economically available. Up to now, the endeavour to procure more green alternatives proved unrealistic due to qualitative lacks of the available recycled granulates as well as too-small production capacities. More ecological but still economical solutions for the processing of production waste need to be found - asap.     More details in our Whitepaper   Why the CYO token purchase is a good idea:   1. Ecological: Support a highly relevant solution to a big problem (plastic waste) 2. 2. Economical: Participate in the success of a highly profitable business model 3. 3.
