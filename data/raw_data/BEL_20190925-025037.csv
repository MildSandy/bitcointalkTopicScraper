Thank you very much for your comment, I see you say you ""realize current lottery methods are highly transparent"" but let me ask you, how exactly do you do this?  Then you say ""everyone is confident of the lottery results being thoroughly tested"", etc... Google says otherwise, people are NOT confident of their processes being genuine and far from honestly held, there are millions of records that result from searches proving people being uncertain about them. This is a reality and players aren't able to prove that lotteries are acting the right way, and never will unless there's Blockchain in between them. That is Belotto's primary intention, to locate this technology in the middle and eliminate the need for blind trust toward lottery systems.  So that stories like Eddie Tipton's and many others throughout the story of lotteries won't be repeated and people are free to play lotteries without a single unnecessary worry.  We have included some information on this specific inquiry on our White Paper because we understand people have been blinded throughout the years and therefore can't be aware of the true reality behind mainstream systems.

Thank you for taking the time to come to our forum and ask such interesting question! I want you to know that this inquiry had been answered before, just like so many others that we can't see now because unfortunately, some of our posts have been deleted (repeatedly, not knowing why).  Here are a couple of reasons besides the undeniable advantages that our platform offers to players and investors that you can find on our White Paper: http://belotto.io/download/belotto-wp-english/?wpdmdl=14  Because we have been highly rated by several analysts at ICO renowned Listings, for example, https://www.trackico.io/ico/belotto/ https://icomarks.com/ico/belotto https://icobench.com/ico/belotto Find out more at our official website: https://www.belotto.io  Because we are giving people the opportunity of having a lottery that is not going to abuse or lie to them. Check the status of the others and tell yourself if you truly think they will take over the industry because they have what it takes to be positioned in the real world, most of them are past ICO, are they taking over yet? Belotto has this and much more to offer, it is a genuine company that is up and will go on until it is recognized as the most reliable leading lottery in the cryptocurrency sphere, regardless of the outcome of its ICO. It is completely up to you to come and join us early; this is just an invitation that allows you to make more profit from it than the regular users/players, but you decide what part you want to play.  Soon we will be releasing our M.A.P/M.V.P, and only contributors will be able to try it out. Real prizes on the way!  The cryptocurrency world is only starting, and successes inside it are not defined by the originality of their ideas or purposes, but the intelligence and creativity they invest into their projects, and the strength and vision of the teams behind them. Google wasn't the first search engine to exist, was it? Far from that, indeed.

We bring transparency into the lottery business and combine our tech knowledge with the amazing blockchain to make more millionaires in the most honest way.   We all dream about becoming rich overnight, don't we? However, we can’t trust current lottery systems as they present plenty of inconsistencies and lack reliability. It is time for an honest lottery we can put our trust in, and Belotto has the solution. A new era of real lotteries where there is no more uncertainty, but a great deal of winning opportunities for everybody. Belotto is a decentralized lottery system built on its own blockchain, created under the Hyperledger platform using Ethereum’s technology for managing BEL tokens based on the ERC-20 protocol, aiming to develop an innovative, secure and transparent global product. Belotto will build a bridge between the crypto community and traditional lottery users by offering prizes of the most valuable cryptocurrencies of the market carried out through a very conservative scheme. Each purchased ticket will increase the jackpots and will be added to the initial base amount of each lottery. The transparency of the ecosystem will allow users to verify the jackpots’ progress in real time.   The world’s truly transparent lottery. Smart Tickets will associate each user with their played numbers preventing ticket forgery and guaranteeing a fully transparent mechanism. Prizes will always be delivered, there are no minimum or maximum limits. Whoever hits the numbers takes it all, because the money is actually there. No deductions will ever be applied to jackpots, as the administrative fees are automatically distributed by Smart Contracts before every new addition. Escrow will ensure payouts are transferred directly to the winners’ wallets without needing regulation or third-party intervention. Universal presence that enables ticket acquisition and prize delivery without leaving home and anonymously to protect users’ integrity. Jackpots and sales history are publicly available and stored on the blockchain for permanent and transparent reports. Money raised once reaching Hardcap and through subsequent Second Sale stage will become the base amount of the first jackpots for millionaire prizes from day #1. BEL tokens are granted as a gift after credit purchase through Pre-sale, Sale and Second Sale stages. Upon completion of these stages, the token will be available through multiple exchanges.   Token Details  BEL tokens are built over the Ethereum blockchain and a fundamental component of the Belotto ecosystem, integrally designed to be used within the platform giving a key value to its economy. Acquiring BEL in early stages entitles holders to benefits while providing the use of services at special prices. These tokens may be obtained through Pre-Sale, Sale and Second Sale stages by purchasing credits.   Incentives   Users who purchase credits in early stages (Pre-Sale, Sale and Second Sale stages) will get discounts and be granted with BEL Tokens proportionally. These credits allow Smart Tickets acquisition that enables lottery participation inside Belotto. Depending on the sale stage there will be discounts (bonuses) that will grant more credits for less money. Users will receive the same amount of Tokens as the number of purchased Credits. After early sale stages and during regular operation of the platform, purchasing lottery tickets through BEL tokens will confer special prices that won't decrease the jackpot amounts as Belotto will cover the remaining costs. Distribution: 30% administrative expenses: payroll, marketing, technology, rewards - 70% Jackpot (60% current - 10% following).
