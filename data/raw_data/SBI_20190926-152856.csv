Today we publish the promised report on the next trip to our fields. The research expedition was successful, the results fully meet our expectations.  Video report from our working group, You can see on our channel.  Link to video playlist from last expedition: Expedition for samples. July 2018  In the report, you will see how to clean the rock under the guidance of our geologist, search and separation of samples. In a walk through the field, you can see the real appearance of the granite massif, and even the surface occurrence.

So its quality is better, and, consequently, the final price of raw materials will be higher.  https://d.radikal.ru/d20/1807/28/1d88efb4a866.jpg    The approximate price of cubic meter of our stone is 35-40 thousand rubles, with an average profitability of such a career of 30 million rubles per month, against 25-40 thousand rubles of the extracted stone in the already working fields of Karelia, bringing income to their owners about 15 million per month, with the current volume of production and demand in the market. But the existing deposits are very close to closure, raw material reserves are running out, and the demand for stone is growing, and the price is growing. Thus, our deposits should reach the leading positions in the future. We will process the extracted samples for texture disclosure and quality evaluation by investors.  At the moment we are actively developing a new WhitePaper. The result will be this week (we will announce the ICO terms later). As well as the preparation of the first “off-chain” sale of one of the fields. We'll have our first major investor.  We remind you that we have an experienced team with many years of successful work on the territory of Karelia (all information about us is available), we have received all the necessary documents for these fields (there is in the header of the topic).
