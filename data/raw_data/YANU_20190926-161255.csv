Maybe you should consider editing this post and enlarging it with a more bold font added too.,True

For now we're (esspecially me) waiting for the exchange listing, because if we see the roadmap, YANU should be listed on exchange in this Quarter. But maybe we must be patient hehe, because for now, this is not the best time for that hehe.",True
