I know Jaxx had a hard time integrating it, and dropped it from their road map.  Well yes, Monero is definitely harder to integrate than most, not even so much because of RingCT, but the protocol itself that's different. It won't be available from the start, but eventually once we finish integrating our more prioritized coins (especially platforms), we will add Monero as well.   Quote from: kamarchek on March 21, 2018, 10:04:56 PM Hi guys, few questions. 1. What is the timeframe after the token sale the product will finished and launched?  2. Will the product launchin alpha stage? 3. Looks like there is only one full time developer right now. Of course even one smart developer can pull it single handedly in the beginning, just like FB and Microsoft in the early days. But how long after the crowdsale you are going to recruit full time members and staff? What is the plan? 4. Do you plan solely using the crowdsale fund to fund the development and marketing? or do you have plan to inject your own funds into this project? Because the hard part in my opinions is the marketing to attract users to use this exchange, if the crowdsale only managed to raise such as $1.5M i think it's quite hard to compete against the big boys. Do you guys also open to pitch to investor and get series funding to expand? (since basically you guys own 50% of the shares/revenue because half of 0.2% transaction) Thank you  We are already looking for new staff members, as well as traditional investments (which is already a part of our funding).  We aren't really scared of the big boys. There are too many flaws with most of them, and we know that if we do a better job, the users will come on their own. We expect to generate revenue and profit from the first month from launch, so the marketing budget will be partially formed by that as well.

It's a centralized exchange that is created as a telegram bot. The bot takes inputs and shows you the interface, and through the Telegram servers it gets sent to our servers which then process the requests. We don't know your IP address or really any meaningful information, except for what you give us. That is the core feature of our platform, it's an approach that allows us to create a very safe and powerful exchange due to the two layers of security (Telegram servers or other messengers - Our servers that are hidden from the public view).

Of course even one smart developer can pull it single handedly in the beginning, just like FB and Microsoft in the early days. But how long after the crowdsale you are going to recruit full time members and staff? What is the plan? 4. Do you plan solely using the crowdsale fund to fund the development and marketing? or do you have plan to inject your own funds into this project? Because the hard part in my opinions is the marketing to attract users to use this exchange, if the crowdsale only managed to raise such as $1.5M i think it's quite hard to compete against the big boys.

The statuses are generally paid for, but of course we may decide to give them for free for contests or other merits.  Also, to clarify a misconception. Our exchange is centralized, in the sense that the private keys will be held by us. Our goal is to create a competitor to Bittrex/Poloniex and others, combining ease of use with a secure and powerful platform.",False

You will need to have a Telegram account though. The first post features a detailed ""how to buy XNT"" video.  Quote from: Logan22 on February 25, 2018, 11:32:28 AM I have checked the website and I didn't find anything about Europe. When are you going to implement it?  Our exchange is global, and we will also be implementing EUR fiat transfers in April, so it will definitely be quite convenient for Europeans.  Quote from: EfIRchEk on February 25, 2018, 11:33:11 AM Am I right if I presume you will create your own blockchain for the application. So a token swap will be implemented on a later stage?  No, the token runs on the Ethereum platform. The exchange itself runs on normal servers. No token swaps are planned.  Quote from: Casperok on February 25, 2018, 11:34:43 AM Do you have any competitors? I know some similar projects, but they have a slightly different idea.  As far as we're aware, none that actually want to create an exchange as a bot for Telegram and other messengers. Also our other ideas are quite unique, like the Investment Management System which will allow the creation of indexes and mutual funds for cryptocurrencies.  Quote from: maAE$tRo$2000 on February 25, 2018, 11:35:25 AM Exenium project is promoting community construction, and all kinds of bounty activities are in progress. Unfortunately, there are no signatures. The project roadmap has planned the development of the next 2 years, and it looks good.  Thank you! If you mean that we haven't released the signatures, that's not true! They can be found here: https://medium.com/@exeniumexchange/exenium-bounty-campaign-2e59d46116b6  Direct links: https://goo.gl/Utxf6K (signature) https://goo.gl/i4t5rF (avatar).   Quote from: kamarchek on February 25, 2018, 11:36:04 AM The project seems to have prospects, but from whitepaper, I do not quite understand what the value of tokens is to me, for example, if I'm a small investor? And another question: Since I didn't find a separate bounty of threads, I'll ask you here: With Twitter participating in the bounty, do I need to provide weekly RT reports?  No need to do reports, we will check by ourselves. The token allows you to pay future commission fees with a discount. If you're not interested in that then you could simply hold, our mechanisms ensure that as the exchange grows, the price of the token does too. It's similar to any other coin in that sense.  Quote from: Aberrant on February 25, 2018, 11:36:54 AM I've just seen that the ICO is running until March 25. Very long ICO... any reasons for this? Can it be seen somewhere how much money they raised so far?  Well the ICO is also a means of attracting future users, so it doesn't make sense for us to do a 1 hour ""all or nothing"" campaign. It's not the only ICO running in the month range, anyway. To see the money raised, just go on our website exenium.io  Quote from: Fanat74 on February 25, 2018, 05:27:14 PM Your product is interesting, but the bounty campaign should be overthought again.... Too less money for too much work.   Well our bounty rewards are in line with all other bounties. Some of the campaigns (like newsletter, Telegram) require almost no effort. For the Facebook/Twitter campaigns, we only ask one post shared per week, which doesn't seem too complicated.",False

The supply of XNT is a lot scarcer than many other coins (<1 million) so its price will be higher than most, if marketcap is equal.  Quote from: CrYpTEr$$ on February 23, 2018, 07:16:08 PM Hello, I wonder do your bot is ready to use or it's in some kind of alpha or beta stage?   It is right now in a beta stage, to be released fully in late March. You can see an early prototype at https://t.me/exenium_demo_bot.  Quote from: Logan22 on February 23, 2018, 07:18:25 PM Is it me, or this project is heavily linked on the assumption that people will use their own crypto? I am not totally sure that their token will be used for day to day payments rather than for stocking value.  It's not. XNT is only one of the alternatives, and it gives a permanent discount.  Quote from: Vurdalakus on February 23, 2018, 07:19:23 PM You have hard cap in about $50m, but eth is volatile like crazy right now. Do you have fixed hard cap in usd or xnt?   In USD.  Quote from: Ceburekus on February 23, 2018, 07:47:53 PM So, is the project going to sell their services in own cryptocurrency? This would have many pros and cons. Definitely, a challenge to overcome.   It's only one of the payment options.  Quote from: Drugser on February 23, 2018, 07:59:39 PM Do I understand this right, you are planning a free airdrop? or is this only to get users onto your platform?   We have a welcome bonus of 1 XNT, but no airdrops.  Quote from: Ceburekus on February 24, 2018, 05:53:42 PM Where can I find document list for KYC and supported countries?   That will be released after the exchange is launched. There will be no restrictions in terms of countries.  Quote from: maAE$tRo$2000 on February 24, 2018, 05:56:15 PM Awesome project! Decentralized exchange powered by blockchain technology and smart contract is promising to be newsworthy. Looking forward to get coins. Can you please tell me the end date of the ICO?  We are not a decentralized exchange, just a special approach for a centralized one. The ICO ends on March 25  Quote from: Vurdalakus on February 24, 2018, 05:57:01 PM When will I get my tokens - after payment or after the end of ICO?   They will be credited after 15 confirmations on your exchange account, but to withdraw them to a wallet you will need to wait for the end of the ICO, after which we will release the contract.  Quote from: Drugser on February 24, 2018, 05:57:45 PM Does management have a view on global development of this plan as well?  Our end goal is to create a white label solution, with e.g. localized fiat solutions. The purely crypto part of our exchange will be globally available, however.",False

We have Telegram where all team members are active, https://t.me/exenium_chat  Quote from: aydarm16 on February 15, 2018, 02:21:07 PM Several questions:  1) Do we really need the token? why can't we pay for services of an exchange in fiat or other crypto? Liquidity of a token is gonna be linked to liquidity of an exchange.  2) The exchange is centralized (runs on messengers). The cryptocommunity is aiming at decentralization.  3) How are you going to make people trust this exchange?  4) How Know-Your-Customer/Anti-Money-Launderin policies are going to be implemented?  P.S. Correct spelling errors on your website!   1) It is possible to pay with other coins or fiat money, but paying with XNT is simply more advantageous due to the discount, especially for things like listing fees.  2) We believe there is enough demand and room for both types of exchanges. Our solution is unique, and it improves on many shortfalls of traditional exchanges such as ease of use, performance and security, and customer support.  3) In terms of security, we use all the standard security approaches with hot and cold wallets, our exchange core is completely hidden by the Telegram servers (so an attacker would need to hack it first), and overall we place a lot of focus on this aspect. We are planning on releasing a more detailed explanation of our architecture, within reason, so as to not reveal too many details and make us too exposed. In terms of trusting us as an exchange and team, we are all real, known people. We have several partnerships lined up, which gives even more credibility. Obviously the best thing would be a solid track record, but everyone has to start from somewhere, and we think our starting point is quite good.  4) It will be implemented through a dedicated verification page with operators, and later AI verifications. It is of course our highest priority after the actual launch of the exchange.  Quote from: Titomonriki on February 15, 2018, 02:23:48 PM Will be great when bounty program goes live to raise awareness further! Very excited about this!  It is already live, https://medium.com/@exeniumexchange/exenium-bounty-campaign-2e59d46116b6  Quote from: KaDeGrOB(1) on February 15, 2018, 02:29:31 PM Hey developers, what plans do you have over the next few months? When will we have fully working product?  In our white paper, you will find a detailed roadmap: https://exenium.io/upload/iblock/9bc/Exenium-Whitepaper-Eng.pdf The exchange will be operational at the end of March, before the end of the ITO. Quote from: datguyian on February 15, 2018, 03:12:19 PM Quote from: Treasurer on February 15, 2018, 02:38:33 PM Each Exenium Token spent by a user will be removed from circulation, i.e. “burned”. Paying with tokens within the system will be advantageous, since the user will receive an additional 10% value to the exchange rate at that moment.  If those tokens are regularly burned, can that processed be compared to a buyback program or what is it most similar to?  Well, in a sense it could be defined as a buy back, but it's not a programmed event. It's intended as a way of providing a deflation mechanism.",False

And how do you keep bot up to date?  One of the main reasons to launch the ICO is to be able to expand our team as much as possible, including 24/7 support in multiple languages. Obviously as a self-funded startup our team is fairly small, but we hope to change that. Seeing the struggles of other exchanges with being undermanned, we know very well that this is a crucial aspect of our future success. The bot is updated seamlessly, especially considering that it is simply an interface for our exchange core.  Quote from: Chu@N on February 14, 2018, 04:06:41 PM How can I buy your tokens?

Liquidity of a token is gonna be linked to liquidity of an exchange.  2) The exchange is centralized (runs on messengers). The cryptocommunity is aiming at decentralization.  3) How are you going to make people trust this exchange?  4) How Know-Your-Customer/Anti-Money-Launderin policies are going to be implemented?

Moreover, the implementation within a bot provides us with two separate layers of security. Basically, in order to hack us, an attacker would need to first break Telegram (or any other future messenger implementation), and then try to break our servers.

To expand on our previous answer, our token price is defined with respect to Ethereum, so any dips in ETH price will result in dips of XNT fiat value. After the ICO, the exchange rate will be determined by the market, so while in the long run, we expect for XNT to have higher and higher demand (and price), there may be short-term dips due to the overall market situation.",False

Website: https://exenium.io White Paper: https://exenium.io/upload/iblock/9bc/Exenium-Whitepaper-Eng.pdf Token sale: https://t.me/exenium_bot  Social Media:                 Key features of Exenium Exchange:   Easy to use, easy to access. By using a messenger-based interface, you can access the exchange on any device and quickly set up trades. Hack and DDoS resistant. Thanks to the additional security layer of the messengers, the core of the exchange is hidden. Crypto and fiat funding. An all-in-one exchange solution to satisfy all trading needs. Extremely quick and cheap listing. Projects based on the most popular platforms will be listed in just a day, provided they pass our review. ICO/ITO module. Other projects can conduct their token offerings on the platform, leveraging our user base. Investment Management System. A unique set of tools for creating and managing cryptocurrency funds and indexes. XNT utility token. Tradable for any coin on the exchange, and accepted with a discount for the payment of all exchange services. Referral/Affiliate program.

New projects wishing to be listed can do so with an XNT-only pair for a fraction of the cost of other pairs. This ensures the demand for XNT by users interested in buying these tokens.  Moreover, the exchange accepts XNT as payment for all the services it provides, including: trade commission fees, deposit/withdrawal fees, token listing fees, and many others. When paying with XNT, we will apply a 10% discount on the current market rate, meaning that paying with XNT will always be advantageous.  All tokens used for the payment of our services will be also withdrawn from circulation, meaning that XNT will have a deflationary supply.  Put together, these measures ensure that the demand for XNT will always be proportional to the success of the exchange.     Bonuses for early investors:",False
