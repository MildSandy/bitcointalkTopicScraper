O2o means ‘online to offline’ commerce, a term used to describe the strategy of bringing online customers to real-world shopping locations. The RainCheck app helps the offline shopping experience by alerting shoppers when they are near items they have previously browsed online, then rewarding them with RAIN tokens through debit / credit card linking when a purchase is made.  Raincheck created on the basis of the Stellar blockchain, with its own RAIN token, and fast transactions. The user registers on the platform through the procedure KYC-AML, and attaches its payment cards through the application-wallet. Further, getting bonuses for purchases in offline and online stores, the user registers them on the platform, and receives in return a particular number of RAIN tokens that can be displayed on a bank card in cash equivalent or exchanged for bonuses in a particular store. Through the use of an online platform, stores will receive information about the purchases of a particular person in offline, and will be able to offer the buyer what he is interested in. And users will no longer lose unnecessary bonuses in one store, instead of it simply transfer them to another.

Stellar network and protocol has faster transaction speed compared with ETH. It also supports cross border payment very well. That’s why we choose Stellar for RAIN token because we need to process transactions quickly when users redeem loyalty points to RAIN tokens, purchase products through mobile app by paying RAIN tokens etc.  RAIN token is designed as a utility token. Besides the 35% tokens allocated for ICO, we also allocate 25% tokens as Rewards Pool used to work with merchants together to promote RainCheck mobile app, O2O activities, brands, Diagou activities. Through these activities, we can increase the circulation of RAIN tokens in all commercial activities of the whole ecosystem.  Once consumers receive RAIN tokens from the Rewards Pool, we will definitely allow users to transfer a certain percentage of tokens to exchange to cash out. Meanwhile, we will also ensure there are enough tokens to meet the circulation needs of commercial activities in the ecosystem. We will balance the circulation needs of both commercial activities and the crypto exchange.  When more and more people are willing to use RAIN tokens in commercial activities in the ecosystem, more and more people will need RAIN tokens. Because of the fixed supply of the RAIN tokens, we will expect the value increase of the RAIN token. The value increase of RAIN will also help to attract more people to join the ecosystem to use RAIN tokens to buy products, redeem loyalty points, redeem brand offer and so on.  Hope it helps. Thanks.",False

Actually, the RAIN token is an extension of our current card-linked loyalty program we are building now. Our solution can provide cashback based on the card-linked offer of three major schemes, Visa, MasterCard, and AMEX. Generally, merchants don't truly like cashback because they want consumers to spend more. RainCheck gives an option for merchants to customized card-linked offer using cashback and loyalty points together. Whether merchants have their own loyalty program or not, they can use the SDK and Smart Contract to plug into the RainCheck universal loyalty program based on RAIN token. We are building the RAIN wallet which will be integrated into our existing RainCheck mobile app for users to exchange between loyalty points and RAIN tokens easily.

To facilitate access to the RainCheck Platform and its functions, such as rewards trading, a new Stellar based token will be created, called the RAIN Token. At the time of issue, the RAIN Token will be used as the value unit within a loyalty DAO. RAIN Tokens will be staked by brands in relation to their community membership. Thanks to the micropayments feature, RainCheck is able to monitor rewards points value available from organizations in real time, and thus inform consumers of the current value and the exact source of rewards in real-time. People who receive or purchase RAIN Tokens will be able to trade these between loyalty programs and schemes. They also have the ability to trade them at any time on exchanges that support the RAIN Token. Merchants and brands can use the RainCheck platform to issue RAIN Tokens for carrying out tasks such as saving discovered items online and actually purchasing items from merchants, also engaging with marketing campaigns from brands.",False

Good question! This is from the RainCheck team,  ""RAIN Tokens are issued on the more secure Stellar network, not the Ethereum network.  Ethereum tokens are issued to the ERC20 Token Standard.  ERC20 tokens are easy to issue and are infinitely customisable using Ethereum’s smart contracting language but recent events have highlighted some weaknesses of using ERC20, including smart contract security issues and very slow transaction processing.  Many organisations with only basic tokens use the Ethereum’s risky Turing-complete programming language.  RAIN Tokens use the more secure Stellar model, without the full functionality (and potential pitfalls) of Turing-complete smart contracts.  Stellar’s model of simple atomic declarative multi-operation transactions leads to better auditable code and limits uncertainty and risk.  Stellar Smart Contracts are implemented as an agreement between multiple parties and enforced by transactions using Stellar –provided APIs with huge benefits in cost and confirmation time.""  Also, Stellar can be traded from day 1, meaning RAIN will be tradeable from day 1.  Hope that helps!",False
