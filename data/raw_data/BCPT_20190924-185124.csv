It was born when early humans’ desire to create and construct led them to branch away from caves and build homes out of stone. Since then, Masonry has allowed for such feats as the Egyptian pyramids, Stonehenge, the Parthenon, the Great Wall, and the Taj Mahal — all at one point were thought to be impossible structures.  Even though building reliable, beautiful and well-aligned structures out of hefty materials comes with inherent difficulties, stonemasons had a strong vision for a new type of architecture that speaks to power, reliability, and consistency, and the will and skills to turn it into reality. Thus, Masonry became the foundation of every structure that surrounds us today.  Similarly, Blockmason aims to become the foundation of the credit industry on the blockchain. The legacy of Blockmason is based on the most central tenets — laying the cornerstone of the new age by having a strong vision of what is possible, and developing platforms and systems that will change the landscape of the world as we know today. By leveraging smart contracts and enabling the development of the infinite number of applications built on the Ethereum Blockchain, Blockmason aims to increase the blockchain adoption for real, active, daily purposes.  Blockmason is the industry leader that is changing the face of the entire world, as a part of the historic moment where traditional systems are being replaced by the blockchain. It contributes to the robust new foundations of life, enabling the next wave of human progress.

Gatecoin is a bitcoin and ethereum token exchange based in Hong Kong. It was founded in 2013 and has been influential in the crypto community since then. It was the first exchange in the world to list ethereum's token currency ether (ETH) in 2015, and then the first exchange to list ERC20 standard tokens.  Gatecoin has been vital to the development of decentralized applications on the blockchain and can be viewed as an authority on the most exciting innovations happening in the space.  On December 13 2017, Gatecoin listed the Blockmason Credit Protocol Token (BCPT) on its exchange. Gatecoin will support the purchase of BCPT with BTC and ETH.  BCPT enables owners to participate in the Credit Protocol, a system whereby debts and credits are secured and tracked on the Ethereum blockchain. With the purpose of democratizing the allocation of credit through permanently recorded debts and obligations, the Credit Protocol has a vast potential scope, and could be applied to many forms of debt tracking.  Blockmason is currently working on releasing its first app Lndr developed on top of the Credit Protocol, that will track debts and credits between friends and family. The team also advises other developers and owners of BCPT (which acts as a use license for the credit protocol) towards building their own consumer and commercial-driven applications on top of the Credit Protocol.

We struggled with the decision of whether to use Ethereum, to customize Ethereum or another blockchain and run our own chain or to start from scratch.  There were various trade-offs no matter which option we chose, but ultimately we settled on Ethereum.  While we still are open to at some point shifting the Credit Protocol to a different chain or rolling our own, the main thing that helped us make our decision to use Ethereum and keeps us on Ethereum to this day is the potential for gigantic network effects.  There is a very large amount of developer resources being thrown at Ethereum currently.  Whether it’s the various ICOs (hopefully) building their projects on Ethereum, the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance or other companies doing more traditional startups using Ethereum, Ethereum is going through a massive onboarding process and it’s not simply individuals buying and holding Ethereum. The scale of development and what’s happening is unprecedented.  Bitcoin never got close to this kind of attention development wise.   So how does this all help Blockmason and the Credit Protocol we’ve built? One example is when people start storing identity information on Ethereum, that information could be incredibly important for specific credit applications. That information can be used to determine the eligibility of someone that will be given credit. It also makes it easier for less sophisticated entities to give out loans, because now they don’t need access to specific credit checks only offered by big corporations.  Instead, they can simply apply an algorithm to information that is easily accessible.  It's also helpful to have assets stored on the same chain so that those could be used for collateral, if for instance you wanted to take a loan out based on those assets or loan at one asset for a different asset or currency built on Ethereum.  In order for this all to work it’s ideal that there is the interconnectedness of everything like it is on Ethereum.  There are a lot of proposals for connecting all the different blockchains, but so far all these efforts haven’t produced much.  Another interesting facet of this network effect is when people are using different protocols for their debts and credits, there is a possibility of reading all that information and then using it to evaluate an individual’s credit score.  So the Credit Protocol could use information from other credit and debt applications running on Ethereum, this would be much more difficult to do if it wasn’t directly on the same chain with them.  With all of this (potentially) going on, it makes it a much more difficult choice to run the Credit Protocol on its own chain.  Running it on its own chain starts to feel like running your own LAN instead of being on the internet with everyone else.  That’s not to say that there aren’t trade-offs that one day might make it a better option to run on an isolated chain.  Ethereum has a lot of work to do to increase scalability and speed.  If the Ethereum network starts to experience serious congestion issues and another chain can solve these issues the decision to move becomes a lot more clear cut.  Storage is also another issue, with Ethereum it’s extremely expensive.   //Blockmason Team  *To see the original post, please follow the link: https://announcements.blockmason.io/ethereum-and-the-network-effect/",False

TL;DR: Many of our the Credit Protocol fans and users are wondering about debt enforcement. The Credit Protocol is a base platform that enables third parties to build lending apps. The “Trust” and “Enforcement” are functions of the apps built on top of the Credit Protocol. Similar to how we trust Amazon delivery — which is built on top of a base protocol (HTTP).  Summary Detail: How are debts enforced on the Credit Protocol? We get this question often.  Actually, the Credit Protocol (CP) is the base mechanism that enables other parties to build functional and trusted dApps (decentralized apps) on top of its core abilities. The function of the CP is to build the train tracks — so you (and others) can build the dApps that run on top of it.  The elements of trust, security, and enforcement will vary with the types of debts. For a lunch between friends it will be different than a car loan or a home mortgage. For a pair of concert tickets between strangers, different measures are needed than taking out a college loan. For this reason, various dApps built on top of the Credit Protocol will have their own enforcement mechanisms, and marketed to consumers and lenders as such.  More / Technical Detail:  The Credit Protocol is a protocol that stores credits and debts on the blockchain between two parties. These debts are stored with a memo indicating the reason for them. In order for these debts to occur, both parties need to cryptographically authorize the debt and credit. Notice until now we’ve said nothing about what kind of debt is stored, what currency the debts are in, what kind of debt it is, how large the debt is or what types of entities the debts are between. That’s because this type of information is separate from the protocol.  The idea behind protocols is that they are simple and broad. One of the most common and well-known protocols http (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) performs the simple and broad task of enabling data to be transmitted for the world wide web. Notice that it doesn’t say how you can guarantee Amazon will actually ship you a book after you paid for it online. Other entities are responsible for building Amazon, other entities are responsible for the payment systems enabling online purchases through Amazon, other entities are responsible for the law enforcement should Amazon decide to take your money, but never deliver the product.  The Credit Protocol functions in a very similar way. It allows dApps to be built on it and hooked in through UCACs (use case authority contracts), but those dApps are not controlled nor governed by the Credit Protocol. Through those dApps different businesses can build their own debt or credit businesses, or fun projects and it’s up to these businesses and the laws governing them to figure out enforcement when someone doesn’t pay their debts.  For example, if a bank started using the Credit Protocol to record debts it gives out, because of the reliability of the blockchain, that bank would still use the same mechanisms it does today to enforce that debt. On the other hand, if the bank started doing cryptocurrency collateralization, it would still be subject to the same lending laws it is today, but would be able to enforce debt non-payment by seizing those cryptocurrency assets used as collateral (within the specific laws of the jurisdiction of the bank).  None of this enforcement specifically involves the Credit Protocol. All enforcement is done by the businesses built atop the Credit Protocol and they are subject to the same regulations as other lending businesses.  //Blockmason Team  *To see the original post, please follow the link: https://announcements.blockmason.io/how-does-credit-protocol-deal-with-enforcing-debts/",False

To read original post, follow the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/blockmason/comments/7f72kb/why_blockmason_bcpt_is_a_good_investment/  -- Hello Crypto Enthusiasts, Today I want to post about why I invested in the very promising project that is the Blockmason Credit Protocol $BCPT. Fact: The global debt market is a $217 Trillion market that is controlled by banks and big corporations. Keep this fact in mind while reading this post. (source:http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-06-29/global-debt-hits-new-record-high-217-trillion-327-gdp) At this moment Blockmason has a very small market cap in proportion to the huge potential of the project. *Total supply: 116,158,667 BCPT *Circulating supply: 45,166,200 BCPT *Market cap: around $10 million Blockmason has developed the Credit Protocol (CP) that can register debts on the Blockchain. This makes Blockmason one of the few projects with a working product. The open source code and documentation provided by Blockmason makes it possible for developers and companies to build their own dapps on top of the Credit Protocol (CP). To run their dapps they will need transactions that can be created by staking $BCPT or buying transactions from bag holders. Example: John has 5000 $BCPT that generate transactions but John is a Hodler. Also John doesn’t know how to build a dapp. Still, John can earn money by staking his $BCPT and selling his transactions to developers or companies that have built a dapp on top of the Credit Protocol. Blockmason developed LNDR on top of the Credit Protocol. LNDR is right around the corner and should be released in a short amount of time (press time). There will be two separate features built into LNDR. The first feature is being able to create a debt with a friend and having him confirm it. The other feature is that debt can be paid back through a cryptocurrency payment or with a new debt that pays into the original debt. LNDR registers debts on the Blockchain using the Credit Protocol. The app makes it possible for anybody to register a debt on the Blockchain without even knowing what a “Blockchain” is. Use LNDR to split the bill from that dinner you just had with your friend. Example feature 1: Jolie and Susan passed their exam and have something to celebrate. They go to the club and order bottle service. After celebrating with “Alpha Omega” they need to pay the bill of $800. Susan and Jolie want to split the bill but unfortunately Susan forgot her wallet at home. Jolie wants to go home and so she pays the bill. Jolie opens LNDR and creates the debt that Susan owes her. Susan accepts the debt in LNDR and the debt is recorded on the Blockchain. Example feature 2: Willy and Walter are finished with dinner at a restaurant. They want to split the $50 bill but Walter doesn’t have enough money to pay. Willy pays the bill and opens LNDR to create a debt. Walter accepts the $25 debt that he owes Willy. The debt gets recorded on the Blockchain through the Credit Protocol. The next time they are out for dinner Walter pays the bill of $60 and creates a debt in LNDR. At this moment Walter doesn’t owe Willy anymore, instead Willy now has a debt of $5 that he owes Walter. He can choose to pay the $5 through a crypto payment or settle it with a new debt (with the next dinner for example). The Blockmason team is also working on patents to take on major industries. This is what the Blockmason team has to say on the subject: First: We are currently filing key patents with our legal team that will challenge multi-billion dollar industries. We have gone to great lengths to assure that there is no prior art, that our methods and processes are sound, and that the USPTO should look favorably on our applications and designs. While no outcome is 100% guaranteed we are bullish in the extreme on what this portends for the future of Blockmason. While we are building out this new IP that supports Credit Protocol and other internal BM efforts, we believe that our team will allow us to operate more effectively. These patents will keep the Credit Protocol an exclusive product with the aim for a big worldwide industry.

Being the Blockmason fan you are you may have heard about the app we have in development, Lndr (http://lndr.io/). Lndr’s core functionality is tracking debts between you and your friends and family. An important feature that will be built into version two of Lndr will be the ability to settle debts with cryptocurrency directly through the app. We plan on integrating a range of currencies but since we’re building on top of Ethereum that would obviously be the first to be integrated.  OK you’ve been using Lndr for a while now and now you have debts with your friends and family. All of who know hardly anything about cryptocurrency. They probably have never heard of Ethereum, maybe you’ve told them about how you’ve been hodling it and it’s on its way to the moon. Well guess what. Now you can settle your debts with them in Ethereum.  Now suddenly your friends who didn’t want to go to the trouble of setting up an exchange account and your family who was just a bit confused by how all this crypto stuff worked suddenly have $15 of Ethereum in their Lndr wallet. What will they do with that Ether? Maybe they’ll pay you back for a debt you have with them in the future. Maybe they’ll notice the price jump up. Maybe they’ll try to pay for everything in the future so that you’re always in debt to them and can pay them back in crypto again and again.  Lndr's other great feature is that it uses the Ethereum blockchain in the background. By this I mean that credits and debts get stored on the Ethereum blockchain, but actual users of the app don't have to worry about having Ethereum or setting their gas prices. This means that average users can start using Ethereum and the blockchain without even knowing they're doing it. As more and more people use Lndr, more and more people are using the Ethereum network.  Lndr is not simply an app using the blockchain to track debts between two parties. It’s not simply a way to send crypto back and forth between people. Lndr is Blockmason’s crypto trojan horse. By leveraging smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, we invite the other 99% of the world to use blockchains for real, active, daily purposes -- and to suddenly find themselves the proud owners of their first bits of cryptocurrency.  // Blockmason Team  To see the original post, click here: https://announcements.blockmason.io/lndr-the-blockchain-sleeper-cell/",False

Under review from USPTO, Blockmason seeks to own “credit” area in the Blockchain technology.  For months, we have been working on refining excellent patent application documents - getting the right designs, claims, and drawings to support the technologies we are developing in parallel with our programming teams.  When developing new technologies with global application, companies should use a mix of trade secret (i.e. keeping ideas internal), and patent protection (i.e. formal publishing of one’s inventions).  Blockmason has consulted closely with its in-house general counsel, as well as external patent and intellectual property attorneys. The project has been coordinated among our technologists, business leads, partners, and legal team.  In a field of rapid business and technology advancement, one of the best ways to protect certain new ideas is to seek out the publishing of unique and novel advances under patent filings in the U.S. and other countries’ patent systems.  We have filed very specific, detailed claims for Credit Protocol, together with broader claims where the state of the prior art warrants, in ways that offer Blockmason a major opportunity for long-term leadership in this emerging field of the blockchain-based lending and borrowing.  In fact, many of the world’s largest energy, technology, medical, and financial companies have begun with significant intellectual property claims – from the light bulb to the automobile, to computers, internet and cell phones.  Our goal is to lead Blockmason to a position of global significance in the applied blockchain technology space.

It's mean no volume to make a price increase.  and after 30/112017 when reward coin income to your wallet who will got reward coin will sold it for sure because that is a free coin and made the price going down.

The development of Lndr continues at full speed. We’re very happy with the progress we’ve made and want to share some updates on its progress. Although technical, you can always view the ongoing progress on our github at https://github.com/blockmason.  For those who weren’t familiar with our beta version of Friend in Debt, which was our internal name for what has now become Lndr. The basic idea behind Lndr is a permanent, immutable and double confirmed debt between two friends on the blockchain. Let me give you an example. You and another friend go out to dinner and one of you pays the bill. You want to record that the other person owes you money, but don’t really care about her paying you now. You just want her to pay for the next dinner or something. With Lndr, you can record that debt and then next time when your friend pays for dinner she can erase that debt.  So why is Lndr on the Blockchain? What benefit are we getting? One thing that we have to remember about every other non blockchain app in the universe is that the data stored within them is impermanent. What does it mean for data to be impermanent? It means hackers can come in and change it, the company storing the data can change it or the company could go out of business and all your data could disappear tomorrow. But with the blockchain, that doesn’t happen. As long as the Ethereum blockchain keeps chugging along, the data stored in Lndr never disappears. If Blockmason one day stopped supporting Lndr and there was no version available for your iPhone XXI another company could easily build their own front-end and tap into that same exact data set. That data will always be there and when you boot up this new app by this new company the same exact debts and credits you had with your friends before are still there.  Another gigantic advantage of the blockchain is that unlike banks, the blockchain doesn’t discriminate. Even if a bank won’t give you a bank account, even if you can’t get a credit card, the blockchain will let you use its payment network. This won’t be implemented until version two, but Lndr allows for the settlement of debts with cryptocurrency. This means there is a universal banking solution for everyone, everywhere in the world.  There are so many other things to write about how amazing Lndr is and how amazing the Credit Protocol is, but for now let’s talk about where the app stands. We are preparing for Lndr to be released very soon to the Android App Store and the Apple App Store. Our basic version with initial functionality is nearly prepared. This means that you will be able to add friends and double confirm debts and credits through the Ethereum blockchain. We’ll be following releasing more posts soon about Lndr’s features and other cool things that can happen with crypto because of Lndr’s existence.   // Blockmason Team  *To see original post, follow the link: http://announcements.blockmason.io/lndr-almost-here/",False

Mastercard is turning to the blockchain for a possible solution.

Among other things, doing so would vastly enhance the security of the data it collects. This is no small thing in light of the massive Equifax breach.

Overview Centralized apps are bad. Everyone knows this: if you want your blockchain idea to sound good, you just say that's its decentralizing something. Money, funding, love...you name it, it should be decentralized!  Well, a key component of our initial Fiddy (Friend in Debt) implementation is centralized, and we think that's a good thing.  But is that true? What if some aspects of decentralization that are useful, but others are useless or actively harmful?  What Blockchains Are Good for It's important to understand what blockchains, in their current form, are good for, and what they don't do well.  Blockchains are awesome at taking processes that required bureaucracy to guarantee storage and trust, and offloading those while keeping the same guarantees. They also excel at simplifying processes that require lots of human mental effort to track or monitor.  Our Needs Fiddy (and Credit Protocol) needs both of those features. People either offload tracking of money and debts to banks (bureaucracy guaranteeing storage and trust), the cloud (mental effort), or pen-and-paper (mental effort). By both recording debts on the blockchain and requiring both parties to confirm the debt, Fiddy takes advantage of the best features of the blockchain.  However, large public blockchains suck at speed and cost. And if we want people to use Fiddy, we need speed and low cost, otherwise we'll just have an ideologically pure app that no one gives a shit about.  The solution we've chosen is an architecture that makes certain decentralized guarantees for Fiddy, and then puts the rest of the information in centralized systems.  Guarantees Fiddy Makes All debts are recorded on the blockchain All Eth addresses that created those debts are recorded on the blockchain Memos saying what the debt is for are recorded on the blockchain Both users must have cryptographically signed in order for the debt to exist If everyone from BlockMason died in a plane crash tomorrow (or a freak gardening accident, or any type of disastrous event, really), users could recreate all data from Fiddy and keep going as if we had never existed How Fiddy Uses Centralization Fiddy centralizes all operations that are short-term, and don't form part of the permanent debt record. The main portions of that are:  Friend requests between users Pending debts and friendships Holding debts that are signed by one party until the other party signs or rejects the debt Notice that all of these operations are essentially temporary, and also ones that users don't want or need to pay for. By centralizing them, we create a much smoother user experience, while preserving all the key features of decentralized, trustless debt recording.  Final Thoughts Most dapps will have this pattern: a high-value, decentralized core, with lots of centralized infrastructure around it to make it accessible and clean for end-users. It's important to understand exactly what the key value propositions of your dapp are: the design will flow directly from that understanding and analysis.  If you like thinking about the boundaries between centralized and decentralized systems, you should join our Telegram and yell about things you want to see in future blog posts. I'll probably make fun of you for yelling, and then write about those things.  Timothy Galebach Read more posts by this author.

Since the first mainnet example apps are about to go live, I figured this would be a good time to explain how tokens work, and how app providers can acquire and use them.  Token Usage Tokens are staked to a UCAC Each token gives a certain number of transactions per hour A transaction is a write operation (updating the balance of a debt between two parties) The number of tokens needed to do a transaction can be updated by BlockMason currently -- in the future, we will make this community or market-driven Tokens are not ""burned"" when used, they simply have to wait an hour to be usable again Token Staking Tokens can be staked by ANYONE who owns tokens Tokens are staked to UCACs UCAC operators can choose to reward stakers if they want (example code for that coming soon) Staking actually transfers tokens to the Credit Protocol contract (to prevent double-spend), but they can be returned to users at any time How Do You Get Tokens for Apps? Have them from the ICO sale Buy them from someone else in a private sale or on a secondary market Receive them in an airdrop (details to follow) We at BlockMason are excited to see this all goes, and we are going to monitor early usage of tokens quite closely to figure out the best mechanisms for balancing the Credit Protocol ecosystem going forward.

The remaining tokens were purchased by STI Group based in Hong Kong. BlockMason Co-Founder Michael Chin has been in close touch with them and was able to present our vision for the future of the Credit Protocol, a detailed technical walkthrough of our upcoming mainnet deployment of the protocol, and behind-the-scenes legal work to protect our intellectual property through patents and licenses. Through this STI was convinced that BCPTs represent a scare resource for developers going forward.  The end of the token sale represents a welcome change in priorities at BlockMason. Going forward we’re excited to give our full attention to the Credit Protocol and growing BlockMason the company as a leader in the blockchain space.  As we’ve previously announced the Credit Protocol and the beta version of Friend in Debt are nearly ready to go live on the mainnet. The auditing of the protocol is being handled by Roy Blankman who we just hired. Roy is also heavily involved in Bamboo and working closely with Yoichi Hirai of the Ethereum Foundation.  We have other projects in the pipeline as well. BlockMason is currently developing a standalone DApp browser which we will release for free and open source to the Ethereum community. We are also in the planning stages of writing additional UCACs for the Credit Protocol, some of which we previously hadn’t thought of and give an even more unique vision of what the Credit Protocol can be used for.  We’d like to thank all customers who participated in the Credit Protocol token sale and would like to let everyone know that we will provide technical support to all things Credit Protocol related at via email at support@blockmason.io",False

Like - naturally as an investor, I would want to invest in something that is going to be the best bang for the buck. That said, if these tokens are just essentially entries to the ""highway"" of the blockchain credit infrastructure, wouldn't the tokens have to always stay at a relatively low price point to encourage people to use said highway? Will the market for the tokens govern the future price? If so, could this theoretically price people out of the credit highway if it became extremely popular? That would then defeat the purpose of BlockMason Credit Protocol, no?  I would like to invest more, however, if there will be a theoretical cap on how much this utility token held will go for, I am not sure how much money I really want to put into it. Sorry if I have a misunderstanding of how it works.  To sum up: how exactly will token holders make money in the future as BlockMason Credit Protocol becomes successful? Will the token price be manipulated to never go past a certain point - or could their be significant profits reaped in the future provided Block Mason's success goes as planned?

BCPT produces transactions that power the Credit Protocol.  The tokens, when staked to applications built atop the protocol provide transaction capacity allowing those apps to run.  Without the token, the application would not have write access.  Why would the value increase over time?   It would increase over time as demand rose for applications based on the Credit Protocol. As the protocol represents a scarce, desirable resource, backed by patent applications, copyright, and an ability and willingness to protect that intellectual property, an increase in value is very likely as credit recording on the blockchain becomes a standard use case.  Why would the value increase faster than BTC or ETH?   The current price of the token represents the price of the protocol before developers and the public understand the full potential of credit recording. The value and use cases of BTC and ETH are already substantially known. As applications based on the protocol spread, developed by our team or by 3rd parties, the value of BCPT will likely rise faster than BTC or ETH as that information gap closes.",False

BlockMason itself has recently released their first application built atop the Credit Protocol, Friend in Debt. While the Credit Protocol is a versatile platform for developers to build any variety of credit recording application, Friend in Debt is a simple and powerful program for tracking social debts among friends. Unlike Venmo, a centralized competitor, Friend in Debt is not restricted by borders, currency, or banking, and adds the ability to keep balances outstanding in addition to spot settlement. Its beta version is already deployed for public vetting on the testnet for anyone with a Metamask supported browser.  About Jaxx:  Jaxx is a multi-token blockchain wallet that provides a unified experience across 8 platforms and devices including Windows, Apple and Linux desktops, Apple and Android mobile devices and tablets, as well as a Google Chrome extension.

Driven by design and user experience and built with simplicity in mind, Jaxx’s mission is to become the interface to the blockchain world.

Called GiftChain, their new application will allow retailers and vendors of any size to easily issue gift cards and implement customer loyalty rewards programs secured by the blockchain. GiftChain will be accessible from any smartphone, making it possible for small businesses to easily track purchases and distribute rewards as would any large company. The application will support all major fiat currencies, multiple cryptocurrencies, and even arbitrary currencies designed by the issuer (e.g. a single meal at a restaurant or a voucher for a one hour massage).  This offering comes in addition to BlockMason’s first fully-functional application built atop the Credit Protocol, Friend in Debt—or, as they refer to it, “like Venmo on the Blockchain, but better!” BlockMason has already distinguished itself from other blockchain startups by offering a working product prior to their ICO. While GiftChain may not be free for public testing until after the commencement of their token offering, the announcement further demonstrates BlockMason’s commitment to product development and customer support. Additionally, the release of GiftChain proves the flexibility and viability of their Credit Protocol, which has been generating buzz for being the first SEC-compliant ICO open to the general American public after the SEC’s report on the Dao. The Credit Protocol is a simple system for recording debts and credits on the blockchain, which can be customized for a variety of organizational, business, or individual purposes through smart contracts programmed atop the protocol. In their Whitepaper, BlockMason has announced their intent to launch a bounty program for the development of template Credit Protocol smart contracts. Suggested contracts include campus meal voucher systems, consumer loans, and microfinancing.  While Giftchain is still in development, BlockMason has reportedly discussed testing an upcoming beta version with several Chinese retailers. According to BlockMason co-founder Jared Bowie, a finished GiftChain smart contract will likely be available in the next month, with a functional front-end available for public use after the ICO.

You correctly note that the Supreme Court has not yet fully ruled as to vertical vs. horizontal commonality, and that creates uncertainty as to Howey's 2nd prong (common enterprise).  However, Howey, as has been made abundantly clear since the original decision, is an AND test, not an OR test. And Blockmason's ICO clearly does not trigger the 3rd prong, the expectation of profits. Quoting from the legal opinion:  ""As to the third prong of Howey, the expectations of profitability and advantage on the part of CP token purchasers in BlockMason’s ICO is a function of the token holders’ own decisions and efforts about how to use and develop the rights they are purchasing, as summarized in detail above. Any possibility of profiting from the future entrepreneurial and managerial efforts of BlockMason – as opposed to their past and proven efforts to develop products and services – is entirely speculative. The BlockMason IPO satisfies each and every formulation of Howey’s third prong, by any of the courts identified above. Far from expectations of profits flowing solely, or predominantly, from the efforts of the promoters, those expectations flow overwhelmingly from the decisions and efforts of the token purchasers.""",False
