ALL airdrops have ended. Coins can only be purchased through the XIF Wallet app.   X Infinity, a Singapore based fintech company, is creating a unified cryptocurrency wallet that allows consumers and merchants the ability to transact as easily using any blockchain asset as a currency. X Infinity features a debit card that acts as a proxy to the wallet.   Problem  With the growing emergence of different cryptocurrency assets, a growing number of users and businesses struggle to use existing infrastructures to interconnect physical and virtual platforms. A number of issues are slowing mass adoption: 1. Increase in the number of cryptocurrencies makes it harder for merchants to accept a broad range effectively. 2. Volatility of cryptocurrency prices make it harder for merchants to adopt them. 3. No major market for some cryptocurrencies making transacting difficult. 4. No single wallet for all cryptocurrencies, so some are not easily usable.   Solution  Unified Cryptocurrency Wallet Transactions  X Infinity plans to use Cross-chain Payment Channels and the Blockchain Routing Protocol to allow users to use their blockchain assets in real-time in the real world. It leverages the power of the smartphone and blockchain to deliver a compelling, secure and scalable consumer experience.  X Infinity can aggregate a user’s blockchain assets through a single wallet. This provide customers with the ability to link their assets to a payment card (debit card – physical, or phone app - virtual). This ensures that X Infinity is the first choice wallet for users.  The phone is used as a controller. Offering complete flexibility, the app dashboard controls which bank card is active and when, rules for spending etc.   The X Infinity App is available for Android and iOS! XIF Coins can only be purchased through the XIF Wallet app  X Infinity Debit Card  The X Infinity Debit Card is a standard-issue card. It is a universally accepted payment instrument, acting as a proxy to the “X Infinity wallet” where consumers can securely store all their blockchain assets.  The consumer can set the X Infinity Debit Card to behave as any card they choose and set rules so the card can work without the phone. The experience to the user is straight-forward and simple, and provides increased utility and security.  The card holds no data as it is ‘virtual gateway’ to the X Infinity wallet. The wallet manages the accounts and identity credentials. The App controls which cryptocurrency asset is active when the X Infinity Debit Card is presented to the merchant. The consumer can set rules within the App to dictate spending limits, which cards are used for certain retailers or product types, deactivation periods and much more.   Transaction Management  Transactions are anticipated to occur in the following way: 1. User pays at the merchant using his virtual or physical XIF Card 2. The card network will send an authorization request to our servers for the purchase amount 3. XIF will send an invoice through the XIF blockchain network to the user 4. The user will then choose which blockchain asset to use for the payment and send the correct amount to XIF through the XIF blockchain network 5. Upon receiving the corresponding amount for the invoice, XIF will authorize the payment to the merchant  Wallet proprietary technology allows X Infinity to conduct more than 20,000 transactions per second, with average transaction confirmation time of 1 second and average transaction fee of USD$0.10 for every 200 transaction.   Value Proposition  Consumers Low cost to consumer Ability to lock card reduces risk of fraud Potential for real–time payment insights and offers Send and receive any amount of money, instantly anywhere in the world, at any time A frictionless experience as the X Infinity Debit Card provides standard payment functionality Cross chain payment channels ensure consumers can make payments using any cryptocurrency in their wallet Private with no customer personal information at risk with control of financial identity Unlimited blockchain accounts in a single wallet profile Control of financial identity  Merchants Instant payment ATM-level security for transactions Potential for loyalty integration and business intelligence Data insight - Preserves loyalty with a compelling, cool solution No new learned skills needed with no behaviour change needed No new POS hardware needed as card is used for transactions Low cost compared to other payment processors No merchant account needed  XIF Coin and Distribution  To facilitate content creators and consumers on the X Infinity blockchain, as well as incentivise other ecosystem stakeholders, X Infinity is planning a blockchain solution powered by the XIF Coin.
