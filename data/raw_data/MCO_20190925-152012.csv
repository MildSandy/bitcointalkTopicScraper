Visa wouldnt work with a scam company. Also they wouldn't have working cards in Singapore. They have also partnered with a bank in the US who has experience in the crypto field.

However, a bankruptcy in itself doesn't really mean anything. Vast majority of all the companies that Donald Trump ever started ended up in bankruptcy. A risk of failure (including the bankruptcy) is an inherent part of any business, it's even explicitly stated in the business legislation of any normal country. Being investigated by the Police in itself doesn't really mean anything either. Anybody can file a criminal complaint against anyone/anything, the complaint can even be entirely anonymous, and the Police is legally obliged to investigate it. So anybody can anytime be investigated for anything. If you recognize the Police then you must recognize the whole legal system in general and one of the basic legal principles is the presumption of innocence so you must recognize that, too.

On your point about MCO utility - it only has any utility if you have cards. Right now that is a handful of people in Singapore.

I mean, cards aren't out there in bulk - how did you think the community would react to hear that you're spending funds on a different project instead of what was in your original (and new) roadmap? Reminds me of the asset contract removal debacle from about a year ago.  Seriously, if you haven't delivered on your core commitment of cards, then why do you think people are sceptical that you'll deliver Crypto chain that has a 5-10 year delivery horizon by your own estimation?

Including ex Visa employees.. and they have a close relationship with Visa and with 2 leading exchanges.. binance and bithumb. No other crypto card has what mco has.  But sure.. fud on them.. because that's really helping adoption. We all need projects like mco to succeed. To bridge the gap between fiat and crypto.  Everyone do your own research.

The fact is the price will never hit its previous highs of $28ish the company is putting downward pressure on token price.  They 'diversify' to crypto.com to focus on other projects, and the value of MCO won't exceed much its current price.  At 50 MCO to get a ruby card, if the price were $20+ per token why would you pay thousands of dollars for that card? So I think the price will stay stable even if cards roll out. Also no news of anything else particularly useful the token can be used for.

No backup of claims, just empty negativity pulled out of thin air. It is so cheap, that it even triggered me to post again, what I rarely do.  First of all, Kris is not our CEO but the CEO of a promising project on the right mission, bridge the gap to mainstream.  long time until now We both know that the fiat world is very complex and slow af, looking at other projects proves it.  Since Crypto.com's core competence is compliance they will not take any shortcut like all the failed projects calling themselves ""competition"". Just google for VISA processing rules or MasterCard, you will find a huge PDF with a thousand tiny details and pitfalls, to get some idea. It simply took the time it took, which was actually fast for a continously changing regulatory environment where partners had been replaced on the go for more sustainability setups demaning also its time to be put in place (especially under consideration of best practices for AML and other regulatory matters). What counts more than ""it took 18months"" is what they built and is live as of today. Just download it from gplay/itunes and check it out, also the blue plastic card is free of any costs up to the monthly limits small fee afterwards, even comes with free shipping - show me sth comparable, I searched long and know there is nothing.  Team What you call ""team"" I call Fintech Allstars Dream-Team, best thing what the crypto space could happen for long term and mass adoption, one day you will understand. I'm sure you never digged into the team at all, eg Bobby Bao's uncle is head of the biggest investment institution in China, or when speaking about Kris, you likely missed that he already raised 3 startups from scratch to moon, in a sharded market now he plays global - be excited! This guy's only motivation as a visionair is to drive forward the mainstrean adaption of crypto (Cryptocurrency in Every Wallet / The Future of Money. Today.). One of plenty proves for that is eg the fact that all reveneues are reinvested into the product to offer one which is so much better than what any bank out there could even remotely offer (eg for EU cashback, MCO pays from own pocket since the cut they get is lower than the 2% black card crypto cashback).  ICO funds Next obvious bullshit is that they live from ICO funds - even if, why would even be relevant at all? What counts is whether they build what was promised, and they do much more. They collected money to get this card+app out, now we got the card out in the first region. Months ago a mind blowing app, live since April with cheaper BTC prices meanwhile than coinbase and also offers feeless IBAN(+soon ACH) wires. Now cards rolling out in the first market of countless to follow. They earn money with their products today, it is business not crypto charity.  We both know that they started in 2016 with their own money, they have since than acquired experts for all fields (eg security) which do not work for free, hired Metalabs to develop the great app (they developed for Facebook, Twitter and the like already), all the legal costs and licenses incl big four reviews and what else, more than +100 staff members in HK and an office in Singapore as well as in Sophioa, Bulgaria (preparing EU rollout, which is closer than you like), they bought the domain crypot.com and still have plenty of funds left. I wish other projects would be that careful with their ICO funds like these fintech guys are - each cent is well invested from what I can tell.   no progress There is a lot of progress, but it is already enough text, could write the same just about the many things they accomplished. Let me just mention that they do not use expensive ready-2-go 3rd party services like other projects, but built the whole infrastructure around the crypto parts themselves (and will offer it to other projects to expand the MCO token eco system even further than you dare to imagine today).  100k signups, KYC'd is quite some for no progress as you say btw, did I alreday mention upcoming votings for new coin listings and accompanied airdrops giving the mco token just another use case and demand driver, after the 50% discount for the invest fees have been introduced as ecomonic demand driver?  misc All the time and energy you spent on ""saving others of a bad project"" is remarkable. Nobody does that for 18months without agenda or getting paid.. if the latter, I'd cut down your salary and would ask you to do it more professional; like get at least some alt accounts to hide it. Crypto.com's app is live for a few month, cards since a few days and further expansion is happening as we talk. You had enough time to accumulate.

(even as a lifetime card)? No.  And they've already flagged that they went with this expensive 'crypto' name so they could do other projects, which probably will have nothing to do with MCO tokens.

Whatever your motivation is, mind that the internet does never forget, all your hate&negativity, bs claims, and false allegations will fall back on you I promise. One day, in a not so far future, ppl will be pointed, by guys like me who bookmarked it, to your intentionally false statements and everyone will notice your stupidity and/or hidden agendas.  You seriously call MCO a scam?! It tells a lot about you...more than you think.. MCO, the only ICO which made it to gain the level of a VISA Program Manager, acquired top-notch partners and staff from different industries, the only cards ICO which ships cards to customers today and which is a multiple above ICO usd price & stays stable like a rock above 4 usd, while the markets went down down down. At the same time you likely celebrate the Dr.med.Surfer or NAGA who sold you a worthless collectors item token... big fat ROFL in ya faces is all I have for you..  MCO changed and enriched their whole token utility design and corresponding ecosystem, all alinged to the latest regulatory changes of the past yr. Most of the accomplishments of the past yr are even not mentioned here, neither are new token use cases, or the Bithumb&Binance partnership you consider as listing only, but I will refrain from telling you (coz it is too much, and you do not care). Many new features and services are being built alongside with global cards market, while eg PAY simply dropped their only usecase completely what one would call ICO investor fraud and scam, no?  And no, I'm not here to convince you that MCO is one of the best mid/long term opportunities, as you have made up your mind already. Further, you seem not to be capable of basic maths or to DYOR, if you cannot understand the potential of the Crypto.com token, which is limited to 31m total supply with more and more of its plenty real world demand drivers are about to slowly kicking in now with roll-out of first region.  I'm not here to open your eyes, I'm here here to express my joy about reading all your bs. And actually, I'd like to ask you to keep on these false allegations and claims, spiced with low level FUD. Why? Coz it provides a frequent smile and also means more cheap tokens for us, us the ones understanding what is emerging.

You are right in what you say but having said that the truth is even if they send cards out to Singapore users in October the fact is they would be 15 months late from their initial date of delivery.  The plus side would be that at least the cards have been sent to one country and they can start planning on sending more cards out to other countries but there is a massive down side too. Failed CEO Kris Marszalek has allowed competitors to get in to a much stronger position to tackle the same core business space that Monaco intends to occupy.  On top of that failed CEO Kris Marszalek has spent millions of the ICO funds on unnecessary expenditure such as purchasing crypto.com domain, hiring new staff, releasing useless exchange apps, pathetic press releases and expenditures related to the ""development and testing of the cards"" including travelling around with all expenses paid trips from the ICO funds going all over the Far East to make test purchases with the test VISA cards therefore the funds to fight back against competitors is already diminished because of mismanagement.  Add to that they the ICO was oversubscribed, they received 71,000+ ETH which was around $26 million at the time. Thne failed CEO Kris Marszalek decided to change the rules and diverted from the whitepaper. It clearly stated 3,333,333 tokens were to be created and that the founders were keeping 833,333 for themselves but they created 31,587,682 MCO instead and NEVER explained to anybody how they were going to be split.  The pathetic user that I have on IGNORE, I only read his post because it shows in your reply. He claimed there are live Q&As with the team but he is writing nonsense. Those questions are sent to the Reddit team in advance and get picked out, censored and filtered then are put forward to the ""team"" that give out a video response.  Their failed CEO Kris Marszalek and his ""team"" have all become multi-millionaires overnight thank to the ICO without declaring how much they own and without explaining why no financially linked bonus milestones were added in to the whitepaper so if they failed to achieve a milestone such as releasing the cards in a  particular country by a particular date then they would forfeit a percentage of their Founder MCO tokens.  Users such as the pathetic one you replied to attacks users for posting here but cannot ask failed CEO Kris Marszalek about his failures and delays? He claims Reddit and Discord are active and stated that MCO users are not really active here yet he continues to post here? Easy to understand why I had to have that fool on IGNORE. He is a ""newbie"" using multiple accounts.  ============ ORIGINAL WHITEPAPER 2017 8.3. Example ‚Äì total MCO issued and MCO in circulation During the Token Creation Event, we imagine that exactly 1,000,000 MCO are created in response to incoming payments.  After the Token Creation event ends, the following additional MCO are created:  ‚Ä¢ 1,000,000 MCO for the Reserve ‚Ä¢ 833,333 MCO for the Founders ‚Ä¢ 333,333 MCO for the Talent Pool (future hires) ‚Ä¢ 166,667 MCO for the Advisors  In total, 3,333,333 MCO are created of which 1,000,000 MCO are transferable upon the completion of the Token Creation Event.  If at some point, $3.33 million worth of tokens are held in the Token Asset Contract, and no MCO have been burned. Each MCO would receive $1 worth of tokens if burned. ============  You are right, it still unclear if there will be cards sent out to users in Singapore or elsewhere. Maybe those continuing to believe in this so far unsuccessful project might look silly if there will never be any cards, it is 15 months delayed at the moment.",True

I'm heavily invested. Not as much as others. But would recommend it.  Think tenx but instead of just a card crypto will have banking facilities attached  We already have a app. Trialing invest feature. Cards are set to be released in Singapore before a global rollout.  And if you want to listen to other fudders here and think kris is a scam then look at the evidence. Look at the rest of the team.  Search it up.. they have a partnership with Visa. They have banking bin numbers. There is so much overwhelming evidence to prove this isnt a scam.  And let's not forget.. timelines always get pushed out in business. It's not easy to please everyone and there will always be problems that will arise.  But..  Kris has stuck to his word. He has delivered on his promises so far.. he has released an app. He has shown a partnership with Visa followed by proof of working cards.  Also ensogo collapsing wasnt kris's fault. He came in as the company was failing and he couldnt turn it around. Its already been investigated and proven that it wasnt a scam. Kris has been cleared of any wrong doing.. however some people here would like you to think differently.. ugh  Do your own research. Make your own decisions.

I say things how I see them. A simple search online will verify these facts:  - The current CEO of Monaco is Kris Marszalek, he was CEO of Ensogo. That company lost a lot of money and was investigated for fraud.  - The original whitepaper stated the ""founders"" were to keep 833,333 MCO tokens for themselves from the 3,333,333 that were to be created. In the end the ICO was super successful and they created 31 million tokens but never announced how many the ""founders"" were keeping. The MCO team are all multi-millionaires thanks to the ICO  - The original whitepaper stated the project was for a VISA crypto card but now these fools have an app for trading and spent millions of the ICO funds on buying the crypto.com domain  - Check the thread. The first time they promised the VISA crypto cards would be sent out was in August 2017. On their Telegram/Discord they keep saying ""soon"", ""next month"" and so on.",True

Kris was put in charge of failing company ensogo. He was unable to turn the company around and he left before they closed their doors officially.

We have a working app. And they have working cards which they are rolling out to Singapore first.  I dont know why you and 2 other accounts on here want to consistently bag on him and try spread fud.

I would say that about 5% of major ICO's are actually capable of doing this and are able to put themselves in the shoes of Mom and Dad investors and understand that while two thousand bucks is peanuts to them, to an average working investors what you do with that $2k is very important.   MCO need to present a SWAT analysis to let investors know where everything stands as of now and into the near and long term future if they are not capable of doing that, they are just another fucking TenX but dressed differently.

They have an app that you can buy cryptocurrencys (BTC,ETH,BNB,MCO,USDM with more to come) and even trade in and after the beta of the app the prices are probably gonna be one of the best in the market (high fees on card buys now and a spread that they say is becoming better) , SEPA transfers is coming for EU from day one of cards and probably coming similar for others after/before?

Their first card will likely involve 'loading' money onto it, kind of like a travel money card, and you'd be able to do this by converting some of your crypto to regular cash on the app/card, then spending this money and get some cashback of 1 to 2% in mco tokens (if you have a premium level card).  So based on that, I wouldn't see any need to use Tether, since you'll be able to covert from cash to crypto through the app/card pretty easily, and you would actually prefer cash to Tether since that would be more 'ready to spend' through the card.",True

From memory, the reason provided was that visa currently doesn't allow the instant sale of crypto through their system - it needs to already be in fiat when you swipe your card.

We will activate the automatic conversion  as an option for Monaco customers the moment Visa rules allow it. In the meantime, we have addressed this user experience issue in two ways: 1) the conversion UI within our app is sleekly designed, it super easy to use and takes seconds to complete a conversion 2) users who do not want to perform manual conversions, can set automatic top-up within the app: ‚ÄúIf my fiat account balance drops below X, automatically topup Y amount‚Äù.

Also a later product alluded to by Monaco is a more traditional credit card, where you get a credit line based on the value of crypto you hold, and you can pay that back as you would a normal credit card.  It is also possible this credit card could instead reduce your crypto value by the equivalent of your purchase on your account/app - I recall they mentioned (I think in a Q and A) that under this system it won't actually convert crypto to fiat at the payment terminal every time you swipe your card. Instead, it will be 'off chain' and only be recorded on Monaco systems, and only be put 'on-chain' when you want to withdraw your money from your Monaco account/app. Part of the reason for this is converting crypto to fiat everytime you want to buy a coffee would lead to substantial fees (think of the bitcoin fees for example).  I'm pretty sure large exchanges do something similar, so you don't get charged huge fees every time you trade some random altcoin for bitcoin as long as the coins stay on the exchange. You only get slugged the large fees when you withdraw your crypto to your personal wallet as this is where the crypto definitely has to be put back 'on-chain' to your personal address.",True

If you choose to use crypto you can pick between different coins. Now whenever you swipe your card one should assume that the price at the time of swiping will be the basis for the deduction of your tokens if you chose not to use fiat.  However, there was talk about a credit feature, in which you would be able to buy something and then if the value of your tokens went up by a lot, you'd end up paying less tokens at a later time. So you could technically hedge with multiple tokens to decrease your spending of tokens. Of course this will carry some risk, since your prediction could be off and then you could end up paying more tokens than you would've otherwise.  Keep in mind that this is just speculation.

Let's say you spent 100 grand in the first year and MCO was at only $100 by the end of that period. You'd have gotten over 15 MCO instead of just 10 in cashback. If MCO establishes itself and really ends up as a major global player, the token price could rise to as high as $5000, which would result in a difference of over $25000 in cashback.  It'd take years to grow this high, but if you're spending a lot of money anyways this would be a good way to increase your position substantially without changing anything other than the card that you use.

It would leave a really bad impression on users if they went to an exchange, purchased 50 MCO to get a Ruby Card, sent it to a special MCO wallet, and then get told that they have 49.9 MCO, so can't do lock up or get their card.  Given the nature of their close 'strategic parternship' with Binance, I wouldn't be surprised if they are working on a direct lock up through Binance to avoid transaction fees while also allowing Binance a one up on its competitors.  Binance already provides extra functionality for specific coins - for example providing GAS for all the NEO you hold on the exchange. No one else does that to my knowledge.

I hope this means cards in hands ready to use and spend!  Hopefully any increase in advertising is because they are close to hitting the go button on sending out cards and eventually working through the long queue of people who have reserved cards (and token lock up). Ideally you'd want the systems all set up so that people have their cards and there is no queue at all - just like you would expect with a larger credit card company (although this could take a while).,True

The Benefit is you have a great product you invested in, you got in cheap even if you don't compare to today's price in comparison to forecast prices. Some folks just don't get it.  Crypto is a long ways away from any type of bubble if you consider valuations, marketcaps etc in comparison to dot-com bubble prices. But when that happens you don't want to be holding companies like dogecoin. You want companies like Monaco in your portfolio. It's just common sense.

If the cost out weights the reward? I honestly don't opt to pay for Travel Insurance but either way its going to cost you one way or another whether through profits or the card costs?

I like the 1%-2% cashback, the metal sleekness of an elite card (status symbol), airport luxury lounge the ability to transfer my crypto to fiat and any other crypto on the fly. The ability to pay in Visa and it automatically takes payment from my crypto account without me having to worry about it.  Sorry but I reviewed all the cards and this one is the one i'm loving travel insurance or not. Not only that but as a token owner i also get the benefits of the program built in.

Basically in Countries such as the U.S. with the security exchange and regulation requirements -- to delist off exchanges if kept as an Asset contract.  As well as the very good reasons why you would want to have the Monaco Premium card and lock up X number of tokens for the period. With no Marketing what so ever at the time of this video they had around 20k signups for the MCO cards. He also promises that the value will still go back into the company and the token holders. He has no reason to lie other than if he wants to destroy the company and his reputation. The market potential for this model is huge and is easily capable of taking the dominate place in the market.  The revenue generation along with the perks make this a very sustainable model with no fees for loyal customers. It's like being a member of a club. Really there is no risk. Lock up 50 tokens for the Ruby card or 500 for the Platinum card and you are a member of the club. For those that want to try the service for free without any lockup they have the basic plastic cards.  At this time they have nearly 50k signups with no marketing for the card. This is quite an achievement and to me it says once a product is released and marketed. Those numbers will easily reach millions. Crypto on the fly, free cash withdrawls, cashback and purchases. Revenue generating program that just makes sense. 4 types of cards so one for everyone based on scale. No 10-20$ purchase and usable anywhere the Visa logo is available.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtymAK1pjss",True

While I don't disagree with this philosophy. You also have to do due diligence research and trust in your instinct. If Monaco was really out to scam you -- this is a pretty elaborate scam you have to admit. Have a whole development team. A state of the art app that does facial recognition, ID recognition, Detailed/Designs and a well polished Business plan. Obviously the numbers have to make sense for everything to fall into play. But the type of company Monaco is turning out to be is a Multi-Million dollar company.  People are concerned about Monaco token use. Well they've already employed a burn plan for the tokens as well as a reimbursement of value for the tokens. As the business model roles out and exchange features for FIAT, Crypto and Visa Network is applied to the Card. You will see expansive growth. This is not a Million Dollar chop shop. This is easily the start of a Multi-Billion Dollar Corporation and you get getting the opportunity to get in on the ground floor.  So join slack on the 9th if you have concerns and ask some questions. Also give input for some great ideas. Remember this is a business and you in part receive benefits for being an owner of tokens but also a customer that uses the card.  So think of ways that can help make this car/app something you would want to eat, sleep and feel as a customer. But also as a business makes financial sense and brings fiduciary responsibilities to its investors.  I see a lot of people crying and whining with little to no business sense and this is exactly why a lot of Companies choose to go with VC's instead of smaller group of investors.    ",True

They shouldn't ever do so as they promised it was meant for new exchanges' liquidation purpose. If you noticed, they will cleverly draw out everytime they make announcement abt the new exchanges.

Regardless, you are wrong to think it is just a made up laugh for kids. You would see that if you did ANY research that the Monaco Government has been trying for years to trademark its name, taking the matter to the EU courts, and companies like 'Monaco Card' would fall under those legal issues IF the Monaco Government was successful. Fortunately for Monaco Card company, the Monaco Government has been unsuccessful to date.  To say it is just FUD or some kindergarten stuff is a bit silly. It is an issue Monaco Card the company has actually responded to in Q&A sessions, and is a well known trademark issue the Monaco Government has been pushing for years.  Also if you look back at my post - I was responding to a question about whether Monaco the country has anything to do with Monaco Card. Nothing to do with randomly starting FUD, just sharing research.  Personally, I don't think Monaco Card the company will have any issues, since there are so many other companies that would be in the same position if the Monaco Government was successful in trademarking 'Monaco'.  Have a read if you'd like to learn about it:  Here for example on Monaco Government court proceedings: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/monaco-government-fails-in-attempt-to-trademark-its-own-name-at-eus-general-court-9981181.html  And it the issue was raised in Slack and responded to by Monaco Card, you can read some of it through reddit in the comments field here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MonacoCard/comments/7idvfk/taking_questions_for_next_qa_on_tuesday_1212_10pm/",True

This can only happen when they implement a real working product globally. Until now, there is not yet a working product.

I assume you're referring to them removing the asset contract? A removal that has resulted in a 50% gain in the token price as they list on 4 new exchanges, whilst one of their competitors (TKN) get delisted at a loss of 50% of their token value? Hmmm, some would argue its forward thinking....  Furthermore, look into the new business model and think about its potential. Lock-up of tokens will reduce the supply at the same time that the token demand is increasing to reserve cards. This will drive the price. People will then report how much money they made whilst holding MCO during the lock-up period. This in turn will drive demand...  This isn't even accounting for the replacement asset contract and further token utility that they are looking into.

I thought that was still quite cheap and a pretty good deal.  I mean an American express card you pay around 100 to 150 per year for. A visa is between 75 to 180 depending on which card you get.  The Monaco card outdoes these cards in terms of features. But the biggest catch is.. you lock the tokens up for 6 months. Then you get them back.  With a normal visa or American express card you pay an annual fee every year. And don't get that money back.  Besides I'm sure it'll get more expensive. And it should.

Monaco is still suffering from the September FUD, but the project is evolving very well and all this FUD is fading away.  What I like about Monaco is that it takes crypto to another level. The team wants to make a world class product, not only a good crypto product, and that's what's going to make them succeed. This is reflected in the way they choose their partners (Gemalto, Wirecard, MetaLab etc.), and the cards and packaging designs are a first sign of their professionalism.  Concerning the token price, I am very confident about the token lock-up mechanism. With the actual circulating supply, only 20k space grey cards can be reserved in a 6 months timespan. It may seem a lot, but it's only 4% of the 500k cards order announced a few weeks ago, without counting the other Platinum cards. This should reduce the supply significantly.  I am also waiting for another token mechanism that would incentivize the use of MCO tokens. If MCO can be spent and bought via the app with better advantages than other currencies, then Monaco users will also be hodlers, which would have a good effect on the price.  In the short run, new exchanges and good news will drive MCO price up.  I am obviously a large MCO hodler since August, and will keep it long term. I am also a future user of the card, so I have two reasons to want this project succeed  ",True

I just came on to say how excited I am for the coming months with Monaco. We've had a tough period with delays, but everyone now gets the sense that something big is around the corner - the future is looking very very bright! In terms of the actual product I am more than confident that Monaco is going to be in a different league to the current competition in the crypto-space:  - They will have better exchange rates - Significantly higher cashback on the platinum cards - A premium metal card (also free remember - its only a loan of Tokens) - An on app exchange at perfect interbank exchange rates - A quick and easy way to buy into BTC for newcomers to crypto (perfectly timed as BTC becomes more mainstream) - More features to come (expecting airport lounges etc)  With such a desirable product (the cards and packaging are simply beautiful) the demand for the platinum metal cards will drive the token price alone. This will be THE card to have if you're in the crypto-space.  Reduced supply & increased demand = exponential growth  Afterall, remember that there are only 9million MCO in circulation! Based on current numbers of reservations (now at 27,000), the CEO mentioned that over 1.5million of these tokens are due to be locked-up. Upon Europe rollout and mass marketing kicking in, the supply of Monaco is going to be drastically reduced! It is for this reason that I am 100% sure dynamic pricing for the cards will be implemented by the Monaco team in order to account for a rising Monaco price. It is something that the community have passionately requested and it clearly seems to have been listened to based on the recent Q&A's.  There have been plenty of other suggestions for a replacement asset contract too and we all eagerly await what direction Monaco will take in this regard. I was however, very happy to hear the CEO mention that the community will be consulted on this. There are other idea's put on the table that could bring real utility to the token too and the CEO has been keen to look into them. For example, we know that they like the idea of a 'reward upgrade scheme' on the blue cards whereby these cards receive MCO cashback too, but it is only redeemed when upgrading to a platinum card. Why would this be good for MCO holders? Well, it would provide an incentive to people holding the blue card to upgrade and lock up the required tokens for the ruby card. However, it would also lock-up additional tokens on a longer term basis for those that continue to hold the blue card. Other increased utility idea's have included cheaper prices or greater MCO cashback when spending MCO. Increased utility of the token like this will only serve to drive the demand for it. Lets see what directions they decide to take!  So, when can we expect positive price movement? Its difficult to predict given that Monaco are now implementing a 'no comment on dates' approach. However, in my opinion there are a few key drivers that will seriously drive the price in the near term (Dec/Jan expected for many):  - A product feature...who know's what this may be? I'm personally hoping for airport lounges! - Listing on at least 3 new exchanges (The announcement that this is happening was in the last Q&A) - Making of Monaco video - building excitement to see the card and app in action hopefully... - Green Light for Europe Rollout - This will be HUGE news as it is where most of Monaco's reservations are - Green Light for Japan Rollout - This will be a HUGE market when word gets out! Some publications have already started the attention. - Card Beta Test - HUGE news as it will be the first batch of people reviewing the card, sharing on social media etc. - Influencer marketing. We now know that Monaco will be shipping cards to the crypto review guys for review. This will put Monaco in the spotlight in the crypto community and hopefully beyond. The CEO also mentioned Marketing Airdrops? - Card Rollout and Token Lock-up!!! This is the biggie. Why? With tokens starting to get locked up, the price will see consistent highs. People will be buying and locking up. Sell pressure will be dramatically reduced.  Longer term, there is plenty more to look forward to: - Firstly there's the TWO big announcements that Monaco has up their sleeve. Kris stated that these were bigger than the Visa Program Manager approval which is a pretty big deal. This is something he has been very excited about from the start and has mentioned several times in interviews. - Credit Card status. Again, something that has been mentioned on the roadmap for next year - Banking partnership in the USA for US rollout...coming next year - Further global rollout  Monaco really do have a great vision for this project and slowly but surely we're starting to see that come to life... These are very exciting times to be a MCO holder - scoop them up whilst you can!",True

You're obviously not in there much as I post in there all the time.  Regarding the replacement asset contract, its coming guys! Monaco completely miscalculated how much this meant to the community (not me personally as I don't think its required under the current business model), but they have recognised that and are working to release something that will be compliant. Afterall, they are ahead of the game on this front as they don't want the token to be considered a security and get it delisted from exchanges.  Remember compliance is at Monaco's core. They have drilled that into us from the start and is why they believe they will be the first to achieve a highly competitive GLOBAL product. It is how they are the first and only product with Visa Program Manager status and why they can offer much better perks to the card.  If it is the asset contract you are waiting on though, just wait a replacement is coming and the community will be informed when they have a suitable compliant replacement that wont be considered a security.",True

However, the impression one gets from reading this thread is not really close to reality, so I'll put a bit more light on it.  Look into Telegram (https://t.me/MonacoCard), there is a lot of info, latest news are shared (during slack Q/A-sessions even close to real time) and you can have very good and enlightning discussions there. I like it more than this place I have abandoned for a long time.  A few bullet points *Many think Monaco started this year, no completely wrong. *Many consider it a crypto startup, but actually it is a fintech startup entering crypto space, quite a difference. *Barely nobody understands what ""perfekt interbank exchange rate"" means which Monaco is listing as a core feature. Well, it is nothing any other bank or card company is willing to offer you, that's why you never heard of it. See https://fx-rate.net/facts/ and you may understand why and what it means. *the cards will not ship anytime soon, ok then tell me all theses boxes (100k cards of 500k ordered in a first batch) are delivered to Monaco to catch dust, only ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28cwsKAN3lc *Moncao does not target the few crypto users out there, they target the masses.  -""Founded in 2016, Monaco aims to put cryptocurrency in everyone's wallet.""  -https://twitter.com/internetgene/status/918401849018826752   Keep in mind there are a few guys here who spread negativity, fud and lies on purpose - it's all about the/your money. Either they do so because they want to keep accumulating cheap, or are paid by other projects that are scared to death behind the curtains by Monaco, or fall into the last category of dumped down humans believing and repeating fakenews and lies without any sceptical thought or own research. Sounds hard, but you'll notice when looking closely and doing your research it is exactly like this.  i.e. this smart guy krypto.hr was so sure it is all just a scam, no VISA approval ever - a simple google search may have revealed valueable info about Foris (company behind Monaco) and its connection to VISA that was in place since day one: https://twitter.com/superchargerft/status/795561158866440192  Or the other user called jasaga who doesn't understand that being listed on the VISA page just means you have a visa logo on your card. He obviously was mislead to think VISA propgram manager status is sth everybody can accomplish in a short time. No, it is nothing most will ever accomplish, especially when being involved in any previous scams (*caught* Lyoness *caught*). VISA would not enter a direct parntnership with any proven scammer, never ever.   Maybe I'm better off when you all think ""MCO is nothing special"", ""will not be a game changer"", ""has a lot of competition"", and so on... However, since my bags are heavy meanwhile, I'm willing to share more of my gathered infos with you here.   Some of you might remind me from 2013, when I shared a lot of infos about my research on KnC Miner back then https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=304567.0  To be clear, I have no reason to shill or fud any coin/asset/token/..., I never did so and there is no need for me to do so ever. I own enough BTCs from my mining ventures to have a nice life. I just consider Monaco one of the best projects I ever had the chance to put my money in.

Also under Monaco's faq - under the heading 'are black cards still available', they say they have a very limited quantity still available ('limited quantity' is nice and ambiguous, are we talking 10 cards or 200?)  My guess is that once cards are actually rolling out in Asia and Europe more broadly, the remaining will be snapped up.  This could depend on what else you get with locking up 50,000 MCO for the Black card, compared to the cheaper 500 MCO Metal (even if it is only a six month lock up and you get them back). However since there is a limit of 999, I don't think Monaco will (or should) focus on increasing value for the 50,000 Black card, and should focus on the value proposition between the 50 MCO Ruby, and the 500 MCO Metal (which is part of what I go through in the blog).",True

It's simply an objective analysis of what has happened so far. Quote All of the above has much bigger impact that the Asset Contract.

Having said that, we understand this is an important matter for the community and are looking into rolling out a replacement that will be fully compliant and not carry any legal risks that would potentially negatively impact token holders. As you're apparently a community/PR type of manager, I doubt you're grasping the impact of the asset contract since even Kris himself claims this to be the case.  But it's patently false that the asset contract would have less of an impact for investors returns. And the fact that MonaCo still claims that the asset contract, which was meant to directly share the potential billions of annual revenue with investors makes this whole endeavour seem either extremely immature or outright dishonest. Only someone who doesn't understand the value of the asset contract or someone who straight up benefits from the removal of it would taint it as impactless or even worthless as Kris put it.  I am actually shocked that MonaCo still hasn't rectified its stance on this matter and keeps going with the ridiculous ""worthless"" narrative.   I do agree that the dump was in part due to technical trading, and I don't see why MCO should care since the company will make more profits by removing the asset contract simply because MCO already has its ICO money and doesn't need to concern itself with the token price as long as people start using the cards.  And traders would trade anything regardless of fundamentals as long as it makes them money, they care about nothing else after all.  So sure, from MCO's perspective the asset contract is worthless, MCO will make more money without it since it won't have to share any of its profits. But from any investor's perspective that actually knows what he's doing it's the last nail in the coffin. Refer to my conservative calculations based on current card orders in a previous post for details. In the mid to long term the asset contract was the value of the token.",True

And serious dump happening right after that had triggered the response of the team, and perhaps they are working on something that might reward us as much as asset contract, and if price of their tokens is their only concern, then, they would have re-announced the asset contract implementation on the very next day to fix the massive dump but they nvr go for that option.

My personal experience is my yardstick in this assumption: I have gone through hundreds of shops in mall and none accepted cryptocurrency payment. You have a few businesses like Delta Airline, Virgin Airlines and a few others i've heard of encouraging people to pay with cryptocurrency.   But with the MONACO's Visa card platform card i personally think the revolution within our reach. this would encourage wider adoption and acceptability amongst payer and payee.  I know with more sensitization a lot of people would adopt it. Also in addition, if i may mention this: that most persons dealing with cryptocurrencies do not actually use them in any commercial transaction but are storing them. This is the mindset the Card projects should tilt, actually having people swiping their cards in malls would show a great sign of mainstream adoption and then you'd see the value of cryptocurrency surge.

Saying they did it to avoid de-listing from exchanges, is the magic excuse for them to decouple the token away from the company entirely.  Simple examples of random scenarios:  Monaco gets a 1 billion dollar investment from whoever -> Monaco token is not tied to the company in any legal way shape or form, so it wont benefit from anything like that.  Monaco sells more cards than they have ""available tokens"" -> Monaco token is not tied to the issuing of credit or debit or gift cards in any practical way. No company needs a ""token"" to be ""held"" to issue a card. Monaco can issue an infinite number of cards at will, without using the Monaco token in any way. There's no laws, nor are there any binding contracts (hello!) that says they must use Monaco tokens for anything going forward.  The actual ""token"" has no practical use, only an artificially made up one -> It is not a ""system"" that does anything. The BIN from VISA is important, and is an actual ""system"" without which Monaco would not be able to function as a card issuer. The ""token"" system from Monaco is literally a useless guise to raise money without selling company shares. Its essentially like going on ""Dragon's Den / Shark Tank"" tv show and saying ""I need 25 million dollars from you guys, and instead of company shares, i will give you these keychains that i may, or may not,  buy back (depending on demand), once people start buying my product""  The ""token"" is not a company share - Success for Monaco is great for company owners. Token holders are not company owners, and rely on the company, without any sort of regulation or binding contract, to somehow make them ""rich"" out of the goodness of their hearts and keep their promise (track record in regards to that is not very good at the moment)    Most investors are well aware of an attempted work around, but falling short of a legally binding contract that would expose them to government regulation (which it wont be, no matter what they come up with, because they're not stupid) the token is based on a faux system that has absolutely no use in the real world. (what other crypto cards require to artificially ""hold"" tokens to get a card? When's the last time you heard VISA ask you for $500 to ""hold"" for 6 months to give you a card?)  For even more fun, you need to realize that only specific current metal cards, not their basic (or future) Monaco cards, require holds on tokens, and the majority of people will have the cheapest one, requiring 50 tokens. Add to that the hold cycle of the tokens, add to it the total number of tokens including those not in circulation, and you'll see that unless they have an absolute constant number of hundreds of thousands of people signing up every few months, they'll never even get close to hitting the token cap, in order for you to have a high scarcity of said token.     People waiting for this to ""moon"" are delusional. Even current pricing of $6 USD is ridiculous for what it offers in return and how de-coupled from company success, it is, at the moment.  If Monaco comes out tomorrow and says they'll buy out the tokens at the IPO price, or not at all, while also having their un-needed ecosystem go dead, there's no legal recourse for you.  Also, if Monaco ever goes public with a legit IPO in the future, they'll completely have to get rid of any possibility (even perception of such a thing is damaging) of being legally exposed in any way, to a class of ""non-investors"", which means the death of the token.  Monaco is only good for day traders to sell on news, or for card holders, who legit want a metal card. If you're one of those ""to the moon"" people, you'll have a better chance buying a lottery ticket, as the token itself is not tied to company growth or success over the long term, and it also lives in an unnecessary ecosystem that only hinders Monaco as a company, going forward, growing from its infancy stage.  On a final note, I dont believe any of the changes were done maliciously, but, given the timing, delays, magnitude, and delivery of the news, it makes me believe that, either the people in charge dont know what they're doing and learning as they go along, or that they're very smart and pulled the proverbial rug from under non-ico holders, before they were legally tied into the token and under government regulation as a result.",True

I bet a lot of you commenting were the same people doubting that Monaco has Visa in the first place. I don't mean anyone in specific, just in general. So far they have kept their word all the way every time. Don't forget that removing the asset contract was a strategic move to not be delisted in the future.  Monaco takes no short cuts and focus on compliance. If you remember that's another reason why they didn't go via China for their ICO even though they could have raised a lot more money taking that short cut. Good move in hindsight. Same as asset contract.  Monaco could also have done a TenX move and gone via a third party like Wavecrest and take short cuts in terms of territory. But they chose not to. You can see the consequences TenX had to suffer for opting for the faster route making them much slower in the end. Do you see a pattern?  edit: typo",True

If they can create a scenario in which they can profit while keeping their name clean, they will most likely go that route. And if it came to public attention that MonaCo baited and switched investors with the asset contract, Visa would simply play oblivious to the fact and get off scot-free.   By the way, with 20000 cards and an average of $1000 transaction volume per year, that would make the dividend of a single token $0.7 per year.  And that's only the amount of cards that was ordered since the ICO. At the same rate there should be more than 100k cards at the end of next year, so each token would give a yearly dividend of more than $3.5 per year. Imagine you bought 10k tokens at $2 for $20,000, then you would be getting $35,000 for your investment every year from 2019.  And this number would grow very quickly as the amounts of cards increase. If cards kept getting ordered at the same rate, in 2020 the same investment would return $70,000 in dividends, and in 2025 the dividend would be $245,000. In 2030 this would be more than $500,000 per year. So in total we'd get a return of at least $2,730,000 at the end of 2030 out of a $20,000 investment with at least $500,000 of extra income per year from that point onward.  And in reality the amount of cards should be going up much faster because of active marketing, which so far MonaCo didn't really do.",True

This year, cryptocurrency debit cards have become quite popular. Such cards are issued by third party companies that store users‚Äô Bitcoins or other currencies. When the consumer goes to make a purchase with the card, the issuing company sells a certain amount of the consumer‚Äôs holdings to pay for the charge.  When one such company began issuing cryptocurrency-backed cards recently, they were shocked at receiving 17,000 reservations in a short period, without any advertising at all.  While the digital currency sector has been surging for the past year, there has been some difficulty in the crossover to mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Much of the lag is caused by difficulties in actually being able to use digital currencies to make purchases.  Now, the globally recognised credit card network, Visa, has stepped in to serve a role in the digital economy. They will begin with Singapore. The tiny nation of Singapore has been a forward thinking and receptive country when it comes to cryptocurrency acceptance and adoption, so this seems like a logical step.  While most ordinary people are still wary of digital currencies, when a respected company like Visa gives its imprimatur, some of that wariness fades. Being able to spend digital currency with a Visa-backed card allows consumers to spend their cryptocurrency at more than 44 million locations worldwide.  Visa has had a few forays into the cryptocurrency sector, having already approved several different cryptocurrency-based card issuers. There is a lot of work that still needs to be done before digital currency truly goes mainstream, but the fact that major companies are dealing with the new technology bodes well for long-term adoption.",True

Kris claimed that the asset contract is ""mathematically pointless"" and people kept parroting that. But that's complete and utter bullshit.  There will be hundreds of millions in revenue in the coming few years, and easily multiple billions of revenue around the second half of 2020-2030.  Take just 1 Billion for example, that means +$33.33 of revenue per 1 MCO per year. That means that your 10k tokens would generate you $333,300 USD per year at 1 billion from around 2025 onward.  Keep in mind that all Visa cards combined have a yearly purchase volume of over 5 trillion per year.  So it's not too far fetched to assume that a strong crypto card could see an annual revenue of multiple billions per year, which at ""just"" 5 billion would imply a yearly income of 1.667 Million USD for your 10000 MCO tokens. And that's not even considering the token value itself, that is literally just the dividend.   This is what every serious investor knew about and invested for. And it's obviously that ""mathematically pointless"" is complete horseshit, it's either a blatant lie by Kris, or an indicator that he's not capable of basic Mathematics.   Even with far weaker performance you would have 50k to 200k per year from your tokens in the early 2020s based on MCO's prognosis. If you, or anyone, really believes that to be worthless I don't know how to help them. They're a lost cause.    Yes. The card is beautiful, yes it's nice to have. But no, the asset contract is not worthless and only someone with absolutely no understanding of the real world would truly believe that. Anyone who claims otherwise either has no idea what they are talking about or is blatantly lying to raise the short term token price.",True

Last week Monaco and VISA announced their latest product, a cryptocurrency pre-paid debit card which will be made available for Singapore-based users. Monaco is a Switzerland-based card issuer, and VISA currently boasts being the world‚Äôs biggest payment network. The physical card will be used by Wirecard AG.  The physical cards are already available to Singapore-based users to register via the card‚Äôs app which is available to download for both iOS and Android. To register, a user is required to enter their email and phone number and verify these contact details, before they can be placed in line to receive their card.  The pre-paid cryptocurrency debit cards do not come attached with any service fees or minimum spend requirements. However, there are four different tiers linked to the card, and a user is placed in a tier according to their Monaco token stakes for a period of six months.  The highest tier in the four-tier system is the Obsidian Black tier. The card is noted for its rarity, as only 999 of these cards will be in circulation at any given time. The Obsidian Black card will provide its user with unlimited interbank exchange rates as well as free ATM withdrawal up to a limit of $1000. After the limit is reached, each withdrawal will come at a 2% charge. In addition, the card features a 2% cash back benefit.  To qualify for this tier, the user has stake a minimum of 50,000 Monaco Tokens for a period of six months. Currently, a single Monaco Token is valued at $6. This means that the user would have to stake Monaco tokens with a total value of $300,000.  The starting tier is the Midnight Blue tier which requires no Monaco Tokens stake and comes free of charge. A Midnight Blue user will be allowed a limited interbank exchange rate per month with the value of up to $2000. After the limit has been reached, each transaction will be subject to a surcharge of 0.5%. In addition, users can enjoy free ATM withdrawals up to the limit of $200.  Others tiers include the Ruby Steel and Precious Metal tiers. These require a stake of between 50 Monaco Tokens and 500 Monaco Tokens over a six month period. This equates to $300 and $3000 respectively.",True

It's very easy to make money without supporting shady schemes.

Quote from: Jeantheboy on November 07, 2017, 08:47:35 AM ""It would become impossible for most people to pick up cards."" What does this mean? Please explain. Otherwise any argument is pointless. Why would most people should be unable to have their cards? Would the company impede the acquisition of the cards because the company is unable to comply with delivering the cards? Why would there be no reason to hold the tokens after the lock-in period? The statements you made are not trivial. You need to elaborate. How can you know what is going to happen? How can you know about the progress of the company and the services provided by it?  ""The only way to work around that is to change the amount of tokens required to reserve cards, which would have a direct influence on the token price and thus be market manipulation which is illegal."" What you are saying is that if the amount of tokens required to reserve cards is modified, then this is market manipulation. Your argument is useless because you are proposing an absurd solution to a problem that you still need to address, which is the worthlessness of the token. Why are you even employing market manipulation and alleged illegality as arguments? Stay on task, and tell us why the MCO token must be worthless.  People jumped the ship because they didn't like the change made by Monaco regarding the asset contract. Jumping is legitimate. But the elimination of the asset contract cannot possibly mean that the token will have no value. How can you make such deduction? No asset contract means no future token value. Why? Not sure what your problem is, I've already explained the issue in detail. If the token price goes up it will cost too much to get a card (even if you get it back in 6 months) and most people are not interested in such modalities. The only counteraction to this problem poses a significant risk of market manipulation, which could have very serious legal implications.  Because see above. Locking up tokens doesn't create value without creating problems that will inevitably create market manipulation scenarios which are illegal.",True

Perhaps even in the medium term.  In the long run there'll be serious problems if the asset contract and the token locking mechanism aren't properly addressed due to a lack of inherent value of the tokens and potentially illegal market manipulation by changing the required amount of tokens for card reservation (which will directly impact the token price).

What does this mean? Please explain. Otherwise any argument is pointless. Why would most people should be unable to have their cards? Would the company impede the acquisition of the cards because the company is unable to comply with delivering the cards? Why would there be no reason to hold the tokens after the lock-in period? The statements you made are not trivial. You need to elaborate. How can you know what is going to happen? How can you know about the progress of the company and the services provided by it?  ""The only way to work around that is to change the amount of tokens required to reserve cards, which would have a direct influence on the token price and thus be market manipulation which is illegal."" What you are saying is that if the amount of tokens required to reserve cards is modified, then this is market manipulation. Your argument is useless because you are proposing an absurd solution to a problem that you still need to address, which is the worthlessness of the token. Why are you even employing market manipulation and alleged illegality as arguments? Stay on task, and tell us why the MCO token must be worthless.  People jumped the ship because they didn't like the change made by Monaco regarding the asset contract. Jumping is legitimate. But the elimination of the asset contract cannot possibly mean that the token will have no value. How can you make such deduction? No asset contract means no future token value. Why?",True

We already received a lot of very valuable feedback and will continue to seek it actively.  Question 2 - which quarter is eu rollout?  EU rollout is a priority ‚Äì we will provide an update on extension of our issuing partnership in November.   Question 3 - when can people start locking up MCO tokens in exchange for cards?  We want to enable MCO lockup the moment when your card is ready to ship.  Question 4 - At what price do you think you will need to adjust the amount of MCO required for the Platinum Cards?  We‚Äôll make these decisions based on funnel conversion numbers: from app download to KYC completed to Platinum card shipped. We already have a big chunk of this funnel complete, will measure the final piece when cards start to ship and make decisions accordingly.  Question 5 - What was the thing you wished you could tell us when you couldn't because of NDA, and you can tell us now?  We‚Äôre still under NDA, but at least we can now say that we are a Visa program manager and that we were approved on Sep 22, i.e. we actually got it done on time, even though we couldn‚Äôt talk about it.  Question 7 - Do you see Monaco being used as a Global currency? Now we have the platform to be a worldwide spendable 'visa' token, is it not wise to push the token in that direction? Give incentives for people to buy/sell/hold Monaco in the app over that of BTC and ETH?  We believe very strongly that the utility of MCO will grow with the size of the platform. This is not a static environment and we fully intend to evolve with the market.  Question 8 -  Are there other ideas on the table to increase the long term value of MCO without it being deemed as a 'security'?  We‚Äôd like to be prudent and have all ideas reviewed by legal counsels in all key jurisdictions, before we commit to discussing it in more detail. It‚Äôs a matter of critical importance, given how things are moving forward with regulators around the world.  Question 9 - Does Monaco currently have a plan for a North American rollout?  Does being a Program Manager help in that regard?  Yes, we had very successful meetings at highest levels during recent Money2020 event with key US partners, who are very supportive of our program. Being an approved Visa program manager helps tremendously in moving forward with global rollout and US is not an exception.",True

We can't provide exact breakdowns, but if we add it all up, when we ship the currently reserved cards out, around 1.3m MCO tokens will be locked up. That's EXCLUDING the Black Cards. 1.3m MCO is roughly 30% of all MCO tokens sitting on Bittrex today. Reminder: we have spent exactly $0 on marketing. Just imagine what will happen when we boost the number of downloads to 2-3 million. All the Platinum card holders will become MCO token holders via cryptocurrency cashback and the initial lockups.

It‚Äôs a matter of critical importance, given how things are moving forward with regulators around the world.  Question 9 - Does Monaco currently have a plan for a North American rollout?  Does being a Program Manager help in that regard?  Yes, we had very successful meetings at highest levels during recent Money2020 event with key US partners, who are very supportive of our program. Being an approved Visa program manager helps tremendously in moving forward with global rollout and US is not an exception.    It means fun for real long-term tough guys. Globally the topic is not easy and it will definitely take a long time, but if the team will continue to work will eventually result in a success, greater than the contract with Visa. I keep my fingers crossed for further positive developments.  This is purely PR shit - All they are doing is keeping people with pitchforks off of their doorstep as they really tried to step out of their original promises. Is this honestly what you guys think is positive for how a company works?  Oh yeah... And how do you think you will stay on Bittrex when the SEC thinks your a security?",True

The competition is facing similar problems and it seems there might be another way. Check comment from Julian (TENX CEO) when he was asked in reddit about their (similar) asset contract:  ------------------------------------------------------------ Julian,  How can you say that Tenx Pay will have rewards, when the SEC clearly has set a precident for going after any ICO or coin project which issues virtual tokens that look or act like securities? This post here has some good information on DAO. This particular quote highlights the situation:   The DAO‚Äôs business model was similar to a venture capital fund. Investors used virtual currency to buy DAO tokens in the hopes of future dividend-like payments.  Seems to me that saying you'll have rewards isn't accurate. If you do, you definitely won't be able to give them to USA investors and card holders, correct? Your message says you will have rewards and then you go on to say that you're waiting on legal advice. Well, what happens if the legal advice is: you can't pay out dividends or rewards to token holders because it would be seen as a security? I don't understand how you can be so sure.  Unless by rewards you mean stickers, merchandise or cashback incentives? Sounds to me like you're not talking about an asset contract type situation where you can earn by holding TenX Pay or am I misreading the situation here? I know you're putting this out there because Monaco just said they aren't having an asset contract system in place because of legal concerns about securities and potential to be delisted from exchanges like Bittrex (based in Seattle).  If you're only putting out unsubstantiated or vague claims to get some good PR from the bad situation at MCO, it's going to hurt the Pay investors in the long run. So, some clarification would be greatly appreciated on all of this. I think many of us can say you've done a great job engaging the community and answering questions.  Can you please elaborate on this, particularly is a ""reward"" the same as a ""dividend"" being paid to token holders? The wording of choice here seems to be very selective.  Thank you and much love.  ------------------------------------------------------------  Reply from Julian:  Rewards in form of token - we do not do any fishy-take-back things. Give me, till I have the green light for all legal opinions and you will see how it is compliant (and will once again be copied by everyone else).  ------------------------------------------------------------ Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/TenX/comments/7a0b6z/tenx_we_do_have_rewards/",True

Here is the update so you don't have to click my link if you don't want to.  ""Monaco just announced today that it has eliminated the asset SmartContract. This significantly reduces the long term value of the token. One thing that will drive the value of MCO, that I originally missed, is that the rewards for the card are paid in MCO (.75% MCO back). This means Monaco has to purchase MCO from the open market to give to card users. This will create demand, but since the tokens aren't destroyed, and most users will simply convert MCO to BTC or cash, it is hard to say it will be a major driver of MCO value. And this relies on Monaco not issuing more MCO, which I still can't find black-and-white confirmation of.  The other thing that drives value of MCO is that the cards that give you MCO back ""cost"" MCO to get. If you want a Platinum card, you have to buy 50 MCO and keep it for six months. However, the MCO isn't destroyed, and after six months you can do what ever you want with your MCO. It is hard seeing this adding much value long term.

First quick, sudden ICO, then leak of VISA picture cards, then missing a lot of deadlines, and now changing this asset contract thing... the lost trust is very hard to regain..especially by people who experienced it more than once,  On the other hand, I believe that most of the moves of Kris were correct at the given situation... he got VISA program manager thing as the only until now, with great rates compared to competition (direct without intermediary), by omitting asset contract he secured the tokens will not be delisted (I am lawyer and I know that cryptoworld  will be(is already in fact) subject of extensive regulation in big countries. When this happens soon in USA  https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/hong-kong-exchange-gatecoin-will-delist-securities-ico-tokens/  it will be very interesting..  It is truth that they promised asset contracts in whitepaper at it is very bad that they will not fulfill it..On the other hand, they did not promise such great cashback rates, and they are giving it now.. You did not get what was promised to you, but you get something else what was not promised...  The only thing that I am not sure is the way that 1 % by asset contracts should have been counted (the way trumpc2016 showed, or the other , much more profitable way), it depends on the interpretation, but the difference of scheduled amount is enormous..  In the long term, I believe MCO  will be ok, but the problem is that this lack of trust (and believe that after 6 months the price of MCO token won't be much lower) will have negative influence on the number of reserved and taken cards..and will make it adoption process all much slower..unless many other tokens delist in 2-3 months..and MCO stays...  In therms of legal fundamentals, Monaco has now the advantage (Direct VISA program, more autonomy  and best rates), but the competition is not sleeping..so it will be very interesting..I believe there is place for 2-3 main players in this area..not more. But, basic thing is: everything goes or falls on the number of people willing to take (platinum) card.. There are around 10000 of us at the moment who have some significant amount of MCO.. the big question is acceptance in general public.. if Monaco is smart, they will spend a lot of money on marketing to get people who don't now anything about this negative events, delays and mistakes  and lost of trust in the previous process.. to take the card!

At least FUCK token is deflationary whereas MCO can create as many tokens as they wish. MCO token used to represent fees, and now they are giving fees from investors to cardholders instead, leaving us with nothing. The only value I see from MCO token is the requirement for cardholders, say 50 tokens for a card, but if token drops down to $0.1 per token, then that's only $5 in additional money flowing into crushed MCO price.

MCO have huge potential, and management team is good at promoting.

It would be at 250 million market cap with 40 times P/E multiple. And given the rate of growth of MCO, it could easily fetch 100 times P/E, making it a billion dollar company versus 60 million now. Assuming it's a security. If it's a crypto maybe even higher valuation as there is less compliance costs. But no, Kris has to take that tiny amount of revenue for himself. The management team can easily become billionaires 5 years down the road if they actually expand at the same rate they projected in the whitepaper, and token valuation could be realized not just by dividend model, but can use token buybacks, which is similar to dividend model and bypass security laws.

In the whitepaper it states:  Quote MCO Asset Contract accrues a 1% licensing fee on transactions using the Monaco Card funded with ETH/BTC, as well as exchange transactions between ETH/BTC and fiat currencies. Over time MCO will be backed by a portfolio of the most popular ERC20 tokens. MCO holders will be able to access the portfolio through a mechanism called ‚ÄúREDEEM & BURN‚Äù (see 1.6). Fees from card swipes will be denominated in the token being used to fund the swipe (ETH or BTC at launch). These fees will be sent directly to the MCO Asset Contract. Over time, this contract will accrue tokens in proportion to the usage of the Monaco Card & App globally.  so 1% of total transaction volume goes into the asset contract (as well as exchange transactions, but I'll leave that for now)  If I use the numbers you added up, the math goes as follows:  Users: 500,000 Volume per user: 20,000 (a bit steep tbh, but for now I'll use your example)  So total volume will be 10,000,000,000 usd in a year. 1% of that goes into the asset contract.  So that means 100,000,000 in the asset contract with those numbers.  Circulating supply is 9,814,875 tokens, which would add a value of 10,19$ per token. Keep in mind that is year one, and price will increase over the years.  This is not even taking in account token burn that would occur anytime someone takes from the asset pool",True

Thus a highly valuable token redeeming it would've granted a portion of the earnings while reducing the existing supply, which would thus further drive up the price. In this situation there were a total of three factors that would've driven the price up individually in the long run.  What we get now: MCO - a token that will be used to reserve platinum tiered debit cards, period. Nothing else. And I've already outlined above why this won't be a very lucrative price driver with fixed numbers. With a dynamic amount of tokens required to reserve the card (e.g. token price up, required amount down) this could be somewhat countered, but it still won't get anywhere close to what was promised during the ICO.   Thus, with the asset contract removed and no alternative proposed that complies with laws and circumvents delisting from Bittrex, the MonaCo Token has just lost the most important driving force behind its future price.  Clueless shills try to convince people that having to lock up MCO to obtain a platinum card will have a significant impact on the price. But that's just a shortterm speculative argument which is completely irrelevant for any serious investor and does not come anywhere close to what was promised during the ICO. If the token price goes back up to $20, even the lowest platinum tiered card would lock up $1000 for 6 months. And if any significant amount of people is to use MCO platinum cards, this number multiplies many times over. In reality however, there aren't going to be a lot of people who will want to put down thousands of dollars on lock just to get a debit (not even credit) card.   Shills: But this is better than not getting listed on Bittrex!  Nonsense. There are other exchanges which are just fine. The only sound argument for this move is not being able to get a Visa deal without complying with some countries' laws. However, as we can see with SONM there are ways to work around buy-and-burn and dividends models. So just dropping the earnings section entirely is neither required nor is it fair, as ICO investors and token holders were promised to be able to participate in the fees incurred through the use of the MonaCo platform.   Hopefully Kris will address this, but it seems like it's already set in stone anyways. And if so, I'll be pulling out of this one.",True

If this would be a full-blown scam, VISA would have been announced, token sold off at 20+ USD and that's it. One day later Visa denies, the bomb explodes and MCO holders lose everything.  Doing it this way just doesn't make sense to me ... selling for 7-8USD would have been possible for a few month. Touching one of the big wallets now would lead to a crash since everybody is cautious.  People putting their name on the MCO board with a good CV, that would spoil their career forever... doesn't make sense either.

To me all signs point to yes. They have actually only ""failed"" their promise once and technically they have never said they will announce ""Card Program Approval"" in September. There is a leading theory that the reason they didn't announce the Visa program is because they don't want to drive up the price yet. Kris has mentioned multiple times they are bounded by some type of NDA and people are speculating that they have acquired VC and their deal needs to occur before any major price movement. We have seen before what simply was a leaked photo did to the price of tokens.      The theory further speculates that the VC could be China Renaissance which is one of the largest Chinese IT VC funds. This connection comes from one of the Monaco cofounder called Bobby Bao who is active on Monaco's Chinese QQ community. If you look at the the resume of Bobby, you can see that he skyrocketed his career very quickly at a young age and even was involved in the famous DiDi-Uber merger. Bobby Bao shares the same last name as the founder of ChinaRen Fen Bao and Bao is not a common last name in China. So the theory goes that Bobby Bao is a close relative to Fan Bao and the VC could potentially be coming from ChinaRen.      Bobby also recently tweeted they want to get one billion people in crypto. When someone asked how you are planning on doing that, he replied: ""Let us check the update on Wed next week"".      They might be the world's greatest scammer at walking perfectly on the line of just being elusive enough for poorfags like me to believe and not obvious enough to be a blatant scam with a shitty website/branding (they have a slick branding in my opinion) or they might actually have something up their sleeves.

Vetted third parties, known as ""official accounts"", offer these services by developing lightweight ""apps within the app"".[38]  WeChat Pay is a digital wallet service incorporated into WeChat, which allows users to perform mobile payments and send money between contacts.[39] Every WeChat user has their own WeChat Payment account. Users can acquire a balance by linking their WeChat account to their debit card, or by receiving money from other users. Users who link their credit card can only make payments to vendors, it cannot be used to top up WeChat balance. WeChat Pay can be used for digital payments, as well as payments from participating vendors.[40] As of March 2016, WeChat Pay has over 300 million users worldwide. In April 2016, WeChat invested RMB 100 million in accelerating market expansion for WeChat Pay.[41]  In 2014 for Chinese New Year, WeChat introduced a feature for distributing virtual red envelopes, modelled after the Chinese tradition of exchanging packets of money among friends and family members during holidays. The feature allows users to send money to contacts and groups as gifts. When sent to groups, the money is distributed equally, or in random shares (""Lucky Money""). The feature was launched through a promotion during China Central Television's heavily watched New Year's Gala, where viewers were instructed to shake their phones during the broadcast for a chance to win sponsored cash prizes from red envelopes. The red envelope feature significantly increased the adoption of WeChat Pay. A month after its launch in 2014, WeChat Pay's user base expanded from 30 million to 100 million users, and 20 million red envelopes were distributed during the New Year holiday. By 2016, 3.2 billion red envelopes were sent over the New Year holiday period, and 409,000 were sent at midnight on Chinese New Year.[40] Jack Ma founder of WeChat's main competitor Alibaba, considered the red envelope feature to be a ""Pearl Harbor moment"", as it began to erode Alipay's historic dominance in the online payments industry in China, especially in peer-to-peer money transfer. The success prompted Alibaba to launch its own version of virtual red envelopes in its competing Laiwang service. Other competitors, Baidu Wallet and Sina Weibo, also launched similar features.[40]  In 2016, in order to offset banking charges, WeChat made a service charge if users transferred cash from their WeChat wallet to their debit cards. Each user had a 1,000 Yuan free withdrawal limit. Further withdrawals of more than 1,000 Yuan were charged a 0.1% fee with a minimum of 0.1 Yuan per withdrawal. Other payment functions including red envelopes and transfers were still free.[42]  WeChat Pay's main competitor in China and the market leader in online payments was Alibaba Group's Alipay which had 54% of the electronic payments market in China in the first three months of 2017 versus 40% for WeChat.[43] However Tencent claimed in 2017 that WeChat had 600 million active WeChat mobile payment users versus 450 million for Alibaba's Alipay.[27]",True

According to their website, they are going to be able to issue global cards:  ""Wirex has several card issuer relationships and we are now in our third and final month of integration with one issuer who will soon be ready to help us meet our growing customer demand.""  ""Our new enhanced offering for Wirex customers will commence in the next few weeks as integration is finalised. We are running final check processes now. Card orders are temporarily paused and pre-registration is now open for the new contactless payment card that will be available globally.""  Could it be that MCO is the issuer they are talking about that they are integrating into their program?  I imagine if they are, then they must be working on the details since MCO has to honor their promises with their customers as far as the .75% and the interbank exchange rates.  If Kris is locked into an NDA he cannot discuss this deal with them and hence cannot update the community until the deal is done.   This is just my speculation and is not based on any insider info or anything.  I participated in the ICO, have since sold off 1/2 of my MCO holdings, which I may soon come to regret if the above turns out to be correct and the promises are kept.   https://wirexapp.com/introducing-new-contactless-wirex-payment-cards/",True

Quote from above link: ""As a German full service bank in the Wirecard Group, the Wirecard Bank issues credit cards in all 33 SEPA countries.

If Wirex is able to issue a global card, my guess could still be correct considering it shouldn't take 5 months to finalize a deal with wirecard.

Why is there no need to change the dates on the roadmap, when Card Program Approval was scheduled for September?  We don‚Äôt have anything to add at this moment.  2.   Are you really 100% confident that cards start are shipping this October?  We will have first cards in the wild in October, admittedly in small quantity.  3.   What other parts of the world are targeted for cards shipment and when (e.g. Russia and Canada)?  We are working on a global rollout with multiple regions (and markets) being worked on in parallel. It‚Äôs too early to commit to dates for additional markets.  4.   I live in a country that is not covered by ASIA/EU/USA, but I have an address in one of these continents. Can I still order and use the card in my country?  Countries will be prioritised based on multiple factors, including local issuing capability, number of cards reserved, ability to use our existing processing relationships and capabilities, cryptocurrency regulation and others.  The more users from your country reserve the card, the higher the priority of your country for Monaco.  5.   Are all cards in the queue to be issued in order or is it region compliance dependent?  In order, but taking into account regional rollouts.  6.   What happened to the ICO buyers being guaranteed to skip the waiting list?  If you participated in the ICO and used the same e-mail address, you will be given priority.  7.   Would it not be wise to have a dollar equivalent amount of MCO to lock up for the cards as to not be effected by the rise/fall of the MCO price?  We don‚Äôt want users to think of this purchase as ‚Äúcost‚Äù. As such, MCO denomination is more suitable.  8.   How do you respond to the concerns about Monaco selling tokens on August 31st at the peak https://etherscan.io/token/Monaco?a=0xf9a5e0436c01cc15708449e480fa5f2d6a5b55ca  Monaco did not sell a single token. If you see any movement of MCO tokens from our asset contract, there are payments for bounties.  9.   Can you clearly outline when it is/was that the developer/advisor tokens were/are about to be released? And will the market cap be changed to reflect this?  None of the tokens were released to any advisors as of 6 Sep 2017.  10.   There are many in the Crypto community that are now convinced that Monaco is either a scam or a project to stay well clear of. Whilst the Monaco community of long holders know this isn't the case, what actions are being put in place to win back the wider Crypto-community?  The list of 4 items raising profile of Monaco in near future a) positive press coverage following our next dev update b) users receiving their cards and posting reviews of Monaco card and app c) announcements of new leadership team appointments d) completion of our first institutional fundraising round (VCs)  11.   Many token holders have a desire for more communication, are there plans to improve the situation?  Yes. We are hiring aggressively and see a lot of value in communicating more frequently and in different formats.  12.   Is Monaco considering leaving slack after the next announcement due to the number of phishing scams?  Our preferred route is to educate users about the dangers of ph\ising scams and lobbying Slack team to implement solutions addressing this issue.  13.   How does Monaco handle internal exchange operations (fiat-to-fiat, fiat-to-crypto, crypto-to-fiat)?  This is proprietary technology and we‚Äôre not planning on sharing this information.  14.   How is the exchange rate calculated?  Our exchange rates are going to be very competitive, but exact algos are unlikely to be shared publicly.  15.   Will the Monaco card be a Credit or a Debit card?  Debit to start.  16.   What is the difference of Monaco Visa Program Manager and other competitors Visa, and why it is good?  Running on our own BIN as opposed to a shared BIN allows us to give users better pricing and allows us full control over rules of the program to build the product we want.  17.   Can you outline the general VISA Program Manager application process?  The one sentence version: sign BIN sponsorship agreement, pass due diligence, submit PIF. get PIF approved, receive BIN #s, setup up the processing platform, get card art approved, manufacture cards, pass UAT, go live.  There are hundreds of smaller steps involving multiple parties.  18.   Do you need an own BIN for becoming VISA Program Manager?  Theoretically, no. See answers to question 16.    19.   Are there any new hires you can tell us about?  Expect news on this in October.  20.   What can you tell us about the upcoming dev update 2?  Focus will be on new features & business model.",True

Only that they have a very huge project to organize and of course sometimes there can be small delays. Kids on here start hyperventilating when their own prophecies don't come true. Monaco never actually said they would make some kind of public announcement regarding the card program approval in September. From everything Kris has said, it looks like they still have a few small issues to work out but because they have signed non-disclosure agreements (with Visa or a bank - I am guessing) they can't say too much just yet. Now is a great time to stock up on MCO - as all the hissy-fit children are selling theirs cheap. October is the month they have said cards will start shipping. Now if that doesn't happen, I would definitely be worried. But right now I am not selling a single MCO (and I have a fairly good stack). I am not advising you to do anything. But try to just look at what Monaco CEO, Kris has actually said - not all the garbage posted on here.  A couple of recent messages from Kris (CEO) - from Slack:  ""kris 11:32 PM All steps we are taking, including those relating to any upcoming dev updates, are in the best interest of all token holders. While it's hard to ask for a little bit more patience, that's exactly what we're doing: please sit back, relax and let us do our job. It's absolutely critical to get these things right, even if it takes a little bit longer. That's the only way to build a globally respected brand in payments space.""

Rest assured we understand the importance of keeping the community up to date with recent developments. We are also fully aware of the timeframes we committed to and how anxious the community is to see the next Monaco dev update. At this moment, it does not seem likely that an announcement will be ready to go out this week. While we're confident & pleased with the progress we've made since last our update on Aug31, we must refrain from providing more colour at this point. Please remember that as a company that views compliance as it's core competence, we feel very strongly about following strict guidelines relating to non-disclosure agreements that we committed ourselves to.  2.  All steps we are taking, including those relating to any upcoming dev updates, are in the best interest of all token holders. While it's hard to ask for a little bit more patience, that's exactly what we're doing: please sit back, relax and let us do our job. It's absolutely critical to get these things right, even if it takes a little bit longer. That's the only way to build a globally respected brand in payments space.  3.

I'll finish this short note with two reminders. The first one is to read our Aug31 dev update yet again - it lays out the mid-term goals we're pursing relentlessly. Nothing gets us more excited than what was included in that update. Second thing I would like to remind everyone of is a quote that is somewhat overused these days, but remains true nonetheless: ""money is moved from the active to the patient"".  5.  things are developing fast and we are updating everyone with what we can communicate publicly; we're not concerned about temporary token price swings given how well the business is moving forward  6.  time will tell - again - we do what is best for all token holders; we have answers to every question that you guys posted here in the last 10 minutes and I'll personally come back to all those after the next Dev Update is out  7. I'm getting a lot of questions about the timeframe of the next update - please note that we didn't update the milestones / timelines for a reason - today's message was that the update is not coming out this week       MCO is actualy doing a CLEANING in the market (actual investors coming in , kids like you selling on panic .... going out)  you can check the buy orders for yourself  (with all this FUD going on ,massive buy orders are placed under 0.0019)  Cya next week ))",True

It seems there is no end to the expression of anger, disappointment and distrust from a lot of token holders who are clearly in Monaco for short-term, speculative reasons. There are many accusations including that Kris is a liar, that he handles communication terribly and even those who say that Monaco is a scam. If you apply a combination of common sense, business analysis and psychological understanding you can completely rule out that Monoca is a scam. It‚Äôs ridiculous even to suggest this. Ask yourself why a successful entrepreneur with 2 exits behind him and money in the bank would create a scam and destroy his name forever. As opposed to the majority of crypto companies Kris and Monaco are perfectionists. You can see their pride and passion in everything they do from the logo (the beautiful Ethereum lion) to the design of cards, website, app and all their written communication which is flawless. Kris is also extremely credible and trustworthy on radio interviews and Q&A‚Äôs. He has high standards and integrity. There is no doubt that the Monaco team are committed, serious and know what they are doing. When it comes to communication Kris is actually very professional. He doesn‚Äôt bend to the pressure of hysterical token holders who constantly scream for updates. It is clear that you cannot communicate the details of a deal before everything is in place. People blaming Kris for not making the ‚Äúannouncement‚Äù sooner fail to understand, that he had no announcement to make. That‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt use the announcement channel ‚Äì logical right? A professional company will not leak details that could compromise the company and potentially make the deals they are working on fall apart. If that happened that would seriously injure Monaco and the value of the tokens. So why didn‚Äôt Kris inform the token holders that things might not fall into place in September a week before the end of the month instead of yesterday? Again ‚Äì if you apply common sense ‚Äì it is pretty clear that they are very close to getting things done and dusted. So, there is nothing strange or unethical with regards to letting us know that they are not quite there yet at the end of the business week ‚Äì of course they are also waiting and hoping for the final green lights. As Kris also wrote they did not change their milestones and timeline meaning: they are still on track. If things were falling apart of course Kris wouldn‚Äôt communicate this way. I‚Äôm glad if we got rid of the disbelievers and the pumpers & dumpers. Crypto is going mainstream in the next 12-24 months and everyone needs Monaco.    ",True

If they didn't ink the deal, don't make an announcement and cash out 30% of the coins and crash the price then we have all been hoodwinked.  I seriously doubt that is what they will do as there will be many unhappy people out there who know what the devs look like, so unless they are also planning some extensive plastic surgery to conceal their identity, pulling a fast one like DROPLEX did is probably not gonna happen.  (DROPLEX copied another group - quantum ledger's whitepaper, changed some language, set up a domain, fake twitter, and apparently copied pics of unsuspecting people off linkdin to put up as their team while paying for ad on cointelegraph.com touting their quantum computer proof token which they actually issued and then their .org website disappeared and no more posting to twitter etc - that is an elaborate scam).  This MCO coin will succeed and the price will go up. People will want more than one crypto credit card in their wallet and MCO will be one of them.

Because it will scare away true investors who want to buy it and hold long term which will give organic increase in price. The ''whales'' will make money out of small savers who may invest in based on lies. I would like to kick their a**es of those whales, but I am a nice person end of the day",True

Kris""  ""The card is just a way to get users in.. and allow the your funds to be easily accessible anywhere in the world on existing banking/visa rails.  If you want to understand the true potential of the project, you have to focus on what our APP will be able to do. One example:  We are integrating with a well funded startup in online lending space - they disrupted a lot of traditional bank business by having proprietary algorithms that judge credit risk based on thousands of data points. They provide instant loan decisions online. So by integrating with them, we will enable a new account top-up option: Instant Credit. You will be assigned a limit, from which you can top-up your account. You will receive a monthly statement for Instant Credit and if you repay on time, there is no interest.  This effectively turns Monaco Debit Card into a Credit Card -> you will not have to pre-fund your purchases!  We have similar things on the roadmap for: - travel insurance - wealth management / investment funds  Eventually, by integrating a lot of disruptive products into the app, we will become a platform that banks will have extremely hard time competing with.  Last, but not least - blockchain & crypto are such powerful building blocks for innovation. We could not be more excited about the potential to disrupt finance industry with it....

Ultimately, a slow attrition, because people will realize that VISA doesn't change the game that much...  and that even with 300,000 credit cards, MCO value based on PER (Price per earning ratio) will remain limite.

That taken on 10y for the PER is $300MM. BEST CASE SCENARIO.  Recalculate with MCO tokens release: the extra $10MM WILL be released as people have to hold for they cards, meaning that the total supply will be north of 20MM tokens )   Black scenario: no visa for MCO... but actually other visa or mastercard solutions in the ecosystem: an actual bank or credit card actor, already established, creates an actual credit card tied to a BTC account and an actual bak account. It's a huge step back for the idea of a decentralized unbanked world, but a massive customer adoption cycle start. I personally see a US bank partnering with Coinbase in a near future: 2019 maybe. (Fidelity investment is already partnering with them, the door is open). In this scenario, MCO valuation drops to $20MM.

I just sourced that article.  This is the closest thing to exemptions in the article:  Quote China will likely eventually allow token sales, according to Chu of Kenetic Capital, however only on approved platforms, and may even vet projects individually. ‚ÄúI think they will allow the sale of tokens in a format which they deem safe and more measured,‚Äù he said.  This is a private individual speculating on the future, key word being ""eventually."" There is no exemption provided in the PBOC press release. It clearly says funds must be returned to investors. I don't know what else to say. Await a press release from Monaco now.

A: We are confident enough to put it in our app 2 days ago. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî A: We don‚Äôt have any items outstanding for now, we are rarely a bottleneck in the process, our turnaround times are usually much better than a large co. benefit of being a small, fast, focused startup ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Q: Can you tell us anything about the challenges faced in sorting out a direct deal with Visa? Does it require additional regulation or licenses? If so, have you filed for those and how long do they typically take to get confirmed? A: If you know what you are doing the only challenge is that large corporates take time to get things done ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî A: we put a lot of emphasis on level playing field for all investors, I think the real problem is that we don‚Äôt have enough people on BCT and Reddit - will address that; I also think that the market will only calm down when price jumps after Visa approval is announced; no other announcements would make an impact, people just look at the price today and ignore the long term goals, progress we‚Äôve made and the overall potential - and we understand that, nobody enjoys being in the red ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî Q: The only wrong thing was showing that cards, and all that news, with the VISA brand.

I really doubt they would dilute the float. In common stock (I'm pretty sure) it's illegal to issues shares and then dilute the float. My understanding from business law is it's illegal to dilute the shares of stock after payment for services rendered, so I would imagine it's illegal to host an ICO And then dilute the coins after issuing them; Also if the team was going to act out such a scam wouldn't they buy back a lot the coin first to artificially inflate the price first.  Bieng that Monaco's team is educated, I feel they wouldn't issue shares and then dilute them. My guess is they will not touch them until Monaco reaches a 1 to 4 billion dollar market cap like Monero or Litecoin and when they do, you will not even notice.  Basically, the Monaco team will never sell a percentage high enough to effect the price in such a negative way; However, I feel the Monaco team should release a statement regarding how they intend to use them, so people don't take advantage of other's by scaring away potential investors, perhaps I will email them.  My personal opinion (not legal advice) is that there are people trying to scare potential investors because they daytrade the coin. I don't feel it's legal to dilute at any time the coin and the Monaco team are educated business leaders. They will probally follow securities law since Cryptos are similar. It's just smarter to sell a the coins in a away that it doesn't effect the Market cap more then a few percantage points in a given, day, week, month or years.   Disclaimer: This is not advice just my personal opinion. Plus I use stop losses.  Stupid seb, Sorry I don't have the whole day to sit here explaining every scenario, but Dodge Coin was based on a grass roots marketing approach. Monaco will be based on marketing as well, and Monanco has the potential to reach a majority of Bitcoin and Eutherum users, unlike its competitors.

From what I understand Monaco are doing things correctly and negotiating deals with VISA in each of the required territories to ensure the cards issued to customers are from the correct country ie VISA Europe for the European customers Visa Asiapac for Asian customers etc. If you saw in the news recently VISA got mad because companies were applying for a licence in one territory and then shipping cards world wide. The fact that Monaco are rolling out to Asia (Sept) then Europe (q4 2017) then America 2018 suggests to me its the order they are working to agree the VISA deals. They are also looking to go direct to Visa for a deal and not go through a 3rd party which is pretty easy to get but the downside is middle man fees that are passed to the  customer. IMO there is room for Monaco Tenx Tokencard Change and any others that come along in the future.  If you have any honest concerns that haven't already been answered online head over to the slack channel. The Ceo Kris is in there all the time answering questions and is open to feedback and suggestions.  The beauty of it is we only have to wait until the end of the month to find out. If a VISA deal is announced great the FUD can end and we can move forward and wait for what looks like a great product..

It's isn't just for it's shopping potential; it connects fiat cash with cryptos through 'normal', non bitcoin ATMs too. If such cards become more popular, cryptos become more popular.  If you look at the MCO price graph it is obvious the pump that started at around 8/25 has now been dumped, possibly taking some panic sells along with it. And by my brief experience in exchanges I can tell many or most short-term traders don't care which coin they trade, they just go for it if it appears profitable to them in the short term, based on hype and similar things. Whether MCO will succeed or not in the long run is not based on pre-launch graphs. It is based on how legit it is and how well it will go as business.

Do the math !!!  There are 9.8M MCO tokens currently in circulation.  All the rest (around 21.8M more) are locked up for at least 90 more days.  https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/monaco/  Of the 9.8M MCO in circulation, 4.3M or almost half the total are currently on Bittrex.  https://etherscan.io/token/Monaco?a=0xfbb1b73c4f0bda4f67dca266ce6ef42f520fbb98  So far in just over 48 hours, over 7000 people have preregistered for a Monaco card.    (This is somebody else's registration screen capture - there's  a Black card reserved for me )    Seems logical that we will get to 8700 preregistrations from the current 7000.    Question - what if they all reserve silver / gold Monaco cards?  Well, they'll ALL have to purchase 500 MCO from Bittrex and then freeze that MCO out of circulation for six months.      How much MCO would that take, to issue 8700 silver / gold MCO cards?  Well, 8700 * 500 = 4.35M MCO.  THAT'S MORE MCO TOKENS THAN ARE CURRENTLY IN THE ENTIRE BITTREX WALLET.  Let that sink in.  Roll that thought around your brain until the lightbulb goes off over your head.  8700 SILVER / GOLD MONACO CARD REGISTRATIONS WOULD CREATE A BUY WALL TIDAL WAVE THAT WOULD PURCHASE EVERY SINGLE MCO TOKEN CURRENTLY AT BITTREX.

They freeze another 1K*500 = 0.5M MCO  or another 5% of total MCO supply out of the market for six months.  10% of total supply of MCO can very plausibly get locked up for six months by the first 11,000 Monaco metal card holders.

You need to withdraw $5000 per month for free?  Buy multiple metal cards with multiple freezes of MCO.  What if there are 20K metal card holders by the end of the year?  50K?  What if they sign up for multiple cards?  Do the math.  Think of the possibilities.  MCO currently has a very limited circulating supply of under 10M tokens.

DO THE MATH please... or you will get burned in this game!!  The Market: Today: 1M people use cryptos. It will grow like crazy, maybe x2 to x3 soon, but most of the population is not yet there (10 more years needed, maybe less)  Question is how many will use the MCO card ? Let's say... 500,000 people. Using it on a regular basis = spending in average $10,000 per person.  That's HEFTY figures... but let's imagine, maybe in 2-3 years, when BTC will be stable and people will want to use it directly from the wallet to the merchant. (for tax evasion purposes mostly... lol) Keep in mind: 500,000 MCO cars is something like 20% of the market reached: A serious performance, assuming MCO is not present in ALL the markets and assuming you have competition like CTR, PAY and TKN, each one on their respecitve markets (MCO= SE Asia, CTR = USA, TKN = EURope, PAY = a bit everywhere...)  Yes, 20% %share is HIGH. Not everybody may have a card (country limitations)... or may need it, or want to spend BTC (growing asset)   The REVENUES on this market: 1% of (500,000 x $10,000) each year = $50M revenues per year.  Apply a PER of x5 on the Revenues (Price Earning Ratio). I don't take the usual x10 because .. hey...it's cryptos!! More like startups, people will expect faster return and the market may not wait for 10 years.  That is $50MM x 5 = $250MM  This is ""ballpark"" the average Market Cap of a Crypto credit card TODAY (maybe in 5 years it will be $1B... maybe more, but I think that in 5 years, Chase, BankOfAmerica, or even VISA and others will have their own token cards. The market is too big to be left untouched by the banksters)  Now... half full, half empty: choose your camp:  Optimists will see $400MM --> 20M coins for MCO (estimated cruise amount: RTFW = read the f whitepaper) = $20 per coin Pessimists will see $200M --> $10 per coin   That said, you know how to address this market now: --> PAY is too expensive (surfes on hype) --> MCO may show some limited potential after the bloodbath we saw. Buy the dips, sell the bumps. --> CTR still needs to bloom (post ICO). Wait and see. ICO levels will be destroyed upwards --> TKN is undervalued by x5, being the only actor tapping on the European market (and in London... a ""small"" financial place)",True

It's totally fine to have the VISA approval still in the works and just launch the APP today, but people need to know this well beforehand. In your whitepaper, you need to explain exactly what ""going live"" means.  Anyways, if you are not able to wait this out, it's fine to sell and fight another day. Maybe you will forgo some profit, but at least save yourself the psychological tormenting. Most importantly, avoid wishful thinking. If you just WANT price to rebound it's not gonna happen; there has to be some good reason for it to happen.",True

You shouldn't worry too much. Getting approved by visa is nothing strange really, though it is a long process. Several cards have visa approval and there is no reason why Monaco wouldn't get it. Moving forward to when they DO release their visa card, their product is VERY similar to TenX for example, and there is no reason why they shouldn't stabilize and grow in value. The reason why you see such big fluctuations is because of the marketcap, volume and released amount of coins and the hype.

They have no working app, no card roll outs, they are not even licensed to distribute their own cards nor have partnered with anyone. The price is at its limit. Tenx has a working app, card roll outs, and are underway to becoming licensed to distribute their own cards. sorry PAY token by Tenx is it.   There's plenty of room for MCO, TKN, PAY as all are serving the same purpose, FIAT-ALTS instant exchange on the smartphone. As such business model focuses on serving the consumer (5billion active consumers), it will keep thriving. Old, and newcomers. The idea here, as I have explained a few rows above, is not to be a bag holder but to make as much money as you can out of these ""speculative"" trends. Right now, as predicted above, smart money is moving fast out of MCO into TKN. It is not whales cashing out but re-investing profits. I've said above that I have moved 80% of my MCO into TKN when TKN was $1.45 and MCO was 24.50. It is easier to double or triple profits at lower prices!  I've since doubled my money while MCO smart money keeps moving to TKN.  The trend will continue until the two will even out, and there is still room for growth in MCO given the upcoming launch. However, do your own research not on the whitepaper and market trends but also about status consumption (Monaco brand) scarcity value (more tokens = less value as it is the case with PAY).  Remember, if you are not a long term investor, don't be a bag holder. There's no room for love here just because you've made some money with coin A or B. Be smart, be ruthless, be cold and make money on these trends, now when it happening.  Good luck to you all.",True

MCO seems to have the most advanced product. VISA could make it a billion dollar market cap. TKN is the underdog, but very similar.

In the meantime I've just found this on reddit:  ""It is defined in the white paper. There is a 1% fee charged on every purchase to the card holder. The card holder can use any fiat currency, Bitcoin, EtH or ERC20 token to make purchases and the 1% fee will be withdrawn from the users account in the same currency/token that was used to make the purchase, All of these 1% fees will be sent to a smart contract. Be aware, That Monaco tokens do NOT pay a constant dividend from this smart contract (This is what most people assume) Instead, You will have an opportunity to burn your MCO tokens in exchange for a a percentage of what's in the contract. It's a ONE TIME thing. Say there are 10 million MCO tokens in existence and you hold 1 million MCO tokens, You effectively have 10% of the token supply, You can then choose to burn your Monaco tokens and you will be given 10% of what ever is in the smart contract. This will bring a lot of game theory into it, When does one choose to burn their tokens? You don't want to do it straight away because the smart contract will grow larger and larger as time goes on, Also... You Your percentage of the total supply will grow as more and more people burn their tokens to take a piece of the ever growing contract. The MCO tokens are unlike any other tokens in Crypto so its going to be very interesting to see how this all plays out.""  https://www.reddit.com/r/MonacoCard/comments/6vq5t0/what_is_the_use_case_for_mco_tokens/",True

Think its soon gona be over and with new stage of marketing(and these guys are good in marketing)price should heads up. Im not gona talk about price because as someone sad it can be 200$ in a month ar can be 100k satosi but only if app and cards miss 5-10.09 then as safex we pack our bags and try again when product would be in final stage. I think as we going close to september price will stabilize and go slowly up stream untill big news come and then let it be what should be.  And if Im reading grafs good(im not a pro learning at the moment) it hit a bottom and its time to go up.  Today and tomorrow are crytical because there are still ppl fith few k of mco selling it and stoping its growth.

I had already reinforced at 0.0027 long time ago, playing a dip. (again I announced it on the forum, I even missed a train forecasting a dip and the coin raised... to dip 2 days later only.)  If you read some of my posts above, you will see that, my personal forecast for MCO/BTC is :     - very long tern: no clue. It can be a multi-billion business, or nothing...    -  long term: 0.003 to 0.005 (20M tokens and a BTC north of $6k) --> simple maths where MCO is around $500 to $700M market cap.    - mid term: 0.005 maybe 0.007 (again depending on the price of BTC), maybe a spike at 0.01 BTC per MCO on the hype-ramp after product release. --> Binance listing is a good point here, it will increase liquidity and help the coin move up faster.    - short term: oscillating between 0.0027 and 0.0032 --> I did a couple good trades within this range, but as we move closer to the product release the more dangerous it becomes, and standard trading indicators do not mean a thing anymore.    I may be completely wrong of course, but so far such analyses went pretty good on other coins. Happy to discuss and disagree :-)    My goal is to generate BTC with MCO, not USD. Therefore my trades only goal is to increase the total amount of BTC in my wallet: I only invest in coins I believe will raise faster than BTC (not a lot of them...) --> BTC price raise is the party pooper here, but hopefully some high quality people here will buy my MCO sell-order at 0.095 MCO/BTC. ;-)",True

Based on my expectation and the high unimagined potential of the product offered by Monaco, I would push myself further. I would in fact say that 0.01 BTC is not an outrageous prediction for MCO as a stabilization price in the long run because most people in the crypto space and beyond would definitely need such card. The abandonment of traditional bank card services is something many people aspire to. This is why ""multi-billion business or nothing"" is a valid observation imo. I do believe in this project so much. I really see a stupendous future of utilizing Monaco-like cards, above all in a situation in which the banking system is more and more government-directed and conniving with extensive shady political structures. The payment industry can really be revolutionized by the introduction of such card. Governments would be required to keep pace with this by monitoring transactions in a heavy and systematic fashion. However, the technobureaucratic cost of doing so would be enormous. I do want to see what will happen. Really. Fiscally oriented transaction monitoring is the future of governments. Though compliance is always something that every financial services business conforms to, there is nevertheless a tremendously increasing cost such that governments will be increasingly challenged and prone to stumble and blunder blatantly. People will have to notice and appreciate the beauty of a technological advancement in the payment and transaction industry. They will have to embrace this somehow. Perhaps slowly and with noticeable uncertainty. But in the end those who really care about forsaking the conventional bank card services will stand in awe in front of such beauty. The price must be a necessary consequence of this beauty. I believe so. Monaco started something, very silently. Omise Go is doing something that may be taken to be similar, but it's categorically different. We all need cards to pay. They are easy, comfortable, slimline. They are what we need. This is why in my opinion MCOBTC may stabilize in the long run around even 0.008-0.01, with possible (numerous) spikes at even 0.02 BTC. The spikes being dictated by the urgent need for a vast minority to see a change. Since at times I have a need for profit, I sold all my exchange-bought MCOs, while my ICO MCOs remained untouched. After selling I realized that it was not good, and that there cannot be any short term with MCO. You have to buy and hold. I needed thousands of them. Now I understand that I was right. Monaco is an excellent investment because it may start a disruption and promote it throughout.",True

I refer to Whitepaper Section 8 (the example on 8.3 is straigtforward)  During the Token Creation Event, X tokens are created. After the Token Creation event ends, the following additional MCO are created: ‚Ä¢ X MCO for the Reserve ‚Ä¢ 83% of X  MCO for the Founders ‚Ä¢ 33% of X  MCO for the Talent Pool (future hires) ‚Ä¢ 17% of X MCO for the Advisors  In total, 3X MCO are created  almost 10M tokens were created, hence the maximum maximorum total supply will be 30M tokens. It may never be reached.  My 20M assumes That the Founders + Talent + Advisors get their shares (after a vesting periods that are disclosed and will be over in mid-2018). I took the hypothesis that the Reserve will not be created (quite bold...), see section 8.2.2. I did not factor some potential token burn. (may be compensated by Reserve?)  So mid 2018, I believe our baseline is a/ 20M tokens circulating (""hodled"" or not) b/ BTC higher than $4,000 today (I assumed $10k for the exercice, you do the math with another figure).  only (b) is questionnable, and therefore raises one question only: how fast will MCO increase in value vs. BTC ? (same question for EVERY coin btw).  We may also ask how MCO can have a sustainable growth (putting $100M to make $12B is, imho, not sustainable as traders will sell their positions and take the valuation down at the same time the order book moves...)",True

It really helps raising the bar here... (but real thanks for the community for the retaliation)  LET'S DO SIMPLE MATHS: Hypothesis = 1 MCO at 1.9 BTC, with roughly 10M coins in circulation from start... (ICO levels, you can find this online) So, it means that MCO did reach 19M BTC market cap in early july ? (when BTC was 2.5k USD) Which is ...47.5 BILLION Dollars valuation...  Basically, you imply that MCO valuation on beginning of July was HIGHER than BTC.   We try (tried?) to help, explaining you that this 1st spike is ""fake"" on Bittrex (look at other recent cryptos and see the SAME spike...).  We want to help you so that you can invest wisely, not make newbie mistakes... and by not being a noob, you will teach others and the whole community will thrive; hence the crypto world will raise its value on the long run, because people will debunk bad ICOs, push the Devs to make better projets, be more alert, smarter about this brave new economy.  You just bit the hand that was trying to help you, and judged a book profile by its cover name.   But you know what: I still love people like you, they make my day, everyday. EVERYDAY. Because trading is a game of give and take, and for some to take and make profits, others need to give and lose money...   Btw, being called stupid by someone like you is a connoisseur's delicacy. (and I know what I am talking about...) Nothing more to add here on my side.  Back to MCO: Following yesterday's very good performance, I realized was wrong about predicting MCO going back to 0.0027. (it did reach 0.28 tough...) I had changed my buy-order to 0.003 and it triggered this morning. Now I will HODOR until the 28th. See where we go from there. I already put a sell order on if the coin reaches a certain value.",True

You see we live in a world and universe where everything and anything can and does happen.  MCO branding, blockchain simplicity, and bank/fiat convertible plastic card you can put in your wallet or purse is likely enough to make the coin usable.   LTC is a legend in crypto space but the sheer fact that MCO is marketed around the richest place on Earth is probably enough to result in a crazy MCO price precedent. It's just the way this crazy world works.  I actually think the developers got the balance right between scarcity and supply.   In terms of mainstream marketing and images to appeal to the new rich and online business entrepreneurs around the world, MCO has a lot more marketing potential than grey Litecoin.  Does Litecoin have it's own version of a spending plastic fiat conversion card? If it doesn't already it is very likely LTC will due to its tech-focused development community.  But I still don't see LTC advertising commercial imagery coming close to the glitz, glam and fashion potential of MCO if it develops a premium price and gathers enough public traction for the Monaco developers to further develop the business model.  MCO doesn't have to be a technological industry leader or coding platform like Ethereum (ETH) or Chinese NEO. It just has to be exchangeable and tradeable against them with practical use and investment by the public using crypto / digital currencies.  At some point the test for most cryptos out there is you have to be able to buy stuff with it in the real world.  If Monaco (MCO) ever reaches the top 50, 25, or 10 crypto currencies it will because its business will be based on scarcity of supply, yet still having practical fiat spending usability, business partnership or acceptance with real world business/lifestyle brands, and being marketed to the public and press as the most Glamorous and Fashionable of all the emerging crypto currencies.

You see we live in a world and universe where everything and anything can and does happen.  MCO branding, blockchain simplicity, and bank/fiat convertible plastic card you can put in your wallet or purse is likely enough to make the coin usable.  LTC is a legend in crypto space but the sheer fact that MCO is marketed around the richest place on Earth is probably enough to result in a crazy MCO price precedent. It's just the way this crazy world works.  I actually think the developers got the balance right between scarcity and supply.  In terms of mainstream marketing and images to appeal to the new rich and online business entrepreneurs around the world, MCO has a lot more marketing potential than grey Litecoin.  Does Litecoin have it's own version of a spending plastic fiat conversion card? If it doesn't already it is very likely LTC will due to its tech-focused development community.  But I still don't see LTC advertising commercial imagery coming close to the glitz, glam and fashion potential of MCO if it develops a premium price and gathers enough public traction for the Monaco developers to further develop the business model.  MCO doesn't have to be a technological industry leader or coding platform like Ethereum (ETH) or Chinese NEO. It just has to be exchangeable and tradeable against them with practical use and investment by the public using crypto / digital currencies.  At some point the test for most cryptos out there is you have to be able to buy stuff with it in the real world.  If Monaco (MCO) ever reaches the top 50, 25, or 10 crypto currencies it will because its business will be based on scarcity of supply, yet still having practical fiat spending usability, business partnership or acceptance with real world business/lifestyle brands, and being marketed to the public and press as the most Glamorous and Fashionable of all the emerging crypto currencies.

Getting things done and getting things done right with the attention to detail you would expect from a premium brand takes time and effort. All I can say is that in our view  it's definitely worth the wait. In terms of market communication, we understand it's importance and we have retained a well respected PR firm to drive the message home on a global scale for us. This was done roughly a month ago. We do not shout about it, but they have laid groundwork for a massive PR push when Visa approval is in. We are simply timing it for maximum impact. For all holders, please remember: Monaco core competence is a triangle of Compliance, Product and Customer Acquisition. We are building this product with customer acquisition and retention in mind, all the investment right now will allow us to acquire customers faster and less expensively once we go live with higher frequency of use and lower churn. This will deliver massive transaction volume and resulting growth in MCO token value. Compliance as or core expertise means that we will get our program approved faster and on better terms than our competition. It means that we will be able to manage a global rollout better. This is what we focus on day to day and it will deliver results for everyone with at least mid-term outlook in mind. There is no time for posting videos of us having lunch. Well technically most of the days there is no time to have lunch at all. But nobody cares, as we absolutely love working on this product and we're really happy with how it's coming together.

I agree they are not treating investors well but to be honest, no matter what happens to the MCO coin makes no difference to the Monaco Card project team because they have $21 million and nobody is saying how much of that was converted to FIAT and withdrawn and how much of that remains in ETH wallets. Nobody is saying how much of $21 million (if any) went in to the pockets of the any/some/all of the project team. Utterly shameful.  This Monaco Card could have had a bright future if the project team treated investors better. They could have hired paid support team to answer here and take care of customer services and they could have used some of that $21 million to cover it but they are treating investors with contempt.

WHOLE damn market is one big red sea. The reason is  1. Ether is still going down. Investors are not buying or selling. 2. There is a growing uncertainty in crypto market as the date for Bitcoin soft fork-Hard fork is approaching. If there is going to be an hard fork, I strongly advice to not keep any assets on exchange because there is a big chance most crypto crash until devs and exchanges decide what Bitcoin to follow. Exchanges might not even let you withdraw.  Big INVESTORS know this, so everything right now is going slow.  So I expect most of the coins going up and down until September/November. Mco and TenX are not an exception to that.  The best thing is to buy at dump prices (not too big of a sum) and hold to see what happens after September/mid November.

Additional 12,635,073 are hold by the devs for the above conditions and represent 40% of all token. THOSE CAN NOT BE TRADED TILL SEPTEMBER! The Reserve 30% may never be issued as this is reserve and solely made for example when monaco decides to go for a full banking licence.

Capital Reserve ‚Ä¢ 30% of the MCO supply will be credited to the reserve, but not issued. These MCO will be available as an additional token sale mechanism, but may never be issued, depending on circumstances in the future.   There's even an example provided  During the Token Creation Event, we imagine that exactly 1,000,000 MCO are created in response to incoming payments.

We modelled our Token pool structure on VC-backed companies doing IPOs. 30% went to the public, 30% is kept by the company as capital reserve for future fundraising. 25% is for the team, 10% is for future hires as a talent pool and 5% is for advisors. The reality is that building a large scale consumer brand in financial services requires world class talent, a lot of capital, time and luck. The way we structured the Token pools increases our chances of building a global business with millions of customers, who will transact billions of dollars on the platform, driving the price of MCO up for all Token holders. Back of the envelope calculation: assuming a very low of acquired CAC (customer acquisition cost) of US$30, it will cost US$150m to reach 5m customers. That's just direct cost. On top of that there is a lot of infrastructure that needs to be built to serve this kind of number of customers. It can't be done with 20 devs and no other headcount. Risk & Compliance, customer support, product, tech, marketing, finance - we're building a business and not just launching a coin. Above all, you have to remember that with this setup founding team incentives are 100% aligned with all Token holders - we all want to see Monaco at a billion dollar market cap. This is when we all win and this is what we are working towards.",True

I don't think they can press a card that is accepted in ATM's anyway.  That was TokenCard, not us.

What has been done so far: - debugged & resolved the Smart Contract issue potentially causing MCO token multisig wallet incompatibility - downloaded all Monaco Token Sale transactions - tested the new token re-issue on Kovan testnet  What is in progress now: - testing on Ethereum Mainnet  What remains to be done: - subject to successful Ethereum Mainnet test, re-running of all 12,000+ Monaco Token Sale transactions on Ethereum Main Net - issuing of additional MCO tokens as per white paper - unlocking of the MCO token  Timing: - while we were 100% committed to the previously communicated timeframe of token re-issue before 6pm HK time on Jun 25th, we are now being slowed down by the Ethereum Mainnet, caused by network congestion - once the Mainnet test is completed successfully, we will initiate the token re-issue, which everyone can track on Etherescan - we will also communicate the new Contract Address to exchanges, investors and wallet providers, so that all parties can make relevant updates - our current best estimate is that the entire process will take another 24 to 48 hours, subject to Ethereum Mainnet performance - that would place the MCO token unlocking and trading start between Monday 26th and Tuesday 27th of June  TokenMarket and Monaco teams are working closely together and will provide further updates on the exact timing of trading commencement on exchanges as we get closer to the finish of token re-issue.  The re-issue was absolutely the best choice to assure good long term performance of the token. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

This appreciation in value (if any) is calculated from the crypto's original purchase to the time it is used in the eventual Monaco transaction.  If it's less valuable when you spend it than when you bought it, no tax.  If you've held it for over a year, tax is 15% capital gains on just the appreciation.  If you've held it for less than a year, the amount of the appreciation is considered ordinary income.  I am not a tax accountant like my stepdaughter is, so take what I am saying here with a ""grain of salt"".  But the truth is either as I describe above or something close to it.    Unfortunately, use of Monaco card will not magically mean you are free from the taxman.    So I advise to keep records of your Monaco transactions like I am going to do, and pay the correct amount of tax on its use come April 15.  That's what spreadsheets are for. Hopefully Monaco will include some kind of annual .csv download of card usage...(hint, hint).

The original contract ended at about 17 minutes before the Website Timer.  The Team and Token Market lied to investors and said it was a ""Technical Glitch"" on the website.  The Monaco Team and Token Market issued another Smart Contract and restarted the ICO to get more investor funds that were trying to make the minimal Eth investment needed to obtain a Black Card  I think the original investors should have the option to have their funds refunded as we were not informed of a second contract in the original contract. I would guess that altering the terms of a contract without notifying investors is illegal in most places.  I know it would be a problem in the US where several members of Token Market reside.  If the Monaco Team is a stand up Team they will see their mistake and try to right it.  I have tried communicating with both TokenMarket and Kris from Monaco but the results were less than satisfying.   The reason for the mistakes and oversight is because they simply rushed the project to beat their Competitor Ten-X.  Funny thing is this project raised 72,000 Eth over 30 days and the Ten-X project raised 100,000 ETh in 2 days in their Pre-Sale alone and the ICO is not until next week.  What it shows is that the Monaco Team has been reckless in handling the investors $25 million and rushed the project for fear of missing out.

It has been a thrilling time for us here at the Monaco HQ to see so much support for the project. The final closing figures show a raise of 71,392 ETH from over 8,500 individual participants, an absolutely amazing result and we‚Äôre thankful to each and every one of you.  Exchanges As you may know, the team here have been working hard to get the MCO token listed on exchanges and we can now reveal the first three to add MCO will be LiveCoin, Liqui.io and YoBit. We are working on growing that number and are in advanced discussions, particularly with exchanges based in China. We will be sure to keep you updated on our progress we‚Äôre making over the next few days.  Upgrade Following guidance from TokenMarket and the exchanges, before the token lists, we need to perform an upgrade that will address an incompatibility issue with certain multi-sig wallets. Whilst this is not a major problem, it does require action to ensure that your experience using MCO is the best it can possibly be. Therefore, we will need to re-issue the MCO token before it becomes transferrable to remove this incompatibility and to ensure that MCO can deliver, for many years to come.  Timeline Since the MCO token listing has already been prepared by our exchange partners we will need to allow some additional time for them to integrate the fix for the incompatibility. We have allowed a seven day period in which to do this, though it may be completed sooner with our internally set goal being 72 hours. As you, we‚Äôre keen to see MCO trading on multiple exchanges as soon as possible. We will keep you updated with progress as we go and of course we will be available to answer your queries or concerns in the usual channels.  Black Card - Final List We will be e-mailing every contributor who is to receive the Black Card within 24 hours, i.e. by 6pm HKT on Jun 19th. Once again, thank you all for participating and supporting Monaco. We‚Äôre grateful for your trust and will deliver a brilliant product we hope you‚Äôll come to love.",True

It has been a thrilling time for us here at the Monaco HQ to see so much support for the project. The final closing figures show a raise of 71,392 ETH from over 8,500 individual participants, an absolutely amazing result and we‚Äôre thankful to each and every one of you.  Exchanges As you may know, the team here have been working hard to get the MCO token listed on exchanges and we can now reveal the first three to add MCO will be LiveCoin, Liqui.io and YoBit. We are working on growing that number and are in advanced discussions, particularly with exchanges based in China. We will be sure to keep you updated on our progress we‚Äôre making over the next few days.  Upgrade Following guidance from TokenMarket and the exchanges, before the token lists, we need to perform an upgrade that will address an incompatibility issue with certain multi-sig wallets. Whilst this is not a major problem, it does require action to ensure that your experience using MCO is the best it can possibly be. Therefore, we will need to re-issue the MCO token before it becomes transferrable to remove this incompatibility and to ensure that MCO can deliver, for many years to come.  Timeline Since the MCO token listing has already been prepared by our exchange partners we will need to allow some additional time for them to integrate the fix for the incompatibility. We have allowed a seven day period in which to do this, though it may be completed sooner with our internally set goal being 72 hours. As you, we‚Äôre keen to see MCO trading on multiple exchanges as soon as possible. We will keep you updated with progress as we go and of course we will be available to answer your queries or concerns in the usual channels.  Black Card - Final List We will be e-mailing every contributor who is to receive the Black Card within 24 hours, i.e. by 6pm HKT on Jun 19th. Once again, thank you all for participating and supporting Monaco. We‚Äôre grateful for your trust and will deliver a brilliant product we hope you‚Äôll come to love.

I invested a small amount just for speculative purposes (too bad they only take ETH. I had to sell some bitcoins for ETH. That was a first for me.) I received the MCO almost instantly once the transaction was confirmed. I'm looking at this like a flip of a coin, double or nothing. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. Just make sure you follow the instructions! I had never used ETH before so it was very confusing for me. I can see my tokens now in the ImToken wallet.   The last time I checked you needed 11ETH to get one of the last black cards. I'm not even remotely close to that and I don't see the value of it so won't be investing anymore. I read the whole whitepaper and I'm glad it's actually one I can understand! There's basically no technical side to it, which seemed a little strange to me for a whitepaper but as a normal person with no coding abilities I appreciated it.  The one thing that confused me was how the tokens were supposed to appreciate to $500MM by 2022 (I believe that's what they said). I don't believe for a second that's going to be the valuation in 5 years, but I'm hoping I'm wrong. It looks like the 1% fee they charge will go back into a 'pot' that will go towards the tokens. I had to read it a few times to understand it fully but it does make sense to me now. Basically you'll be getting a sort of dividend on your investment into their company.  The one thing I don't like about the project is that it's based on ETH tokens. What if ETH fails? I'm not a believer. Not by a long shot. Growing in market cap doesn't mean you have a good coin. having a real use means you have a good coin.  I'm anxiously awaiting the cards and app to come out.

Thanks, Kris    1) Can you please send me the link to your Github code repository?  Our Smart Contracts were developed by TokenMarket and audited by CoinFabrik. https://github.com/TokenMarketNet https://github.com/CoinFabrik We do not have Monaco Github code repository at this moment.   2) I have read many paid press releases, but I would like to see some unpaid articles as well. Could you send me links to articles mentioning Monaco card?  https://mona.co/press.html  We are continuously updating the press page as new coverage comes in.   3) Has VISA company approved Monaco card or have you already closed a deal with VISA? 3a) If yes could you please send me the terms of this deal?  We are under NDAs with our partners, so obviously we can't send you the terms of our commercial arrangements. We have an agreement with a principal member of Visa, who will act as the issuer of Monaco cards; in turn, we are in the process of becoming a Visa program manager   4) In the video about Monaco card, Kris Marszalek claims that you have worked on Monaco card for almost 12 months. Do you have any material that could confirm this? It can be for example a team chat like slack with the history of your team messages.  Our HK company was incorporated on 30th June 2016. The first press coverage of our product was released after we got accepted into Fintech Supercharger, the #1 fintech accelerator in Hong Kong.  https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2016/11/92176-supercharger-fintech-accelerator-announces-8-new-startups-hong-kong-fintech-week-starts/  5) In the video was mentioned Monaco app. I could not find it on Google play so I suppose it is still in development. Could you please send me the working prototype or any beta version that your team has created so far?  We are going to have a closed beta for a selected group of our users in late July/ early August.  The release date of our apps has been set for 31 Aug 2017.  6) In the video was mentioned ""Forecasted appreciation of Asset Contract value to ~$500MM by 2022"" What does this mean and which analysis supports this forecast?  Please refer to the whitepaper, it's described at length there.  7) Kris Marszalek claims in the video that: ""You only spend exact increment in Ether or Bitcoin. Just enough to cover the VISA transaction. So, as a result, you are able to save 30-40 EUR on every 500 EUR you spend on Monaco card""  What is the saving of 30-40 EUR compared to? Is it comparison to using a fiat debit card, credit card or something else? How are you going to achieve saving EUR30-40 on every EUR500 equivalent spent?  It is compared to selling your cryptocurrency on an exchange or through a service like coinbase and subsequently spending it in foreign currency on a debit or credit card issued by a high street bank.  We're achieving the savings by offering our customers perfect interbank exchange rates without any markups and free top-up with cryptocurrency.  Another claim from the video: ""They are going to save 5-8 times more on perfect interbank exchange rates that we provide.""  How can you achieve the perfect interbank exchange rates and what are these exchanges compared to? Do you have a special deal with VISA? If yes I would like to see the contract.  As described in the whitepaper, we have built proprietary technology, that allows us to offer these rates to our customers as a customer acquisition tool. This has nothing to do with our Visa agreement. In fact, our rates will be more competitive than standard Visa rates.  9) Rafael Melo claims in the video: ""Given the interest that the product has received over the past 6 months, it is likely that demand will exceed supply""  Who expressed interest in the Monaco card when there was no public communication of Monaco card before mid-May 2017?  We were referring to the fact that we were chosen in early November to be one of 8 startups to join a leading fintech accellerator in Hong Kong, we were selected from a group of over 200 companies.  10) In the video was mentioned that the project was self-funded. What was your initial budget and how was the money used? How are you going to spend the money raised in the ICO? Do you have a detailed business plan?  The details of our business plan are listed in the whitepaper.  11) GmbH is a legal status of a company in German-speaking countries. If the company is ""in formation"" it has no legal status and therefore there is no reason to use GmbH in the name of the company. How is it possible that on your official website is written ""Monaco Technology GmbH"" when the company is still in formation?  It is common to have a company ""in formation"", we are following legal advise from our Swiss counsel here. The incorporation of the Swiss entity will be completed before the Token Sale is finished.  12) On the official website Mona.co the description of Kris Marszalek CEO says: ""Serial Entrepreneur in Southeast Asia Internet industry, 2x from $0 to $100m in revenue and 2 exits. CEO at Ensogo, Founder at BEECRAZY (sold for US$21mm to iBuy Group in 2013).""  Which companies did Kris start that had ""2x from $0 to $100m in revenue and 2 exits""?  This information is publicly available on Kris' LinkedIn profile.  13) On the LinkedIn profile, I have found that Kris worked for Ensogo. On the Facebook page of Ensogo lot of people are complaining the company is a scam. Could Kris comment on these accusations?  Please refer to the 10min video answer by our CEO: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCL2gVoBdEw  14) Retrieved from Ensogo Wikipedia website (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensogo):  ""On June 21, 2016, Ensogo announced that it will shut down all South East Asia operation (including Hong Kong) and its CEO Kris Marszalek has resigned; it also requests ASX to suspend shares trading. The unprecedented shutdown affected operations in several countries; workers in Singapore found the office was closed, Hong Kong sellers call for police investigation of fraud and certain stores in Thailand rejecting deals purchased by consumers, though the Consumer Protection Board is expected to summon Ensogo executives for remedial issues.""  What was the reason for fraud investigation of Ensogo? Has Kris ever been investigated for fraud? If yes what was the result?  Ensogo is controlled by Patrick Grove, one of the top internet entrepreneurs in Southeast Asia and networth exceeding $400m according to Forbes.  It is worth noting that Ensogo appointed E&Y, a highly reputable big4 accounting firm to manage the process of exit from the region. Ensogo is still listed on the Australian Stock Exchange and has no liabilities with approximately $5m cash balance as of the end of last quarter.  As explained in the video above, Kris never agreed with the Ensogo Board's decision regarding the exit from the e-commerce business. This disagreement resulted in his resignation. He was not involved in the execution of the shutdown and does not agree with or support the way in which it was executed. Kris was never investigated for fraud of any kind and he has limited information about what happened with the company after he left.",True

However, there are a few buts that need clarification.  So, I would like to know what happens next if the VISA agreement fails to scale through. (Or is it impossible).  In my own opinion, an irrevocable VISA agreement should have been fully secured before this ICO. Reason being that the VISA card is the main thing you are offering. Every other offer is attached to the VISA card.  Kind regards.",True

Then they saw TKN raise circa $15 million in 30 minutes and thought 'hey we can do that' and decided to pivot into a crypto debit card on the front end.  Except for the payment app it seems largely a copy. However that doesn't mean it can't be successful because the CEO does have experience rapidly building high valuation companies and TKN has stalled a little post ICO.,True

If you want to understand the true potential of the project, you have to focus on what our APP will be able to do. One example:  We are integrating with a well funded startup in online lending space - they disrupted a lot of traditional bank business by having proprietary algorithms that judge credit risk based on thousands of data points. They provide instant loan decisions online. So by integrating with them, we will enable a new account top-up option: Instant Credit. You will be assigned a limit, from which you can top-up your account. You will receive a monthly statement for Instant Credit and if you repay on time, there is no interest.  This effectively turns Monaco Debit Card into a Credit Card -> you will not have to pre-fund your purchases!  We have similar things on the roadmap for: - travel insurance - wealth management / investment funds  Eventually, by integrating a lot of disruptive products into the app, we will become a platform that banks will have extremely hard time competing with.  Last, but not least - blockchain & crypto are such powerful building blocks for innovation. We could not be more excited about the potential to disrupt finance industry with it.... But coming from traditional business world / finance background, we understand that in order to take marketshare from them, we need to play by the rules. Compliance. Compliance. Compliance.

It seems there are similar restrictions governing both projects.  In your whitepaper, your App Go Live date is Aug 31st. What will that entail, do you have a more detailed roadmap I might have missed? (By comparison, TKN aims to release an MVP and an initial card batch in September and version 1 about 4 months later.)  Given TKN's poor post ICO performance and that you have an additional 7 day period if the soft cap is reached, I think you're likely to raise considerably less which may be a competitive disadvantage unless of course you're able to get some pre-commitments from larger exchanges to list/trade your token, which is unlikely, but good luck.",True

The MVP app functionality is: top-up, exchange, p2p send (free real-time sending between Monaco users), withdraw Following versions will include: cross-border transfers, budgeting, instant loans, travel insurance It's hard to talk about timelines, but 4 months is an eternity. We run weekly sprints and will have an R&D centre in Shenzhen with 20, maybe 30 engineers. We can do a lot in a month, let alone a quarter.  Roadmap will naturally evolve, especially we are planning to have regular feedback gathering sessions with the community.  POST ICO PERFORMANCE  We will have a dedicate team to keep the community up-to-date after the Token Sale is over. We'll get exchanges onboard to align the dates with the closing of the event. We have a firm believe that the performance post ICO depends on 3 things: - delivering the product into the users hands in schedule - over-communicating with the supporters, including interim milestones that get us to launch - growing the user based and transaction volume rapidly post-launch, to maximise the 1% contributions to the Asset Contract (which in turn will drive performance of MCO price)  We are committed to deliver on all 3 fronts.  Regarding capital, yes, if we raise substantially less, they can have an early advantage. But the reality is that we have already raised 3x more than we need to launch the product. And once it's live, we have higher token reserves to raise again at better prices and turn the capital advantage to our side. TKN mismanagement of their post ICO performance will be extremely costly to them, which they don't understand yet, because they think US$20m is all the money they will ever need. Shows lack of scaling experience.  Last, but not least, as a serial company builder, my core skill sets are: - assembling a world class team and lining them up behind a singular vision - pushing them to achieve things they thought not possible - acquiring & retaining customers at a fraction of cost  That last piece is what investors should always look for in founders. Anybody can burn through capital to build user base. Can you do it without money? I bootstrapped my e-commerce startup in HK without venture capital to almost 1,000,000 users by the time it was sold for $21m. That's like 20% of online population in HK.. Mass market adoption.  We're taking all these learnings and using it to make Monaco better and deliver a fantastic product for the community.  Support us & have your friends support us, too!  Kris    ",True

Just opened an account on Bitcointalk to answer all the questions you may have regarding our company and the token sale. We'll be posting a thread shortly...  I think we have to start by acknowledge, that: - in hindsight, we should have had done a few weeks of pre-marketing to make a good first impression on the community - we are late with even the basic stuff - like posting ANN on bitcointalk - but at the same time, we are very happy with the results so far with our minimum being hit in under 2 hours and that we hit 10,000ETH milestone during the first 24 hours. - we think since we had zero pre marketing ahead of ICO launch, the results are amazing and the only reason behind it is simply our product: people love the Monaco Card & App   In terms of addressing the single most common question: why only 1 day notice. It's actually pretty simple. The single thing that pushed us to launch ahead of our original July schedule was a competitor running towards an ICO with a 90% same value proposition (FX+crypto). Our CFO was at an event at VISA Innovation Centre in Singapore on 11th of May, where he ran into another founder, who basically told him what they're working on and that their ICO is going to launch in June. We made a judgement call to finish working on our ICO within a week and launch, then spend the next 30 days to gradually build exposure and increase our brand awareness, so everyone has plenty of time to get to know us and do their due diligence.  Naturally, we had no idea people would think this is a scam. - we've been working on the product for almost 1 year - we have very experienced team of entrepreneurs (I sold my previous business for US$21m in 2013, our CFO is ex-Mastercard) - we have serious heavy-hitters on our Advisory Board from companies like AWS, VISA, Adyen, Emarsys  I guess to a certain extent it's a function of us not understanding how does this community think and operate. We're learning fast and we're committed to being open and transparent, so that everyone can have their questions answered. I will be here and on our ANN thread answering all the questions you may have. I also encourage those who find our project intriguing to join our slack channel: https://monaco-card.slack.com/ - it's growing steadily and is probably the most convenient way to get to know us personally.  One final note: the team is based in Hong Kong, so please note the time differences in case we don't respond instantly, it's probably middle of the night on our end.  Kris""",True
