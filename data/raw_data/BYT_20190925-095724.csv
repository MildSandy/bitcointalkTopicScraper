An increased level of cholesterol can raise the risks of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. According to a study by the World Health Organization, hypercholesterolemia is estimated to cause 2.6 million deaths annually and 29.7 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the global population.  One of the underlying projects that Bayan Token — through its ICO — will support is the production and commercialisation of Basella Alba leaf extract. Basella Alba — other common names would be red vine spinach, Malabar spinach or Ceylon spinach — is a widely used vegetable, and traditionally known to have many health benefits.  A breakthrough in research has found that Basella Alba has great potential to be a solution in treating high cholesterol levels, or hypercholesterolaemia. On top of that, Basella Alba is the natural alternative to statins. Statins are widely prescribed as drugs to treat cholesterol problems. Study showed that Basella Alba has similar effects as simvastatin (which is a form of statin), in reducing total cholesterol, LDL (or low-density lipoprotein), and triglycerides in the blood. Even better, it is very safe and doesn’t cause any muscle or liver damage, which are some of the common side effects from using statins.  By supporting and participating in Bayan Token, you are effectively helping the global citizen to fight this endemic disease.

The devoted Islam convert, who was a wanted man on the streets of Adelaide before fleeing to Italy in March 2017, has been appointed as an “ambassador” and a “chairman” for a “sharia-compliant cryptocurrency” business.  In a visually striking YouTube video advert for Bayan Token, in which he is described as a “former gang leader” by the online company, he can be seen punching animated words and describing how the idea will have a positive impact on the planet.  “I believe that when you do good, goodness will come back to you,” he says in the three-minute clip.  “However, Allah has decreed that good deeds should be done with good intentions.”  He goes on to describe how Bayan Token is a “sharia-compliant Utility Crypto Token” which funds beneficial projects for millions and are in line with Islamic teachings.  On its website, Bayan Token is open about the former underworld figure’s volatile past.  “There was a time, whenever Vince Focarelli’s name was mentioned, it struck fear and hatred in the people’s heart, especially among the residents of Adelaide,” it states.  “That is not the case anymore. The former leader of the notorious gang ‘Comanchero’, he is now a transformed and completely different person after embracing Islam.   “Vince — now Imran Abdul Salam — is an active social activist, where he frequently gives motivational and inspirational talk about his journey to Islam.  “He is also actively involved in several humanitarian works such as organising a food convoy for the Yemeni refugees.”  The company describes how he used to own and run a Halal Italian restaurant, La Fig Cucina in Adelaide, and how he wishes to expand its presence around the world.  In the video advert, Mr Focarelli describes how the company aims to improve the lives of millions of people living across South-East Asia.  “The proceeds from Bayan Token crowd sale will fund several projects that will ensure the integrity of Bayan token as a valuable token,” the new company’s website states.  “Bayan Token is not only a utility token but it is also backed by real-life, profitable projects that will support the whole ecosystem.”  These projects include the expansion of 100 to 1000 affordable halal stores across Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia. The company claims its stores will lower the cost of living for millions of Muslims living throughout South-East Asia.  Another project is the commercialisation and production of the natural Basella alba leaf extract, which it claims lowers the level of cholesterol in humans and most animals — without the muscle and liver damage, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure caused by synthetic treatments.  Mr Focarelli fled to Italy — where he lived until his arrival when he was 12 years old — in March, 2017, pre-empting efforts from immigration authorities to cancel his visa and deport him.  The high-profile former underworld leader said he wanted to leave on his own volition before being forcibly deported.  “If I stick around and wait for them, then there’s a chance I could be taken to a detention centre,” he told Nine News.  “Once I settle down, my wife and daughter will come along.”  However, he moved to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia shortly after landing in Italy.  The Advertiser reported that he flew his mother out to be by his side. However, he is understood to have been unable to bring his wife and daughter over to Malaysia full time.  After appointing Mr Focarelli as an ambassador, a spokesman for Bayan Token said the former gang leader “shares the same aspirations and noble intentions of spreading good to the wider mass”.  “An avid preacher of kindness and goodness himself, he is very excited and looking forward to do greater good through the sharia compliant Bayan Token,” he said.",False

The gangster, turned devout Muslim, swears to have wiped his hands of the underworld.  Unable to return to Australia, he’s amassed a legion of fans in the Muslim world, particularly in Malaysia where he preaches the teachings of Islam and shares his story with school children in the hope of convincing them to turn to religion, not crime.  On face-value it’s a stunning turn-around for the once feared gang leader who survived four assassination attempts, including one in which his own son was killed during a shoot-out in South Australia.  Micky can now reveal his appeal in the Muslim world has landed him a job as an ambassador for the ICO of ‘Shariah-compliant’ utility token, Bayan Token.  The ICO is aiming to raise up to US$35m.  Speaking to Micky News, Bayan Token Chief Operating Officer, Adam Mustapha said Vince Focarelli has already brought in new investors.  “We invited Vince to join us and upon hearing about what is Bayan Token, its features and benefits, he straight away agreed as he is really convinced with Bayan Token’s potential,” said Mustapha.  Despite the former gangster’s chequered past and recent deportation from Australia, the COO believes Vince Focarelli is the ideal face for the ambitious project.  “We discovered about Vince’s journey to Islam and it strikes very well with Bayan Token’s story and vision.  “We hope his life’s experience will inspire people to be part of Bayan Token, since we are promoting ‘Good for Goodness’ concept, whereby when people invest in a Shariah-compliant product (GOOD), more benefits and blessings will come back to them (GOODNESS).  “Having Vince as our ambassador will definitely attract people to find out more about our products,” added Mustapha.  Bayan Token is the latest ICO to attempt to tap the trillion dollar Halal industry.  According to the White Paper there are varied plans as to what the ICO funds will be used for, including; establishing a network of Halal-Marts where the tokens can be used, developing a shariah-compliant artificial intelligence global equity trading platform and commercialising a new Halal health product that lowers cholesterol.  The organisation also claims, at the very least, Bayan Token holders will have access to a cloud server, giving users access to tools including private data storage of inventories, invoices, web server, email server, DNS server or any services hosted on a Linux platform.

Vince Focarelli, who survived five attempts on his life as the Adelaide-based leader of the Comancheros, is the new frontman for Bayan Token, a Singapore-based Islamic finance group.  The 42-year-old reformed bikie is introduced in a three-minute YouTube clip as a 'devout Muslim and social worker' who was previously a 'gang leader'.  'My name is Vince Focarelli and I believe in God,' he said, after delivering a brief introduction in Bahasa Indonesian.  'I believe that when you do good, goodness will come back to you.'  The Italian-born former underworld figure describes the cryptocurrency as something that delivers 'goodness at every turn' and has 'real world benefits and a 'higher purpose'.  'It is backed by ongoing projects that are strong in Islamic principles,' he said in the video.  The man with a colourful past said the world's growing Islamic population meant there would be more demand for halal products, that were permissible in Islam.  Last year, he fled South Australia to live in Malaysia to escape a criminal-related deportation.  The Kuala Lumpur-based man, who describes himself as a devoted Muslim, has a wife and a stepdaughter in Adelaide.  The former Comancheros leader risked having his Australian visa cancelled under the Migration Act, which gives Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton the power to deport a non-citizen that is regarded as a threat to community safety.  Fearing it would be revoked and he would be sent to a detention centre, he left the country before an adjudication process could begin.  Focarelli, who became a Islam devout in 2012, survived five assassination attempts at the hands of gangland rivals - the last attempt killing his stepson.  Now, he encourages others to celebrate the beauty of life, and hopes to reopen his old Adelaide restaurant, La'Fig ­Cucina, in Kuala Lumpur.  The daunting task won't be the same without his wife though, given she was 'the backbone' behind their Carrington Street establishment.

Smart contracts can help you exchange money, properties and anything of value without any or minimal conflicts.  Traditional Contracts  So what do we know about traditional contracts?  1. You need a legal representative  For one, you basically need a legal representative to write a contract between you and another party. Most of the contracts are written in legal language that is difficult to understand and parse through. Moreover, you need the legal representative to act as a witness and enforcer for your contract.  2. It’s a difficult process  Sometimes, the process can be time-consuming, as well as ambiguous. You may very well come out from the negotiations with no knowledge of what you’re agreeing to. Most of the time, people overlook the terms and conditions and just put their signature on the contract (which is legally binding, by the way!).  3. The legal consequences is not a walk in the park either  If the contract falls under dispute, both parties can experience negative effects. The process of resolving issues with contracts involve long waiting period and a lot of money. Often, both parties find that the resources wasted not worth the dispute in the first place.  Smart Contracts  So how can smart contracts improve traditional contracts?  1. Simple computer programming to replace enforcers Behind the scenes, computer programmers help create smart contracts using contract development tools and programming code languages such as C++, Python, Go and Java. The code will define the rules and consequences in the same way that a traditional legal document could. It can include obligations, conditions, benefits and penalties in different circumstances. This code can then be self-executed using the same principle as verification of bitcoin transactions.  2. Easy to understand Because all the complicated process happens behind the scenes, the surface of a smart contracts remain simple and relatively easy to understand. Think of it like an IF function in Excel, where a cell returns one value if a condition is true and another value if a condition is false.  3. Transparent and accurate Smart contracts are less prone to manual errors and the process of execution virtually eliminates manipulation and noncompliance. Similar to bitcoin transactions, computer nodes in the network come to a consensus about the code execution. The network will record the execution of the contract and update the ledger, and monitor the compliance of the contract.  Smart Contracts Use Cases  A wide range of areas in various industries can benefit from using contracts and Deloitte have identifies several areas that can use smart contract in the picture below:   Credit: Deloitte  Smart contracts are still new that research into the technology is still ongoing. Several issues such as coding error or external circumstances can affect execution of smart contracts. Experts are trying their best to resolve these issues as fast as they can identify them. But just like how bitcoin has changes the process of transactions, there is no doubt that smart contracts will change the way we execute contracts.  So here’s to the future of smart contracts.

If you haven’t, worry not. You’re not too late and here’s your chance to find out more about Bayan Token. In fact, the author will try her best in shedding some light on this new project.  What is Bayan Token?  On the 28th June, BYT Technologies Pte Ltd announced the launching of Bayan Token crowdsale in a press release. According to the press release, BYT Technologies is a tech company incorporated in Singapore, and it is using Blockchain technology to enhance usability and create real value for its token holders, as well as the general population.  Based on the core concept of “Good for Goodness”, the team has created a token that is Shariah-compliant and committed in delivering goodness through redeemable value as well as their high-profiled projects. Bayan Token is a ERC20 token built on the Ethereum platform, and it utilises the smart contract function as a mechanism to ensure that token holders can redeem value instantly and automatically.    Each Bayan Token contains 16 hours’ worth of private cloud server space, where one cloud server is made up of 2 GHz of computing power, 1GB of memory, 5GB of SSD disk and 10GB bandwidth per month of data transfer.  What are the projects?  BYT Technologies Pte Ltd is planning numerous projects in the future, but there are three main projects that it will be focusing on. During the selection process, the Bayan Token team has carefully analysed the potential of each project and chosen three projects that are already operating in a small scale, indicating that the funds raised will be used to expand ongoing projects, not those at ideation stage. This is so that neither investors nor token holders are exposed to more risks than necessary if a project fails in the initial stage.  Shariah Compliant Artificial Intelligence-Equity Trader (AiET Z2 System)  I’m sure you’ve read articles on trading bots right? They are basically computer programs that analyse trends and automatically execute trades. Neat, huh? But this one’s better. The AiET Z2 system is based on Artificial Intelligence and it uses both fully automated and semi-automated strategies for executing trades.  According to their whitepaper, this system “provides the best investment and trading opportunities by streamlining the whole process of making investment decisions to produce more efficient, profitable trades”. You can read more about the system in their whitepaper, but what’s important is that the system has already been tested in the global stock exchange market, specifically NYSE and NASDAQ with fruitful success. With the funds raised from the ICO, the system will be further developed and is set to explore other markets, including cryptocurrency.  Development of Halal Mart Network  Did you know that although online stores are fast becoming favourites for shoppers, physical stores are still the go-to especially for daily needs such as groceries, fresh food and apparels? But what if you can have both worlds? That is what Bayan Token envision for its Halal Mart: the opening of at least 100 Halal Marts chain across not only Malaysia but also Singapore, Brunei and Indonesia within the next 3 years and also a platform that offers small and large vendors a chance to sell Hala products to a wide range of customers.  According to their whitepaper, “Malaysia’s position as one of the biggest Halal hubs is an attractive selling point to investors, small to medium retailers and most importantly, conscientious consumers”. This project is based on existing business model, Elzar Mart which has already been opened in several locations within Malaysia, and further expansion is planned under the flagship of Halal Mart with the funds raised during ICO. In the future, BYT token holders will be able to use their tokens to make purchases at selected Halal Marts across the country.  Commercialisation of Basella Alba Leaf Extract as Health Supplement  So we’ve already covered the financial as well as the retail industries, let’s move on to the health industry for the final project. First, some health lessons. What do you know about cardiovascular diseases? Did you know that one of the factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases is high level of cholesterol, or hypercholesterolemia? And did you know that hypercholestrolemia affects 1 in 500 people in most countries? According to a study by the World Health Organization, hypercholesterolemia is estimated to cause 2.6 million deaths annually and 29.7 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in the global population.  At the moment, the only available drug prescribed as a prevention for those with elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases is statin, which unfortunately cause some long-term side effects, including muscle and liver damage, rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. That is where Basella Alba comes in. The health supplement that will be developed based on a present study of the properties Basella Alba leaf extract is organic in nature and have been reported to possess beneficial effects in treating hypercholesterolemia and its related diseases.  It is definitely a groundbreaking project to get behind, and has a huge commercial potential not only locally, but also in the global health market. Not only that, Bayan Token holders will actually be investing in something that is beneficial for society and it brings us back to the principle of “good for goodness” that Bayan Token is promoting.  Why is Bayan Token different?  Did you see the purple banner right on top of their website? Of course. It reads ‘A Shariah-compliant Utilty Crypto Token’. Interestingly, this is what sets Bayan Token apart from its competitors. One important element contained in Bayan Token is it is backed by an asset that provides real value to its holders.  Why is this important?  Glad you asked. In Islam, every financial dealings must be based on real goods or assets that have intrinsic value. For example, Islam doesn’t see money as having its own intrinsic value; it is only ever acceptable as a medium of exchange. Similarly with cryptocurrency, on its own, it does not have any intrinsic value. Therefore, to solve this issue, Bayan Token is backed by an asset of real value and it is considered as ‘Mal Mutaqawwim’ or something that can be beneficial or of value according to Syara’.  Bayan Token has received accreditation as Shariah-compliant from Elzar Shariah Solutions Sdn Bhd, which act as a Shariah advisor for Bayan Token. According to the certificate, which you can accessed on their website, the structure of Bayan Token complies with the principles that is set within the Shariah law, which is represented by:  16 hours of benefits of cloud server containing value that is accepted generally by cryptocurrency users and can be traded within the cryptocurrency market the capacity of Bayan Token as a utility, where it can be used in exchange for goods available in stores under one of its projects Who is behind Bayan Token?  I’m pretty sure this is a very very important question for most of you, and can even possibly a deal breaker. Allow me to shed some light on some of the people working behind the scenes of Bayan Token. If you look at their website, you’ll be able to see that the Bayan Team consists of people who are experts in numerous fields, including cryptocurrency, Shariah compliance, banking operations and compliance, blockchain and peer-to-peer technologies, payment processing, artificial intelligence, internet marketing and economics, market operations and biotechnology.  Dr. Zaharuddin Abd. Rahman, who is Chairman of BYT Technologies Pte Ltd is a name that is already renown within the local community. He is Managing Director of Elzar Group of Companies (Elzar Shariah Solutions Sdn Bhd, Elzar Resources Sdn Bhd, Elzar Trading Sdn Bhd and K-Fiqh Sdn Bhd) and has been an Assistant Professor at the Kulliyyah of Economics, International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) for more than 10 years. He also has a lot of experience in dealing with Shariah compliance, having been Shariah advisor to a number of institutions, including Bank Negara Malaysia, RHB Islamic Bank Ltd, OSK Investment Bank, Deutche Bank, Al-Rajhi Bank Malaysia, Standard Chartered Saadiq Bank, ACR ReTakaful Bahrain, BIMB Securities Sdn Bhd, BNP Paribas Bank amongst others.  Another interesting team member is their amabassador, Vince Focarelli. If you’ve been keeping abreast with the underworld (just kidding!), you would know that Vince was once a name that was feared in the community of South Australia. He was once the leader of the notorious gang ‘Comanchero’, but has now turned a new leaf and decided to contribute his time and energy for Islam, and in this case, through promoting Bayan Token.  What’s next for Bayan Token?  As you can see in the roadmap above, the three projects listed above is due to start in November 2018. At the same time, Bayan Token will go through testing for redemption from their cloud server. The team also expects Bayan Token to be listed in exchanges by the end of this year. 2019 will be the benchmark for official launching of Bayan Token projects to the public.  Bayan Token ICO  Bayan Token is now holding their ICO from the 27th June to 27th July 2018. Each token is offered at the price of USD0.80 and the minimum amount you can buy us 50 BYT or USD$40.

Our targeted area would be as follows:   Basella Alba Leaf Extract  Commercialise and production of new compound for health care which is based on compelling lab and chemical research. (Basella alba leaf extract as a treatment for hypercholesterolemia). The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate.  The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase effectively lowers the level of cholesterol in humans and most animals by the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2, which upregulates the HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor that lead to the reduction of cholesterol levels. Although statins are well-known HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, long-term consumption of statins cause severe adverse effects such as muscle and liver damage, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal failure. Due to the side effects of synthetic drugs, attention is now directed to alternative medicines of plant origin.

A growing number of cryptos have claimed to be Shariah-compliant. Just for you to know, Shariah is a set of rulings in Islam in accordance with the guidelines of the Quran and teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him.  So what does a Shariah-compliant crypto mean to Muslims? And why does it matter to non-Muslims?  For a Muslim investor, looking for halal investments is obligatory upon him. Muslims are prohibited to get involved in gharar (uncertain) activities, what more things that are clearly haram (forbidden). Hence, a Shariah-compliant crypto is definitely a huge advantage for Muslims who are looking to participate in the ever-volatile cryptocurrency world.  For a token to be certified as Shariah-compliant, it needs to meet a set of strict conditions and only highly qualified Shariah scholars are able to certify it. For example, an asset must contain real value to make it Shariah-compliant. This concept is very important to ensure justice is upheld in every commercial transaction. It’s an open secret that most of cryptocurrencies’ values out there are based on speculation only and not backed by real assets.  Another instance is there must be no element of excessive uncertainty in every aspect of an asset to make it Shariah compliant. Cryptocurrency is created upon the blockchain technology, which is decentralised and very transparent in nature, thus, eliminates the uncertainties which are always associated with conventional investment.  How about non-Muslims? How is a ‘halal’ crypto can be advantageous to them?  It turns out, the very principle of Shariah law (maqasid al-shariah) is to protect the basic rights of human being; religion, life, intellectual, heredity and wealth. Any human being — Muslims or not — will benefit from Shariah law as the rulings seek to uphold fairness and righteousness in every element of life. In fact, it’s not news to find a lot of non-Muslims prefer Islamic banking to conventional, due to its ability to safeguard their rights and interests.  Investing in a Shariah-compliant asset is not just about the ‘feel good’ factor, but it will produce real value and growth to its stakeholders.",False

Bayan Token ultimately satisfies Shariah-Compliance as it acts as a means of payment, and most importantly is backed by private cloud server that gives it value. Bayan Token offers holders the ease of payment as well as a secure way to purchase goods at our Halal Mart.

As a case study, we refer to the OmiseGo (OMG) ICO.

This is attributed to the fact that the issuer had created a robust ecosystem and community where token holders may transact and circulate their tokens among themselves for services and goods.
