I'll try to clarify those for you: Luckily, we have a successful business based on virtual planetariums, the ICO is not a goal itself but is one of the instruments for money raising. We don't want to do a quick poorly made ICO, we need to and will do it much better. During the roadshow, we have found many experts and advisers and our project has been improved several times.  We believe it will help to create a good product, not depending on the ICO results. Besides, the number of funds will only affect the speed of development. Also, we have introduced one of our b2b products for additional education lately and  Altair VR took part in XII SIBERIAN VENTURE FAIR hold on August 27-29 ( which is a great additional possibility to attract the interest of potential investors to our projects)  So you see that being positive about the future of our project is a good thing to do  Thanks!",False

We are in business since 2010 and since then we have built the largest chain of portable planetariums in Russia.  This year we presented our new product - VR Planetarium. It's available free for Oculus Gear VR (https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1174406302638883/) and at the moment it was downloaded more than 300.000 times. It's a global platform allows content producers safety sell their fulldome shows not only for planetariums, but for everyone who has VR glasses. In fact, we made a small revolution on this market. Because now content producers has a direct access to millions of customers from all around the World. And the customers for the first time can buy subscription for planetarium shows and watch them just seating at home.  This April we also introduced VR Planetarium franchise. It's a offline version for countries where VR glasses are not popular. With VR planetarium franchise we build a partners chain. And each our partner can go in any school in his region and show fulldome shows synchronously for the whole class of children. You can watch how it works here.  For the half year we sold 15 franchise and more 8 are in the process of signing.  So we confirmed the high interest for edutainment VR content. And VR Wikipedia is a next step for us to make an education process more interesting. We will do it in any case, because we already start this process with our VR Planetarium. But ICO help us to make it much more quicker.  Of course we will continue to grow up our franchise chain. Because when the VR Wikipedia will be ready our franchise chain will be the great marketing channel and help us to grow a community and make VR Wikipedia popular.  I hope I answered your question.

Our platform allows community members to create and distribute VR experiences (applications). It’s a perfect tool for those who are looking for affordable, easy-to-use learning experiences that employ senses and emotions. Our target users are audiences of the National Geographic and Discovery Channels.  •  We are creating a global VR platform that allows users to discover the world. It’s community-run and blockchain-based. •  It’s a decentralized virtual encyclopedia. It allows users to learn more about the world either in game or academic format. From molecules to the edge of the Universe; dinosaurs, to scenarios of the future. •  The content is to be created by users and financed by a platform’s in-built trust fund, as well as by crowdfunding. •  The platform can be accessed via a browser from any VR device. It aims to avoid prohibitively high fees traditionally charged by VR stores, as well as censorship.     WHAT IS ALTAIR VR?  We have been working in the field of additional education for over 7 years. During this time, we managed to build in Russia and the CIS the largest network of mobile planetariums thereby introducing astronomy to more than 500,000 children.   The next stage is the creation of a platform to virtually discover the world through teaching and interactive games – a type of Virtual Encyclopedia for the natural sciences including, but not limited to: chemistry, physics, biology, natural science, geography, and history.  We have created a VR encyclopedia in which anyone can create their own content and share their interpretation of knowledge.
