Haven't interested in ICO's, usually what I am interested in is mining, buying some coins and everything related to bitcoin. It's nice to imagine a world which is the equivalent of play but that world doesn't exist and we don't have to have a hope of something that will always be dream. Also such world will ruin everything if we think from current situation. I think we mustn't motivate players by making playing on pc profitable, we have to motivate them to work, have a healthy lifestyle and etc. If I am wrong and it's not related to your thread OP, lets explain things to me.",True
