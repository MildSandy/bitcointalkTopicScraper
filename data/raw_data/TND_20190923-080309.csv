It allows us to create a tamper-free ledger of the tokenized assets, i.e. it serves as a kind of “public” register of which token owners has what rights to what asset. We believe for such type of purpose, the blockchain is much better than traditional, central databases.  2. It gives us a marketplace or trading function which irrevocably allows proper ownership transfers without us or anyone else being able to cheat on this.  3.

Keen to check out your whitepaper as soon as available. 2. My point is not to avoid regulation - no point to do it. The tokenization of real assets is a way to go and is the future, but still complicated at this stage especially from regulators point of view. Hope you will disclose your position on the issue during your ICO. As it could be an important step for the whole market especially in regulated jurisdiction such as Switzerland. 3. Here another question - have you clear taxation compliance approach at this stage? Especially regarding capital gain taxation? 4. NP  Anyway hope you will reach your goals and will develop something interesting. IMHO you have great potential market and great approach to handle it. Will follow you closely.

Would be great to hear their answers/approach how they plan to achieve it especially with announced goal of 100 m users  .  Seems 90% more prepared from this side than any current ICOs at least at this stage.  But another issue that will be important for you guys - regulation. AFAIK FINMA dont have the guidance for blockchain based collective investment schemes yet, but judging by the experience of other Swiss FnTech startups you will be facing this problematic quite soon. Will you be self-regulated? Will you limit the number of owners per asset to avoid banking regulation? Those are important questions as regulation risks are present here.   As a minor point - your site is missing terms of use and risk disclaimers.  Hope to hear some answers from you.  Cheers BeReal12            ------------------- Important disclamer: I'm not associated with any past or ongoing ICO's  and expressing my sole and personal opinion. Most of the ICO will fail as they are not mature neither experienced neither professional and in most cases are pure marketing hypes. Thus an independent due diligence has to be done prior taking any supporting/investment decision. Turn on your brain and ask questions.",False

Our exact rollout plan will be part of the whitepaper, released next week. In principle, we will have a strong focus on the mega cities in the world especially in emerging markets. This allows a very focused, lean, but highly scalable rollout plan.  2. We will be regulated under the existing and upcoming FinTech Swiss FINMA licences.  3. The number of tokens per asset will be small primarily to guarantee a privileged experience on that asset. Avoiding regulation is not our philosophy, in fact coming with a 20 years background on how to run a compliant banking business regulation is not a concern at all.  4. Thanks for the hint. We will upload these as soon as possible.",False
