On the Business to Business/enterprise product, manufacturing companies will initiate and invite collaborative savings for their distributors, this will give distributors opportunity to buy products from manufacturer and provide a way for interest free credit for longer period without exposing the credit risk to the manufacturing company. And in the business to business model manufacturing company bear the loss of in case of any distributor defaults, but this wont effect manufacturing companies at all, as per our market research and statistical analysis the defaults wont be more than ~.1% of sales boots.

Please find our comments below in italics:  Why can't you source money from traditional banks or local investors? [Getunion] Sourcing money from the traditional banks will be debt on our books, and paying EMI will take funds out of a growing startup, which will hinder our growth. Hence we are not talking traditional approach.  Sourcing funds by selling tokens is very risky. There have been a series of scams in the past which were extremely sophisticated and elaborate in their sales approach.

This scheme has been a trusted format to support oneself in times of need, it helps as a borrowing and savings instrument, rate of borrowing is determined by the participants themselves, the intermediaries cost is lower when compared to traditional banking, and it uses social capital.  The modus operandi of scheme is simple: Let us assume a collective fund has 4 members, who put in INR 1,000 a month each. This would mean that a collection of INR 4,000 would be made. Thereafter, an auction is conducted where the lowest bid (from a person who is most in need of money that month) is selected. Assuming that the lowest bid is INR 3,800, the balance amount of INR 200 will be equally divided among the other members. This process will continue for 4 months, going by the number of people in the group.  There are a lot of different forms of collective investment scheme used by people all over the world. Majorities of these informal collective investment schemes are based on individual choices. Nevertheless, there are as well broadly distributed mechanisms to save and borrow together or in groups.
