Excerpt from White Paper  Only $500,000 USD will get the company needed funds to commence drilling on two wells, sufficient to generate enough profits and allow the company to open more wells for production.  Obviously, if only $500,000 is raised less shareholder will have their hands in Tomahawk Exploration LLC, that's not to say that we are not allowed to have the ICO opened until we reach a decent goal, but nevertheless, more equity owners less profits spread among the group.   Tomahawk Exploration LLC can make money as low as $20 per bbl , so how can we sit by and let events out of our control dictate our business future. Oil demand is increasing World Wide with the 2,000,000 bbls a day surplus being narrowed every year by a combination of our peak being reached and with China and India continuing their growth. The world will always be full of strife and all we need to do is keep going.  Thankfully the actual price per barrel is approaching $50 and shows no indication of dropping since the US oil reserves are at it's lowest ever, also recent announcement by Trump administration will implement and reinforce restrictions and reductions on importing oil from Venezuela due to recent political events disrupting Venezuela's progress based on a current Dictatorship, as referred to by Donald J. Trump.  We also have received an offer from a prestigious Private Financial firm in New York as follows, if Tomahawkcoin ICO is able to raise a minimum of $1 Mil USD in cryptocurrency value, they will commit $10 Mil USD from their portfolio assuring Tomahawk Exploration LLC success.  Due to aggreements between both parties, we are not allowed to disclose detailed information regarding the firm's name, but as soon as the goal in discussion is met, the company will make such agreements available for public view.  So with all these factors in place the price per barrel is going to move higher, although not good news for consumers, but great news for investors.  Tomahawk should recover net to our interest approx. 80,000 bbls per well. If we use a low figure of $40 per bbl that nets us $3,200,000 per well if oil never goes above $40 per bbl. I predict low $50's in 2018. The Tomahawk wells will cost appox $500,000 each with oil flowing into the tanks.   Using our finding cost of $500,000 and finding 80,000bbls shows we are finding oil for $6.25 per bbl. Producing oil at $6.25 and selling for at least $40 should give us a very healthy profit. I really believe that with a future Steamflood we should get at least 200,000 net bbls per well for a profit of $80,000,000 at $40bbl. A Steamflood would inject steam into the formation and flush a lot more oil out (Up to 300bopd).  I hope this can clarify Tomahawks position on these matters. Remember, oil and it's derivatives (gasoline, diesel, plastics, medicines, fertilizers, many chemicals, lubrications and countless others) will be needed long after our lifetime. We appreciate your interest in Tomahawkcoin and our future. Hopefully together.  So, what are the projected revenues after drilling? The Company expects more than $500,000 USD to be generated by each well per year based on the reserve reports: 10 wells x $500,000 = $5,000,000 a year revenue projection  Our initial plan was to transition from an already Private company to a Public traded one.  But amidst recent news regarding the SEC targeting recently announced ICO's, we decided to best avoid them by staying Private, thus equity owned by our investors would not be subjected to SEC rules and regulations and only state regulations.  The company will also implement a Coin Buy Back program in the future from these exchanges, which remains to be determined based on revenues and profits generated by the company  The business plan provided by the Company is believed to increase the demand for Tomahawkcoin on digital currency exchange markets, such as Bittrex, Poloniex, and others, since ownership equals equity share equivalency, more coins, more voting power and company stake ownership",False

We take no position on the desirability of any particular proposal nor do we have a stake in any outcome. Our primary concern is protecting our users and their tokens.  As we have done in the past when faced with similar circumstances (1), any decision we make will be with the security of users' tokens in mind. We will be disabling deposits and withdrawals of Bitcoin (and all BTC related tokens) any time we deem necessary to ensure that all tokens stored on Poloniex remain safe. The length of any possible downtime is unknown as this is highly dependent on network stability. Our objective will be to bring the wallet back online and enable deposits and withdrawals as soon as we believe it is safe to do so. Trading will be unaffected during these periods.  At this time, we cannot commit to supporting any specific blockchain that may emerge if there is a blockchain split. Even if two viable blockchains emerge, we may or may not support both and will make such a decision only after we are satisfied that we can safely support either blockchain in an enterprise environment. If we decide to support and make available derivative blockchain tokens after a blockchain split, note that if you have your tokens on loan at the time of a split, we cannot distribute the derivative tokens to you, the lender, as you would not possess them. Such loaned tokens can, and often do, leave the platform. (2)  If you don't want to leave the decision of which Bitcoin tokens to support (or recognize as valid) to a 3rd party, you should not keep your tokens on any 3rd party platform. We encourage you to follow our Twitter and Notices board for updates.  - The Poloniex Team",False

On one hand, high risk investors cannot stop buying these unproven coins and tokens which have been shown to be a way to make incredible profits. On the other hand, wary buyers are smart enough to realize many of the projects offer no real substance, and in many cases are relying on an uncertain future for success. Investors in the crypto community have become distrustful of these unproven concepts raising tens of millions of dollars, when only a small portion of those funds are actually required to get started.  I invite you to picture a new professional brand of ICO. One where the costs have already been defined and the goal is to raise only the money needed to begin operations. An ICO where the business plan is available to read before investing and put together by a publicly accessible business team with verifiable credentials.  More importantly, imagine an ICO promising investors the option to receive gift shares in the company tradable over the counter in a lucrative industry within eighteen months. Perhaps ICO in this particular case should stand for Initial Coin Ownership.  Let me introduce you to Tomahawkcoin, and a new category of digital currency investment offering investors transparency, assurance and sincerity.  Tomahawkcoin is the digital currency being offered by Tomahawk Exploration LLC, an oil and gas exploration company registered in Nevada (1) with headquarters in California. The company will raise $5 Million for the ICO, which will be used to drill ten wells in Kern County, California. A complete business plan detailing costs, rates of return and risks involved is available on the Tomahawk website.  Within eighteen months after the completion of the ICO (and potentially sooner), Tomahawkcoin holders will be given the option of receiving gift shares (2) in exchange for their digital currency at a one for one exchange rate. Another option would be to keep your Tomahawkcoins and continue to trade them in the crypto markets.  The expected revenue for each of the ten oil wells based on the company’s investigations is $500,000 (3). This brings the total for all ten wells to $5,000,000 per year, which will then be poured back into the company to further increase the value of its investor’s shares.  The ICO price for Tomahawkcoins, and therefore shares in Tomahawk Exploration LLC, is set at .05 cents each. 100 million Tomahawkcoins will be sold at this price to raise just $5,000,000 to get the ten oil wells running. An additional 100 million coins will be used for marketing, bounties, employee salaries, ownership shares for the Board of Directors, and otherwise running the company, however, no additional superfluous funds will be raised in the ICO, and no further coins will ever be created in the future.  Other Crypto ICO sales in the past, where untold millions of dollars were handed to an often anonymous group with little or no business experience and a vague plan of action, seem tremendously risky in comparison. The few people who will have the opportunity to buy Tomahawkcoins before the limited number are sold will be buying into a transparent operation with potential profits already defined.  Don’t let this one article convince you though. Tomahawk Exploration LLC invites everyone to do their own research first. The company encourages investors to look at the materials already available, such as the Roadmap, Business Plan, Director Profiles and Business Registration. Please stop by the slack channel and ask the Chief Information Officer, Horia Cretan, your questions. All the links you need to help make your decision are below.  Tomahawkcoin is expected to increase in value similar to other recent digital currency ICOs. However, the incredible advantage buying and holding will offer to early investors will be the opportunity to obtain shares in the actual company itself, which is expected to be worth millions in the coming years.

According to the Department of Energy, at of June 30, the SPR had 682 million barrels of crude in it, after more than 10 million barrels were sold over the first five months of the year.  Yet, there is no cause for concern: shale production, according to energy analysts, has created a comfortable cushion against potential shortages, and the U.S. simply does not need to store as much petroleum as it once did.  “You only need 60 days of your net import of crude and products in the emergency stockpiles,” Macquarie Capital analyst Vikas Dwivedi told Bloomberg. “Given the fact that we don’t net import that much any more, we only really need 300 million barrels.”  Daily U.S. oil imports for the week to June 23 averaged some 8 million barrels, and 8.1 million bpd was the average for the last four weeks, according to the Energy Information Administration’s last weekly petroleum data report.  Total oil and product imports stood at 9.83 million bpd. Exports of crude and products averaged 5.6 million. Net crude oil and products imports for the week to June 23 stood at 4.23 million barrels. According to Bloomberg, this compared with a high of 14.4 million barrels daily in November 2005.

Click here to find out more According to the Department of Energy, the SPR was at its highest at the end of December 2009, holding 727 million barrels of crude – equal to the capacity of the four storage sites.  Earlier this year, at the presentation of his draft budget for 2018, President Trump included a proposal for the sale of around half of the SPR, for proceeds estimated at US$16.6 billion over a period of 10 years. If the shale industry continues to pump at a growing rate, a 50-percent reduction in the strategic petroleum reserves over a decade would hardly be felt.  By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com",False

Respectively and historically I am against big oil but in this unique case thanks to University Professor of Geology Mr. David Laurance I do not have a problem with his proven methodologies he developed for extracting natural resources such as oil which are proven to have an extremely low impact on the surrounding environment and the laws that he passed at the State level and beyond in California making 'Fracking' like we see in Wyoming and North Dakota Illegal which he championed. So we truly are living in historic times and participating in an historic project while we usher in this new financial/Energy Economic Era together through Crypto.

And where do you see failure in oil and petroleum exactly, we all drive cars, but not everyone buys coins.  You can keep waiting on Zrcoin and Starta and many others, what they offer is a pipe and a dream, especially Starta.  Starta business plan explained below:  Starta wants to raise money, to fund start up companies (newbies without a name), and then hope they become successful, and then hope they are bought out by other companies, preferably US companies, that maybe are publicly listed on Nasdaq, then maybe when this scenario happens,...if it does,..then maybe they  decide to use the profits to buy back the coin Starta at a higher price of 1o X or 20 X higher then what they sold it at their ICO.  In other words, they are full of Kaka, and these claims could get them in jail really fast.  What's more surprising is that, they really raised $5,000,000 with that story.  Unreal  And about ZrCoin, how much do you guys know about Zirconium and the cost per ton.  The company behind ZrCoin is in Russia, Starta is in Singapore, our company in the US, you guys send value out of the country for no apparent reason.  How can you, the coin holder benefit from a company listed overseas ?  The answer is, you can't because every country has different regulations and laws, if they don't deliver can you sue them and get your investment back  ? No you can't, the claims on their business plan would be enough to get them in jail according to US laws, Red Bull got sued because it claimed It Gives You Wings, false advertisement.  Keep the money home, all you guys do is make people rich in poor countries, ZrCoin business plan is calculated in Rubles not Dollars.  Funny stuff.

The estimated price of $0.05 USD price per Tomahawkcoin is based on the IPO (Initial Public Offering) price expectation of the Company set to start trading on the OTC Market at no less than $0.05, and 200,000,000 shares outstanding. Due to the volatility of market conditions, known fluctuations in capital markets, changes in economic variables, and risk inherent to the energy sector, there is no guarantee as to price and / or timing which is subject to change. There is no guarantee, implied, or otherwise, as far as, the price of Tomahawkcoin is concerned on any currency traded exchange, since the parity of which Tomahawkcoin will trade for, and against, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and / or Waves, have no set price, and no price guarantee in any way or form, due to the constant price volatility of these coins, known to carry their own risk of losing USD value.  The time horizon of 18 months is fundamental to the initial ICO, whereas ICO capital will be used to place Tomahawk Exploration LLC  (The Company) into a profitable company and fund the cost of drilling the 10 wells available.  The bold ICO price objective and confident time horizon goal of 18 months is based on the legitimacy of Tomahawk Exploration LLC, an oil & gas exploration company, managed by David Laurance.   Business details  Tomahawk Exploration LLC proposal https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7BA7703vYuOUllvdncxM1RacGc/view?usp=sharing Tomahawk Exploration LLC decisive factors https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7BA7703vYuOWGhNRzV6RUtUNUU/view?usp=sharing  Only $500,000 USD will get the company needed funds to commence drilling on two wells, sufficient to generate enough profits and allow the company to open more wells for production.  Obviously, if only $500,000 is raised less shareholder will have their hands in Tomahawk Exploration LLC, that's not to say that we are not allowed to have the ICO opened until we reach a decent goal, but nevertheless, more equity owners less profits spread among the group.   Tomahawk Exploration LLC can make money as low as $20 per bbl , so how can we sit by and let events out of our control dictate our business future. Oil demand is increasing World Wide with the 2,000,000 bbls a day surplus being narrowed every year by a combination of our peak being reached and with China and India continuing their growth. The world will always be full of strife and all we need to do is keep going.  Thankfully the actual price per barrel is approaching $50 and shows no indication of dropping since the US oil reserves are at it's lowest ever, also recent announcement by Trump administration will implement and reinforce restrictions and reductions on importing oil from Venezuela due to recent political events disrupting Venezuela's progress based on a current Dictatorship, as referred to by Donald J. Trump.  We also have received an offer from a prestigious Private Financial firm in New York as follows, if Tomahawkcoin ICO is able to raise a minimum of $1 Mil USD in cryptocurrency value, they will commit $10 Mil USD from their portfolio assuring Tomahawk Exploration LLC success.  Due to aggreements between both parties, we are not allowed to disclose detailed information regarding the firm's name, but as soon as the goal in discussion is met, the company will make such agreements available for public view.  So with all these factors in place the price per barrel is going to move higher, although not good news for consumers, but great news for investors.  How will Tomahawk utilize the oil yields?  There are many other Exploration opportunities to look at with the profits generated from this field. If our business is oil then we would naturally continue to grow the company in the oil sector. There are many companies using several ""Steam Flood"" methods in California if the oil is either very shallow (500ft) or the oil is thick and hard to pump. The oil in our field can be easily pumped. In the future, when our initial pressure naturally declines, we can utilize a Steam Flood where steam is injected into several wells to both heat and thin the oil and build up pressure to reinvigorate the production to even more than the initial production rates. It would also greatly increase our ultimate recoverable reserves.  How will Tomahawk sell the crude? When we announce a Discovery there are at least 6 large Oil Brokers knocking at our door trying to get a contract to purchase our oil. They would then pick up oil on site and truck it to refineries or pipelines surrounding Bakersfield. About a 30-50 mile trip. We would get about a $1.50bbl haircut for the Transportation cost.  Let's get into the number factors a little deeper regarding Tomahawk Exploration LLC success.  I will try to make it quick about our project.  We are not ""Fracking"". Fracking is usually for Shale zones which are very brittle and hard to produce from a vertical well. Fracking is when a well is drilled to the Shale Oil zone and redirected at a 90 degree angle for as much as a mile thru the shale zone which may be several hundred feet thick.  Shale has oil and gas trapped in a very hard zone which needs to be cracked or ""Fractured"" to give the oil and gas an avenue to escape thru the cracks formed from the injection of sand and chemicals into the mile long ""leg"" in the Shale.  A well may cost $4,000,000 to $6,000,000 each and payout in less than a year. The 2nd years production would drop by 50% and 50% each year afterwards. Our wells decline only 10% to 15% each year after the first because we are in a very permeable sand formation. Tomahawk should recover net to our interest approx. 80,000 bbls per well. If we use a low figure of $40 per bbl that nets us $3,200,000 per well if oil never goes above $40 per bbl. I predict low $50's in 2018. The Tomahawk wells will cost appox $500,000 each with oil flowing into the tanks.    Using our finding cost of $500,000 and finding 80,000bbls shows we are finding oil for $6.25 per bbl. Producing oil at $6.25 and selling for at least $40 should give us a very healthy profit. I really believe that with a future Steamflood we should get at least 200,000 net bbls per well for a profit of $80,000,000 at $40bbl. A Steamflood would inject steam into the formation and flush a lot more oil out (Up to 300bopd).  I hope this can clarify Tomahawks position on these matters. Remember, oil and it's derivatives (gasoline, diesel, plastics, medicines, fertilizers, many chemicals, lubrications and countless others) will be needed long after our lifetime. We appreciate your interest in Tomahawkcoin and our future. Hopefully together.  So, what are the projected revenues after drilling?  The Company expects more than $500,000 USD to be generated by each well per year based on the reserve reports: 10 wells x $500,000 = $5,000,000 a year revenue projection  Our initial plan was to transition from an already Private company to a Public traded one.  But amidst recent news regarding the SEC targeting recently announced ICO's, we decided to best avoid them by staying Private, thus equity owned by our investors would not be subjected to SEC rules and regulations and only state regulations.  The company will also implement a Coin Buy Back program in the future from these exchanges, which remains to be determined based on revenues and profits generated by the company  The business plan provided by the Company is believed to increase the demand for Tomahawkcoin on digital currency exchange markets, such as Bittrex, Poloniex, and others, since ownership equals equity share equivalency, more coins, more voting power and company stake ownership.  About Kern County California Oil Production in Kern County, California https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/case-study/oil-production-kern-county-california Kern River Oil Field https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn2cmCtdhm4&feature=youtu.be  The Kern River Oil Field in south-central California. Other oil fields are shown in gray.  Kern River Oil Field aerial, 2012. The Kern River Oil Field is a large oil field in Kern County in the San Joaquin Valley of California, north-northeast of Bakersfield in the lower Sierra foothills. Yielding a cumulative production of close to 2 billion barrels (320,000,000 m3) of oil by the end of 2006, it is the third largest oil field in California, after the Midway-Sunset Oil Field and the Wilmington Oil Field, and the fifth largest in the United States.[1] Its estimated remaining reserves, as of the end of 2006, were around 476 million barrels (75,700,000 m3), the second largest in the state. It had 9,183 active wells, the second highest in the state.[2] The principal operator on the field is Chevron Corporation[3]  Geographic setting Kern River Oil Field; view from Panorama Park in Bakersfield, on the blufftop across the river. This is the most densely developed oilfield in California, and the fifth-largest producer (as of 2006) in the US. The Kern River Oil Field covers an area of 10,750 acres (43.5 km2) in a rough oval extending over the low hills north-northeast of Bakersfield, hills which are now almost completely barren except for oil rigs, drilling pads and associated equipment. This area is the densest operational oil development in the state of California: Midway-Sunset, which has more wells, is almost three times as large in surface area, for a lower overall density. Elevations on the Kern River Oil Field range from approximately 400 to 1,000 feet (300 m), rising towards the northeast, and the Kern River flows south of the field, from east to west, from the Sierra Nevada into the city of Bakersfield. The oil field is one of many contiguous oil fields along the eastern edge of the southern San Joaquin Valley, lying between the Kern Front field to the northwest and the Kern Bluff field to the southeast, on the other side of the Kern River. Directly north of the Kern River field is the large Mount Poso Oil Field, entirely in the Sierra foothills, and to the northeast is the Round Mountain Oil Field.  Kern County produces 66% of the oil in California, about 10% of the U.S. oil supply, and approximately 1% of the world's total oil production. That works out to about 560,000 barrels of oil per day, which at $12 to $15 per barrel is something like$2.4 billion to $3.0 billion worth of oil every year.

However I would of tried to point it out in a better way or PM and if I liked the project and clearly seen a lot of zeros I would just fix it myself. As a Hero Member I would think you would be glad to see real people show up here with real companies with past proven track records with a Crypto that is backed by 100 Oil wells needing funding for extraction equipment. These people are real and want to fund their company and share the profits with regular folks. We need to support projects like this that have respected businessmen and real assets behind those tokens if we want Crypto to ever really be mainstream. David Laurance probably looks at your comment and says to himself ""Lord what have I got myself into"" because he now associates 'Hero Members' as people that bounce in the forum and sarcasm as a way to welcome regular folks, take them down a notch, and do them a favor by letting them and the world know that maybe the least important aspect of his project might of been slightly rushed. I hope when you return to this [ANN] Thread that you find a better way of welcoming Mr. Laurance to Crypto than that and if you must sling or chop at the knees either do it privately or use the skills I know you have to do it right, and if you want to make some real money because I know you missed out on Bitcoin and my guess ether also, send me a PM.

The difference between a troll like you and a paid troll that is spreading FUD as a job and for personal lowlife self gain is this.
