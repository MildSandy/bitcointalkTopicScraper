Nilsson Founding researcher, Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science, Stanford University.  starmine.ai  whitepaper v0.88  Customer use cases include: unsupervised machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced pattern recognition, clustering, hidden relationship discovery or visualization for the Financial Markets (Stocks, Cryptocurrencies, Options, ETFs), Life Sciences/Drug Discovery, Entertainment, Automotive, Travel, Energy, Education, Advertising etc. Starmine is a robust and highly scalable platform for constructing, trading and exchanging advanced algorithmically generated on-demand datasets for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) efforts. Datasets remain at the core of most advances in ML and Al. This can also be done with full anonymity using Starmine tokens to execute and transact smart contracts where each dataset or each individual feature column in any dataset can be treated as a tradable asset which is transacted and executed via smart contracts on the blockchain. The primary objective in extending the commercially released platform is to enable anyone or any machine to anonymously assemble unique and highly valued datasets made up of Starmine supercolumns and ‘package’ these datasets with their own algorithms, along with monetary value transacted via smart contracts where Starmine tokens are used. Each supercolumn, entire dataset and complete ‘package’ will have its own value placed on it by its current owner. Once any of these is created, they can be traded, exchanged, bought or sold.",False
