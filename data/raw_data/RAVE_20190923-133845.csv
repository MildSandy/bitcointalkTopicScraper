Quote from: Chibongvdg on January 03, 2018, 11:25:24 AM Can we mine this token?  RAVE is an ethereum based token (ERC-20) and it has a fixed supply, so no mining is needed (or possible).

We will look into lazada as well as other widely used ecommerce platforms for insights on building the crypto marketplace. We are working on solutions for the delivery issue .   Quote from: Patmille on January 03, 2018, 04:04:52 PM yeah i want to know too if token holders will have dividends or this token would be the mode of payment for bought items.  So from the whitepaper, there is a section that explains this:  RAVE tokens are used only when there is a mismatch in seller accepted cryptos and what crypto that the buyer is able to pay with. The value of RAVE tokens partially comes from what is raised in the crowdsale and part of any future seller fees.  That means that as more people use the platform whether they directly use RAVEs or they just complete sales/buy stuff on the marketplace, the base value of the token will increase.",False

RAVELOUS is a crypto-commerce platform intended to make buying and selling items online in exchange for cryptocurrency simple.  Ravelous was made to help people buy and sell goods for crypto so that they can acquire coins without having to divulge personal information to do so.  The ecommerce platform brings the security and trust systems of the darknet markets, but the ease of use and familiarity of the clearnet (regular internet).  By making cryptocurrency more accessible to the average audience, we hope to gain more usage and widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies beyond trading and long term holding.   https://s17.postimg.org/7n9xzyk4f/ravebanner-whatmakesitspecial.png  What Makes It Special?  What Crypto-commerce requires to gather widespread adoption by sellers and buyers is acceptance of many crypto payment types.  Sellers can accept many types of payments from buyers, and withdraw your balance in the token of your choosing, just as you would on an exchange. Buyers who do not have the currency the sellers prefer can exchange their coins for RAVE tokens which used for payment.  The RAVE tokens can also be traded for other coins, and will have a value backed by the crypto-marketplace and the RAVE treasury that will increase over time as the treasury grows in value.  Community Governed Each new cryptocurrency that gets accepted as payment into the marketplace will be voted in by the community. To help this project go in the best direction, we will setup a community governance model to decide seller fees, what to do with development funds and to maintain the treasury.  The goal of the system is to use the latent talent and resources of our community to create a different way to save and invest in cryptocurrency than through traditional fiat methods or exacting gatekeepers.

Any coins undistributed from the crowdsale/airdrop will remain in the treasury for intermediary product transactions.  How the Crowdsale works: During the crowdsale you can buy RAVE for a variable amount of ETH. The earlier someone buys in, the more tokens they receive. When the specified amount of RAVE is sold during the crowdsale, the price for buying RAVE will increase.  We may create some special rewards for crowdfund participants, so we encourage people to participate in the crowdsale.   https://s17.postimg.org/qsd79ow7j/ravebanner-bounties.png Bounties & Contests:  More information on bounties wil  be coming soon!

RAVELOUS is a crypto-commerce platform intended to make buying and selling items online in exchange for cryptocurrency simple. Our Platform is being made to help people buy and sell goods for crypto so that they can acquire coins without having to divulge personal information to do so.   By making cryptocurrency more accessible to the average audience, we hope to gain more usage and widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies beyond trading and long-term holding.        What Makes It Special?  Commerce Without Borders | Full Medium Article The strength of any currency is based on the products and services you can buy with it. At this moment, Cryptocurrency has very few platforms of commerce to trade crypto for products.  Until Widescale services and platforms for crypto are adopted, More money will be sucked out of the Marketcap and swapped for FIAT that is currently more useful to traders lives. Ravelous is working to make getting into as simple as selling stuff you no longer need. This creates liquidity outside of selling direct to fiat methods.  This keeps the coins in circulation, and not collecting into more centralized hands (usually the companies that trade Crypto to Fiat).    Solving Seller Profit Volatility | Medium Article - How Stablecoins Work Ravelous is solving the problem of profit stability by backing our own tokens at a base value. We are able to do this, buy creating a treasury system that takes a percentage of seller fees, and uses them to back the underlying value of each token.  You can read more about our reserve/treasury system and what role rave tokens play in our marketplace in our whitepaper.    Buy & Sell With Many Types of Crypto | Full Medium Article Ravelous uses the exchange system as a layer within our commerce platform. This gives us the flexibility to accept many types of currencies, and help users to sell their items around the home for cryptocurrency.  The RAVE tokens can also be traded for other coins, and will have a value backed by the crypto-marketplace and the RAVE treasury that will increase over time as the treasury grows in value.    Community Governed Each new cryptocurrency that gets accepted as payment into the marketplace will be voted in by the community. To help this project go in the best direction, we will setup a community governance model to decide seller fees, what to do with development funds and to maintain the treasury.  The goal of the system is to use the latent talent and resources of our community to create a different way to save and invest in cryptocurrency than through traditional fiat methods or exacting gatekeepers.     Token Information  Etherscan Smart Contract Info: https://etherscan.io/token/0x6a09e1b7cc5cb52ffdfc585a8df51ced7063915c  Coin Type: ERC20 Token (Compatible with Myetherwallet, Metamask,etc.) Token Name: RAVE Token Supply: 100 MILLION COINS (MAX/TOTAL SUPPLY)   Airdrop Ended: January 31st | Over 9400 Users Received RAVE tokens! Bounty Ended: February 28th Crowdsale/ICO {Ongoing}: From February 7th to March 7th  Token Crowdsale | Join Crowdsale  Up to 50 million tokens will be used for the crowdsale, and a separate allotment will be used for the airdrop and bounties.  Any coins undistributed from the crowdsale/airdrop will remain in the treasury for intermediary product transactions.  How the Crowdsale works: During the crowdsale you can buy RAVE for a variable amount of ETH. The earlier someone buys in, the more token bonus they receive. When the specified amount of RAVE is sold during the crowdsale, the price for buying RAVE will increase.  We may create some special rewards for crowdfund participants, so we encourage people to participate in the crowdsale.        We are a small team of developers and crypto-enthusiasts from the bitcointalk community that have come together to build this resource. You can meet us in the discord/telegram where we will be the most active.

We are not affiliated with existing ecommerce platforms as we are working to create a commerce solution solely for cryptocurrency. It can be used in a way similar to what you might see on ebay, etsy or amazon where sellers can set up shops and sell goods in exchange for crypto.  Quote from: SGToken on January 02, 2018, 01:12:54 AM Good idea to use darknet. To clarify, we want to bring the ease and protection that darknet provided while avoiding the legal troubles by permitting only legal goods like you would see available on most platforms. This is so that cryptomarkets can succeed without being stigmatized with fear and concern about what's being sold.  Quote from: SGToken on January 02, 2018, 01:12:54 AM But I have to wonder the competency of the team to achieve the goal. Keep a tab on the project and let our progress over time help you decide if you want to be apart.",False
