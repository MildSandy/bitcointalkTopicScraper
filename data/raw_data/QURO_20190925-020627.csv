Official Website | Whitepaper Facebook | Twitter | Telegram Introduction Qurito is a platform for people to discover, gain and share their ideas and knowledge. The primary goal of Qurito is to deliver reliable and valuable content that is free of promotional spam or other various forms of unwanted content. As a result, the users of the platform can grow and explore in an effective and efficient manner. Qurito differs from other pre-existing knowledgebase platforms in a unique way through an incentive program. Qurito incorporates a rewarding system, which rewards users for their contributions within the platform. This reward system will subsequently bring out more qualitative and quantitative content that will be shared on the platform.  Mission & Vision Creating a platform for curious minds that are willing to share knowledge, ideas and views in a way that is unlike any other preexisting platform. Qurito will be a common platform for people around the globe to share their knowledge, experiences and ideas while also being rewarded for the same. The aim is to create a globalized platform where being curious and helpful can be rewarding.  Pillars of Qurito Q&A : Reinventing Q&A. Introducing a platform that yields rewards by Q&A based on Analytics. Qurito enhances the way people share knowledge, views and ideas. Qurito aims to bring volume of qualitative content over the platform via reward system. ""Q&A will never be the same again."" Polls : Redefining Polls. Qurito Polls enable efficient recording of public opinions and to get better perspective of people's views. Polls also have the rewarding system similar to Q&A but it accounts hosting and participation parameters. ""Opinions much broader."" Forums : Revolutionising Public Forums. Qurito Forums open a much broader way to create and participate in Forums with a twist. Forums incorporate rewards based on analytics and activities. Amazing User Interfaces and Experiences are the driving forces of the platform. ""Discussions more rich.""  Why the need of Qurito? On many existing platforms, there is a lack of quality content shared by people in the form of Q/A (Question and Answers), Polls and Forums. These platforms also lack structure, making it nearly impossible to quickly index and search for specific content. Lastly, when using these platforms, you never know how reliable the information is, especially because there is no incentive for giving reliable and quality feedback.    How Qurito Solves that? Qurito aims to solve these problems by bringing in quality content by attracting more knowledgeable, idealistic, passionate and curious people to the platform. Qurito will also reward users for their contributions to the platform as gratitude for their service, which directly increases the volume of qualitative content. Users of the platform will also have a unique rating for how reliable their profile is which will solve the ongoing issue of accountability that other platforms lack. Maintaining easily index able content using the latest technologies will also enhance the overall user experience within the platform.   The QURO Token and QURITO's: QURO tokens will be the driving force of the platform. QURITO is the 100th fraction of a QURO, which will be used platform wide. It will be used in various platform wide activities. QURITO’s will be an integral part of major operations on the platform. QURO tokens can be deposited in the main wallet and can be changed for QURITO’s and vice versa. The derivation of QURITO virtual token is to ensure scalability, security and stability in the platform. QURITO however has no face value outside the platform irrespectively it’s changed back to QURO’s.  Rewarding System:  QURITO’s can be earned in two prominent ways, User Activity on: -Questions & Answers(Questions Answers, Likes, Dislikes, Comments, Favourites Answers Likes, Dislikes, Favourites), -Polls(Participating & Hosting), -Forums(Create & Participate) Web Analytics based on Social Media and Search Engine Traffic  Spending: A User can spend QURITO tokens on the platform to Feature a Question in search results or homepage. Although, posting a Question is Free; fast and better answers can be expected by featuring it. Polls can also be sponsored and featured for better and quick public responses. The user who has posted the Question can also feature a single answer from the numerous answers. In that case, the answerer earns QURITO’s and is debited from the same Question’s QURITO earnings. More ways of spending QURITO over the platform are still being thought of and will be added eventually.  Earning and Spending Qurito's on the platform is discussed in Whitepaper Section 2.3 in Details.  The Twist: We call it the ""Claim"". A user can withdraw the QURITO tokens from the main account balance anytime. The ONLY exception is that each singular Question or Answer or Poll that has generated QURITO’s over time, a “claim” for the same can only be initiated once. Once a “Claim” has been initiated from a posted Question or Answer or Poll, it no longer generates QURITO’s in future and the claimant’s main account is credited with the QURITO’s earned till date. Other Questions/Answers/Polls remain unaffected. Suppose a user had posted a Question 1 year ago. Presently, the Question has generated 600 QURITOS over that course. If the user initiates a “Claim” on that Question, the generated 600 QURITOS are transferred to the main wallet account and the Question no longer generates QURITO’s further. A Question continues to generate QURITO’s  until and unless a “Claim” on the same has been initiated. The same rules will apply for Polls, Answers and all the planned & unplanned forthcoming features.  QURO’s from QURITO Balance (and vice versa): All QURITO’s claimed will be stored in the main account balance. The QURITO’s can be changed for QURO’s anytime but a minimum 100 QURITO balance is mandatory for processing and incorporates a 1% fee. Likewise, a user can add QURO’s to the account and change them to QURITO’s as per the conversion discussed in the whitepaper.  IMPORTANT: Please note that a “Claim” doesn’t initiate the removal of the Question/Answer/Poll from the Portal. It just exempts the entity from further earnings. QURITO calculations are just for understanding and have no relation with actual calculations. The exact parameters are still being researched and are not decided yet. The parameters and the QURITO to QURO conversion fees are subject to minor change in the platform in the future if required.
