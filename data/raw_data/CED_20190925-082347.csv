This is the largest increase we’ve seen in a while and hints towards a possible end to an almost two year bear market. While it’s impossible to say for sure what lies ahead, there are a few ways to educate yourself about an assets possible upcoming price movement.  Technical Analysis  Technical analysis can be best explained as a method of price discovery that takes a look at statistical trends in data. This can be anything from an assets trading volume to its weekly highs and lows.  A majority of the time, you’ll see this data displayed on a chart or graph making it easier to read. Tradingview is one of the most popular technical analysis websites and has historical charts for nearly every cryptocurrency.  Fundamental Analysis  Fundamental analysis is the other popular method of price discovery and looks at quantifiable measures of use. In cryptocurrency, some interesting examples of fundamental analysis would be a google keywords search volume or the sum of all transactions on a cryptocurrency network.  In Bitcoin’s case, the number of transactions per block is reaching record levels. This is a great sign, as it shows that more and more people are finding uses for the Bitcoin network, hinting that the value of the network may or may not be more valuable than it’s currently priced at.  So… Which Type Analysis is More Useful?  As you might expect, a combination of both types of analysis are vital to trading and investing successfully. Looking at charts are a great way to learn from the past and recognize patterns. However, at the end of the day, a project that is demanded and used heavily will always win out in the long run. This is exactly what CEDEX is attempting to build with our online trading arena and upcoming diamond ETF.  Which method of analysis do you use more often? Let us know in the comments below.  https://www.reddit.com/user/Cedexofficial/comments/be5n8b/fundamental_and_technical_analysis/",False

We are currently in the process of getting CEDEX listed on several exchanges, within a number of different jurisdictions. Listing on these exchanges will be gradually implemented over the upcoming months, probably beginning in June.  As for the size of the exchanges we aim to work with - we are carefully trying to strike a balance between different elements which we believe to be essential to the success of Cedex.  We don’t want the exchange to be too small on the one hand, but at the same time, we are trying to get into exchanges that will cater to our community’s needs properly, offer a variety of coins, be open to our investors who hail from many countries and allow the coin to grow as our project evolves. Additional considerations include the offered features and technology.  We should have news about the first exchanges within the next few weeks, so please have a little patience and we promise to make it worth your while.  https://business.facebook.com/cedexEN/photos/a.338989439907485.1073741828.329418980864531/422301631576265/?type=3&theater",False

(**Point to remember !!!**)   Let's be honest - your ICO event isn't doing well : you have only managed to sell just over 1 million tokens in roughly 2 weeks. I will be generous in assuming maybe another 3 to 4 million in the last 2 weeks will be sold (I'm sure you will have further bonuses during the last few days ) - so let's make it a round 30 million that will be sold.  Now here's the worrisome part: 50million - 30 million = 20 million tokens will be destroyed (more or less) !!! Then to add to this, there are 50 million still stashed in your reserves which weren't available for purchase - what are your plans for this ?? Then again come to think of it - this is a rhetorical question - you are going to dump them on the exchanges right so you can make a nice profit!!!  This leads us back to the point I made earlier regarding a softcap - and now illustrating the importance of one further. You don't have one purely because you are playing it safe: if you don't reach it - you will have to return the funds collected, and that way you won't be able to ""cash out"" the 50 million tokens stashed.

This is because the value of a diamond depends on more than just the number of carats. Several other characteristics come into play when valuing a diamond.  However, up till now, there hasn’t been a reliable method to assess the fair value of a diamond without getting it subjectively appraised by a diamond dealer – who may not have your best interests at heart.  In addition, after purchasing a diamond at retail price, it is nearly impossible to later turn around and resell it for its full market value due to a lack of a standardized diamond-reselling platform.  These inefficiencies in liquidity, transparency, and standardization have caused diamonds to be shunned as a traditional asset class, and therefore, the average person has not been able to trade them like other commodities (like your gold jewelry, for example).  Fortunately, with new advancements in financial technology led by CEDEX, this extremely lucrative and stable market has been made accessible to everyone.  https://www.coinspeaker.com/2018/01/15/quick-start-guide-buying-selling-diamonds-cedex-exchange/",False

With the rapid growth of cryptocurrencies around the world, the main challenge is deciding where to invest.  CEDEX is set to answer that question when it launches its new and revolutionary Blockchain-based diamond exchange beginning with an ICO Token Pre-sale of its CEDEX Coin on the 16th March 2018. Due to unprecedented interest, the pre-sale amount of tokens has increased to 50% of the total. The aim of turning the existing diamond industry into the next asset class for investors will then be well underway.  Up to this point, diamond exchanges have functioned on a business to business (B2B) basis, leaving the public with little way to get involved. CEDEX aims to bring the traditional diamond industry into the world of innovative financial markets, thus enabling a transparent and safe way for the public to invest in diamonds as they would any other financial asset.  In De Beers’s Diamond Insight Report carried out in 2016, they attribute 95% of global diamond trade to consumer retail. This outlines the present gap in the market for investment in diamonds that CEDEX is aiming to capitalize on.  The lack of financial investment in the diamond market up until this point can be attributed to a number of challenges that the revolutionary CEDEX Exchange will overcome.  https://bitcoinist.com/upcoming-ico-cedex-coin/",False

We have some exciting news to begin 2018! As a result of high demand, new opportunities and regulatory developments, our pre-sale will be increased from 20% of total tokens offered to 50% and will be rescheduled. The new token pre-sale date is now: Friday March 16th, 2018 at 19:00 GMT.  There has been an extremely high level of interest in the CEDEX Coin on the token sale whitelist, and it has received substantial SAFT contributions, indicating that a 20% token pre-sale would likely fall well short of meeting the total demand. This has lead us to increase the sale amount to 50%, presenting a new opportunity for public investors, as 25,000,000 CEDEX Coins out of the 50,000,000 total publicly offered tokens will be available in the pre-sale. The remaining CEDEX coins will be made available through the public token sale.  Another significant benefit of the date change is that it allows for the Japanese market to participate in the token pre-sale. The Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) has recently decreed that tokens be registered on a Japanese regulated exchange prior to a token sale. Japan has long been a leader in cryptocurrency adoption and investment and represents a major potential market for CEDEX. As such, we felt obligated to our partners and participants to reschedule the pre-sale in order to accommodate the Japanese market. The extra time will be used to try and complete the regulation process and allow our Japanese contributors to participate in the token sale.

CEDEX was founded by an innovative team of specialists across many disciplines, including technology, finance and diamond trading.

In fact, over 95% of the global diamond trade is consumer retail-based, with investment largely overlooked. There have been many obstacles in the way of public trading of diamonds, namely: -Differing individual values of each diamond. Much like a fingerprint, each diamond has unique characteristics making bulk pricing impossible. – Current diamond exchanges are business to business (B2B), purposely excluding the public. – There has been no platform made available to the public with enough liquidity to sell diamond assets at a reasonable price.  A recent advancement in the CEDEX development has been the powerful partnership formed with IDEX (International Diamond Exchange), the world’s premier online diamond exchange. () No other online diamond exchange has both the wealth of experience and widespread acceptance of the industry. IDEX boasts over 7000 professional diamond traders as regular users and an enormous supply chain inventory. Furthermore, they have set the industry standards in regard to pricing of diamonds. Founder and Chairman of IDEX online, Ehub Cohen commented: “We believe that the diamond industry stands to gain by connecting with CEDEX B2C offerings, vision and trading models’”. Methodological advice, together with inventory and diamond suppliers’ data will be shared, ensuring liquidity in the CEDEX market from the first day of trading.  For the first time, CEDEX will empower the public and enable them to invest safely and transparently in diamonds. With a precise valuation of the assets in place, no previous experience in diamond trading is even needed. Furthermore, the investment potential is clearly evident:  Already the global demand for diamonds is predicted to outstrip the supply by over 40 million carats by the year 2022. A whole new influx of investors will be able to trade in diamonds transparently with CEDEX which should ensure the price of diamonds remains on an upward trajectory. The emerging middle-class markets in both India and China will continue to drive demand. The proprietary technology behind CEDEX is a self-learning algorithm called DEX which is designed to combine both the diamond trading and crypto-financial markets. The primary functions of DEX include the Gemmological composition of each diamond listed on CEDEX, together with global inventory data and the financial indices of the Diamond Market.  DEX’s artificial neural network technology makes full use of all given diamond data. A beta version of DEX can be found on their website – here you can even get an immediate theoretical price for any GIA Certified diamond. DEX is able to rank diamonds according to investment value, which will be an invaluable tool for new traders.  The actual process of either purchasing or liquidating diamond assets will be a user-friendly one with CEDEX. The initial languages supported will be English, Russian and Japanese. For an individual or diamond dealer wishing to sell their diamond assets, the first step is to create a smart contract. This is done using the simple CEDEX tokenization onboarding process. The sale can be of one diamond, a diamond bundle or a shared investment of diamond assets. Only GIA (Gemmological Institute of America) certified diamonds are permitted to be traded on CEDEX, thereby ensuring the valuation is correct. After an online valuation, the diamonds are physically compared to their GIA certificate, then validated and stored. All diamonds are kept safely by a custodian. After the approval process, a Diamond Token is generated using blockchain technology and the owner’s wallet is credited with the token. The seller can then either list his diamond token on CEDEX or sell to another user directly. A purchaser of diamonds will need to stock their wallet with enough CEDEX Coins to purchase their diamond of choice. Following purchase, the assets can be delivered or stored for them if they wish to trade further. There are nominal charges for listing a diamond and a small transaction fee per trade. Only CEDEX Coins can be used to purchase the diamonds on offer.  The CEDEX Coin will be an ERC-20 compatible coin, which will be traded over the public Ethereum network. The CEDEX Coin will be listed on all major exchanges and transferable to any currencies listed on them (both crypto and fiat). CEDEX Coins can be stored in any ERC-20 compatible wallet, however, it is recommended they be stored in an offline cold storage solution. Pre-sale of the CEDEX Coin begins on Friday, 12th January at 19:00 GMT. The minimum purchase is 1 coin (valued at 1ETH), while there is no maximum amount. Users will be able to buy CEDEX Coins with Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ether and many fiat currencies. Pre-sale registration is available on www.cedex.com. The amount of CEDEX Coins is limited to 100 million tokens of which half will be offered. Any offered tokens which are unsold will be destroyed.  With the support of both a publicly traded company and a premier diamond exchange, CEDEX is bound to hit the ground running. Not only is CEDEX an exciting prospect for those looking to trade in diamonds as an asset, but the CEDEX Coin itself may become a lucrative investment.  A solid foundation and tangible product are what so many Initial Coin offerings are lacking, but in the case of CEDEX, these are its strongest selling points.  https://urbancrypto.com/press-release-cedex-revolutionary-global-diamond-exchange-blockchain/",False

In addition to the underlying distributed ledger, Ethereum incorporates Turing-complete programming languages on the protocol-layer to realize smart contract capabilities. Smart contracts are, “orchestration and choreography protocols that facilitate, verify and enact with computing means a negotiated agreement between consenting parties”. The latter establish binding agreements and deploy applications using such smart contracts to enable certain services and functionalities, e.g., a P2P-trading platform.  Quote from: MkrKing on December 29, 2017, 11:17:45 AM Can you tell us how the value of diamonds will be estimated with the help of tokenization?  The DEX values the diamonds, the Dtokens that represent diamonds hold the information about the GIA certificate this information is fed into the Dex and the price is calculated, to put it simply. It's a lot more complicated in the long version, of course.  Quote from: californybit on December 29, 2017, 11:21:28 AM Hello! Can you adduce a couple of arguments in favor of the fact that diamonds will be a new asset in the market?  Diamonds are already bought and sold, but the current system is more B2B, and at the personal level very in favor of the buyer only. The Cedex system makes diamonds fungible, which changes everything as far as it being a true asset in the market.  Quote from: shara on December 29, 2017, 11:41:44 AM Have a nice day, all of you.

If so then there will be a huge demand for the coins in the market and these people have conducted their very long run for promoting the campaign in order to get awareness about the project.  The only way to pay for diamonds or services is with the Cedex coin, that is correct.  Quote from: romfish on December 25, 2017, 10:14:54 AM Greetings. I do not quite understand what ""short sales"" on the platform are like. I just already faced this concept, but only in the securities market. How this will be realized here, I will not even make up my mind.  Short selling is the well-established practice of selling securities without owning them. This strategy is motivated by the belief that the price of a security will drop, allowing it to be bought back a lower price to generate a profit. In such a case, traders earn the price difference of the security minus the borrowing cost.  More info in whitepaper, section 5.3 - https://cedex.com/img/Whitepaper.pdf   Quote from: MkrKing on December 25, 2017, 10:22:24 AM Hello! Can anybody explain in detail, by what principle will the baskets be traded on the platform?  Quote Three simple steps to upload a diamond/s and create a Diamond-Smart Contract 1) Enter the GIA certificate (or certificates if loading a diamond basket) 2) Choose how many smart contracts to create (one for single stone sales, multiple for shared investment or diamond basket) 3) List the diamond on CEDEX or sell peer-to-peer. Order a pick-up.  Quote Mapped onto the CEDEX system, a diamond holder will be able to upload a list of GIA certificates [34] to trade multiple diamonds as one basket. The CEDEX system creates multiple Diamond-Smart Contracts that each represent a partial ownership of the basket. This novel function is anticipated to evolve over time to complex financial products backed by diamonds, such as short ETFs, leveraged ETFs, single category ETF baskets, multi-category ETF baskets, rear and high value ETF baskets and more  From sections 3.1 and 5.2 in the whitepaper here: https://cedex.com/img/Whitepaper.pdf   Quote from: californybit on December 25, 2017, 10:27:41 AM Hello. I have read that the loans will be issued by the platform in case the user has the selected diamond tokens. What are selected diamond tokens and how they can be obtained?   Traders will be able to use their portfolios as collateral to receive CEDEX Coin loans. Selected diamond tokens just refer to the CEDEX token. The diamonds held by the custodian on behalf of traders will be able to serve as collateral for providing loans.",False

The DEX, our proprietary machine-learning algorithm, has been created to bring transparency and coherency to the diamond financial market. The DEX comprises three main elements: the gem composite, which represents a diamond’s gemological perfection; the parallel composite indicating the rarity of a diamond category and the indices composite, giving potential traders market directions for the diamond industry. Diamonds are onboarded to CEDEX and classified by categories. The DEX has been designed to incorporate artificial neural network technology using all available diamond data.  After a set value of a diamond has been determined, a diamond token is created.  All this is is a digital representation of that diamond on the Cedex platform.  Cedex Coin: The CEDEX Coin will be the only means of payment used on the CEDEX exchange. The CEDEX Exchange will be powered by the CEDEX Coin. This ERC-20-compatible token will be traded over the public Ethereum blockchain and will allow users to purchase diamonds on CEDEX, transforming their assets into diamonds. Use of the CEDEX Coin will be driven by trading volumes generated on the CEDEX Exchange and the demand of the diamond ecosystem. The CEDEX Coin will be listed on major exchanges (to be announced) and will be transferable to other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.",False

No one has experience with a certified blockchain diamond exchange yet, we intend to be the first. However, the Cedex team does have extensive Diamond industry knowledge and experience. CEDEX wants to engineer a ground-breaking change – enabling people to liquidate and invest in diamonds like any other financial asset, in a transparent and secure way. Volatility is not just an issue in crypto, it's in global market fiat as well. Certainly it's been a considerable challenge to establish fungibility for diamonds and allow uniform trading. The CEDEX platform solves this problem by applying the DEX algorithm and creating a smart-contract Token that represents a gemologically validated asset. It is then possible to apply innovative trading mechanisms employing blockchain-based Tokens, such as category trading, short selling or ETF trading, to the diamond industry. We stress that these mechanisms are not a complete set. In the future, more diamond-trading mechanisms will be developed with blockchain-based tokenization of diamonds being the technological enabler.",False

Please direct all questions to cedex.community here on the forums.  Read Whitepaper        About Cedex CEDEX is the First Certified Blockchain Based Diamond Exchange  CEDEX.com is a global exchange that focuses on bridging the gap between the traditional diamond industry and the innovative financial markets. With its extensive industry knowledge, CEDEX wants to engineer a ground-breaking change – enabling people to liquidate and invest in diamonds like any other financial asset, in a transparent and secure way.  The CEDEX exchange enables anyone to invest in individual diamonds, shares of a high- value stone or shares in a basket of diamonds (ETF). Investors, buyers and sellers have full confidense because the diamond value is transparent, using the DEX, our machine learning algorithm and blockchain technology that rates a diamond’s asking price; liquid because it creates a two- sided market by enhancing both the supply and demand, and fungible because CEDEX creates a unique benchmark value, rate and contract for every stone.    The Technology DEX – The Intelligence Behind CEDEX  DEX, our proprietary machine-learning algorithm has been created to bring transparency and coherency to the diamond financial market. The DEX comprises three main elements: gemological composition of individual diamonds listed on CEDEX, diamond market financial indices and global inventory analysis. Diamonds are onboarded to CEDEX and classified by categories. The DEX has been designed to incorporate artificial neural network technology using all available diamond data.  Try DEX for yourself!  See how easy, open and transparent it is to invest or trade in diamonds through CEDEX. Our DEX Beta version will give you a theoretical price for your diamond and rate it by its relative market value on the spot! (for round carat stones 0.3, 0.5 and 1.0 carats. Once the DEX is fully developed it will be able to provide all type/size diamonds)    CEDEX Coin – Powering CEDEX Exchange  The CEDEX Coin is an ERC-20-compatible token traded over the public Ethereum blockchain. It will enable our participants to purchase diamonds on the CEDEX, transforming their assets into diamonds. Use of the CEDEX Coin will be driven by trading volumes generated on the CEDEX.com exchange and the demand of the diamond ecosystem. The CEDEX Coin will be listed on all major exchanges and will be transferable to other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.  The CEDEX Coin will be the only means of payment used on the CEDEX exchange. The CEDEX Coin amount is limited and coins offered on the sale that will not be bought will be burned.  Roadmap CEDEX has a seven-stage roadmap summarized below.       The Team     Advisory Board      CEDEX COIN TOKEN OFFERING  The pre-sale offering will be conducted over a 10-day period beginning on March 16th, 2018 at 10:00 GMT. The main-sale start date will be dictated by the completion of the pre-sale. If the pre-sale is completed within 24, hours main-sale will open at 10:00 GMT on March 17th, 2018. If the pre-sale is not completed within 24 hours the main sale will commence at 10:00 GMT on April 13th, 2018. In either event the main sale will last 28 days or until the maximum cap is reached.  - The CEDEX project will issue a maximum of, 100,000,000 CEDEX Coins. Due to the high volatility of ETH/USD rate CEDEX will cap the dollar value that will be sold throughout the Token-Sale to a maximum of USD $40 million. According to this adjustment the value of 1 CEDEX Coin will not exceed $0.8 - The public token sale will offer 50,000,000 CEDEX Coins. Currently, the CEDEX Coins are to be sold for 100,000 ETH. - Up to 25,000,000 of the coins will be sold in the pre-sale and the remainder in the sale. - All of the token supply will be created during the token sale and distributed once it is completed. Any tokens offered for sale to the public and not sold will be destroyed. - As the Hard Cap for the Token-Sale will be published in ETH, prior to the Token-Sale, on March 14, 2018 08:00 GMT CEDEX will be locking and publishing the final ETH amount to be sold in the Token-sale  Users will be able to purchase CEDEX Coin in Ether, Bitcoin and fiat currencies according to the available rates in the market. A portion of the supply will be pre-allocated to the CEDEX founders and team members in the vesting schedule listed below. The company will hold 15% of the CEDEX Coin supply for future development and marketing expansion. This holding will also be used for purchasing additional diamonds in order to expand the financial offering of the CEDEX project.    Participants in the pre-sale and sale will receive special bonuses as indicated below: - Pre-sale up to 25% of total CEDEX Coin – 0.3 CEDEX Coin for each CEDEX Coin purchased. - First day of sale up to 25% of total CEDEX Coin – 0.15 CEDEX Coin for each CEDEX Coin purchased (ending at 24:00 GMT). - Further information and updates will be posted ahead of time on cedex.com.  USE OF FUNDS The net proceeds collected in the token sale will be used as follows: - Up to 20% for finalizing the development of the DEX, Diamond-Token smart contracts and the exchange as described in the milestone section in Appendix C below. - Up to 45% for marketing, business development and sales purposes. Most of the funds will be used for marketing the exchange in different jurisdictions. This will include online and offline marketing activities, signing partnership relations with various business partners and signing agreements with potential partners from the diamond industry.   - Up to 20% for regulation, licenses, legal and operational purposes. - Up to 15% for working capital.  The expected breakdown may be altered based on the Token Sale outcome and project progresses.    EXECUTION & BUSINESS ROAD MAP  The CEDEX project was launched at the beginning of 2017. The CEDEX team has already achieved extensive business and technological milestones, as illustrated in Fig. 10.  On October 2017 Tech Financials announced the project to the public. AIM Announcement October 23,2018 Below we have detailed the four milestones that are the building blocks of the CEDEX project.",False
