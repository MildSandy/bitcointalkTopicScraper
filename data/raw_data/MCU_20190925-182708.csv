As has already been said to some individually, the bounty hunters are highly valued and we thank you, in front of everyone, for your contributions to the project. We would like you to keep working with us and we're sorry that you have had to keep waiting for news on this round of token distribution. We are pleased to announce that we do not require bounty hunters to go through the KYC process. We had never intended that you should, but we had to ensure we were fully legally compliant, which is particularly important for the long term token holders. We can now offer you two options for receiving your MCU tokens. Since the MCU value will depend on the value of medical data in the MediChain system, we aim to push the token price up to several dollars once we start processing data. Until then, we are of course keen to do what we can to keep token prices strong on an unstable but largely falling market. We have carried out mathematical modelling on the effect of introducing data into the system, the effect of changes in the crypto market and the effect of releasing bounty tokens into the market. It's expected that some bounty hunters will 'dump' their tokens at a low price on P2P exchanges. Although this could be considered a negative effect for initial token prices, it is very much in the interests of long term token buyers, who will be able to buy up MCUs at low price now and hold them until the token value is pushed up by the data coming in to the system. The effect of the data, and the way MediChain creates data of much greater value from it, overrides initial token prices, so this creates a golden opportunity for those who wish to buy and hold MCUs for the future, whether at small or large scale. We can therefore offer the following two options for bounty hunter token distribution:  1) You receive your tokens immediately the bounty managers can distribute them (and we aim to distribute to bounty mangers within a week from now) or 2) You receive them in 6 months time with a 50% bonus.  We will be asking the bounty program managers to ask you which of these two options you prefer.  We will be making a further announcement in the near future about our exchange listing plans.",False

We share a similar vision with other projects, but we will be approaching the problem with finer attention to research, issues with systems currently in place around the world, and blockchain integration.  From an architectural standpoint, we don't feel blockchain alone is able to scale for the masses. So instead of storing all the medical data in the blockchain, like other projects do, we created a hybrid of blockchain and offchain data storage. The blockchain stores pointers to the data. The data itself gets stored in the cloud and is only accessible by the cryptographic keys. This results in faster speeds, while still having the privacy and security of the blockchain.
