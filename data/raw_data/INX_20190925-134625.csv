We have successfully implemented a growth strategy for each business and since the start of 2018 they don't require our day-to-day input.  Our crowdfunding model is of course a different model, where for investments we list we will not take a managerial role in each business, and we will not have ownership. That simply wouldn't be scaleable, and since deal flow is important for token price, scaleability is our focus alongside quality of investments available.  We will apply our experience and knowledge of what makes good investable businesses to select businesses for listing on the platform, and we'll start to announce the first few as the ICO progresses.  Here's an article where we talk about our relevant experience within the board: https://medium.com/investxltd/investx-board-experience-in-sme-businesses-and-software-platform-development-who-we-are-c417b336dd89.

Thank you for the belief you have shown in us.

The Investx Platform will revolutionise the access and cost of investing, making it affordable and rewarding, allowing investors to support and share in the success of businesses they believe in. It will provide access to shareholdings at a reduced price for investors because of the value of its use and the cost efficiencies it creates.   Our Key Blockchain Innovations  Real world adoption of blockchain technology: We expect over 500 SME companies to transact investments on the Investx Platform in the first two years, thanks to our extensive UK SME connections, our easy to use platform and our blockchain expert team. Currency design: A payment token backed by a fiat liquidity reserve and reduced transaction costs. The Investx token (INX) ecosystem is designed to expand and contract based on supply and demand. Fundraise innovation: Digital representation of investments in businesses is the next disruption in financial technology, and Investx will use blockchain technology to open a brand new market for investments in SME businesses. Investor community: Crypto investors will be able to invest in shares in privately held companies and then later sell these shares without using fiat currencies - a new way to help the crypto world build a diversified portfolio.    Our Key Crowdfunding Innovations  Crowdfunding using security tokens: Powered by the Ethereum blockchain using security tokens for automated legal contract execution, fundraising, share registry, dividend and exit payments. A new currency for investments: INX used as the preferred payment currency on the platform. New asset class: Equity crowdfunding targeted at SME businesses with proven financial track records, not just start-ups. A wide range of deal types available, from minority investments and Management Buyouts (MBOs), through to full shareholder exits. Secondary share market: Investx intends to develop a secondary market to provide additional liquidity for the security tokens created on our platform. Global investor reach: Allows SMEs to raise funds they can’t currently access, and allow global investors entry to growing UK businesses they can’t invest in at present.    Why does the Investx Platform use the INX token?  INX tokens are designed to power the Investx platform, and by using blockchain technology the platform offers the following advantages over traditional crowdfunding:  The use of INX tokens allows our dynamic currency supply model to be implemented, transacting according to deal funding, dividends and company sale pay-outs, with controlled authorisations for minting and burning of tokens. INX will be used to purchase shares during a fundraise using smart contracts which will execute the necessary legal processes with total autonomy and reliability. INX will use the Ethereum public blockchain which is inherently self-administering, secure and scalable. The use of INX tokens allows Investx to transact a high volume of deals with speed and costs traditional crowdfunders cannot achieve. Having INX tokens already distributed and marketed creates an engaged global investor pool primed to commit to investment opportunities and long term engagement.    Why does the Investx Platform issue security tokens?  Investx-issued security tokens provide a digital record of the legal share ownership recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, thereby providing the following advantages over other traditional solutions:  A real-time up to date accurate ledger of every company’s shareholders will be maintained without reliance on manual reporting or trust in central software. It provides an autonomous self-governing mechanism to pay dividends and exit proceeds directly to investors. We will design and deploy security tokens for each completed fundraise, which will be tradeable according to ERC-20 protocols allowing investor-to-investor transfers. Once we have received the necessary permission to operate our own secondaries market, the platform will enable fully regulatory compliant autonomous investor-to-investor share exchanges with deeper liquidity - just like a stock exchange.  See our INX token currency paper which details its design, tokenomics and interaction within the phases of the ecosystem, enabling our token purchased at ICO to retain real world purchasing power despite token price increase over time.

Perversely, start-ups get an easier ride raising equity, because there are plenty of platforms out there serving them, with mad valuations based on hockey-stick forecasts. Our focus is not on start-ups but on businesses with financial track records - which are the vast majority, and full of really attractive investment opportunities.",False

Peter Edgar – Co-Founder/CEO. Founded The Oxalis Group in 2010 successfully exited in 2015. He’s now an investor and non-executive director for 3 companies. Dave Hewitt – Co-Founder/CTO.  Since 2013 has been Partner at Equal Experts, who provide tailored, end-to-end services in software development and delivery, and have 10 offices throughout the world with between 500 and 1,000 employees Leon Sloyan –  CCO.  More than 3 years experience as International Commercial Manager at HSBC, then spent 3 years as Relationship Director for Santander UK (over 10,000 employees) Richard Chambers- COO. Director of Finance team at Royal Bank of Scotland Senior Associate Director SBC. Andy Gray- Blockchain & Smart Contract Consultant with 20 years commercial IT experience.  DApp/Solidity Developer at Barclaycard, Full-stack Developer at Globility Ltd. Four advisors are listed, including a Partner and Head of Commercial Fraud & Risk at DWF, a Managing Director at Central Business Finance, and an Engagement Manager at Equal Experts. Also, global top 10 law firm CMS will advise them on legal/financial regulatory work.  Verdict STOs can and most likely will cause a major disruption in the current ways small/medium equity businesses operate. Investx is positioning themselves to be the front-runners in opening this brand new market for investors.  The Investx platform allows crypto investors and holders to purchase shares in stable businesses, be paid any dividends and sell their shares all without using fiat on/off ramps.  Risks     Standard Ethereum platform risks. -1     Their pre-sale starts Nov 1, but they have not started marketing at all yet. Telegram has only 50 members so far. -1     In order to become an investor, holders must create a platform account and pass KYC checks. This most likely leaves USA, China, and possibly even Korea citizens from being able to invest in new projects on their platform. -1.5     Regulation concerns: they have yet to become authorized and regulated by the FCA.  the goal is for the platform to launch its first business listing on May 2019, and then they will work on launching a secondary market once they get FCA approval. -1     Major exchanges are afraid to list security tokens. Although INX token is utility, exchanges most likely won’t take the risk. -1  Growth Potential     A brand new way for SMEs to raise funds! +2     The team is full of value. +3     Perhaps the most professional whitepaper I’ve ever reviewed. They even made a separate 19 page Currency paper, that gets into every detail of their Tokenomics. +3     They have an elaborate game plan to become authorized and regulated by the FCA. According to the roadmap, the platform will be ready and listing the first businesses in May 2019. +2     From the whitepaper: “We are opening up a currently inaccessible asset class at discounted costs. Our focus on stable, growing businesses means greater opportunities for immediate and stable long-term returns.” +2  Disposition This is basically Ethereum for SME STOs. It has the potential to be massive. Lots of bleeding-edge risks though. 6.5/10  Investment Details     Symbol: INX     Blockchain: Ethereum     Total Supply: 34,375,000 INX     Presale: Nov 1 – Jan 7  (5% bonus)     Crowdsale: Jan 15- Feb 28     Price: GBP 0.80     Hardcap: 25 million     Softcap: 7.5 million  This is a good grade on this project.",False
