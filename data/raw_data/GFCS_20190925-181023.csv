Global Funeral Care, a company that is developing a platform where customers can (pre) plan completely customized funerals, is honored to announce that Logino Dujardin has joined the Global Funeral Care Advisory Board as Executive Advisor.  Global Funeral Care is developing a mobile friendly all in one blockchain-based platform without entry barriers where customers can (pre) plan a completely customized funeral with products and services from different organizations in just a few clicks. Customers can pay with GFCS and track the price of their pre-planned funeral in real time. The platform plays a key role in the advancement of knowledge and technology and helps to create economically productive relationships between organizations operating in the 109$ billion death care industry. Global Funeral Care encourages all organizations operating in the funeral industry to use GFCS with the intention of becoming a globally used payment method for the funeral industry.  Global Funeral Care and Safe Haven announced a strategic partnership on June 7, 2019. Global Funeral Care will be built as a Safe Haven vertical utilizing their flagship product, the Safe Haven Inheritance Platform (SHIP).  Lots of crypto owners are concerned about losing private keys or passphrases, or about what happens after they die. SHIP is the perfect solution to this problem. Safe Haven will allow an ‘initiator’ to manage, protect and distribute their assets with any number of stakeholders, for example family members or children. This can be done by dividing seeds, private keys, passwords, documents or any digital asset in several shares, one for each stakeholder. You as initiator can acquire assistance from validators. The validator (notary, legal person) will distribute your assets to your heirs if needed or by your request. You will be in full control of the assets at all time. Safe Haven does NOT own your keys or crypto. This technology integrated in the Global Funeral Care platform will make it easy for users to safely transfer their crypto to their heirs if something happens.  Logino will provide advise regarding Global Funeral Care on the integration of SHIP. Safe Haven will act as technical and integration support for Global Funeral Care regarding SHIP.  Alex van der Wal said, “We are pleased to have Logino in our Advisory Board, he brings a huge amount of knowledge into our organization. His role is critical to ensure that the integration of the SHIP protocol will go as smoothly as possible.”  Welcome on board, Logino!  Join Our Official Channels to Receive the Latest Updates.

The Global Funeral Care platform is a globally sourced decentralized platform, not centralized.  The Global Funeral Care Foundation has done research on several centralized platforms who made steps to increase transparency. The centralized platforms charge money to funeral homes whereas we incentivize organizations to join our platform, which makes it more attractive to the Global Funeral Care Platform.  I don't know from what country you are, but for example in the United States, 98 percent of funeral homes are owned by individuals, families, or closely held private corporations. Feel free to follow our project. We will publish our latest developments on our website. https://www.globalfuneralcare.org   Kind regards,  The Global Funeral Care Foundation   ",False

The foundation understands that everybody wants to honor the live and memories in a way the departed loved one truly deserves, and fully supports the funeral industry from a neutral perspective.  As you might know the price of funeral services in the United States have risen almost twice as fast as the consumer prices for all items from 1986 to 2017. Moreover, in recent years, Federal regulators went undercover to purchase products and services from funeral homes. The regulators discovered that approximately one out of four funeral homes violated the law by not disclosing information on their prices.  On average a cremation must take place within 72 hours and in some cultures the time between the death occurring and the funeral is even within 24 hours. If we look at the funeral industry as a distributor of essential goods and services, the interface between consumer and funeral director is one where consumers cannot act on the market in a rational way. The decision process takes place in a different context compared to usual major purchases. Many relatives do not want to think about comparing prices and the quality of goods and services during times of stress and bereavement. Therefore, the funeral industry its consumers need to receive transparent and clear information on the products and services. It is therefore necessary to provide education with regard to the pricing of funerals and other possible choices.   We invite you to read our white paper, to read more in-depth on the current issues in the funeral industry.   Regards,  The Global Funeral Care Foundation",False
