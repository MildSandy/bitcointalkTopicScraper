Our main UI is a browser module which is distributed for free.  Users download and run the module and it parses the JSON from supported social media sites, inserting our score into the content.  Images are available in the whitepaper.  It doesn't run on user voting.  Rather we give each of the half billion social media contributors a rating based on our AI's assessment of their content, and then the user has the option to filter the content that they think scores 'too low' for them to be useful.  Some people want to see everything.  Some people only want to see the most credible information.  For some, it's a question of what they're looking to find out.  Sometimes they want pictures of angry cat which is fun, but not necessarily credible.  Sometime the question is an important one and they're only interested in 'the facts'.  With our system every user decides for themselves. And in the process, we use the power of the marketplace to deny 'clicks' to the most polarized sources and make the more credible news sources 'worth' more. ",True
