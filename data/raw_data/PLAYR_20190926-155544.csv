As price discovery specialists, we are introducing a new way of perfecting the real-time valuation of players, while also expanding the scope of in-game and off-pitch information available to every segment within the football industry, having one ultimate goal:  Bringing transparency back to the sports industry  Playrs’ first project will be focused on the football industry where, we believe, there are inconsistencies and lack of clarity concerning real-time valuation of football players. After, future projects, will include cricket, American football, baseball, basketball and tennis. Our model is to use the algorithm and accommodate popular sports with its complexity. We see it fit that the community starts to get involved on a full-time basis in how players are perceived and valued.  How Blockchain is used by Playrs  blockchain technology will be used by Playrs to add an extra layer of transparency to its Index, with the use of decentralised data distribution by the community, as mentioned above. Instead of relying on one source of data which would undoubtedly control the flow of information into the Playrs Index, the use of Blockchain technology tackles this problem and Playrs uses blockchain’s inherent characteristics in order to create a kind of ‘open source’ player valuation pool where contributors will share information on various players’ on-and-off pitch data with the ultimate goal of setting a global standard which is both transparent and fully-decentralized.  Background and Key Market Facts  Ever since the “Moneyball revolution” swept the world of baseball in the early 2000s, big data has rapidly gained importance for other sports on a global scale. Big Data is becoming increasingly important in profiling athletes in a more accurate way as current valuations are often done by sports institution and are seldom fairly done.  With the Moneyball revolution well and truly underway in terms of revamping key processes sports such as baseball and American football, football is now next in line. Football clubs are actively looking for means to increase their advantage over their competitors through the extensive use of data which will result in on-field improvements. While physical performance and skill remain at the heart of a team’s core strengths, the use of data and its ‘correct’ analysis gives teams an edge over their competitors — whether it’s on the pitch or in matters of recruitment — the latter of which has become somewhat of a battle of its own.  Raw data providers such as WHO SCORED?, OPTA, STATS, Prozone, and other major players within the data collection and distribution segment of the sports market typically collect in-game information either with the help of on-field tracking cameras, or individual data collectors, who send the information to a data center, which is verified, and then pushed to their live feed via XML or JSON format. Collected data typically includes directly recognisable actions such as passes, shots, goals, fouls, bookings and more.  The issue with this methodology lies in the fact that several important in-play actions are not taken into account such as an offensive player defensive contributions, which could greatly help the player’s team in achieving a positive result. Such pieces of information are provided and replayed at the end of a game’s half or full time — but are not collected in real time.  Meanwhile, the world of football is notoriously known for inflated players prices causing somewhat of a financial abstract within one of the largest global industries. Clubs are expected to spend over-the-odds to close a deal, while agents fees, commissions and other incentives push player prices to unprecedented heights.
