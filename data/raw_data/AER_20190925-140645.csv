Since it’s built on blockchain technology, the transaction is instantaneous. No waiting for a bank to record the transaction, change a fee, and pass the money from one party to another, because there is no bank. There’s more security because there is no central bank that could be a target for hackers. And your personal data is safe because blockchain distributes little bits of encrypted information across the whole network, instead of storing it in a central database, the way banks do.
