This is a longread, and we really want you to read it.  https://i.imgur.com/2jXM3Tml.jpg  Let’s begin from the start of HUNT.BET Project. In the beginning we started to develop the product without understanding that we can move it to the blockchain and make an ICO with that. The goal was to steal a way to eSports audience hearts. Our team spent days and nights designing the system of our masterpiece. Every piece of the system was developed relying on cybersports audience opinion. We were collecting opinions of gamers, users of betting platforms and people who are interested in eSports and designed the HUNT.BET – project that meant to be loved by everyone.  So the plan was to develop the project, buy the license, make friendships with professional teams and media persons related to eSports and click on the “LAUNCH BUTTON”.  Then the ICO appeared. Thoughts that we can make our project on the blockchain and raise money to push our project to the world scene blowed our minds. We slowly started to “flow” through all moments, related to ICO. What should we do? What should we start with? Who do we need? How will we jump into this huge market? These and many other questions appeared on our way to actual launching. Our project is 70% complete – maybe it can give us a huge boost compared to other ICOs?  So, it happened. We found the answers and thought that everything is great – we can start the ICO. We made the crowdsale site, made our whitepaper, found money to make the PR campaign, found really good person who became our Bounty Campaign manager, made the topic on Bitcointalk forum and there we go – timer is launched, ICO is coming.  We did not publish any articles on news portals, did not make any ICO announcements on the ICO platforms. Our fault, we thought that we can do it later, nothing will change if we will do it at the time of ICO start or even in few days.  Only after that we realised that audience was not prepared for us – we just appeared from nowhere and started to sell our tokens. “Haste makes waste”, beautiful Russian proverb says.  First stage of our ICO ended and we weren’t funded a lot. For sure, it was a crash. But, we are not despaired by this. We want the world to know about us. HUNT.BET will live and we will do everything for it, but we need your help!  After few days, we decided to ask audience about our mistakes. Now we really want to be fully open to you, your questions and your thoughts. We want to make the second ICO stage as perfect as it can be. Now, we have an audience and this is a perfect moment to start the preparation for it.  So, we appeal to you. We made a vote and we really need your thoughts. There are just few variants – it won’t take a lot of time.  Stay with us and join our story – we will show the world that we can do it!
