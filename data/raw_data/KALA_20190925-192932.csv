As publicized in July of 2018, Nui was issued a notice from the TSSB in regards to some of its cryptocurrency mining products. After seven months working cooperatively with the TSSB, Nui announces that the investigation has now been resolved.  ‚ÄúWeeding out the good and the bad players is a necessary step in the progression of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency,‚Äù Darren Olayan, Nui CEO, said. ‚ÄúBy working with the Texas State Securities Board, Nui has proven that we are committed to doing things the right way.‚Äù  Nui disputed the core allegations in the notice and presented to the TSSB compelling arguments why their products are not subject to securities laws in Texas. Recently, they decided it was in the best interest of their business and members to settle the issue directly with the TSSB rather than proceed to a hearing with a neutral arbiter.   On Feb. 21, 2019, Nui consented to the entry of an agreed order in which the TSSB concludes that two of Nui‚Äôs products should have been registered as securities before being sold to Texas residents, Nui should have registered in the state before offering the products for sale in Texas, and that Nui will pay a fine. This is not an admission of fault. In fact, Nui disagrees with the legal conclusion that the TSSB reached, but is pleased that the matter is now behind them.  In addition, the TSSB agreed to remove all allegations of fraud from the order and that the offer of Kala mining rigs did not constitute a securities offering, as the TSSB had originally alleged. In the near future, Nui will make a rescission offer to Texas residents who purchased the products. As part of the agreement, this rescission offer is also not an admission of guilt.  Olayan stressed that Nui strives to abide by all relevant laws and regulations and will continue to do so. ‚ÄúWe have been very careful and strategic in how we move forward. With so many factors affecting today‚Äôs crypto space, it‚Äôs important that we take the best steps to protect our company, our members and our products,‚Äù he said. Therefore, moving forward Nui will not offer any cryptocurrency mining products to Texas residents and they ask their members not to solicit Texas residents, with strict penalties for violation of this policy.  Nui understands that as the crypto space continues to evolve, legislators, regulators, and businesses will have to adjust to make room for this new technology. Now that they are in good standing with the Texas State Board of Securities, Nui is looking forward to that bright future. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre thrilled to be on the front lines of this new evolution,‚Äù Olayan said.  Nui harnesses the power of the blockchain revolution by strategically providing ways for their members to participate and earn with blockchain and cryptocurrency.

And a lot of MLM are nervious... One of the reason are the next:  What if you could have complete ownership of your downline? What if you could prove the size and activity of your team, or had guaranteed accurate commissions? And what if you could build your network ONCE, and have it live on forever? Welcome to CompChain Designed as the world‚Äôs first blockchain created specifically for networking, CompChain is putting the power into the hands of the entrepreneur, giving you the chance to earn, grow, and run your personal business in a completely revolutionary way.  Why Blockchain? Blockchain technology has the power to make information completely secure, transparent, and decentralized, giving each user the ownership and autonomy they deserve.  By putting power back into the hands of the user, blockchain enables entrepreneurs to grow at their own pace, be paid in a fair and transparent environment, and lock in their team for life. In turn, CompChain eliminates some common pitfalls of the network marketing space, including fraud, withheld commissions, and cross-recruiting.   Through the power of blockchain, CompChain is about to transform the world of marketing as we know it‚Äì and Nui has a front row seat. Nui Gets in First Over the next 15 days, Nui has the exclusive chance to get in FIRST, before CompChain opens to the masses. As the first of many customers lined up for the action, Nui will sit at the top of the CompChain, as the world‚Äôs first network marketing company to be built on a blockchain.  As a Nui member, now is your chance to join before anyone else. Build your frontline on CompChain‚Äôs unilevel structure to an infinite width and up to 10 tiers deep, then lock it in for life with unalterable blockchain technology. From there, sit back as CompChain continues to evolve and offer new opportunities to you as one of its earliest adopters.  The CompChain Vision CompChain has the power to transform affiliate marketing on a global scale. The only question is‚Ä¶ will you take your chance to get in first? The future of CompChain involves a 3-phase integration, with each phase offering a deeper opportunity for the entrepreneur.  Phase 1: Membership With a simple one-time purchase, validate your identity, buy your CompChain ‚Äúblock‚Äù, and gain access to the CompChain software.  Phase 2: Ownership Purchase a node, giving you full access to your personal blockchain data, and a complete, unalterable record of your downline.  Phase 3: Wealth Generation Monetize your network as product providers and distributors give you exclusive access to sell their products to your frontline.  As CompChain continues to grow, so will your potential. With millions of network marketers worldwide, don‚Äôt miss your chance to get in NOW before CompChain is unleashed to the rest of the public!  Benefits of CompChain What do you have to gain by jumping into CompChain? We‚Äôll sum it up for you:   Your Network is Yours. Regardless of the status of your company or government regulation, your network lives on in an immutable blockchain that can never be altered or shut down. By purchasing a node, CompChain gives you the first ever solidified legal record of your downline, allowing you to prove both the size and activity of your team.  Commissions are transparent. How do you know you‚Äôre getting paid what you deserve? While many companies hide their commissions, and may only pay a portion of the whole, CompChain displays all commissions in a completely transparent environment, so you can be sure you‚Äôre earning every commission, every time.  Build One and You‚Äôre Done. Sick of rebuilding every time you take on a new opportunity? With CompChain, you‚Äôll only do it once. After your network is in place, present it with any unique opportunities, products, or applications you see fit, so you can make money YOUR way.  Verification from A-Z. Blockchain has the power to verify everything from your personal contacts to their activity, and even the product offerings you choose to share. No longer can your personal contacts be stolen, switched, or removed from your network, and gone are the days when you could risk selling something that doesn‚Äôt exist! Let CompChain do the verifying for you, to make sure your contacts and the products you offer are completely transparent and secure.  A Product that Pays for Itself! With CompChain, a one-time $100 purchase pays for:  The service to validate your identity and record it on a blockchain Access to the CompChain network and a secure ‚Äúblock‚Äù of your own The opportunity to own the entire history and data of your block in the future, including the chance to monetize it Plus, earn commissions for every member you enroll who joins your CompChain network!   20% CompChain commission for each personally enrolled member = $20 20% Nui commissions in CompChain paid up the unilevel (up to 10 levels) = $2 per level In addition, Nui is offering an extra commission of $5, with $2.50 to the direct enroller, and another $2.50 sent up the Nui TBS! (Nui specific commissions are not available to Nui Free Members) With almost $25 available for each new member you refer, all you‚Äôll need is 5 personal enrollments to earn your enrollment fee and MORE right back! Get your 5 and let your fee pay for itself!  Take Your Chance to Get in Early Starting today, Nui members have an exclusive window to register for CompChain first, before it‚Äôs opened to the masses. NOW is your chance to get in at the top‚Äì but you won‚Äôt have long. Keep your eyes out in the coming days for an invitation link from your enroller, giving you access to join.  Nui‚Äôs Exclusive Window Nui Members have until October 5th to join before the blockchain goes live Nui members will receive their invitation code from an enroller, in an effort to honor the current Nui lines of sponsorship The blockchain will go live on October 8th, with the first commissions paid out on October 19th Use an invitation code to join CompChain, and pay your $100 fee to ‚Äúbuy your block‚Äù Pass on your invitation code to anyone you‚Äôd like (inside or outside of Nui) to get them to join your network! All members must be KYC verified before they are eligible to earn commissions in CompChain. If your KYC has not been verified by the time the blockchain goes live (October 8, 2018), you may not receive commissions and access to your teams. Our customer support team will work with anyone who runs into KYC issues to resolve them in a timely manner, however, if your KYC is not approved by the date the blockchain goes live, we cannot retroactively award commissions. Keep in mind that full unilevel commissions are only available to Nui members‚Äì this includes Free members, too! There will be an option for non-Nui members to join as free members during CompChain sign up. Important Insight for Leaders The CompChain structure is unable to mirror the Nui TBS, and will not automatically transfer you and your downline into CompChain at any point during enrollment. In an effort to honor Nui lines of sponsorship, all new members (in or outside of Nui) are required to receive their invitation code directly from an enroller before they will have access to CompChain.  As a leader, the responsibility is on you to share your enroller code with your teams in a timely manner, and help guide them through the enrollment process to establish your team structure.  BE ADVISED: that Nui policies and procedures regarding team building still apply throughout this transition and that we will be monitoring recruiting practices very closely over the coming weeks. If your actions lead us to question the integrity of your recruiting practices, we may have cause to suspend or terminate your account. Please join us in our efforts to act with honesty and integrity as you transition your teams into CompChain.  Once you‚Äôre ready to take the leap, head to our CompChain Enrollment Tutorial for step-by-step instructions.  This is Just the Beginning Don‚Äôt look back and wonder what could have been. Take your chance to get in NOW before this revolutionary technology changes the world!   But as I said a lot of time. The may way to get kala will be doing activities. But he doesnt want listen... well his problem. But actually I think he is here just to desprestige. After all he had only 6 message and not in any other theme.",False

Now, Kala‚Äôs vision has sharpened as we announce three new milestones for the coming months.  This roadmap is designed with Kala‚Äôs strategic plan in mind: to get on an exchange at the right time, with the right framework, and ultimately at the right value, thus avoiding the common pitfalls of hundreds of coins who jump to an exchange too soon.  KALA'S NEW MILESTONES  Kala Listings (Coming December 2018) - Next month we will launch Kala‚Äôs very own private peer-to-peer trading platform called Kala Listings. With its release, Kala users will have the chance to list their Kala and trade it for BTC.  Kala Integration (Coming Early 2019) - Kala will continue to be implemented into unique platforms and applications. Symatri partners already plan to do this in a number of ways, with additional partnerships on the horizon. More Kala use-cases across a variety of markets makes it a stronger and more valuable coin.  Reach Targeted Hash Power Threshold (Ongoing) - The Kala network continues to grow toward our targeted network hash power threshold, which makes it more valuable for exchanges. While getting on an exchange can be done at any time, creating a strong network opens up a new world of opportunity and creates a more stable framework for Kala and its users in the long run.  Get on a Public Exchange (Coming Mid-2019) - Kala‚Äôs strategic pathway will continue with the move to a public exchange mid-2019. This timeframe has been thoughtfully planned, allowing Kala to become stabilized through peer-to-peer trading, established use-cases, and a strong network hash power before it is released to the public. The Kala Advisory team is confident in their decision to wait to join an exchange until Kala stands on solid ground, further stabilizing value for Kala users.    way to earn kala right now:  - Make activities, see videos, surveys, etc - Shopping in the retail rewards =) - Rings Kala",False

A lot of cryptocurrency trading doesn‚Äôt happen on the public exchanges; it takes place peer-to-peer instead.  What Is Peer-to-Peer Trading?  Just like it sounds, peer-to-peer (P2P) trading is when one person wishes to trade their crypto and a second person agrees to trade that coin for another. Peer-to-peer trading provides a great alternative to a traditional, centralized exchange.  Over the past year, we've seen the demise of hundreds of crypto coins due to the hasty decision to get on a public exchange too soon. Therefore, we are waiting to join an exchange until the time is right, when Kala is set up not only for short-term development, but for long-term success. While the Kala Team is focusing on creating a strong foundation for long-term value, they still see the need to provide a trade opportunity for our community.  Introducing Kala Listings  By the end of 2018, we will be releasing our very own private, peer-to-peer trading platform: Kala Listings. The Kala Listing platform provides Kala users with the opportunity to trade Kala while we make progress on the next milestones of expanding the Kala ecosystem and getting on a public exchange in mid-2019.  Kala Listings will live in the Kala Wallet, and will be open to all Kala Wallet users who complete a simple KYC verification. At the time of launch, Kala Listings will facilitate P2P trading of Kala and BTC only; future development may include other features.  Kala Listings gives you full control of your Kala trading. Not only will this platform open an untapped market for current Kala holders, but will also create an opportunity for users who haven‚Äôt had the chance to mine or purchase Kala on their own",False

According to The Quartz Index, 800 to 1,000 ICOs failed in just the first 6 months of 2018, despite the consistent rise in the number of coins hitting the market. (Quartz, 2018)  So what sets a good coin ahead of the rest? It seems that while many coins rush to create a short-term spike in value, most forget the most important element: creating real, long-lasting value that isn‚Äôt dependent on an exchange.  Lucky for us, Kala has always been different. From day one, Kala‚Äôs advisory team has been focused on building the framework to support a thriving ecosystem that will provide value both before and after Kala hits a public exchange.  A Thriving Kala Economy The Kala Economy is made up of several components, each working to support the life and longevity of the Kala coin. By establishing a diverse set of use-cases and business partnerships, Kala is building the infrastructure to withstand the ups and downs of the crypto market, and make a name for itself in the process.  The Kala ecosystem is being strengthened in many ways:  Mining ‚Äì Our community can mine Kala through pre-configured mining rigs and coin mining contracts. With thousands of users and counting actively mining, the Kala network already has a hash power that far exceeds most coins on the market. Current Partnerships ‚Äì Symatri partners will integrate Kala for membership enrollment payments, product purchases, member commission payouts, and more Kala Wallet ‚Äì Unique and easy-to-use crypto wallet with thousands of users that provides a safe and secure place to store, send, receive, and use Kala  Additional Uses ‚Äì Kala will continue to integrate uses in our own ecosystem. This includes the CORE platform and Reach marketplace, which allow users to earn Kala through online activities, then spend it on real items. Business Partnerships/Applications ‚Äì We are already being approached by other businesses looking to partner with or integrate Kala, which will expand the ecosystem even more Trading ‚Äì Users can begin trading Kala through Kala Listings, which facilitates peer-to-peer transactions of Kala and BTC. By creating a diversified, secure foundation, Kala value is not subject to the perceived price of an exchange but is instead tied to concrete applications to last for years to come. For more on Kala‚Äôs ecosystem, read up on Kala‚Äôs 5 Reasons to Get in With Kala Rigs and Reason #4 ‚Äì Kala‚Äôs Growing Ecosystem.  Leveraging The Kala Network The Kala coin‚Äôs use-cases are not the only thing influencing long-term value. As the Kala blockchain network continues to grow, it becomes a valuable offering in itself that can be used to foster business partnerships across a variety of markets.  Businesses seeking blockchain applications of their own can tap into the Kala network to support and power their projects. As Kala‚Äôs distributed network reaches its target hash power threshold, it not only becomes a valuable selling point for exchanges but further increases its capacity to support B2B partnerships.  Members of the Kala network can only stand to benefit from these partnerships, as they participate first-hand in a thriving Kala economy and gain direct access to business offerings down the road.  Doing It Right As with all good things, building a sustainable ecosystem takes time. New use-cases must be carefully tested, applications created, and partners must implement Kala into platforms of their own, giving their users the chance to use Kala.  Each step must be thoughtfully taken to build a foundation that can withstand an often unpredictable crypto market. Advances like the Kala Listings platform also put the Kala Community first, focusing on those who are supportive of the success and usage of the Kala Coin, and not just the speculation of value. This is why the Kala Advisory team has waited to join a public exchange, strategically giving time holding off until the Kala ecosystem has time to mature.  With new Kala applications on track in the months ahead, the Kala team feels confident in the plan to join a public exchange by mid-2019. More information on upcoming Kala Milestones can be found in our recent article,",False

Building Kala on a Bitcoin fork provides a wide variety of benefits to our Kala community.    Increased Stability and Protection with the SEC  In 2017, the cryptocurrency market came under intense scrutiny from many governments and the SEC in the United States.  The SEC has been taking steps toward defining which ICOs and cryptocurrency tokens should be considered securities, thus requiring security regulation. Due to its simple design build, several ERC20 tokens are currently under investigation and may receive regulatory or legal action. Moving from an ERC20 token to a unique blockchain establishes Kala‚Äôs utility and value as a cryptocurrency, not a security, and confidently places Kala in compliance with SEC guidelines.   Increased Validity and Opportunity within Crypto Exchanges  In response to SEC involvement, many cryptocurrency exchanges have adjusted or are currently adjusting the requirements coins/tokens must meet to be listed on their exchange. Several ERC20 tokens have recently been pulled off the world‚Äôs top exchanges. Since Kala will no longer be an ERC20 token, it is more appealing to exchanges, making the path to being accepted that much easier. Once Kala gets on crypto exchanges, its currency value can begin to take off.   More Favorable Structure for Decentralization through Proof of Work  As one of blockchains biggest catalysts and revolutionaries, Bitcoin‚Äôs primary purpose is to be a decentralized and trustless network.  Bitcoin is built on a Proof of Work mining method, conferring rewards in the form of the coin being mined to those who solve complicated mathematical algorithms that verify transactions. This design gives every person the opportunity to mine Bitcoin.  Ethereum has announced their plans to move from Proof of Work to a Proof of Stake system, conferring awards to miners based on how much stake, or ownership, they have in Ethereum. A drawback to this type of mining is that it concentrates control based on how much a person currently owns. When the power in the system moves toward a select group who already have more than others, that undercuts the whole idea of decentralization.  Kala believes in the power of decentralization and the opportunity that it offers for everyone who wishes to participate, rather than select groups. In that way, Proof of Work is a better fit.    Putting the Kala Community in the Driver‚Äôs Seat  Operating on its own blockchain gives Kala users the ability to directly support and build the Kala ecosystem through mining or installing the Kala blockchain on their own hardware. This gives our users a personal impact on the strength of Kala‚Äôs network and its ability to be effective within Kala‚Äôs ecosystem. The Kala network then becomes just as valuable as its token. Each person who mines Kala increases the strength of Kala‚Äôs network, creating a truly decentralized network that belongs to and is powered by our Kala community.   Simplifying Kala‚Äôs Blockchain Design  Since Bitcoin has been around for almost 10 years, there are hundreds of supporting tools already developed and in use. Moving to a fork of Bitcoin increases the ease of adoption across multiple platforms, such as wallets and exchanges, which are already set up for bitcoin and its forks. This makes Kala easier to use, with wider access.  But, the benefits and opportunities don‚Äôt stop here. In the coming weeks, Kala‚Äôs Advisory team will release new updates and information about how Kala‚Äôs blockchain network will be built.  https://kalatoken.io/deeper-look-benefits-new-kala-blockchain/",False

According to a report by Netscribes Inc., the global blockchain technology market size is expected to reach 13.98 billion USD by 2022, with a compound annual growth rate of 42.8%. With a Kala community of over 6,500 people, Symatri is confidently designing and building a revolutionary Kala blockchain and network.   Kala‚Äôs Next Steps  Kala‚Äôs Advisory team is currently finalizing their ITO audit, and will soon take the first steps in building Kala‚Äôs blockchain network. Moving to its own blockchain not only increases Kala‚Äôs intrinsic value, it also adds stability and protection in the regulatory and legal arenas, and eliminates some roadblocks to being accepted on cryptocurrency exchanges. Symatri understands that these increased benefits and added value make Kala a more appealing cryptocurrency. They are therefore rewarding early Kala supporters by offering them first access to mining before the blockchain becomes available to the general public.  Building Phases  The Kala blockchain and network will first be built among Symatri‚Äôs partners and the Kala community through the sale of exclusive, preconfigured Kala mining rigs. These rigs will be offered via a tiered rollout that will end with the general public. All participants can then mine Kala privately until reaching a certain network hash power threshold.  Benefits Of This Innovative Blockchain Creation  First to Mine Gets Highest Reward  Kala will follow a controlled supply system, similar to Bitcoin. This means there will be a certain number of Kala created over the lifetime of the coin, which will be distributed over time by fixed amounts. 50% of Kala‚Äôs total amount, in billions, will be released within the first four years. The percentage will then be halved every four years.   Years 1-4 = 50% of Kala lifetime amount  Years 5-8 = 25% of Kala lifetime amount  Years 9-12 = 12.5% of Kala lifetime amount  Years 13-16 = 6.25% of Kala lifetime amount  And so on.  The set amount of Kala being created every day will be distributed among the rigs that are actively mining Kala on that day. You can see that the greatest mining rewards will be received by those who mine in the first four years, especially by those who are among the first to mine Kala.  For example, if 10,000,000 Kala were available daily, and you owned one of the 100 rigs mining Kala, you would earn 100,000 Kala/day and 3,000,000 Kala every month.  This allows us to reward our early supporters, since they will have exclusive access to mining Kala at the beginning.  Increased Protection and Stability  By building Kala‚Äôs blockchain and network in this way, we are able to protect it in the first stages when it would be most vulnerable to hijacking from competitors. Then, when the Kala blockchain goes public, it will already be built on an existing strong, secure, and distributed network foundation. This further protects the interests of Kala owners, since the currency cannot easily be taken over by powerful entities.  Decentralization at its Finest  Kala believes in the power of decentralization and the opportunity that it offers for everyone who wishes to participate, rather than select groups. One of many things that is drawing industry leaders to blockchain is having access to networks that allow honest transactions. Because of Symatri‚Äôs partners and Kala users, we already have a head start on the the ability to grow a truly decentralized, distributed network. This can open doors for future opportunities.  Once Kala‚Äôs blockchain hits the required hash power threshold, Symatri will complete preparations to get on crypto exchanges, finish Kala integration within the Symatri ecosystem, and publish the blockchain code base. Once the blockchain is public, anyone can become a node or mine Kala.  We will be announcing more specifics on all of Kala‚Äôs next steps in the upcoming weeks, so watch for updates via email, our blog, and the Kala Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter.   https://kalatoken.io/roadmap-building-kalas-network/",False

Kala is moving to a newer and better blockchain and Kala users are going to help build it. Kala is designed to bring cryptocurrency to everyday people, and Symatri recently announced plans to move Kala from an ERC20 token to a blockchain of its own. This confident step helps take Kala to a whole new level within today‚Äôs crypto market and opens many opportunities for our valued Kala community.  Helping Us Build & Drive Kala‚Äôs Success Symatri is currently expanding and developing various mining opportunities, in addition to CORE, that will allow users access to mine, build, and earn Kala. Each option puts the network in the hands and homes of thousands of Kala users. This innovative step not only increases Kala‚Äôs level of decentralization, but it also gives Kala a competitive edge within today‚Äôs crypto market.  But the benefits don‚Äôt stop there! Building a Kala blockchain also provides many advantages as Kala prepares to get onto crypto exchanges. Some of these include:  ‚ÄîProtection and Stability within SEC regulations: Many ERC20 tokens have been removed from exchanges due to legal or regulatory reasons, drastically affecting their value and availability.  ‚ÄîKala is User and Exchange Friendly: Because of increased regulations, most crypto exchanges are increasing their onboarding requirements. As a Bitcoin fork, Kala will be able to access exchanges quicker.  ‚ÄîCORE & Reach are Ready for Kala: As a blockchain, Kala can easily integrate and support Symatri‚Äôs ecosystem that allows users to mine and earn Kala by completing simple activities like submitting surveys, downloading apps, watching commercial videos, etc.  With so many exciting things coming, don‚Äôt miss out on any Kala updates.  https://kalatoken.io/giving-power-blockchain-kala-users/",False

WHITEPAPER   |   FACEBOOK    |    TELEGRAM |   KALA  explanatory videos    Back Office, CORE & REACH Walk Throug YouTube    |    Introducing kala |    NUI Social in 17 minutes |     Summary  Kala is a cryptocurrency built on a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain that will integrate seamlessly within the Symatri ecosystem and has multiple levels of value. The Kala economy is simple:  1) Members earn points for completing simple activities through our revolutionary CORE platform, 2) they transfer those points to Kala, 3) they use Kala in the Reach marketplace, which offers a vast array of products and services.  Users can also earn Kala through traditional mining. An additional level of value comes from the decentralized, distributed network built through Kala that itself becomes an asset that can be leveraged for future endeavors as blockchain gains even more use and adoption across multiple industries.  Symatri  Symatri was created to help people achieve some financial breathing room so they can reach for something better.  The concept of symmetry has timeless appeal, and is important in mathematics, science, nature, architecture, music, the arts, and literature. Symmetry refers to a sense of balance, proportion, and harmony.  Sym- means together or with We believe that there is a unique strength when we work together, which creates powerful synergy and momentum. Together, we can accomplish more than we can by ourselves.  Tri means three Our vision is to help people around the world have financial security through the convergence of the three key components of Symatri‚Äî CORE, REACH, and Kala. These, just like the vertices of a triangle, work together in a winning system for our Members. The triangle is one of the strongest shapes structurally, able to maintain its integrity under pressure. All three of Symatri‚Äôs components work together in a strong, unified system.  A New Digital Currency  Symatri has already experimented with a rudimentary form of digital currency with our current point system, where users can earn and spend a centralized digital currency. We are now taking the next step in our vision to build a vibrant community in creating a new cryptocurrency: Kala (KALA). Kala is designed to bring people together in a new shared economy.  Multifaceted Value  The underlying utility aspect gives Kala an inherent value not found in many other cryptocurrencies because users will be able to earn Kala through completing simple activities in the CORE platform or through Retail Rewards, and then redeem Kala for goods and services in the online Reach marketplace.  In building a Kala blockchain, two additional levels of value have been added: 1) the opportunity to mine Kala through mining hardware and 2) the decentralized, distributed network itself becomes an asset that can be leveraged for future endeavors as blockchain gains even more use and adoption across multiple industries.  The Kala Economy  The Kala economy will be based on the same mutually beneficial system that drives CORE. Individuals are rewarded in points for completing activities like taking surveys or downloading apps. They can then exchange those points for Kala that can be used for products and services in the Reach marketplace, thereby enjoying a tangible reward for their efforts. People are incentivized to participate, and as word-of-mouth spreads, others will want to join. As more people become part of our community, businesses will offer more CORE activities that Members can do to earn Kala, in a winning cycle. In addition, people can participate by mining with the Kala blockchain. Mined Kala can also be spent in the Reach Marketplace. These economic incentives at the center of the Kala economy will ensure that all participants can ultimately benefit.  As befits the decentralized inspiration behind blockchain technology, the Kala economy will be widely accessible. It‚Äôs estimated there are approximately 2 billion individuals with access to the Internet or mobile phones who don‚Äôt have access to traditional exchange systems.2 The merging of CORE, Reach, and Kala cryptocurrency offers a unique opportunity for these individuals to participate in the Symatri Ecosystem.  BUILDING A DIGITAL ECONOMY INSIDE SYMATRI  About Symatri and Currency  Symatri burst onto the scene with incredible growth from the beginning, when we launched with one vertical on Oct. 15, 2016 under a different company name. Our accessible and simple platform resulted in explosive interest and growth, which uniquely positions us in the marketplace with over 300,000 members in over 140 countries. These members have come in through only one of our verticals for member acquisition.  The size of our user base, global demographics, and business partnerships create a distinctive community where cryptocurrency may be introduced, adopted, and used. The points system that we have been using suggests that Symatri users are open to digital currency, and that people do not need to master a special level of technological knowledge to participate.  Why Kala Is Different   1. Inherent Value - What makes any medium of exchange valuable is whether or not owners can use it to for real world transactions. Unlike other cryptocurrency, Kala will have inherent value because it can be spent on a wide array of products and services on our Reach marketplace. Our decentralized, distributed network itself adds an additional, foundational value that backs Kala.  2. Two Ways to Mine ‚Äì Kala makes cryptocurrency accessible to anyone with two ways of mining: 1) Proof of Work and 2) our unique way of ‚Äúmining‚Äù through Proof of Effort. Proof of Work confers rewards in the form of Kala to those who verify transactions through mining hardware. The Proof of Effort process is simple‚Äîcomplete activities through our CORE platform and earn CORE points, then transfer those into Kala.  3. Existing Ecosystem ‚Äì People don‚Äôt have to wait for a platform to be built in order to participate in the Kala Economy. CORE and Reach are both existing platforms that are being used, tested, and improved before integrating Kala. As Symatri expands its ecosystem, the economic possibilities for users are heightened.   An Earnable Reward  Kala will be a completely earnable cryptocurrency by anyone within the Symatri ecosystem through completing simple CORE activities or through traditional crypto mining.  CORE  CORE (Compensation On Real Efforts)  is the unique system in which users have the ability to earn by completing simple activities like taking surveys, testing products or services, downloading apps, playing games, watching videos, and more. Members will earn points on CORE activities and can earn commissions on referrals. The points will be transferrable into Kala to be spent in the Reach marketplace.  CORE Activities  Symatri has partnered with businesses to bring hundreds of offers to our community of Members, who have the ability to earn by completing simple CORE activities, like:  ‚Ä¢ App Downloads ‚Ä¢ Offer Trials ‚Ä¢ Surveys ‚Ä¢ Email Submits ‚Ä¢ Video Views ‚Ä¢ And more  Retail Rewards  Members can also shop through our Retail Rewards portal and earn a certain percentage back on their shopping at thousands of online retailers. This benefit alone provides immense value.  For example: According to Forbes, the average holiday shopper planned to spend $1,175 on gifts in 2016. If a person spent that $1,175 through our Retail Rewards portals and received 5% back (an average offering), then they would get back $58.75 in points on holiday shopping alone, that could then be exchanged for Kala.  Reach Marketplace  Reach (Redeem and Achieve) is the ultimate Kala redemption center, and will be open to anyone that uses Kala later in 2018. To reach means to move toward, extend toward, or stretch out for something. It also means to arrive at a destination. Reaching is both an action and a result.  Reach is more than a marketplace; it‚Äôs where our Members enjoy the benefits and reap the rewards of their work through CORE, and where Kala users can spend Kala. Symatri has stocked Reach with products and services that will all be available for purchase with Kala once it is fully integrated. We will also consistently add products and services to Reach to make it as robust as possible.  THE KALA COIN  Purpose and Characterization  Symatri is introducing a general purpose cryptocurrency named Kala that will be the unit for economic transactions within the Symatri Ecosystem. Like other cryptocurrencies, units of Kala are fungible and transferable. They will be expected to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges.  Implementation  Kala is a new cryptocurrency (KALA) that will be created as a variant of the Bitcoin open-source protocol. Each coin issued equals one coin generated on the blockchain.  Kala Exchange Rate  Users can earn Kala through mining directly, or earn points through CORE activities which can then be exchanged for Kala to make purchases on the Reach marketplace. The value of Kala, and thus how many are used to obtain a product or service, will change dynamically based on the floating exchange value of Kala. In order to prevent rapid changes in Kala floating market value from swinging prices, and enabling users to time Kala transactions to maximize value, an average exchange rate value will be calculated periodically and used to price goods and services in Reach. This will smooth out fluctuations in the Kala market, but will not alter the fair market Kala value in any significant way  Kala Market Flow  Kala circulates in the following ways:  1. Members in open countries complete CORE activities and shop through Retail Rewards to earn points.  2. Points are recorded and stored in Member accounts.  3. When they choose, Members can exchange points for Kala, which are assigned to the Member from the Symatri Reserve allocated for CORE activities.  4. All Kala users, Members, Kala Miners, and those who purchase Kala on exchanges can make purchases in the Reach marketplace. Kala from these purchases will go back in the Symatri Reserve.  5. Fiat income is earned by Symatri from client partnerships, which will be used to keep CORE and Reach stocked, and for business development, additional infrastructure, and operating costs.  6. Mined Kala enters circulation as it‚Äôs created.   Supply Strategy  Cryptocurrencies often have relatively low coin numbers. Bitcoin, for instance, has a maximum of 21 million coins. This means that whole coins tend to have a large value, which creates a perception barrier. When someone goes to use their coins in transactions involving small amounts, they must think in terms of multiple decimal places. For example, to purchase an item priced at $1 USD, a person would pay something like 0.00018 Bitcoin (at Oct. 2017 Bitcoin value). That can be challenging to mentally calculate, and feels unnatural in a society used to exchanging full coins for things.  In keeping with our mission to make the Symatri ecosystem as widely accessible as possible, we are making Kala simpler to understand and adopt. Kala will be a two decimal place based cryptocurrency. Everyone is familiar with a payment system that uses two decimal places; it is comfortable. This will make transactions easier to understand and will simplify mental calculations. It is simpler to grasp that the price of an item is 100 Kala, rather than 0.00018 Bitcoin. This gives Kala a ‚Äúreal money‚Äù feel.  Distribution  Kala will be created according to a controlled supply strategy, similar to Bitcoin. This means that Kala will have a finite number of lifetime coins that are issued on a set schedule. There will be a total lifetime supply of 21 billion Kala. Three billion of the lifetime supply will be created at the launch of the Kala blockchain and allocated for purchases made through the ITO and a Symatri internal reserve of Kala. The reserve is earmarked for exchanging points on completed CORE activities, membership bonuses, partnership commissions, and to support the members of the Symatri ecosystem. The remaining 18 billion will be created as mining rewards. Half of that will be distributed in the first four years, then the number will halve every four years after.  MOVING FROM AN ERC20 TOKEN    At this time, the cryptocurrency space is constantly evolving, and 2017-2018 has seen several key changes. In order to make Kala a power player in these shifting conditions, the Kala Advisory team has strategically chosen to move Kala from an ERC20 token on the Ethereum blockchain (as previously planned) to its own blockchain on a fork of Bitcoin. This move provides many benefits for Kala, as well as chances for the Kala community to participate in additional opportunities beyond Kala‚Äôs underlying utility.  Benefits Increased Stability and Protection with the SEC  The SEC has been taking steps toward defining which ICOs and cryptocurrency tokens should be considered securities, thus requiring security regulation. Due to its simple design build, several ERC20 tokens are currently under investigation and may receive regulatory or legal action. Moving from an ERC20 token to a unique blockchain establishes Kala‚Äôs utility and value as a cryptocurrency, not a security.  Increased Validity and Opportunity within Crypto Exchanges  In response to SEC involvement, many cryptocurrency exchanges have adjusted or are currently adjusting the requirements coins/tokens must meet to be listed on their exchange. Several ERC20 tokens have recently been pulled off the world‚Äôs top exchanges. With its own blockchain, Kala is more appealing to exchanges, making the path to being accepted that much easier.  More Favorable Structure for Decentralization through Proof of Work  Bitcoin, whose primary purpose is to be a decentralized and trustless network, is built on a Proof of Work mining method, conferring rewards in the form of the coin being mined to those who solve complicated mathematical algorithms that verify transactions. This design gives every person the opportunity to mine Bitcoin.  In contrast, a Proof of Stake system (which Ethereum has announced they will be moving toward) confers awards to miners based on how much stake, or ownership, they have. A drawback to this type of mining is that it concentrates control based on how much a person currently owns. When the power in the system moves toward a select group who already have more than others, that undercuts the whole idea of decentralization.  Kala believes in the power of decentralization and the opportunity that it offers for everyone who wishes to participate, rather than select groups.  Putting the Kala Community in the Driver‚Äôs Seat  Operating on its own blockchain gives Kala users the ability to directly support and build the Kala ecosystem through mining or installing the Kala blockchain on their own hardware. This gives our users a personal impact on the strength of Kala‚Äôs network and its ability to be effective within Kala‚Äôs ecosystem. Each person who mines Kala increases the strength of the network, creating a truly decentralized network that belongs to and is powered by the Kala community.   Simplifying Kala‚Äôs Blockchain Design  Since Bitcoin has been around for almost 10 years, there are hundreds of supporting tools already developed and in use. Moving to a fork of Bitcoin increases the ease of adoption across multiple platforms, such as wallets and exchanges. This makes Kala easier to use, with wider access.  Moving to a blockchain on a Bitcoin fork not only has the above benefits, but also gives us the opportunity to give the highest mining rewards at the beginning of Kala mining to our supporters and partners, and creates a network of our own that can be leveraged for future opportunities.  Building the Kala Network  The Kala blockchain and network will first be built privately. In this way the network will be protected in the first stages when it would be most vulnerable to hijacking from competitors. Most importantly, Symatri can offer the greatest rewards to those who support the Kala vision. Then, when the Kala blockchain goes public, it will already be built on an existing strong, secure, and distributed network foundation.   The network will be built in phases, allowing different groups to participate in a tiered private rollout that will end with the public. The blockchain and mining will be kept exclusively to the Kala community and Symatri partners until reaching a certain network hash power threshold. At that time, we will complete preparations to get on exchanges, finish Kala integration within the Symatri ecosystem, and publish the blockchain code base. Once the blockchain is public, anyone can become a node or mine Kala.   Hash Power Threshold  After extensive research and consulting with experts, Kala‚Äôs Advisory Team decided to build the Kala network privately until reaching a 40 PH/s threshold. A 40 PH threshold (comprised of 10,000 mining rigs of 4 TH each) would place Kala as a very real contender in the space.  Since the cryptocurrency arena does change rapidly, the advisory team will continue to monitor and strategize during the network building phases, and may choose to adjust the threshold. Those who participate early will still enjoy the biggest rewards, regardless of the final hash power threshold.  Future Network Opportunities  When the Kala network reaches a threshold 40 PH/s with 10,000 distributed, decentralized rigs, it will be one of the largest and strongest blockchain networks with true decentralization. Right now, it can be argued that large mining pools actually control the networks they mine, which can make it intimidating and difficult for smaller companies or cryptocurrencies to compete for mining hash power on these large blockchain networks. And once they do get on, there is the very real possibility that the controlling mining pools and entities could end up taking over them. Because of this, the demand for alternatives is growing. Our network can be leveraged for others to build on, which would offer many of these smaller newcomers a safer, more secure option. Those already in our network would be positioned to benefit from such partnerships.  Blockchain technology is quickly becoming a revolutionary force within today‚Äôs business world, and this is just the beginning. Industries like banks and financial institutions, retail, health care, humanitarian initiatives, real estate, and more are already looking at implementing blockchain solutions. All those business applications need to be built on a network, and many companies would prefer to use an existing one instead of creating their own. It is essentially a race to build the infrastructure (the networks) for all these future applications. This opens incredible opportunities for us to partner with others to build their technologies on our network‚Äî and for our users to benefit.  Kala Mining Rigs  Symatri has negotiated and formed partnerships to acquire mining hardware that is currently in high demand and can be difficult to find. These exclusive and ready-to-mine rigs will ship pre-configured to mine Kala.  ‚Ä¢ Kala rigs can only be purchased through Symatri‚Äôs supplier. ‚Ä¢ Kala rigs will be the only way to mine Kala until the blockchain goes public. ‚Ä¢ Kala rigs are built on the SHA-256 algorithm. ‚Ä¢ Each rig produces 4 TH/s. This limit allows for even further decentralization and distribution width.  Sale Details  Symatri is offering Kala rigs to the Kala community and our partners at exclusive,discounted prices, beginning with a pre-sale before the Kala blockchain is finalized. In this way Symatri can offer great rewards to early supporters as they become part of the growing network.  Pre-sales will only last until the Kala blockchain is launched. We will continue to sell and distribute rigs after Kala‚Äôs blockchain has launched and throughout the private phase until we reach the network hash power threshold.  Full sale details can be found at https://kalatoken.io/kala-rigs.

Date Dependent on Previous Milestones ‚Äì Get on Exchange Kala is accepted onto crypto exchanges with a stable and consistent value.  Date Dependent on Previous Milestones ‚Äì Finish Integrating Kala into Symatri‚Äôs Ecosystem:CORE, Reach, etc.  CORE members and Kala users will be able utilize their purchased/earned Kala to buy items in Symatri‚Äôs Reach marketplace.  NOTE: At the date this document is published, Symatri intends to follow through as described in this white paper. However, changes in business strategy, the regulatory environment, technologies, and other unforeseen circumstances may necessitate deviations from the described plan. Symatri intends to faithfully follow through on execution of the plan outlined, but retains the right to deviate as needed to succeed.  After the ITO   Fund Allocation & Future Development  Growing and strengthening the Symatri Ecosystem is at the heart of fulfilling our mission, instilling hope, and effecting change across the world. Funds raised through the ITO will be used for: building out the additional infrastructure so we can reach and help more people, business development, operational expenses, partnerships, employees, and owners.   Safety of Funds  All funds will be held in escrow during the ITO. When the crowdsale ends, before the final number of Kala tokens sold will be created and distributed, we will do an audit of deposits to ensure accuracy. Where possible, two-of-three multi-sig addresses will be used to secure funds.  Kala tokens will be generated and issued following an audit and confirmation of the receipt of contributions. This protects the issued Kala from fraud and backs all issued coins with real monetary value.  Wallet  As part of joining the Kala ITO, all participants will create a secure wallet. This wallet is where Kala coins will be delivered upon the closing of the ITO. Symatri employees do not have access to participant wallets. Management of these wallets is the responsibility of the participant, including the withdrawal or exchange of coins. Following the final audit, all Kala will be available for transfer to participant wallets.  Conclusion   The Symatri Ecosystem is perfectly structured to foster a vibrant economy around the Kala cryptocurrency. Members can earn Kala through CORE activities or traditional crypto mining. With the Reach marketplace, all Kala users can purchase from a vast array of discounted products and services. The value of Kala is backed by its use within the Symatri Ecosystem and the network itself being built around the coin. The network becomes an additional asset that backs the value of Kala and can be leveraged for future opportunities.   FOUNDING TEAM & ADVISORS          Note : I am not the adm or devoloper.

DID YOU KNOW??? Kala users will be able to EARN Kala every time they shop at their favorite online stores. Symatri is excited to bring an exclusive opportunity where CORE members can earn points by shopping through our Retail Rewards portal. After Kala‚Äôs ITO, CORE members will be able to convert their CORE points into Kala, and use their points to purchase quality products at discounted prices within our REACH marketplace. Opening later this year, Retail Rewards allows members the ability to acquire cryptocurrency through everyday shopping.  Retail Rewards partners with thousands of online retailers to make earning rewards quick and user-friendly. Some of the companies we are partnering with include:     Retail Rewards Makes Earning Kala Easy  Retail Rewards offers members incredible deals, online discounts, and coupons like free shipping, holiday sales, or special offers. From shopping at home or on the go, members earn points for every item or service they purchase through the reward portal.  For Example: According to Forbes, the average holiday shopper planned to spend $1,175 on gifts in 2016. If a person spent that $1,175 through our Retail Rewards portals and received 5% back (an average offering), then they would get back $58.75 in CORE points on holiday shopping alone, that could then be exchanged for Kala.  Whether you‚Äôre shopping for gifts, clothes, home decor, or everyday grocery items, each Retail Rewards purchase made earns you Kala. It‚Äôs that easy!

Some of the crypto directories you can find Kala on include:  CoinHills Coin Spectator Coin Market Alert ICO Buffer What News Outlets Are Saying About Kala Having transparency and establishing credibility are vital components in having a successful ITO. Symatri‚Äôs Advisory team is dedicated to providing clear and accurate information about how Kala works everyone. And, the media is noticing! Take a look.    Last weekend, Kala gained even more media attention when Global Crypto Press released their online interview with Symatri‚Äôs CEO Darren Olayan. They discussed  how Kala is different from other crypto tokens by having the opportunity to both earn and purchase Kala is revolutionizing how people can get into the cryptocurrency market. Mr. Olayan believes that  ‚Äúcryptocurrency is a hot topic right now, and the mainstream public is trying to understand it and the nearly unlimited applications.

ICO/ITO‚Äôs are typically created as a way to raise capital funding for building a  business or product. Most purchasers buy into an ITO with the hopes that the business or product will become a huge success. But most ITO‚Äôs are valued low or not at all until after the ITO closes. This is where Kala is uniquely different from other ITO‚Äôs or cryptocurrencies. Designed as an accessible and easy-to-use crypto token, Kala gives users the ability to get into the crypto game now!  Why Kala Stands Out From Other Cryptocurrencies  Kala Has Immediate Value: Most ITO‚Äôs use the funds raised from token purchases to build a platform or product their purchasers can use in the future. However, Kala will be implemented into Symatri‚Äôs REACH, a digital online marketplace that is operational now.  Kala Can Be Earned: In addition to direct purchases, Kala can be earned through Symatri‚Äôs CORE product. Members can earn points by completing a wide variety of marketing activities including surveys, downloading apps, playing games, etc. Members can then convert their CORE points into Kala.  Kala‚Äôs Has Instant Purchasing Power: Kala users can use Kala to purchase discounted products, services, and gift cards.  Kala is Built on the Ethereum Blockchain: As a certified ERC20 token, Kala is built on an existing framework that has been tested and proven, eliminating trial and error and increasing reliability and efficiency. ERC20 tokens can also be used immediately once implemented into an exchange or platform.  ITO Referral Program: Unlike most ITO‚Äôs, Kala users can earn 5% on every referral ITO purchase made before the ITO closes.  Earn Kala Through Online Shopping: Later this year, Symatri will open their Retail Rewards program that allows CORE members to earn Kala every time they purchase items or services at one of their online partners. Some of these partners include Walmart, Best Buy, Amazon, Home Depot, and hundreds more!  Mining Kala is Easy: Kala can be mined through Proof of Effort. Anyone with the internet can mine Kala by completing simple CORE tasks. No expensive equipment or training required. With Kala currently priced at only $0.02, now is the best time to purchase Kala!   https://kalatoken.io/kala-changing-game-cryptocurrency/   Over the past few weeks, Kala‚Äôs advisory team has seen and heard user requests to add an ITO referral bonus program. And they were eager to make that happen! Starting today, as a ‚ÄúThank You‚Äù for supporting and believing in Kala, Symatri released a Kala Referral Program that provides users the opportunity to earn 5% on every direct referral ITO purchase. This means that Kala‚Äôs ITO is not only offering Kala at ground level pricing, but users can now earn more Kala by simply sharing it with your family and friends.  How The Kala Referral Plan Works For You You can refer people in two ways:  Referral Link: When someone clicks your referral link, they‚Äôll be directed to our ITO page, where they can create an account. Referral Code: A referral can sign up on their own on our ITO page and simply enter your referral code. Those who already have an account can go in and add your referral code on their account Profile page. If a referral completes either option, they will be marked with your referral code and you will receive 5% of their ITO purchases from Feb. 13 through Mar. 15, 2018 in Kala tokens!  For example, if a user from your referral link purchases 1,000 KALA you will receive 50 KALA.",False
