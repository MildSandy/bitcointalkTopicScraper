To develop all the elements of the finished work product, we are faced with the high costs of paying for the work of specialists, which we can not cover on our own. Making a conclusion from our mistakes, for the development of the platform and the creation of an innovative ecosystem in the field of tourism, we choose an unusual way of attracting funds from investors, but by selling our tokens to the COT to people and organizations who will use it.  About US  The tourism industry is one of the largest industries in the world, which shows steady growth every year. It provides employment for more than 292 million people, or 10.2% of the worldâ€™s employment structure. Travel has changed significantly in recent years. To simplify the calculations during the trips, tourists first used cash, then travelerâ€™s checks, and, ultimately, payment cards. With the development of means of transport and the invention of airplanes, traveling from one end of the world to the other became very easy. However, we at Coin Tour believe that we can raise this level even higher. Our project can help you as quickly as possible and easily plan your vacation in advance. We are planning to connect the tourism industry to the blockchain in order to simplify travel, reduce their cost and make them safer. We provide services to our customers, so we always focus on a special attitude to the service. The advantages of this project are security, transparency, speed and decentralization. Paying coins CoinTour (COT), you do not have to worry about high commissions when exchanging for cash, using an ATM or credit card. Unlike cash or credit cards that you take with you on a trip, coins COT can not be lost or stolen. We are doing everything possible to be proud of our services, and we also hope that COT will not only change peopleâ€™s notions of travel, but the world as a whole  Here is the token specification: Name: CoinTour Name: Contract address: 0xA7dF9FE76B5C4928DE450AFE0b2fF95a968640c2 Symbol: COT Max amount: 100000000 Decimals: 8  Stages:  Token Presale Dates 26.03.18-09.04.18 14800000 COT available Price 1 COT = 0.0000625 ETH Presale Bonus 40%  ICO Round 1 Dates 30.04.18-10.05.18 18500000 COT available Price 1 COT = 0.0001 ETH Round 1 Bonus 25%  Round 2 Dates 10.05.18-20.05.18 18500000 COT available Price 1 COT = 0.0001 ETH Round 2 Bonus 15%  Round 3 Dates 20.05.18-30.05.18 22220000 COT available Price 1 COT = 0.0001 ETH    Minimal amount of investition is 0.01 ETH  GET COT TOKENS  Distribution  Totally maximum created can be 100 000 000 tokens COT. We do not pursue the profits, but we aim to create a great decentralized community, so 10% of all coins are allocated to the team;instead the main part of the whole number will be received by investors and the members of our campaign, which will be the basis of our joint crypto-family.   A coin fund of 10% will be created separately, which will be reserved for the uninterrupted work of the COT token exchange resource in ETH, or BTC, and vice versa.        4% of all coins have been allocated to the advertising campaign, namely 4,000,000 COTs, more details about it can be found on our official website.    We also have a 2% fund for members of our community who have been with us since very beginning of activity. They will have the opportunity to exchange our old coins for new ones in the ratio of 10 to 1, after the end of all stages of the ICO.    All tokens that remain after the exchange of old coins to new ones will be automatically burned after the end of the exchange period, all this is written in the smart contract. The remainder of the tokens after the ICO (if any) will also be burned after the last stage of the ICO.   The distribution of CoinTour Token looks as follows:    The minimum necessary amount for project implementation (SoftCap) is defined by us in the amount of 400 ETH.   Its fast and high-quality implementation with the involvement of leading specialists and a wide advertising campaign will require 5968 ETH (HardCap).  Use of funds     Road map   We appreciate all the participants who have been with us from the very beginning and helped us with the development of our project. In gratitude, we created a separate fund that will allow you to exchange old tokens for new ones, at a rate of 10:1, after the end of the ICO",False
