You are able to pay rent for using AirPod unit.  2. You can become a ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù of an AirPod unit only with APOD token. In Sponsorship Program, ICO contributors to exchange APOD tokens for the right to participate and earn up to 80% profits generated by AirPod unit every single month. ICO contributors will have the value of their tokens doubled when entering Sponsorship Program meaning they will be able to become a Sponsor of twice as much of the AirPod as if APOD tokens would be bought after the ICO. Example: If the AirPod price is set at $32.k ICO contributor will pay $16.k in APOD tokens gained in ICO.  3. You get a possibility to become an AirPod‚Äôs Partner. With our ‚ÄúPartnership Program‚Äù we are establishing a global network of AirPods that will enable everyone to become part of an Uber-like, but much more profitable Business model. In this last stage of our project development, you will be able to propose any place in your domain as a new potential AirPod location. If the location is suitable we‚Äôll support the engagement 100% by sending AirPod directly to the proposed location. The Partnership Program will enable you to earn a passive income in APODs with peace of mind.  4. APOD token is not conditioned by unstable crypto market. For a cryptocurrency to be successful over time it must be driven by a sustainable economy. As customers use the AirPod and distribution grows, the ecosystems network effect will grow, building its value, and bringing lasting rewards for participants in the sponsorship program and token holders.

You are able to pay rent for using AirPod unit.  2. You can become a ‚Äúsponsor‚Äù of an AirPod unit. In Sponsorship Program, ICO contributors to exchange APOD tokens for the right to participate and earn up to 80% profits generated by AirPod unit every single month. ICO contributors will have the value of their tokens doubled when entering Sponsorship Program meaning they will be able to become a Sponsor of twice as much of the AirPod as if APOD tokens would be bought after the ICO. Example: If the AirPod price is set at $32.k ICO contributor will pay $16.k in APOD tokens gained in ICO.  3. You get a possibility to become an AirPod‚Äôs Partner. With our ‚ÄúPartnership Program‚Äù we are establishing a global network of AirPods that will enable everyone to become part of an Uber-like, but much more profitable Business model. In this last stage of our project development, you will be able to propose any place in your domain as a new potential AirPod location. If the location is suitable we‚Äôll support the engagement 100% by sending AirPod directly to the proposed location. The Partnership Program will enable you to earn a passive income in APODs with peace of mind.  4. APOD token is not conditioned by unstable crypto market. For a cryptocurrency to be successful over time it must be driven by a sustainable economy. As customers use the AirPod and distribution grows, the ecosystems network effect will grow, building its value, and bringing lasting rewards for participants in the sponsorship program and token holders.

The shortest answer to your question is: there are 2 way you will profit out of your contribution: a) as token holder/owner. The potential increase of value is in execution of: as we split the received FIAT (payment for rent): using 50% for our company costs and the remaining 50% for buying Tokens on exchange at market price and placing sell orders (sell wall) at equivalent value of $2 in both ETH/APOD and BTC/APOD pairings. While the number of distributed AirPods and users will grow the frequency of Tokens we buy from the Exchange grows, as a result, the value of APOD token will automatically increase over time. This simply means that more AirPods are installed and more users are generated, the frequency of Token buyback from the exchange and placing them back at a higher price, will increase with the price of APOD Token. b) as ICO contributor you will be able to convert APOD tokens to a Sponsorship Program for each installed AirPod unit for an indefinite time period thus establishing a profit-sharing relationship (Reward), giving you the possibility to manage unit(s) and own the right to collect fees in APOD Tokens. This simply means you are eligable to collect profits from profit generated by AirPod unit(s). It is like owning mining machine but better/more profitable.",False

But the most important part why ICO:  a) collecting funds needed to kick of the project that will be distributed like this:  61% Production and distribution 17% Marketing 15% Company operations 5% DAPP Platform development 2% Legal  As you can see the main part of budget will be used for Production of new AirPods as this drives the APOD-Crypto-Economy.  b) We see the potential of BC use wider than typical ICO. Beside implementation of our token (which is also one of the ways to rent our Airpod), the BC will be used in the development or DApp platform. Primary use of the DApp platform is general management, economic overview, and control of the individual AirPod unit(s). At the same time it is enabling complete transparency, helping us control and grow our business. More about this is written in our WP on pages: 31,32, 36, 37, 38. In addition BC enables processes on DApp platform (below) faster, cheaper and more transparent than ever:  OLD WAY  ‚Ä¢ Auditing. ‚Ä¢ Preparation and coordination of legal opinions and contracts (the relationship between participants). ‚Ä¢ Signing agreements. ‚Ä¢ Sales (trade) ""rights"" on profits made by Airpod unit (process). ‚Ä¢ Transparency - tracking and permissions. ‚Ä¢ Cross border Payments.  VS BLOCKCHAIN  ‚Ä¢ Smart Contract and token solves all of the mentioned problems.

The potential increase of value is in execution of: as we split the received FIAT (payment for rent): using 50% for our company costs and the remaining 50% for buying Tokens on exchange at market price and placing sell orders (sell wall) at equivalent value of $2 in both ETH/APOD and BTC/APOD pairings. While the number of distributed AirPods and users will grow the frequency of Tokens we buy from the Exchange grows, as a result, the value of APOD token will automatically increase over time. This simply means that more AirPods are installed and more users are generated, the frequency of Token buyback from the exchange and placing them back at a higher price, will increase with the price of APOD Token. b) as ICO contributor you will be able to convert APOD tokens to a Sponsorship Program for each installed AirPod unit for an indefinite time period thus establishing a profit-sharing relationship (Reward), giving you the possibility to manage unit(s) and own the right to collect fees in APOD Tokens. This simply means you are eligable to collect profits from profit generated by AirPod unit(s). It is like owning mining machine but better/more profitable.",False

ICO contributors will be able to convert APOD tokens to a Sponsorship Program through DApp platform for each installed AirPod unit for an indefinite time period thus establishing a profit-sharing relationship (Reward), giving them the responsibility to manage unit(s) and right to collect fees in APOD Tokens.This stage is planned at (1) 400 installed AirPods; or after or (2) 1 year of business (whichever happens first). Since APOD token is transforming to a security token, we plan to act accordingly, listing it on the exchange that will support our token type.    As mentioned before, the DApp will offer APOD token holders (ICO contributors) the option of token conversion to a Sponsorship Program of the already set-up AirPods. The platform will enable contributors to make a financial analysis of the individual AirPods free of charge and help them decide which AirPod they choose. The price of a Sponsorship Program (value of a single AirPod) is adjusted in accordance with its projected financial performance - the initial price algorithm is set by us.  In case multiple parties express interest in a specific AirPod, token holders will be able to bid for the chosen AirPod. When interest is high, the cost to participate in the Sponsorship Program will rise accordingly. Tokens are the only currency used for the Sponsorship Program as well as for the reward percentage payouts. The Sponsorship Program gives contributors a chance to participate in profit shares (rewards) for the specific AirPod.  Participants in the Sponsorship program can buy a percentage (depending on the number of purchased APOD tokens), of each Sponsorship Program which can also be sold to other interested parties. Also, additional Sponsorship Program(s) can be created for a specific percentage of other AirPod unit(s). Sponsorship Program participants get their monthly reward payouts to the account they've created on the platform.",False

What we do know is that out of advanced economic calculations, we are able to simulate potential value on a basis of the business model and token flow. But again, it is not something we would consider to discuss publicly yet.  Strictly technically looking the basic value of token will increase because it's linked directly to company's revenue stream. Please read the explanation: We split the received FIAT (payment for rent): using 50% for our company costs and the remaining 50% for buying Tokens on exchange at market price and placing sell orders (sell wall) of 0.023 APOD/ETH or/and 0.0002 APOD/BTC at today's equivalent value. While the number of distributed AirPods and users will grow the frequency of Tokens we buy from the Exchange grows, as a result, the value of APOD token will automatically increase over time. This simply means that more AirPods are installed and more users are generated, the frequency of Token buyback from the exchange and placing them back at a higher price, will increase with the price of APOD Token.",False

The main reason for potential APOD token value increase lays in our technical execution after receiving FIAT payment for AirPod service. We split the receiving FIAT and use 50% for buying Tokens at the lowest price possible and placing them back to exchange at higher fixed price $2. While the number of AirPods and users will grow, the value of APOD token will automatically increase over time. So when more AirPods are installed and user number grows, the frequency of bought Tokens from the exchange and placing them back at a higher price, will increase the price of APOD Token.  Blockchain is essential part of our business growth. The platform is the key to our success, which will also be a marketplace where users will be able to trade Sponsorship Programs in Stage 2. The key to project success is an ecosystem, which connects all AirPods in various locations around the world with a platform that enables franchise model distribution based on the Blockchain technology (in Stage 3). For more detailed info check WP pages 36-37.  Hope this helps.",False

Our mission is simple: to improve the traveler‚Äôs experience by building a unit to Relax, Work, Sleep and Have fun in complete privacy while waiting in transit. We will achieve this by creating AirPod Sleeping Pod, a state-of-the-art product that meets the needs of the traveler and develop a platform for marketing those pods on different markets, starting with airports and potential use in hotels, railway & bus stations, shopping centers, offices and more, wherever people are seeking an area to relax, work or have work in privacy. Blockchain technology is essential for our business growth and strategy, that is why we are looking for community support and contribution to our business model during the Crowdsale event. We want to improve customer experience and offer travelers a balanced, comfortable and affordable space that will offer free Wi-Fi, comfort, privacy, security and relaxation. AirPod Capsule is a private ‚Äúcapsule style‚Äù designed with health, relaxation, and functionality in mind. By combining the latest technologies of special awareness, ergonomics, light, sensory, and vision we developed a comprehensive solution for transit passengers. The technology and range of services available in an AirPod fills a gap in the market for luxury services at affordable prices and offers a very similar alternative to the various already existing VIP lounges at airports. We have integrated anti-stress technology that Relaxes & Revitalizes, since stress is a major issue that our users have in common. According to scientific studies, various scents, sounds and colors stimulate cognitive recognition in the brain. That is why AirPod has integrated technology, which targets our three most important senses ‚Äì smell, vision and hearing. During a 15-minute treatment, all three senses are being monitored by the Biofeedback device (before and after effect). Our vision is to see AirPods implemented in every major airport across the globe before moving onto the smaller airports. We believe AirPod will become the ultimate unit for rest, relaxation, and privacy within airports (and later other locations).",False

We are placing minimum 10 AirPods per smaller airport and minimum 30 AirPods per airport on larger airports. To answer your question why we specified 1000 AirPods by 2021. This figure is based on our own pace of expansion without 3rd phase where general public can propose new locations beside airports for AirPods. As you can see from whitepaper page 24 there are 724 international airports worldwide. We are targeting 284 airports. Keep in mind that airports are our primary market. We are placing AirPods to other public places in later phase which means additional business potential.  I hope that explains your question.,False

I see that it could be actually useful, even for people outside of crypto world. I must admit that I didn't read the wp. yet, so I'm sorry if this following question it answered there. Speaking about people outside of crypto-world, what payments methods going to implemented for a nap, excluding the token of course? Have you foreseen the cabins maintenance cost? Are they going to be insured by old-fashion systems? And last but not least, what your big-data policy going to be? (please say you wont gather B.D)",False
