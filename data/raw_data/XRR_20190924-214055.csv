We decided to extend the ICO to establish crucial partnership deals to help grow our ecosystem. We would like to introduce the first set of partners to you:  Pecun.io  is a decentralized investment platform that focuses on blue-chip blockchain assets with unique value proposition and high performance potential, whose products and services cover the whole lifecycle of blockchain innovation: From angel & venture capital investments (AC & VC) and initial coin offerings (ICO), to cryptocurrencies and asset-backed tokens.  Ligercoin.com  is a top end blockchain technology led safe cryptocurrency for Online/Offline Gaming and Casinos and access to Fantasy Sports, which ensures liquidity through regular and large acceptance thereby minimizing concerns like privacy, taboo, liquidity, speed of settlement and safety.  Rootblockchain.io  is the first hybrid blockchain with flexible options for both enterprise and retail customers, it’s also API driven, which means that businesses can reap the benefits of blockchain technology without the accompanying complexity.  Viso.global is a holistic payment solution for individuals and businesses that combines cryptocurrency and generally accepted payment cards and terminals into a single environment.  Plaak.com  is a project that began in an effort to find a solution for the perceived incompatibility of incorporating blockchain technology more cohesively into people’s everyday lives, in a constructive manner.  Amon.tech  is a wallet that allows users to manage all the assets in one place, with a top-level user experience.  Alttex.io  is a digital platform with a decentralized exchange, personalized crypto-messenger and a Smart Safe. It enables users network and collaborate on the go through messenger.  Dice.money is a revolutionary cryptocurrency which features great simplicity and different operational model compared to the rest. The main goal is to allow DICE to enter the everyday life as a normal currency alternative to the traditional money, while at the same time complete decentralisation gives power to social groups to raise funds through cryptomining. Users can now invest in business by simply mining DICE for that business.   We are working hard to get listed on Exchanges, and will have more partners to announce.

The ICO will be extended by 30 days after initial end date to have time to continue marketing & pursuing investments/partnerships.   As the market is gradually recovering from massive price declines that were experienced in Q1 2018 and investor confidence is slowly creeping in. We believe this extension in the current market uptrend will help us achieve the aim of the ICO.  New ICO end date = 9th June, 2018.12 Noon UTC.  We say a big thank you for your understanding and support up until this point and beyond.

Note that these were the metrics i used Other metrics such as suitability index will be added. Please make sure to read the whitepaper!  INFO ON XRR  I will try to be as concise as possible... And also explain in simple terms  XRR (XhangeRateRobot) is in 2 parts; automated trading by the robot and manual trading via the CMB (Coin Monitoring Board)  The analysis carried out by the xchange rate and the primary difference is that via the manual trading the coin monitoring board you need to place the trades yourself manually on the exchange. The coin monitoring board then gives signal on when to exit the trade but with the involvement of robot, trades are executed automatically without a trader having to be online...  An image of how the CMB looks like is shown here https://imgur.com/a/FgIZ0  The CMB connects you to the activities on the exchange of your choice by aiding your analysis of which COIN you are supposed to trade using certain metrics. These metrics are broken into Frugality Ratio (FR) and Price Relativity Ratio (PRR)  First is the FRUGALITY RATIO (FR) parameter which is further broken down to 1.   EXCHANGE TREND 2.   MARKETCAP 3.   LIQUIDITY 4.   1HR IMPACT  EXCHANGE TREND - Seeks to check the difference btw the last BUY & SELL on the exchange- If it is positive it gives a 25% Score  MARKETCAP - Seeks to capture the INFLOW or OUTFLOW of funds from the last MARKETCAP .If positive gives a 25% score and if negative 0  LIQUIDITY - Which gives you the BTC under BUY & SELL within the Last Trading Hour- If more than 0 give 25% score. It is VERY IMPORTANT to CHECK LIQUIDITY of a COIN to know How soon you can get Value on your COIN because this shows the DEMAND vs SUPPLY element on that exchange.  1hr impact - seeks to measure the BTC addition to this coin between what value it was before the change and now. If it is positive it shows 25% if its negative it shows 0  The Total Score could show 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% A score of 100% simply says that the coin has full live activity. The 100% does NOT however mean it is OKAY to buy the COIN. - Your Strategy is your own so you need to have strategy preferences based on your Trade Appetite.  As a Trader- You can choose to Trade often on minimum value or Trade Seldom(Not Too Often) based on high or very High metrics I have proved over time and time again that the higher the METRICS the better the result is.   The SECOND ELEMENT is the PRICE RELATIVITY RATIO (PRR)  The PRR has so much power because it compares the actual Price and Exchange price relativity  The Total MarketCap is the total value of fiat that has gone into the purchase of that coin from all over the world. GAP is the Global Accepted Price of a coin CPP is the Current Perceived Price on exchanges  So we have GAP and CPP. The GAP and CPP based on PRR are the 2 elements you should look out for when making a buy or sell decision on a coin. The CPP always goes towards the GAP. So the higher the PRR the better the profit potential of your purchase.  By combining all of the above mentioned metrics, you will be amazed how this works...  See here https://imgur.com/a/VZuaR my trades in the past 12 hours and from two days ago... despite the current trend in the market  This is definitely the tool if you intend to earn a living trading.

The mvp is to let prospective user track the performance of the robot - using its historical accuracy. The map reports entry position signals and follows up these signals with the highest price attained.  The User can however exit positions at any point of the price movement. The mvp will.not suggest an exit.  Exit is in the full discretion of the user.  The mvp does not request any user information API or secret key so it's open to all.  The Price and time of entry is what is most important so when a user gets notification from the mvp. It is the responsibility of the user to get in at the recommended price or lower price bounce so a to move with the signal.  The mvp is strict so when market is bearish signals aren't as much as when market is bullish.  The mvp intends to deploy a stat that's self rating so new entrants can peruse the previous performance of the mvp to judge the reliability of its recommendations,False

It detects and analysis market movement and then suggests which coins to buy and equally tells you right time to sell BUT it will not do execute the trades for you so you must execute the trades yourself on your trading account. Xchangerate robot makes use of several metrics which range from PRR, suitability index e.t.c to give accurate buy/sell signals which are accurate 90% of the time from my experience. Auto trading: this is basically the same but the major difference is that it executes trades on your behalf using the same metrics meaning trades can be done while you are offline.

Please make sure to read the whitepaper!  INFO ON XRR  I will try to be as concise as possible... And also explain in simple terms  XRR (XhangeRateRobot) is in 2 parts; automated trading by the robot and manual trading via the CMB (Coin Monitoring Board)  The analysis carried out by the xchange rate and the primary difference is that via the manual trading the coin monitoring board you need to place the trades yourself manually on the exchange. The coin monitoring board then gives signal on when to exit the trade but with the involvement of robot, trades are executed automatically without a trader having to be online...  An image of how the CMB looks like is shown here https://imgur.com/a/FgIZ0  The CMB connects you to the activities on the exchange of your choice by aiding your analysis of which COIN you are supposed to trade using certain metrics. These metrics are broken into Frugality Ratio (FR) and Price Relativity Ratio (PRR)  First is the FRUGALITY RATIO (FR) parameter which is further broken down to 1.   EXCHANGE TREND 2.   MARKETCAP 3.   LIQUIDITY 4.   1HR IMPACT  EXCHANGE TREND - Seeks to check the difference btw the last BUY & SELL on the exchange- If it is positive it gives a 25% Score  MARKETCAP - Seeks to capture the INFLOW or OUTFLOW of funds from the last MARKETCAP .If positive gives a 25% score and if negative 0  LIQUIDITY - Which gives you the BTC under BUY & SELL within the Last Trading Hour- If more than 0 give 25% score. It is VERY IMPORTANT to CHECK LIQUIDITY of a COIN to know How soon you can get Value on your COIN because this shows the DEMAND vs SUPPLY element on that exchange.  1hr impact - seeks to measure the BTC addition to this coin between what value it was before the change and now. If it is positive it shows 25% if its negative it shows 0  The Total Score could show 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% A score of 100% simply says that the coin has full live activity. The 100% does NOT however mean it is OKAY to buy the COIN. - Your Strategy is your own so you need to have strategy preferences based on your Trade Appetite.  As a Trader- You can choose to Trade often on minimum value or Trade Seldom(Not Too Often) based on high or very High metrics I have proved over time and time again that the higher the METRICS the better the result is.   The SECOND ELEMENT is the PRICE RELATIVITY RATIO (PRR)  The PRR has so much power because it compares the actual Price and Exchange price relativity  The Total MarketCap is the total value of fiat that has gone into the purchase of that coin from all over the world. GAP is the Global Accepted Price of a coin CPP is the Current Perceived Price on exchanges  So we have GAP and CPP. The GAP and CPP based on PRR are the 2 elements you should look out for when making a buy or sell decision on a coin. The CPP always goes towards the GAP. So the higher the PRR the better the profit potential of your purchase.  By combining all of the above mentioned metrics, you will be amazed how this works...  See here https://imgur.com/a/VZuaR my trades in the past 12 hours and from two days ago... despite the current trend in the market  This is definitely the tool if you intend to earn a living trading.

Xchangerate robot function in basically two ways.  The manual trading: How this works is that xchange rate platform which get data from several exchanges. Analysis those data using several unique metrics. It detects and analysis market movement and then suggests which coins to buy and equally tells you right time to sell BUT it will not do execute the trades for you so you must execute the trades yourself on your trading account. Xchangerate robot makes use of several metrics which range from PRR, suitability index e.t.c to give accurate buy/sell signals which are accurate 90% of the time from my experience. Auto trading: this is basically the same but the major difference is that it executes trades on your behalf using the same metrics meaning trades can be done while you are offline. Your account is connected via API manual trading is recommended for those skeptical about API connections for fear of compromise.

Note that these were the metrics i used Other metrics such as suitability index will be added. Please make sure to read the whitepaper!  INFO ON XRR  I will try to be as concise as possible... And also explain in simple terms  XRR (XhangeRateRobot) is in 2 parts; automated trading by the robot and manual trading via the CMB (Coin Monitoring Board)  The analysis carried out by the xchange rate and the primary difference is that via the manual trading the coin monitoring board you need to place the trades yourself manually on the exchange. The coin monitoring board then gives signal on when to exit the trade but with the involvement of robot, trades are executed automatically without a trader having to be online...  An image of how the CMB looks like is shown here https://imgur.com/a/FgIZ0  The CMB connects you to the activities on the exchange of your choice by aiding your analysis of which COIN you are supposed to trade using certain metrics. These metrics are broken into Frugality Ratio (FR) and Price Relativity Ratio (PRR)  First is the FRUGALITY RATIO (FR) parameter which is further broken down to 1.   EXCHANGE TREND 2.   MARKETCAP 3.   LIQUIDITY 4.   1HR IMPACT  EXCHANGE TREND - Seeks to check the difference btw the last BUY & SELL on the exchange- If it is positive it gives a 25% Score  MARKETCAP - Seeks to capture the INFLOW or OUTFLOW of funds from the last MARKETCAP .If positive gives a 25% score and if negative 0  LIQUIDITY - Which gives you the BTC under BUY & SELL within the Last Trading Hour- If more than 0 give 25% score. It is VERY IMPORTANT to CHECK LIQUIDITY of a COIN to know How soon you can get Value on your COIN because this shows the DEMAND vs SUPPLY element on that exchange.  1hr impact - seeks to measure the BTC addition to this coin between what value it was before the change and now. If it is positive it shows 25% if its negative it shows 0  The Total Score could show 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% A score of 100% simply says that the coin has full live activity. The 100% does NOT however mean it is OKAY to buy the COIN. - Your Strategy is your own so you need to have strategy preferences based on your Trade Appetite.  As a Trader- You can choose to Trade often on minimum value or Trade Seldom(Not Too Often) based on high or very High metrics I have proved over time and time again that the higher the METRICS the better the result is.   The SECOND ELEMENT is the PRICE RELATIVITY RATIO (PRR)  The PRR has so much power because it compares the actual Price and Exchange price relativity  The Total MarketCap is the total value of fiat that has gone into the purchase of that coin from all over the world. GAP is the Global Accepted Price of a coin CPP is the Current Perceived Price on exchanges  So we have GAP and CPP. The GAP and CPP based on PRR are the 2 elements you should look out for when making a buy or sell decision on a coin. The CPP always goes towards the GAP. So the higher the PRR the better the profit potential of your purchase.  By combining all of the above mentioned metrics, you will be amazed how this works...  See here https://imgur.com/a/VZuaR my trades in the past 12 hours and from two days ago... despite the current trend in the market  This is definitely the tool if you intend to earn a living trading.

And also explain in simple terms  XRR (XhangeRateRobot) is in 2 parts; automated trading by the robot and manual trading via the CMB (Coin Monitoring Board)  The analysis carried out by the xchange rate and the primary difference is that via the manual trading the coin monitoring board you need to place the trades yourself manually on the exchange. The coin monitoring board then gives signal on when to exit the trade but with the involvement of robot, trades are executed automatically without a trader having to be online...  An image of how the CMB looks like is shown here https://imgur.com/a/FgIZ0  The CMB connects you to the activities on the exchange of your choice by aiding your analysis of which COIN you are supposed to trade using certain metrics. These metrics are broken into Frugality Ratio (FR) and Price Relativity Ratio (PRR)  First is the FRUGALITY RATIO (FR) parameter which is further broken down to 1.   EXCHANGE TREND 2.   MARKETCAP 3.   LIQUIDITY 4.   1HR IMPACT  EXCHANGE TREND - Seeks to check the difference btw the last BUY & SELL on the exchange- If it is positive it gives a 25% Score  MARKETCAP - Seeks to capture the INFLOW or OUTFLOW of funds from the last MARKETCAP .If positive gives a 25% score and if negative 0  LIQUIDITY - Which gives you the BTC under BUY & SELL within the Last Trading Hour- If more than 0 give 25% score. It is VERY IMPORTANT to CHECK LIQUIDITY of a COIN to know How soon you can get Value on your COIN because this shows the DEMAND vs SUPPLY element on that exchange.  1hr impact - seeks to measure the BTC addition to this coin between what value it was before the change and now. If it is positive it shows 25% if its negative it shows 0  The Total Score could show 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% A score of 100% simply says that the coin has full live activity. The 100% does NOT however mean it is OKAY to buy the COIN. - Your Strategy is your own so you need to have strategy preferences based on your Trade Appetite.  As a Trader- You can choose to Trade often on minimum value or Trade Seldom(Not Too Often) based on high or very High metrics I have proved over time and time again that the higher the METRICS the better the result is.   The SECOND ELEMENT is the PRICE RELATIVITY RATIO (PRR)  The PRR has so much power because it compares the actual Price and Exchange price relativity  The Total MarketCap is the total value of fiat that has gone into the purchase of that coin from all over the world. GAP is the Global Accepted Price of a coin CPP is the Current Perceived Price on exchanges  So we have GAP and CPP. The GAP and CPP based on PRR are the 2 elements you should look out for when making a buy or sell decision on a coin. The CPP always goes towards the GAP. So the higher the PRR the better the profit potential of your purchase.  By combining all of the above mentioned metrics, you will be amazed how this works...  See here https://imgur.com/a/VZuaR my trades in the past 12 hours and from two days ago... despite the current trend in the market  As a privileged day trader with access to put the revolutionary CMB to work... the future of trading is limitless",False
