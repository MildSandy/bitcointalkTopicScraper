We appreciate your concern and checks. We also understand the fact that there has been a lot of scams in these space, but we are different. We are small team who has great focus on creating something to help the whole world on a single platform with the ease of the internet anywhere, anytime, anyday.  Regarding funds. Any finds raised can be seen on the Ethereum smart contract and that's why we made ERC20 our choice due to transparency and making everything clear to everyone. We are real and here to stay as well.  As for achievements, the team has different inter personal achievements as entrepreneurs, freelancers, etc and work autonomously in their business fields as well. We came up with this project to solve many ongoing problems globally and we tend to build something useful around the blockchain space with a use case around our token.  We have our profiles on the site, whitepaper and we can easily be reached. We provided real info and we are not hyping our project or feel too eager as great things takes time and more time to make people understand it, people who love great things will locate our project and give us chances to prove our mission.  It's so unfortunate people who tend to do real things are the people who are rather suspected and not supported while leaving those who has hidden identities/bad motives to be praised and welcomed.  We await more queries, critics  and analysis as they will make us stronger and focus while creating a FOMO to unbelievers.  We love you all and all we need is a chance to deliver our goals.",False

Built on the algorithm of proof of freelance and proof of skills. The technology simplifies the process of decentralizing job opportunities, embracing skills, disrupting unemployment. Patents will be stored on blockchain, making them immutable, transparent and secure. Licensing patents will be done through smart contracts, ensuring that all parties meets an agreement.  The platform fully utilizes the capabilities of Blockchain where you could earn money by completing various tasks using Pcoin as base payment currency.   A New Initiative: Pension Coin is a unique digital currency inspired by the pursuit of philanthropy and pareto-optimal game theory. Pension Coin offers a secure and trust-less network to disrupt the non-transparent employment model in the world by making everyone useful and get rewarded via the pension reward platform. On our network, help yourself by helping others.   More transparency: Every transaction will be traceable via the explorer. The information stored in a block will show the distribution allocation. This will also show how rewards are distributed.  With the new transparency system which is completely unique in the blockchain world, we are building barriers which will limit the cases of unemployment, partiality, on the Reward platform. Our target is to build a user-friendly system with the aim to grant the right to freelancers, gurus, who are ready to sell their skills/fields to the decentralized labor market and make something out of it but not as a place for illegal actions/activities. To reach this full transparency is as important as to stay without any strict censorship.  Why This Project?  Pension Rewards Platform was born out of research and passion to see people connect to the outside world, hire or be employed and be happy without fear of been useless, using the strategy ""Find > Make > Earn > Repeat"" and also be granted the ability of having a diversified income source while aiming at expanding the spread of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.  PCoin is utility token usable worldwide – Use it to pay hired freelancers on the platform [crypto token for freelancers and employers], exchange on Crypto trading sites, or exchange into your preferred fiat currency and lots more.  PCoin is going to be issued with a limited amount, therefore, once PCoin spread globally, demand of the token usage on the platform and supply will play its role in value for investors/freelancers to benefit.  The use case of PCoin will also assist the growth in no time. This is not a get rich quick project, it's a long term project with daily usage. If you think it's a get rich quick project.

Or is it? Kindly point it out to me if I am mistaken.  Nevertheless, let's talk about whitepaper. I'd like to know this thing first before other details you state and not state on the WP. One of the selling-point you offer will be a fix to language barrier (pg.13). I took an impression that your solution will enable employer/freelancer from any language to interact/hire/apply rather easily. Like, suppose I am an Arabian with minimum knowledge to english or other prime language and wanted to post a job, I still can somehow interact with a Chinese freelancer who fluent only in mandarin? Or maybe an Italian to an Indian?  And how will this achievable?

How do you exactly plan to look professional and trustworthy if you describe your team as a bunch of instagram influencer-wannabe (and seems failed to be) with their selfies inside a car?  What would happen if the hinge joining fragments of a chain felt apart? Chain would stop being what it used to be when the hinge wasnt broken. This is to illustrate that there will be situations in ur life when u wont be able to resist the impact of negative factors from the outside and will have nothing to do but surrender to my will and serve me as if Im ur master although I dont like this scenario.  I'm sorry, I failed to get what you tried to convey with your message to me. Care to explain more?",False
