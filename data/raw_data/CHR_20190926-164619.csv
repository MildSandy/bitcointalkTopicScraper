Alongside this we are aiming to enable decision power for our donors and a reward system for our active participants. We aim to raise funds with cryptocurrencies and thus, enable our donors to experience low transaction fees. CHERR.IO will use a gamification process to engage with a multitude of interested parties willing to both donate and volunteer for others in need.
