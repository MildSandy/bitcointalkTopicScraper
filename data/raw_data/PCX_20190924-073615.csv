Are the tokens are backed by real estate or real estate co legally?  3. When you sell the property and/or exit the loan, it will be fully taxed at Real Property Holding Corp’s level? Then, I assume you will liquidate the co and recognise a gain at the token holder’s level (which are flew thru to the partnership’s LP and GP). Would there be a distribution to the LP and GP to match the tax so that the token holder will only reinvest the rest to the future project?  4. Did the profit calculation and return calculation on white paper and marketing material consider the federal and state tax?   Answers:  1.  Our US tax advisor is Dentons.  We're also discussing partnerships with both E&Y and Deloitte on Tax, Audit and consulting services post raise.  More to come on that once we complete the STO. 2.  Tokens represent a LP interest in the Token Issuer which is the sole owner of the Real Property Holding Cos.  We do this so we can legally separate loans and properties and account for them accordingly. 3.  Correct.  Taxes are realized on the Real Property Holding Co level on a property by property basis and paid before profits are reinvested.   4.  Those returns include the payment of taxes and all related rehabilitation, listing and sales costs.  Those return numbers do not, however, incorporate leverage and financing costs.  We intentionally did this to show the asset level profitability without the influence of leverage (which is highly dependent on how much/ little leverage is obtained) .

There are 21 million tokens available for sale, we are just targeting a sale of 1 million in this initial sale.  HOWEVER, any unsold tokens have no value and will be owned by the token holders.  Because this is an asset backed token, the value per token should not be diluted by any additional sales because 100% of the net proceeds will be used to buy more real estate assets.  It's very different than traditional ICOs in that way.  Also, we (the management team) are retaining no free tokens. In fact, 100% of our employees have purchased property Coins with their own money.  We want to be 100% aligned with the interests of our token holders.  If the token holders dont make money, we don't make money.  First and foremost, the value proposition of Property Coin is different than most tokens.  It is critically important to remember that, because 100% of the net proceeds of any Property Coins sold will be used to buy assets, subsequent sales will only increase the underlying asset value of ALL Property Coins.  Any Property Coins that are not sold will have NO rights to profits and NO economic value.  Of course, there are no guarantees or assurances when it comes to investing but we believe that future issuances shouldn’t be dilutive to existing coin holders.  Hopefully that helps.  Please feel free to ask any additional questions.  Thanks!",True

That’s not guaranteed and there are definitely risks involved with investing in real estate but in my opinion, I like having an asset backing the value of the coin vs. other ICOs.  2.- We have internal controls in place that were created with the intent of limiting just that scenario (i.e. manipulating returns for our own benefit).  We have managed very similar capital scenarios before and know how to manage these processes.  We pride ourselves on being honest, straightforward and transparent operators and the scenario you’ve detailed would fly in the face of everything we stand for.  Aperture, property Coin and related businesses are our livelihood and we’ve taken great care to build a legal and operating structure that abides by the relevant securities laws and this scenario would certainly violate those.  Separately, we intentionally created our structure so that we are aligned with token holders.  If they don’t make money, we don’t make money so the scenario you asked about wouldn’t be beneficial to us.  Lastly, our goal is to make this a lasting and lucrative project that will help us grow our existing business so we want to be transparent with our investors and provide them with strong and stable returns.  Thank you for your question and I hope I don’t come across as being crass but we truly believe this project will innovate the token and securities markets so we are really passionate about doing things the right and honest way.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask us  BTW just a quick update  We have been reviewed by ICO bench  https://icobench.com/ico/property-coin  Make sure the read through the ratings, watch our up-loaded video and ask us any questions that you might have to convince yourself of our exciting project",True
