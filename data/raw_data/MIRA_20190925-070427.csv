Due to the recent unforeseen changes in the crypto and ICO market, the Mira team made the tough decision to delay the official ICO until April 20.  The thing is that the constant tightening of control and changing of rules by the regulators forced Chinese and European funds, with whom we had reached preliminary agreements, to take time out to reflect and resolve legal issues for legal participation in our ICO. But we strongly believe that this update is in the best interest of all our contributors and early adopters. We take our crowdfunding very seriously and highly value every participant. Thus, we ask for everyone’s support and cooperation.   In that regard, we have great news as well.  During the past two months we are intensely working on the MVP MiraWallet developing. It can already be built and installed onAndroid from the GitHub repository. From now on, the development process is open to the public and available in real time. Test network has already been launched, where three test Mira nodes are currently configured, functioning and interacting with each other. For more detailed information feel free to contact our devs in a new dedicated Telegram chat https://t.me/MiraDev.  But, starting from February 1, all contributors can pre-order the needed amount of MIRA tokens.  ⚜⚜Pay attention that the website https://ico.miralab.io/ was intended for raising funds only during the pre-sale stage. Please do not make any payments as they will not be processed! In order to make a pre-order, click the button below and fill out the form on the next page.⚜⚜",False

But we can reduce the risk of pump&dump to a minimum with the market-making mechanism. We have two reserve funds (see WP): in MIRA token and in cryptocurrency or fiat money, which is about $ 2.0 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively (provided we reach a hard cap). In the future, reserve funds will be used for the MIRA platform. Before we launch it there is no utility demand for tokens and the tokens themselves are relatively illiquid. At this point we will use reserve funds to support the spread of bilateral quotations by the market maker. The market maker will have a rather large resource, which will help to prevent pump&dump schemes.",False

Due to the recent unforeseen changes in the crypto and ICO market, the Mira team made the tough decision to delay the official ICO until April 20.  The thing is that the constant tightening of control and changing of rules by the regulators forced Chinese and European funds, with whom we had reached preliminary agreements, to take time out to reflect and resolve legal issues for legal participation in our ICO. But we strongly believe that this update is in the best interest of all our contributors and early adopters. We take our crowdfunding very seriously and highly value every participant. Thus, we ask for everyone’s support and cooperation.   In that regard, we have great news as well.  During the past two months we are intensely working on the MVP MiraWallet developing. It can already be built and installed onAndroid from the GitHub repository. From now on, the development process is open to the public and available in real time. Test network has already been launched, where three test Mira nodes are currently configured, functioning and interacting with each other.
