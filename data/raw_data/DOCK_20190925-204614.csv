The concept is two-sided. On one side, Dock provides an option for internet users to free themselves from the centralized, monolithic, data-hungry organizations that keep user data hostage in well-guarded silos. At the same time, it provides an option for progressive companies to build services where data exchange between companies is incentivized to break the data silos. Across the board, this data exchange is always controlled by the users’ permission of their own data.  We have been working towards this mission on both the blockchain side, which is the core infrastructure layer to realize the Dock vision, as well as on the user side with a working App for users and APIs for partners to get initiated with the Dock vision.  The biggest challenge that we face, like many other projects that want to use blockchain at scale, is to architect a scalable solution to implement the Dock protocol. A lot of projects on various major blockchains are working on different approaches and we compared a few for our use case in an earlier post. Since then we have successfully developed a POC rooted in a Plasma Cash-based approach.  In this post we will discuss our goals and findings from the POC as well as discuss how it all works together to solve the scalability problem for our use case. We will also share some of the challenges and the road ahead of us.",False

We have one of the largest communities in cryptocurrency with over 64,000 Telegram members. We also have over 200,000 alpha app users and continue to grow by more than 5,000 a day.  Our partner network is growing as well, creating new opportunities for our users to connect their professional data across the internet. In light of this, we are pleased to announce another partner who is joining the dock.io ecosystem: Indorse.  What is Indorse? Indorse is a skill based professional network that gives data ownership back to the users. Unlike traditional platforms, such as LinkedIn, Indorse aims to give back ownership of your data and allows you to profit from sharing your skills and activities on the platform. Indorse uses rewards and a reputation system to incentivize users to add their accomplishments and endorse those of others.  Why Indorse? The alignment with another Ethereum based professional network is obvious. But beyond that, we’re excited at how Indorse is approaching skills validation to make the skills you list on your professional profile have actual value. Through consensus of other expert users or by interacting with AI based systems like chatbots, you can have the skills you list in your profile verified.

One of the biggest problems facing this market sector, however, is the fact that users on the platforms do not own their data. What this means is: if you spend a couple of years on a particular platform and you complete a number of projects, get some reviews and some recommendations etc., you cannot transfer the data to another platform.  dock.io team aims to build a platform that, according to them, will allow the easy integration of data from different sources (not just freelancing websites) along with regular and automatic updates. Users on dock.io should also be able to receive updates from multiple websites at once. Furthermore, data providers — the platforms that the data originates from— may be able to send data to a user’s profile on dock.io with approval from the user.  dock.io team claims that all data stored on their platform will be encrypted by IPFS. Furthermore, all the data on dock.io will be updated by the user off-chain; this should serve to assure applications that the data is a continuation of the previous, and that the version being received is the latest available. Additionally, users on dock.io should be able to verify each others’ on-chain data in a manner similar to employees confirming each others’ work experience.  Different applications may choose the extent of their verification requirements. The options that will likely be available on dock.io are: Loose verification — data from the user is sufficient on its own; Mid-Level verification — additional verification from the data source is required; Strong verification — on-chain signing of the information provided by the user is required.  The token, DOCK, is supposed to be used in rewarding data providers — platforms that give users permission to move their data to dock.io. If a platform wants to access user data that was provided by another platform, the former will pay a fee to the latter using DOCK tokens. Now, if a third-party wants to access the data from the “former”, they will pay a fee, also in DOCK; however, to ensure that the total supply of DOCK is constantly reducing, the DOCK tokens in this transaction will be burned.  Remote is expected to be the first platform that will integrate dock.io, and they already have a working product.  https://medium.com/research-center/dock-io-dock-ico-analysis-a-decentralized-professional-data-exchange-protocol-5a2e99d2d845",False

The sheer pace at which it has caught the public eye is unprecedented amongst all financial terms in the history of the world. To put in perspective the magnitude of this, there are some statistics furnished by icodata.io which are massive to say the least.  In the year 2017, 889 blockchain startups opted for the tokensale and a combined $6,062,538,291 were exchanged for the tokens. In 2018, at the time of writing this article, 186 startups have already opted for tokensale and close to $1.5 Billion dollars have been exchanged for the tokens. And amongst these tokensale champions, most of them have observed the ERC-20 rules meaning that most of the tokens released through Ethereum initial coin offerings are ERC-20 compliant.

You sold $12mil in pre sale at 40% bonus so left only $8mil worth of token at ICO price around $0.07.  This would represent ICO token sale to represent around 12-15% of entire token cap.  Even entire pre sale and ICO sale would represent max 40% of all token.  This has potential for pump and dump as soon as token hits any exchange if 60% or more tokens in hands of owners and pre sale investors that had to invest min $200k.  From small investors point of view this doesn't look as a favourable ICO to invest into.  Also roadmap not have any plans for 2019 like everything is just focused on token finishing ICO, getting on some exchange, 4 months passing from pre sale for investors to unlock 40% bonus they got.  Then high risk every $200k+ private investor starts dumping and ICO investors that represent around 15% of all token holders getting burned.
