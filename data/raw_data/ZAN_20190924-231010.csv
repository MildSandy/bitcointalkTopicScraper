ZAN Coin made international headlines this week with the announcement of their ICO that is set to rock the world of IT and software development. ZAN Coin is a new and effective payment solution that can be utilized in practically any employment situation. One of the aspects that makes ZAN so unique compared to traditional methods of payment is that it utilizes the blockchain’s ability to send a payment anywhere in the world instantaneously. What makes ZAN truly stand out when compared to other cryptocurrencies as a payment option is its unique “tokenomics” model which not only acts as an efficient form of payment, but also as a tokenized asset which provides token holders various incentives that are exclusive to ZAN.  ZANFAU, the company behind the ZAN coin is a successful software development firm that is run by some of the brightest in the business. The team at ZANFAU have a combined experience of over 35 years in a multitude of areas including IT & software development to blockchain development and online marketing. It is this wealth of expertise that has enabled the ZANFAU team to create an ICO that is unlike any other and set to reshape the way employers send payments and how developers interact with the projects they are employed with. Businesses that use the ZAN Coin incentivize their developers to work harder and better by being paid and then receiving a stake in the actual project. Doing this creates a winning environment for everyone involved....",False

Regards, Zan Coin team ----------------------------------------------------------  Hello everybody, My name is Todor Boyadzhievhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/todor-boyadzhiev-1379416/ and I am one of the founders of ZAN Coin Project https://zancoin.tech I just want to lay down what we are planning to do and need your precious feedback.  You may check out our short video that explains our model here https://youtu.be/RiiQH73fIJE  The coin is nothing new in the aspect of technology - it is Ethereum based, but its implementation is the thing that we want to put forward. We are a bunch of people with IT background that already has existing projects and we are working with lots of freelance developers and customers on different locations. We faced a lot of issues with payments and keeping everybody on the same page - that's how we came up with the ZAN Coin idea. Using a cryptocurrency to pay to our developers and motivate them to keep it as an investment is something that we wanted to introduce. We spoke with them and the majority agreed so we created our ICO.  The main points which we want to emphasize on are:   - Speed (payments are made really fast, and tax issues are tackled)  - Motivation (people can keep the coin as an investment - read down and you will know)  - Quality of products (we believe that if we motivate our devs the quality of our products will be better)   So, now you can ask... why don't you use just Ethereum or Bitcoin, or any other existing currency. Here comes the sweet part. We want to pay dividends to each person holding our coin (investor, developer etc.) on a monthly basis. From the sales we make - we will split the winnings 50-50. 50% goes to the company for reinvestment and salaries and so on... and 50% goes as dividends but in the form of ZAN Coins. So if you are a developer that worked for our products you will get dividends based on your own work.  And that's not all... We want to initiate a buy-back option for our coins. What is it? Well - when we get money from our sales (because our customers are using actual money and I am not sure if we can make them use ZAN) then we will buy back coins from the open market in order to pay to devs and pay dividends.  I consider this as a nice option to keep the price of the coin high because of 2 points 1) People will want to keep it because they will get dividends 2) We will be on the buying side as well  That's basically it - now some technical details  Number of tokens: 17,148,385  Investors 70% 12 003 870 Affiliate and bounty 10% 1 714 838 Founders 15% 2 572257 Reserve 5% 857 419  ERC20 Protocol used. We will be accepting ETH and we consider BTC too.  We are still probing the market and I think our presale will start in the middle of this month with coin price 1ETH=1500 ZAN, but if anyone wants to join in he can contact us. We have more people joining our team - developers and people from other companies that want to participate or contribute. Also we are in the middle of negotiation with a soft development company for becoming our partner which is great.

That's why I never deal with erc20 tokens. With coins they take the amount of crap you own and then you sell it. Here you have to spend first and it would cost you more than the tokens worth in total,False
