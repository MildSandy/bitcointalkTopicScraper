So basically X8X is the means through which one can aquire X8C, whereas the X8C can be seen as a SAFE means to store value.  Lets consider the folowing example.  X8X is worth 5 EUROs at Exchange and i own 20.000 X8X, which in turn would worth 100.000 EURO Now i want to ""back UP"" These 100k Euros.  I give the 20k X8X to you, and i receive a certain amount of X8C token, which presumably, has a fixed value. Now when i give you X8X worth of 100k EUROS, you basically issue a certain number of X8C, and hold the 100k EURO, naturally, spread over 8 different fiats and Gold.  But wait, you dont actually receive the 100k EUROs i give you, you only receive 20.000 X8X, that you somehow Need to convert in 100.000 EUROs worth of 8 Fiats and GOLD, for the issued X8C to be actually be backed up by 8 fiats and Gold that are worth 100k Euros, that means you will Need to dump the 20.000 x8x back in circulations where other will be buying it, for their other cryptos, or BTC or whatever.  Then what you receive for the dump of 20.000k X8X (lets say BTC), will Need to be somehow converted to said 8 FIAT plus Gold, which will consequently mean a dump of said BTC, which will in turn lower Price of BTC.  This is how i see the System would work, or am i teribbly mistaken ? And that is where my question comes !  How are you planning on filling the basked with 8 fiats plus Gold, that serve as collateral for the X8C coins you are issuing ? Naturally when someone cashes out from X8C coins, you give them whatever fiat or Gold they want, and you burn said number of X8C Tokens.   Or are you planning on filling the basket yourself by allowing People to purschase X8C directly with said 8Fiats plus Gold, thus collecting liquidity, for when People trade in X8X ? That would also not work, because say you gathered 10 mil Fiat/Gold, and you issued 10 mil X8C, now someone comes and exchanges 10k X8X for 1000 X8C, and you give them 1000 X8C, and now you have issued a total of 10.001.000 X8C, but you have in basked only 10 mil Fiat/Gold, you know what i mean ?   I would like to have some answers to this simple matter. Perhaps i will invest then.",False

Let me correct your way of understanding X8C.  You don't purchase X8C with X8X. You need X8X on your X8 AG account so you can obtain X8C without any fees. You still purchase X8C with cash or later with ETH/BTC.  After purchasing X8C you still have your X8X tokens which get locked for a certain amount of time and after that time you can sell or use them again.  You can purchase X8C on exchanges aswell but you will pay the fee and the price will be the supply/demand one.  After you exit from X8C your X8C tokens get destroyed.  The equation for the amount of X8X needed for X8C is  X8X^2 = X8C so for example, with 10 X8X you can purchase 100 X8C(you still keep X8X like explained above).  I recommend reading these two blogs:  https://www.ionectar.com/x8-project-token-model/  https://www.ionectar.com/business-model-of-the-x8-utility-token/  And if you have any other questions feel free to ask or join our telegram channel.",False

X8currency is now institutionalized. We are also moving closer to another important milestone, which will open the way for X8currency to be put into operation.  X8 AG started the process of opening a corporate account with Bitstamp — a regulated European crypto exchange. This is the first step for X8currency towards opening its crypto liquidity window for anybody who will want to use the functionality of the X8C smart contract — Decentralized Auto Conversion Platform.  DIRECT CONNECTIVITY Bitstamp offers FIX Protocol connectivity for B2B users to connect their own systems to the Bitstamp exchange. For us this is one of the best options. ioNectar’s ARM AI technology already uses FIX protocol to connect to financial intermediaries and their servers. This is one of the most direct ways to connect our system to the crypto world.  Why is this important in our plan? When the X8C smart contract will have all necessary links established to convert ETH for fiat and vice-versa, X8currency will be one step closer to starting production. From an early stage people will be able to start using X8C directly without going to the exchange. The smart contract itself will find effective routes to exchange crypto into fiat and produce X8C tokens for the client in return.  SHORTER TIME TO MARKET Investors will only need to send ETH to our X8C smart contract’s address. This is a big advantage for us and for X8currency in the crypto market. Linking to the Bitstamp exchange enables us to start building liquidity for our product and to make it available on the market. We feel that this is one of the best ways to start the process.  When our application will be resolved successfully, the X8 project will implement the Bitstamp process into out platform and start testing it as soon as possible. When connectivity to the entire system will be in place, the platform will know how to issue X8C tokens.  This will permit our project to further prepare the broader infrastructure mechanism for the engagement of Automatic Reserve Management AI. ARM AI will become activated when sufficient reserves will accumulate on X8currency AG accounts. Nevertheless, because of the described approach the X8C production start will not be dependent on raising large reserves from the start. This will further accelerate the time to market for X8currency.  SUMMARY A working infrastructure is one of the most important elements for any service or product to start entering the market and to start gaining market share. Even if it starts from a smaller scale initially, the system will be able to start producing a product and then expand the liquidity network further from there. We look forward to this process as it is of direct benefit to our project, X8currency and all our supporters and investors.  Remember, X8Currency is the ultimate crypto safe haven.",False

The existing procedure stays the same for contributors from countries that are on the original list. (ALL THE COUNTRIES IN THE ATTACHED LINK + JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, BRAZIL, KAZAKHSTAN). Please use and follow the existing instructions and troubleshooting link.     The new procedure for all the new countries will not include a video verification. More than 150 countries are added. All verifications will be performed by a manual check. This can be described as a lighter version of the KYC.  The lighter version of the KYC procedure without the video verification has a compliance level, which only allows subscription of smaller amounts, yet with that configuration it at the same time ensures that the X8 project is fully in line with all existing rules and regulations. This addition means that every contributor from every country will have a chance to take a part in the X8 project TGE!     Many members of our community expressed strong opinions that in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies there shall be no distinction and that a fair opportunity for everybody shall be enabled. We completely agree with these views. Nevertheless, exactly the same equal treatment cannot be provided because of various legal reasons and requirements.     Light KYC specifications:  User will be able to select their country from the TIER 1 list of countries Maximum contribution for TIER 1 KYC will be 1ETH or 0.05BTC Members from every country can participate (except China, South Korea and United States of America) Users for TIER 1 KYC will enter the same procedure using our login page.

Nevertheless, because the TGE timeline and the Limited Whitelist phase of the TGE came about faster than we were able to receive a response from a U.S. institution to provide a solid legal base for this step, we had to decide to put the safety of the project and other participant contributions first and continue with the X8X utility token sale without the participation of U.S. citizens.     In this context our project sought the best solution, because we care a lot for our support base. The X8 project has always been about the long-term perspective and we believe that everyone should be able to join us. When merging all the perspectives into one, we were able to come up with the following proposal to invite the members of the U.S. crypto community, so everybody who wants to support our project gets a fair chance.     Status:  U.S. citizens cannot contribute during the TGE (X8X utility token sale) X8 project will create a reserve of 1.000.000 X8X utility tokens from the airdrop quota  Airdrop size will be reduced from 27M to 26M tokens.  The reserved quota of 1.000.000 X8X tokens will be offered to U.S. supporters directly prior to the X8 project’s entry into the U.S. market. The quota will be offered to those followers from the U.S. who will complete their Video KYC by 15th Jan 2018. Only successfully verified U.S. supporters will get a chance to obtain the X8X from this special package. The future limitations on contributed amounts for each individual will remain the same at 10 ETH, just as during the Limited Whitelist of our TGE. In case the entry into this quota will be oversubscribed, contributions will be averaged out and a proportional amount of X8X will be obtainable by each individual.    This is a symbolic gesture which the X8 project can make to remain in a good relationship with our U.S. community base and at the same time remain fully compliant. The price of the token at that future point is not determined, but we are looking for the most sensible, practical and fair offering that we will be able to pursue at that time. We believe it is in the interest of the entire project and the wider community to keep our ties with our American friends as strong as possible.

We could hardly have produced a better historical introduction to the X8currency. The author points out that the famous Austrian liberal economist Friedrich von Hayek opined that the biggest headwind a currency might face is volatility. Of course no holder sees the appreciation of his altcoins as a problem, but what goes up can always go down. The perennial threat and reality of inflation is another problem addressed by X8currency. To efficiently hedge against inflation capital must be continuously reallocated. The X8 project is not about value gains (and consequently value losses), as this field already provides a host of speculative instruments. X8currency tackles the problem of value preservation and has no intention to appeal to speculators and token dumpers. It will appeal to the risk-averse and everyone who dislikes  inflation. And we believe there are a great many of them.  MANY ATTEMPTS AT SOLVING ONE PROBLEM We have already written a comparison of X8C with some other tokens and also with arguably still the most popular token crypto traders resort to in downswings — the USDT. Von Hayek envisioned many different “private currencies” pegged to different commodities competing for the consumer’s wallet. Since stability is a universally recognized problem in the crypto world many projects have emerged recently under the banner of ensuring stability. Different solutions have been proposed but we can say with confidence that our particular niche  is not getting crowded. In fact we stand in it alone for the reasons stated below.  VON HAYEK AND X8C To quote from the article: “The egg of Columbus, in my opinion, is to connect a coin to a fund that holds a range of basic assets like national currencies and other commodities.” The author goes on to claim that the pegging mechanism has to be revolutionized. The reserves backing the token must be audited by an independent agent. Here X8C gets a big check. The holdings will be audited and monitored by JP Fund SA which will also transfer all data on the blockchain. Additionally, a special audit will be performed on request for a fee. Another issue the  author mentions is legislative support. Here again X8C gets a check. The X8 team has been working hard to make the whole enterprise FINMA (Swiss regulatory authority) compliant.  CONCLUSION Unlike any other token X8C is backed by an active basket. ARM (Automatic Reserve Management) AI allocates its holdings continuously amongst 8 currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, JPY, AUD, CAD, CHF, NZD) and gold. There is no human factor involved. No central planning and no room for any arbitrary manoeuvres. No board of directors and no group of fund managers will ever need to sit together and fix the ratio of the currencies in the basket. This is why only those currencies that are 100% convertible into each other have  been accepted into this basket. The system responds to any kind of market movements and volatility boosts  its ability to fight inflation. That is the gist of having a system — no situation should blindside you. Every contingency is covered. ARM AI is brought down only when the grid comes down altogether, with every other electrical device. A descriptive ARM AI whitepaper is available on our site.",False

The text also clarifies how our tokens actually comply with the guidelines of the regulator and answers various observations about how a crypto project can work in the developing crypto market, where the environment as we approach 2018 is becoming much stricter concerning new projects than it has been up to 2017.  99,9% OF TOKENS ARE SECURITIES According to the key European regulator, ICOs could be derivative activities. The European Securities & Markets Authority (ESMA) warned investors that ICOs can cover fraudulent and illegal activities as described in this linked article. The main stance of the regulator is to point out obligations to conduct affairs properly and follow the rules that are already in place.  There is great cognitive dissonance existing between the general blockchain community and traditional institutions. The former is largely not specialized in various in-depth distinctions between types of assets and asset classes. Most blockchain projects do not ask themselves how the type and the nature of the token product that they make will determine how it will be bound into the regulatory framework of the financial market. And as the article on news from ESMA nicely puts it, wordings in whitepapers will not be able to convince someone that something is not a security if it behaves and works like one.  On the other hand, traditional institutions don’t yet comprehend the significance of the blockchain community, which is a necessary element for concepts to be implemented into actual technical solutions, which work in a decentralized manner. In the simplest of terms, it is required to have interest from developers or supporters, who will invest their work into implementing yours or someone else’s solutions to be able to connect to other projects on the chain. This is what creates a market place and is an important part of what blockchain is capable of. It’s technical and it has to be practically achieved if any product wants to become widely adopted in the decentralized digital realm.  DOES TOKENIZATION MAKE SENSE? It all boils down to how well a certain business activity can be translated into the tokenized world. It does not work in the same way for differing types of businesses. It is also difficult to copy a traditional business model into blockchain. Simple business models that rely on fees can become impossible to implement because of the potential breach of rules regulating the area of securities in the financial markets. Can blockchain solutions therefore be just simply copy/paste concepts applied to a new architecture? Technically, of course, the answer is yes. However, the regulator points out that venturing into blockchain does not mean becoming exempt from existing rules that cover known financial and economic activity types. Nevertheless, that is mostly what is happening, as many projects attempt to rebrand traditional business concepts and pin a crypto badge on it.  ICOs COULD BE DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES The approach of the regulator is to first push and filter out projects, which include the use of leverage or constitute a portfolio of leveraged instruments. This is because derivative instruments fall under a different section where public offering to a non-professional audience is restricted. Furthermore, risks of losses linked to investing into derivative instruments must be specifically declared as such, which sometimes may even include the risk of losing more than your deposit.  The derivative argument goes further than the argument of a security. A security can simply be a share of a company, which pays out dividends to investors. It represents an ownership in this case. A derivative instrument however constitutes a right or an obligation linked to its ownership, which has its own price, future delivery date and is traded on a margin with less than total deposit for example. It can be much riskier than a simple share and it can incorporate leverage. If this is the case in an ICO, the regulatory requirement would be even stricter than that required for general securities, making the environment for leveraged portfolio management business models in crypto most difficult at the moment.  DECREASE IN COMPETITEVNESS OF DIGITAL SECURITIES These developments hint at an instrument the regulator could use to moderate the fiat-to-crypto flows. If most ICOs are securities and at least some of them are even derivatives, then this covers the ground for differentiation of tokens from the perspective of taxation. There is a clear tax code for securities. Furthermore, in certain jurisdictions the profits from investments in derivatives are taxed at a higher rate. It could be a factor in taking some wind out of the enthusiasm of investors, who are counting on returns without any taxes. This means that constructive business models based on an honest arbitrary fee approach will not be able to lessen the burden of taxation by simply moving to blockchain. In this sense “blockchain is not offshore” could be the message. How this will unfold is unknown, yet it is clear that it narrows the view about possibilities that comply with regulatory standards worldwide. This also could, in part, answer the question of why there is a need for a token and what kind of a token that should be.  CURRENCIES AND UTILITY TOKENS ARE EXEMPT Currencies are exempt because they are a non-leveraged instrument, which is not based on assets. Bitcoin falls beautifully into this category, as do all traditional currencies as well. Imagine you decide to travel from one continent to another, and you buy some foreign cash currency for your trip. After you return you exchange what’s left back into your local currency. The exchange rates would be different, but if it is a positive difference, you made money and you keep your difference without any taxation.  This cannot happen if you would use a crypto token which would be asset-backed. However, if the token is not backed by assets then the question is can a token be backed by anything? The answer is yes it can. It can be backed by another currency. As long as there is no financial leverage in the structure and that the constitution of an instrument is 100% of currencies and the token does not constitute any ownership of assets, the instrument is neither a security nor a derivative.  Now imagine that you have a service on blockchain, which controls your currency risks while you are traveling as described. Perhaps at some point during your travels the exchange rates become more favourable, but you are somewhere where you cannot do anything about it. This blockchain service makes sure you don’t miss many of these opportunities because it backs your currency with a basket of cash currencies and observes the movements between them in order to find the most competitive overall exchange rate. An individual would need to visit exchange offices, observe the exchange rates and update his or her global wallet rather regularly, so it is not practical. Instead, you use a cryptocurrency token, which simplifies it all. It can go everywhere with you because it works on blockchain and it does not consist of any assets.  IS GOLD AN ASSET? When former FED Chairman Ben Bernanke was asked by congressman Ron Paul (R) about how he sees the role of gold and if gold is money, the Chairman clearly stated that gold is an asset, not money. In another question asked about what is backing the US Dollar then, the answer from Ben Bernanke basically was the dollar was backed by all the goods and services that the dollar can buy. Implications of this historic interview are that crypto coins like The DAO or Xaurum, which include gold backing, could not escape the definitions of securities because gold is an asset. Nevertheless, this is an area where we completed a lot of research and have a great deal of experience. Intuitively, gold should be a part of every safe and stable currency. Legally however, if you are not a central bank, it has to be in the form of cash.  This points towards only one thing – gold coins. Gold coins have a declared fiat cash currency value and are not assets but are actually money or legal tender. Simply put, if a crypto token would use gold bullion as the backing for its tokens, it cannot be a currency, because it would hold assets as reserves.  WHAT ABOUT FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING? When the forex market is used for speculation purposes or for purposes of achieving an investment gain involving margin trading it represents a risky activity. An illustration might be a hedge fund using a discretionary trading strategy and 5 to 1 leverage to increase the returns in the market from 2% to 10% or more, for example.  On the other hand, foreign exchange can be used just to exchange currencies without any prediction of which way the price of one or another currency might go. In this way, it can be used to effectively balance out your dependence on just one currency. Diversification reduces the risk of any single currency’s collapse.  On a foreign exchange trading account one can have dollars and diversify them electronically using the spot price. You do not speculate on a currency, which you do not own. Such activity is different from speculative trading because it has backing in real currency for which it tries to negotiate an optimal exchange rate. The goal is in wealth preservation, not in achieving a return. When one currency is exchanged into another currency without any leverage and with diversified risk, the upside volatility decreases as well. It gives an overall effect of safety and balance, but because it is continuously searching for an optimal overall exchange rate it has a better chance to sustain value in the long-term. This helps to fight inflation, or at least if there is inflation you still get a part of the inflated value back, which lets you sustain your purchasing power more readily on really long hauls.  WHY IS THERE THE NEED FOR A TOKEN? People do not follow this wealth preservation approach, because it is expensive to do so, plus time-consuming and complex to maintain. Sometimes it requires responses during periods which are impractical and when somebody cannot do anything about it. Sometimes it requires a fast response, which is not achievable manually. It requires preparations, dedication and continuous calculation to keep your optimal diversification.  Fortunately, technology can make this benefit more accessible, because it calculates vast amounts of data quickly and can respond, increment by increment, without any wavering in focus. Without a token, each individual would have to create an X8 portfolio by himself or herself. X8 is a very sizeable portfolio to create. In order to be effective and viable, due to running costs, it has to be more than several million dollars in magnitude.  It is also not possible to make a small X8 portfolio due to minimum trade size limits set by brokers, because it doesn’t pay off for them to trade 20, 50, 100 dollar amounts. The result is that it is not possible to exchange very low, low or even medium amounts in a portfolio and then frequently maintain optimal ratios. Small and medium size savers cannot diversify their risk due to a cost equation in the value chain.  UNLIMITED EXCHANGE AT FAIR VALUE The token enables a system, where the benefits of the functionality can be channelled to the end-user at zero fees. To the user the token has utility value. The token provides the utility which, once set up, does not impose any additional charge onto the user. This means that the market will be able to determine the value of the utility freely and the utility will be equal for all users regardless of the prevailing price of the token.  Larger users will also not need to pay more than utility value for the service because with increasing size they will not need to spend additional costs on overcoming entry hurdles. For a computer a calculation on numbers 100 times larger in scale is not 100 times more expensive. It also means that there is no hidden profit in the system as it scales up and it remains competitive as a utility.  A TOKEN FOR EVERY USER Only a token can make this mechanism possible. It solves the problem of getting a fair reward for holding cash. It makes the use of cash less costly and more protected against harmful market drops. It reduces the entry hurdle for users who are able to use this stable money principle so that small- and mid-size users can benefit from it.  It enables a 100% backed and stable token, which is not based on assets. Because it does not include any fees in the model, the entire value for the user is actually in the token itself. To work properly it needs to be able to operate on a worldwide scale and it needs to be able to circulate freely and to service everyday activities in the digital world.  This combination of characteristics that we have presented is one of only a few which allows complete value to be built into the token itself. That is a big part of why the market needs this token. The world is looking for tokens, which can be valuable and can work practically for a large number of users. The benefit it can provide cannot be delivered to the market through any other form than as a token. The market also benefits from a new member who adds stability and a product to that market which can, in turn, attract new future users who will welcome this new token solution.

To address volatility and illiquidity risks, several cryptocurrency exchanges have started to back their currencies with fiat currencies. Zug, Switzerland-based X8 Currency (X8C) has gone even further by backing its currency 100 percent with a reserve basket of fiat currencies and gold. The Crypto Valley company has implemented additional risk measures engineered to Swiss financial standards that would even make the global bank regulators down the road in Basel blush.

If you only invest in one asset (or peg a tokens value to only one asset, such as gold, USD, etc.), you are completely exposed to the movement of the value of the chosen asset. Thus, there is no effective solution in case of a black swan event (the value of the asset significantly decreases) and your portfolio loses on value.  You can significantly lower you risk/exposure by investing (pegging a token) in several assets. In the case of X8C there are 8 different fiat currencies and gold coins.  In our project we have also taken a next step in the process of lowering risk/exposure. The value of X8C is not pegged to the value of the backing assets. Rather than that, the backing basket is actively managed by ARM AI. Thus, the distribution of assets in the basket is not always the same, but it changes together with the market. Example: if the value of gold would decrease, our ARM AI would lower the percentage of gold in the basket to ensure and even lower exposure to the negative market conditions.",False

I read your home page and the summary at: https://www.ionectar.com/x8-project-token-model/  So just to confirm (please correct me if I am wrong),  1) The X8C token is linked to fiat currency and gold reserves that you will have in possession and the amounts are regularly audited by an independent 3rd party. The value of the X8C token is expected to remain fairly constant in the event of Cryptocurrency market swings. The X8C token could be viewed as a ""safe haven"" token during Cryptocurrency market swings. Since X8C is a token, depending on the particular laws of a country where a persons resides, moving for example Bitcoin into X8C would not be seen as a taxable gain, since no recognized fiat currency was purchased. This is much like Tether but with greater security since X8C has audited proof of your fiat currency and gold holdings.  2) The X8X token is a fixed supply utility token that allows the holder thereof to enter into the X8C token. The value of the X8X token would logically be expected to rise most in value during times when the Cryptocurrency market value is falling, when people are looking for a safe haven to park Cryptocurrency market gains. The absolute only way to enter into/get the X8C token is by using the X8X token. There is no fiat portal or otherwise available method to enter the X8C token. Only the X8X token allows entry to the X8C token.  Will both X8C and X8X be listed on Cryptocurrency exchanges or just X8X ?  Thank you",False

Wow that's a pretty good idea, I never thought setting limits could be really beneficial to a project. I do support this idea, with this investors doesn't have to fear whales from dumping a huge amount of tokens causing a huge crash on the token's price and this move can really help the token and the project reach as many people as possible making this project accessible to everyone. Whoever thought about this is a genius and I applaud you guys for integrating this feature into your project, not everyone is willing to take a risk as big as this so if this ends up being successful then you guys will probably change the way ico works. I couldn't agree more that's why this forum is filled with bounty hunters because most of them just supports the project because they can gain something from it and once the bounty will be over then there will be a huge dump coming from them which can affect the token negatively especially its price. With everything that you said here, it seems like you're really devoting a lot of time thinking about the future of this project and planning each step as carefully as possible to ensure a successful outcome, with that you just prove to me how trustworthy you guys are and how serious you are with this project.

However, I must correct you that you will be also able to enter X8C through an exchange, as both our tokens (X8X and X8C) will be listed on exchanges.

It is most likely due to its keen sense for financial innovation and its decentralized political system that Zug finds itself again at the spearhead, this time with the adoption of blockchain technologies.  An ecosystem of blockchain innovation has been founded in Zug, connecting other places of innovation in this field, such as Singapore, Silicon Valley, New York and London. The X8Currency team finds the Cyrpto Valley an ideal environment for the placement of the X8 project. Where else can one find institutional support of finance and industry, supportive local government, progressive associations and various interested market participants from all over the world in one place?  The increasing frequency of successful Zug-based ICOs has attracted the attention of the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). In September this year FINMA released a statement acknowledging ICOs as vehicles for fund-gathering. However, they stopped short of prescribing regulation. Another Swiss government-sponsored body, the Crypto Valley Association, expressed the desire for the clarification of ICO tokens’ status in legal terms. The same association also came forth with a code of conduct for ICOs that would prevent fraudulent practices. The Crypto Valley Association is composed of corporate and individual members, proficient in various disciplines such as taxation, cyber security and legal. The X8 team has no doubt that such mutual encouragement between financial entities allied with a multidisciplinary approach will result in regulation that will hinder neither progress nor innovation. The KYC procedure already built into the X8 project’s system and the clear use of utility tokens make sure that X8Currency finds favourable sentiment in Zug.  But there is not only the progressive and benevolent cryptofinancial environment working for the X8 project in Zug. The traditional financial infrastructure involved in the project includes one of the top-rated banks in the world when it comes to safety. The funds placed in the bank will be reinsured by the world-renowned SwissRE. The gold coins comprising a part of X8currency’s basket will be stored in two Swiss facilities where all reserves are insured by default — Malca-Amit S.A. and GoldSwitzerland. And there is also JP Fund, a financial institution that kindly agreed to provide independent auditing and monitoring of the funds managed by X8 AG. This will be an additional measure providing transparency besides blockchain-secured auditing.  Just as the applicability and usefulness of the X8 project spills over the boundaries of the crypto world, its attractiveness spills over  the boundaries of any single state. Which is why we are confident that embedding the X8 project in the well-designed Zug financial ecosystem is the fastest route to global recognition of X8Currency.",False

Is X8X really a Utility Token? Where are the arguments?  For too long, the question of the legal status of cryptocurrencies was neglected or even ignored. Lately, with the USA establishing better control and China even banning crypto until further notice, the crypto world has begun to acknowledge that rules and legislation have to be studied carefully and legal measures have to be undertaken. It is not only the case that ICOs have to subordinate to the laws of the country where their issuing company is established, but they have to become responsible towards their investors and explore the legal aspects of their crypto token in those countries where investors live and pay taxes.  There were several attempts to unite the standards for the legal status of Digital Assets (“DAs”), but for now countries around the globe treat DAs quite differently. Although we can make some general conclusions or summaries, we should not expect all tax, law enforcement and regulatory entities to share the same view or position.  A generally accepted view, based on many articles, legal advice and reports divides digital crypto DAs into 3 groups:  1. Cryptocurrencies 2. Utility Tokens 3. Tokenized Securities  There is no strict definition of each group and there are some assets, that share similarities with more than just one group.  Cryptocurrencies Similar to fiat currencies such as the Euro and the US Dollar, the main purpose of cryptocurrencies is to carry value and enable transactions of value possible. That does not mean, that other crypto assets represent no value. The argument is in substance, in the main purpose.  It can be arguable as to what is the actual intrinsic value of cryptocurrencies, although some make a very  quick conclusion: “The true value of a cryptocurrency is in the trust of its owners and users.” If trust is lost, deliberately or accidentally, cryptocurrencies usually lose all value and exchange rates plummet rapidly. The opposite conclusion is not necessary true, cryptocurrencies with extremely good records and valuation do not necessarily own public trust, as market speculation can still dictate the fate of exchange rates.  Cryptocurrencies usually have the ambition to become a payment vehicle, which means that owners can buy other monetary or physical assets with these cryptocurrencies. Therefore, it is expected for t hese cryptocurrencies to have a broad pool of owners, large enough to create its own economy, where people trade goods and assets. Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies can have very unique digital encryption techniques to reach consensus on approved transactions, often inextricably linked with the process of issuance. Some of these mechanisms (e.g. staking) can bring some cryptocurrencies very close to the definition of securities.  Generally, if a DA shares most of its features with fiat currency then you are probably looking at a cryptocurrency.  Utility Tokens Nomen est omen. These DAs are mainly used for utilization of a service. You can imagine them as a ticket or counter, that allows an owner to use a certain number of service functionalities, to gain certain data, acquire better insight or upgrade. Therefore these tokens carry value, but usually the issuer is quite indifferent or agnostic towards its trading value. The DA issuer should not be in a conflict of interest. A utility token must be freely available to all potential users of the respected service or utility. Groups of users can be smaller, usability can be pegged to a limited number of service providers.  But, what about the number of DAs in circulation? Can these utilities become securities, if you remove, destroy or permanently lock or keep a certain amount of DAs, thus decreasing the number of DAs in circulation? It is not definitive, lawyers tend to study a DA’s model closely before making any conclusion. Even buy-back plans and programs, where an issuer returns some of the profit to a DA’s owners can be problematic, although some (EU) legislations would classify these DAs as profit-sharing contracts.  The issuer of such a DA would not consider his ICO as an “investment opportunity”, but rather as a “contributions to the cause”. Many startup companies found issuing their own DAs a very convenient method to raise funds to build their infrastructure and ecosystems. The main purpose of distributing their DAs is to grow a community of potential service users.  Tokenized security As for the USA, the Securities and Exchange Commision (“SEC”) announced a general test that decides, if a DA should be considered as a security. The definition is reduced to simple questions, that make up the Hovey test:  ● Is it an investment of money or assets?  ● Is the investment of money or assets in a common enterprise?  ● Is there an expectation of profits from the investment?  ● Does any profit come from the efforts of a promoter or third party?  If the business model of the DA offers affirmative answers to these questions, the DA should d efinitely be treated as a Security and thus comply with wider legislation. It does not mean, that this DA is illegal, it just has to be registered with and overviewed by the SEC.  If you look for an ultimate confirmation, you should observe investor activity. If the profits arise and are distributed without the need of investor to actively cooperate or contribute with knowledge, actions or informations, then the DA is most likely a tokenized security.",False

We are happy to announce that the X8 project has successfully implemented the KYC procedure in cooperation with the provider, which is capable of delivering services in accordance with Swiss FINMA guidelines on the matter. This solution means that the X8 project further increases the standard, strengthening the Swiss base which has already been established. This solution meets strict requirements and ensures the best position for the project and the necessary level of business compliance for it to engage with institutions as well. The procedure will take participants through a guided video verification of personal documents and will require each one to fill in and upload the required AML forms in the pdf format during the procedure. X8 project will raise funds during the pre-sale and crowdsale in line with Swiss KYC/AML requirements and will be one of the first TGEs to meet this level of transparency and compliance with all existing rules and regulations. Because of these relatively high requirements, which also in turn makes the X8X Utility Token a better and more valuable token, we decided to give our contributors enough time to complete the KYC in full within a comfortable time period. Furthermore, based on legal advice we received in regard to recent Ethereum congestion, this will help the project to protect contributors and reduce the risk of not being able to contribute if potentially another or a similar Ethereum congestion event takes place during the TGE stages. As a result, we are presenting the extended timeline for the TGE.   X8X TGE Timeline:    - Whitelist registration is ongoing  - KYC instruction video and text will be published on Sunday, 17th Dec  - KYC for registered Whitelist members starts live on Monday, 18th Dec  - Limited Whitelist Pre-Sale starts on Thursday, 4th Jan 2018 at 12:00 CET  - Limited Whitelist Pre-Sale ends on Saturday, 6th Jan 2018 at 12:00 CET  - 2-day break  - Unlimited Whitelist Pre-Sale starts on Monday, 8th Jan 2018 at 12:00 CET  - Unlimited Whitelist Pre-Sale ends on Wednesday, 10th Jan 2018 at 12:00 CET  - 2-day break  - Crowdsale starts on Friday, 12th Jan 2018 at 12:00 CET  - Last Registration/KYC open date: 20th Jan 2018  - Crowdsale ends on Monday, 22th Jan 2018 at 12:00 CET   This is the final timeline of the TGE of the X8 project.

Do not hesitate to ask questions. The running performance of the ARM AI is operating on behalf of financial insitutions. These institutions are not inclined to reveal their realtime financial performance to third parties. In fact a release of such details would be illegal due to laws governing confidentiality. However, there is a written reference on the website from a financial institution of NZ. It would of course be useful to be able to share all this information but the very nature of the industry prohibits that until these figures are published in the annual reports of the institutions concerned then we cannot divulge them. We raised just over 1 mil in the fiat presale. You are right, TGE will issue X8X utility tokens. X8C will be issued shortly after the TGE. At first we believed it would take up to 90 days to install everything, now we know it can be much sooner. Since X8C cannot exist without full backing the redeemed tokens are of no use, hence they will be burned.",False

Do you have a proper exit strategy to avoid potential losses? X8 Project developed a double token model for preservation of your value.    Remember the Dot-Com and USA Housing Bubbles? When you notice investors with little to no trading skills buying an asset, not for its fundamental value, but only because they plan to (quickly) sell it later, at a much higher price, you are probably looking at an investment bubble in progress. Sounds familiar? Similar patterns can be observed on current Crypto markets, that show a great similarity to overheated economies from the past.   What does it mean for your crypto investments? If you are a Bitcoin, Ether or some Coin/Token holder, you are probably well aware of their volatility — the value of your crypto-portfolio can change rapidly. When the markets start to crash, the most straightforward exit strategy is a conversion of your crypto assets to fiat currency (USD, EUR) on some Online Exchange. The X8 Project is proposing an alternative, a conversion to the X8Currency Token, the closest thing to fiat on the crypto market.   X8Currency is not only representing one fiat currency at a 1:1 exchange ratio, but is composed of and 100% backed with 8 fiat currencies and physical gold. X8C is exchangeable for each of the 8 fiat currencies  directly at the issuer, X8 Capital AG, a Swiss based company that safeguard all backing assets under the supervision of Swiss regulators. Fiat assets and gold funds are actively managed by Automatic Reserve Management, a proven and tested software designed to minimize risk and to preserve value.  What does it means for you? Converting to X8Currency gives you:  ● stability of value due to dispersion of backing fiat assets,  ● security as X8C Tokens are exchangeable on demand to any of 8 fiat currencies at the issuer and  ● portability, as X8C Tokens will be tradeable on Online Exchanges and easily transacted from one Exchange to another. You can build your own fiat exit for the Exchanges, that do not offer fiat conversions or withdrawals,  ● liquidity, as all the underlying assets are 100% convertible.  X8Currency minting and conversion to fiat at the issuer will only be available to holders of the utility token X8X, which acts as a ticket for X8 Capital AG services. X8X Tokens will be available on a crowdsale, enabling owners to convert their crypto assets and fiat to X8Currency and back without fees.",False
