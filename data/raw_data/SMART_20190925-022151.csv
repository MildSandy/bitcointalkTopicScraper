The ico of this project ended last year.  If you are asking in general about advantages of investing in ICO at beginning or after I mean buying from the exchange then there could be advantages depending on how the ico is structured and how the bonuses are awarded.  If the ICO has a round for ""private"" sell where the minimum amount to enter is huge for example 100ETH then i do not thing there there is an advantage to buy in invest into an ICO if you are normal public investor. In such structure the ""private"" investors are usually dumping the ""extra bonuses"" that they have received on the free market therefore there could be an advantage for a usual investor to buy from an exchange at cheaper prices.  On the other hand  when the ICO rounds have no big bonus difference and the bonus is not so high and when there is no private sale then in this case joining the ico in the beginning could be favorable as you could get more tokens for less as there should not be a big dump on the free market.  But there is no guarantee so take your time to study the project before you invest any money that you can not afford to lose !",False

Taking a peek at the site, you currently accept bets from 0.001 to 1 ETH, when I enter my bet size, I get an ""estimated"" win, where the estimate for #6 is glowing & jumping right in my face. It says 7,000 ETH at the lowest allowed bet size and a whopping 7,000,000 ETH at the 1 ETH max bet. However, your current pot is just 6,227 ETH, meaning you can't even cover a jackpot hit at the minimum bet.  Am I right that the payout for a single bet is always capped at your current pot size? If this assumption is correct, why do you show ""estimated wins"" that are way higher than what you actually can pay?  I think this is highly misleading, and further I think this is intentionally misleading. You should adjust the estimates to show actually valid amounts, not fictional possibilities. And you should do this quickly, because with every bet placed, you are promising something you cannot keep. On top of that, since you cannot cover any full jackpot hit, not even on the minimum size, betting in any way right now has a higher than intended house edge.",False

After that, the player will be able to cash out up to 50% of the Pot value every month until the withdrawal of the total value of the win.  This provision ensures continued high Pot values, driving the lottery’s appeal to the gaming clients. Meanwhile, ~95% of funds from ticket sales are transferred directly to the Pot and fill it up again and again.

However, you can also trigger it by specially created function for dividends payout (It is written in whitepaper and smart contract itself):      /**      * @dev Pay unpaid dividends      */     function payDividends() external {         require(investStart == 0);         commitDividend(msg.sender);         payWallet();     }  I think it might involve less code execution (and consequently, lower costs of transaction). However, I am not the Smart Billions developer so I do not take any responsibility for that claim  For those of you, who need small help  1. Go to MyEtherWallet and choose ""Contracts"" from the above tab 2. Copy-Paste the address of the Smart Billions Contract to Contract Address field (You can get it from etherscan.io: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6F6DEb5db0C4994A8283A01D6CFeEB27Fc3bBe9C ) 3. Copy-Paste ABI of a Smart Billions Contract to ABI/JSON field (You can get it also form ethersca.io link above. Just click Contract Source tab and you will find it) 4. Click Access 5. Choose payDividends function from Read / Write Contract section below 6. Access your wallet with one of the options provided  (the simplest, but least secure is providing your wallet private key - NOT RECOMMENDED) 7. Finalize the transaction and send it to network (Click Write -> Leave ""Amount to Send"" set to 0 ETH [zero] -> adjust Gas Limit - for instance to 200 000 should be enough -> Click Generate Transaction and send it)  Of course this Transaction has to be made from the wallet which holds your SMART Tokens! In general it should work. Please remember also that cost of the Transaction might be higher than Dividents itself. I Recommend calculate your potential dividends income beforehand.  Answering the potential question of ""When I can do it?"" You just need to wait for the next dividend period to happen. Small instruction provided below:  1. Visit Smart Billions Contract on etherscan (https://etherscan.io/address/0x6F6DEb5db0C4994A8283A01D6CFeEB27Fc3bBe9C) 2.

Where will I receive funds? And can anyone work out so far how much 1 smart will earn you?  You can get all the data from studying Smart Contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x6F6DEb5db0C4994A8283A01D6CFeEB27Fc3bBe9C)  1. You can see in code that dividends are calculated as follows in CommitDividents function:         uint share = balances[_who] * 0xffffffff / totalSupply;         uint balance = 0;         for(;last<dividendPeriod;last++) {             balance += share * dividends[last];         }  So share is your balance (for instance 1 SMART) divided by totalSupply (7852650), which equals around ~0.0000001. Consequently your dividends will equal to your share multiplied by dividends in fist period, which are currently 1861403419200000000 Wei. As a result dividends for 1 SMART are worth today around ~0.000000237 ETH.  Of course dividend value will rise till the end of first dividend period, with tickets being purchased. You can always check it on etherscan (link above). Just go to ""Read SmarContract"". Find  ""17.  dividends "" field, put there value 1 and click ""query"". The function will give you back current overall dividend value for period 1.  What is more you don't have to get your dividends right away (for instance if they are too small in compare to transaction fee). CommitDividents function will sum up your dividends across all periods you didn't gather them.  Regards",False

Code: c. Lottery Closing In the event of unexpected circumstances (such as Ethereum protocol changes) which could affect the lottery and endanger the funds stored in the Jackpot, the contract allows Admin to withdraw surplus funds from the Jackpot remaining after settling all outstanding smart contract obligations, such as: - Redemption of all remaining SMART Tokens, and - Payout of all outstanding lottery prizes. Admin will be allowed to withdraw the surplus from the Jackpot only if more than 50% of all SMART Tokens are redeemed. In this situation, it will be clear that lottery security might be vulnerable and that its funds must be secured. As a consequence, all the surplus funds will be allocated to the Jackpot of a new, comprehensively secured and updated lottery and the players and all relevant parties will be notified immediately and continuously updated during the process. There are no other circumstances under which funds from the Jackpot can be withdrawn by any party.  As pointed out, it concerns only the SURPLUS. NOT other investments or users balances.  IF they get more than 50% of the total investments in the ICO, one could indeed withdraw this surplus, but with 50% of the dividend pie, that would not make sense at all Would be like slaughtering the cow while they give tons of milk .

It should put an example like that on the website (check bets).  About the question 2, I mean:  Player places 1 ETH and HIT #6. So, he should receive 7.000.000 ETH.  But, Smartbillions has on Jackpot only 2.500 ETH in this moment.  In this case, the player can withdraw 1.250 ETH now and ""After that, the player will be able to cash out up to 50% of the Jackpot value every period (approx. 1 month) until the withdrawal of the total value of the win."" (Whitepaper). To be honest, I didn't understand how it works the other 50% withdraw later on. Will it be monthly payment? How long time?  So, the player wouldn't receive the money showed on ""ESTIMATED  WIN"" (7.000.000 ETH), but 2.500 ETH only.

Currently, he must do that manually which cost time and GAS (and nervs). So he won't do it.  therefore you throw away a big part of potential players.

This is the most important feature of the SmartBillions lottery. Every bet is made from the players wallet to the smart contract. To bet multiple times you need to send multiple transactions to the contract. Of course the player can automize the betting bu implementing scripts to his wallet. We will also introduce such a solutions for the players. The average single bet value in our estimations is set at 0.03 ETH (9 $), which is lower than iour competitors (i.e. True Flip single bet value is 0.005 BTC - 25 $) Please remeber that the upcoming Metropolis fork will lower the block time to ca. 15 seconds and this will double the transaction number.  The most important SmartBillions lottery is it's transparency and fairness. This is why all bets must be recorded in the Ethereum blockchain. The bets are not made from the internal players wallets within the smart contract but from external wallets. This guarantees the players protection.   If you have any other questions relating the smart contract or the assumptions from the white paper please feel free to ask.",False

For a while i'm investing in the cryptocurrencies and till today I was not interested in ICOs at all (too risky and unpredictable result ). Today I've found this project and became really interested in it. And I intended to invest in it until... I looked at the TrueFlip and it's team's results and the mood of its investors . Now I'm trying to guess whats the difference between these two projects and how SmartBillions intend to overcome the difficulties the TrueFlip faced.... So I have some questions : 1. Web site of TrueFlip is banned in some countries (I've found out Russian Federation and  the US, and I think there are more). This cuts off a big part of gamers. How will SmartBillions handle this issue? 2. Tokens of TrueFlip have not been listed at popular exchanges, all promised time limits have gone and their price declines. How can we be sure that tokens of SmartBillions will be listed, are there any facts or negotiations confirming the plan of SmartBillions' team to be listed at exchanges? 3. How will be token dividents payed out to the holders? For example, at TrueFlip they are paid with great delay and manually. So the investors are very angry! 4. The smallest bet at TrueFlip is 0.0005 and it is stated in SmartBillions whitepaper to be 0.001. So where is the competitive advantage?  PS English is not my native language, I hope I've made my ideas clear to understand.",False

Please correct me if I'm wrong.  1. The share for the dividend payments can decrease but not increase. If investments are removed with the disinvest() function the shares and hence the paid out dividends are still calculated with the max amount that was invested ever.  As long as the max amount of 200000 ethers invested is not achieved the share shrinks with every investment (totalSupply is incremented in the invest() function). For 20000 ethers it is 1/20000, for 30000 ethers it is 1/30000 and so on.  But in the other direction (possible with the disinvest() function), the shares don't increase again.  Assume the max possible 200000 ethers were invested. Then one share is 1/200000. After someone disinvests 50000 ethers one share is still only 1/200000 and not 1/150000.  The reason is that in the disinvest() function only investBalance is decremented but not totalSupply and in the commitDividend() function the shares are still calculated with totalSupply: uint share = balances[_who] * 0xffffffff / totalSupply;   2. In the same function (commitDividend()) there is a loop through every yet not paid out dividend period using the actual share calculated like above. This means that if someone did not pay out dividends for say the last 4 periods, and until this time the invested amount raised while 200000 wasn't achieved the shares of the periods 1-3 are still calculated with the last, highest investment amount (smallest possible share) of period 4 instead of the actual share that was active during the corresponding period 1-3.   3. Whitepaper/hackathon coverage:  From the whitepaper:  ""7. Risk-free smart contract product with full security proven in the hackathon process (hackathon prize: 1500 ETH) provided by SmartBillions’ creators to validate the system’s safety).""  For this to be true the word ""full"" has to be replaced with partial. The hackathon only covered the case when the contract is in preparation state (investStart == 1). Hackers had no way to withdraw the 1500 ETH if they found a bug concerning the ICO (investStart > 1) or investment closed (investStart == 0) state.",False

Dear SmartBillions community!  Last days of Hackathon generated a positive response and very valuable feedback from the community. Based on user comments, we have decided to deploy an updated version of the contract with the following improvements:  1. We have fixed minor spelling mistakes (https://github.com/SmartBillions/SmartBillions/pull/1). 2. We have changed the token name to “SMART” to solve the occurred conflict with HEROcoin ICO (https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/pull/1104). 3. We have changed the management of the payment periods and decided to use Timestamp rather than the Block.time (https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/74d3dc/smartbillions_lottery_contract_just_got_hacked/dnyjtm2/). 4. We have changed the putHash function, to prevent misalignment in the hash database.  The contract is now available at: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6f6deb5db0c4994a8283a01d6cfeeb27fc3bbe9c The jackpot of the contract will be filled with tomorrow (2017-10-10) 12:00 GMT, after preparing the contract database. The funds from the old contract (https://etherscan.io/address/0x103c2c150a2dbcc277ee084c59881978060c8c22) will be withdrawn, according to the hackathon rules, and deposited to the new address.  We would like to thank all the hackathon participants for active involvement in the contract improvements. The HACKATHON will continue and we will be working on further improvements, if requested and justified.",False

Last days of Hackathon generated a positive response and very valuable feedback from the community. Based on user comments, we have decided to deploy an updated version of the contract with the following improvements:  1. We have fixed minor spelling mistakes (https://github.com/SmartBillions/SmartBillions/pull/1). 2. We have changed the token name to “SMART” to solve the occurred conflict with HEROcoin ICO (https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet/pull/1104). 3. We have changed the management of the payment periods and decided to use Timestamp rather than the Block.time (https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/74d3dc/smartbillions_lottery_contract_just_got_hacked/dnyjtm2/). 4. We have changed the putHash function, to prevent misalignment in the hash database.  The contract is now available at: https://etherscan.io/address/0x6f6deb5db0c4994a8283a01d6cfeeb27fc3bbe9c The jackpot of the contract will be filled with tomorrow (2017-10-10) 12:00 GMT, after preparing the contract database.

The Admin cannot withdraw more than the 90 % of the raised sum and the funds waiting to be withdrawn as a wins. Investors and winners funds are always protected. I will demonstrate Admin withdraws on the following examples. Let's assume that there was 200 000 ETH raised during the ICO - 100 % goal. 90 % of the raised sum - 180 000 ETH will be allocated to the Jackpot. 10 % will be allocated to the marketing fund.  Scenario 1: During the first week contract earns 1000 ETH the contract balance is 181 000 ETH  after the first week. Admin will be able to withdraw 0.25 % of the Jackpor value - 452.5 ETH Scenario 2: During the first week contract earns 100 ETH the contract balance is 180 100 ETH after the first week. 0.25 % of this sum equals 450.25 ETH but Admin will be able to withdraw only 100 ETH. so after his withdraw the contract balance will equal 180 000 ETH - 90 % of the raised sum. Because he cannot withdraw funds that are reserved for Token redeem and wins payouts. Scenario 3: During the first week contract loses 1000 ETH the contract balance is 179 000 ETH after the first week. Admin won't be able to withdraw any funds.  I hope that this will clear the Admin withdraw rules. Remember that the Investors and winers funds are always protected. Please see also my posts above.,False

SmartBillions smart contract is improved and now we are pleased to announce the hackathon second round. 1500 ETH was put in the smart contract address to validate the contract security after the improvements  were made.  Contract address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x103c2c150a2dbcc277ee084c59881978060c8c22  The list of contract improvements: 1.   transferFrom function: You can only send owned Tokens. 2.   addHashes function: the database initiation is now safer. 3.   hotStore function: Anyone can deposit funds in the contact. 4.   coldStore function: In case of emergency the admin Is allowed to withdraw the whole surplus over the contract liabilities only when over 50 % of Tokens are redeemed. 5.   won function: will not return the bet value in case of database error 6.   play function: players are required to store more information in the database.  The Hackathon prize was deposited in the smart contract using the hotStore function by 6 different ETH addresses. The hotStore function allows any address to store funds anytime in the smart contract and then withdraw the prior stored amount using the won function. However the Jackpot management rules apply to these withdraws. One address cannot withdraw more than 50 % of the contract value and withdraws can be made every (4*60*24*30) blocks  1500 ETH Hackathon prize will be withdrawn in 2 cases: 1.   If there’s another bug found in the contract and Hacker will not withdraw all the funds, the remaining funds will be withdrawn by the same addresses that deposited the funds using the won function. 2.   If the funds will remain intact before the ICO the same addresses that deposited the funds will be able to withdraw exactly the same amounts as deposited (Hackathon prizes) in the later phase.  The funds from the first Hackathon were withdrawn by the Admin using the coldStore function. The withdraw was possible because there weren’t any liabilities on the contract such as Token redeem and win payouts. There weren’t any wins to pay out because the players were able to claim the wins after a given time period, they weren’t the lottery winners right after the lottery draw. At the moment of the Admin withdraw there were no wins to pay.  The funds raised during an ICO are protected within the smart contract. Withdrawals by the admin are possible in the coldStore function only under certain conditions.  function coldStore(uint _amount) external onlyOwner  {         houseKeeping();         require(_amount > 0 && this.balance >= (investBalance * 9 / 10) + walletBalance + _amount);         if(investBalance >= investBalanceGot / 2){ // additional jackpot protection             require((_amount <= this.balance / 400) && coldStoreLast + 4  60  24 * 7 <= block.number);         }         msg.sender.transfer(_amount);         coldStoreLast = block.number; }  This line: require(_amount > 0 && this.balance >= (investBalance * 9 / 10) + walletBalance + _amount);  guarantees that the admin can never withdraw  funds that are protected: the 90% of the funds invested during the ICO plus the funds in wallets waiting to be withdrawn (these includes unpaid prizes due to lack of funds in the contract; however these prizes must have been claimed with the won() function before, otherwise the prizes are not known to the contract).  There is also an additional important limit that the withdraw amount must be smaller than 0.25% of the jackpot and this fraction cannot be withdrawn more often than every 7 days (4*60*24*7 blocks).  This additional limit is waived if 50% of investors decide to disinvest.  This additional limit means that if there is a large lottery win waiting but the winner did not collect his winnings yet, then the admin can run away with 0.25% of the current jackpot , leaving 99.75% of the jackpot still in the contract. Thus this risk has a negligible effect on the collected funds by the winner. The regular withdraw of 0.25% per week by the admin to promote the lottery is an expected behavior.",False

The contract enabled the withdraw of lottery prizes up to 1 months after the draw by keeping a history of 163840 block hashes (hashes[]), which is much longer than the default history of 256 hashes available via standard opcodes. At the same time the initial contract reduced the participation of the player in the costs of updating the database by requiring an update of a maximum of 10 hashes, which corresponds to one uin256 integer (5000 gas). If the lottery would run more bets than 1 bet / 10 blocks, the players would keep the database of hashes up to date without an active participation of the admin. In case the frequency was smaller the admin was required to run the putHashes(with argument 25)  function at least once per hour. The admin failed to do this during the hackaton and the frequency of bets was much smaller than in the expected production environment. An additional problem was the initializations of the database of hashes, which was vulnerable to exploits during the first period of 30 day, because the marker of hash creation time (hash >> 240) was set to the current period and the getHash function failed to detect that the hash is not initialized properly. This let to the exploit of setting a bet with ‘000000’ (or ‘000001’) and waiting for more than 256 blocks until the contract attempts to read the draw hash from the database instead of the short term memory stored in opcodes.  In the new contract we have decided to make the players responsible for the maintenance of the database of hashes. If the frequency of bets will stay above 1 bet / 10 block the costs of the lottery for the players will remain as it was. In case the frequency will drop, the players will be required to store more information about the history of draws in the database (up to 25*10 hashes, 25 uint256 integers). In case the frequency of bets falls below 1 bet / 250 hashes the player will be required to collect the lottery results within 256 blocks from the draw block. If the draw block hash was not stored in the database of hashes and the player did not collect results within 256 blocks after the draw, the bet will be lost (the previous contract returned the bet value).  This solution makes the user experience more problematic but protects the investors against negligence of the admin.  Other changes include the correction of the transaction order in the transferFrom function, a change in the initiation of the database of hashes and a modification of the hotStore function to allow anybody to deposit funds in the contract and remove these funds afterwards.  The new contract is deployed. The admin has been changed. We will start putting funds to the contract again.  Withdrawals by the admin are possible in the coldStore function.  function coldStore(uint _amount) external onlyOwner  {         houseKeeping();         require(_amount > 0 && this.balance >= (investBalance * 9 / 10) + walletBalance + _amount);         if(investBalance >= investBalanceGot / 2){ // additional jackpot protection             require((_amount <= this.balance / 400) && coldStoreLast + 4  60  24 * 7 <= block.number);         }         msg.sender.transfer(_amount);         coldStoreLast = block.number; }  This line: require(_amount > 0 && this.balance >= (investBalance * 9 / 10) + walletBalance + _amount);  guaranties that the admin can never withdraw more funds than: the 90% of the funds invested during the ICO plus the funds in wallets waiting to be withdrawn (these includes unpaid prizes due to lack of funds in the contract; however these prizes must have been claimed with the won() function before, otherwise the prizes are not known to the contract).

We were able to withdraw the remaining funds because there weren't any liabilities on the contract when the withdraw happened. To answer your question, the Admin management rules were a bit changed now what was described in the post above but it used to be:  In you case if the 150 000 ETH would be rised and 1500 ETH from the hacathon would stayed in the contract Admin would be able to withdraw in this case 0.25 % of that sum per week - 378,75 ETH but only if the amount is higher than the liabilities of the contract.  If less than 50 % of the ICO goal would be rised - less than 100 000 ETH Admin would be able to withdraw the whole surplus over the contract liabilities. If 50 000 ETH would be rised and 1500 prize would remain in the contract Admin would be able to withdraw 1500 ETH, but than nothing more if the total value would be less than all contract liabilities. This was designed to allow Admin to withdraw the funds from the Hackathon prize for example when the ICO would fail than Admin could withdraw the funds. During the Hackathon less than 50 % of the sum was raised - 0 to be exact, so Admin was able to withdraw all the surplus funds over the contract liabilities - there weren't any at the time.  The new rules will be described in details and will be published before the new Hackathon.

I'm not attacking you or your project, I just wish to inform the potential investors of the grave dangers of participating in an anonymous ICO, sending their hard earned money to a an anonymous team. This is exactly what bitcointalk is for, there are a lot of naive investors out there who do not understand how risky this is.",False

This is a great possibility to implement any final smart contract security solutions to guarantee comprehensive Investor and lottery protection. Congratulations to https://etherscan.io/address/0x6245c1804f7fceb305a60bbb5cb6e18f939edb69.  The SmartBillions hackathon was held as a final validation of the smart contract security and to secure future ICO Investors funds. The most important goal of the hackathon has always been and will be Investor funds protection. We witnessed the best possible scenario as the leak was indicated during the hackathon process and not after the start of the ICO. We strongly believe in this community audit mechanism and therefore the next hackathon will begin today, based on the revised smart contract.  As we learned, the function “putHashes”  was not executed by the admin as required. The hackathon allowed the team to improve the smart contract in order to validate it finally. The administrative strategy has been changed now to protect the investors the security of the contract will not require a continuous acitivity of the Admin. The updated smart contract is now available online at https://github.com/SmartBillions/SmartBillions/blob/master/SmartBillions.sol. The new Hackathon will now commence with the same prize of 1500 ETH. Later today a detailed description of the improvement will be published together with the description of solutions and modifications made within the smart contract. SmartBillions Team will be happy to answer all possible questions concerning the course of the hackathon.  The execution of the hackathon allowed community members to find the leak in the smart contract and later implement further security solutions to conduct one more hackathon validation. The funds were withdrawn by Admin, only because there was no smart contract commitments, such as wins payouts or Token redeeming. If interested, please see the SmartBillions smart contract to see limited funds withdrawal possibilities.  SmartBillions Team",False
