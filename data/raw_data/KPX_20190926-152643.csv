We will support 30+ languages, provide hosted nodes which reduce and a connective fabric to combine all of the applications, websites, and devices if people want to.  Also, it is not just for websites, but also IoT Devices, applications and even point of sale systems.  Most projects that have attempted this do not offer hosted nodes or provide a connective fabric. If you are a developer entering the space and you want to create applications, it is too expensive and complex if you need to maintain and pay for hosting a full node in order to create proof of concepts or integrate websites to use smart contracts. Providing these nodes for developers means we open an entire new market that would otherwise not participate due to cost and complexity.  Let me know if this addresses your questions,",False
