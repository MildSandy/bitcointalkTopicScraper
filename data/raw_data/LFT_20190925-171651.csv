At the beginning of developement of Life Charity we have analyzed the whole market of charity platforms or charity-related projects that have blockchain technology in their system. And you are absolutely right - most of them using blockchain only because it was a tranding technology and it helped to collect money or it just has been used it in wrong direction. We figured out how to use it right and make donations much easier and more transparent. Our team is not looking forward to collect money from this ICO for pernosal gains since we are not starting this ICO at the period of time when 90% of the ICOs were successfull only because of the market saturation and we will appreciate any help that we will get just to create reputation of technology that helps people for blockchain.,False
