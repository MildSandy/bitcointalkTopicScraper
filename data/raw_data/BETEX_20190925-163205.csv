Smart contracts were built under the following restrictions:  The bet occurs by the means of transferring the SBT token into a common liquidity pool for a given event in the system; The network commission (Ethereum) should be as small as possible; Reward payout (including the transfer of the commission) is realized by a smart contract based on the data received from the oracle. The architectural system is based on the following smart contracts:  SBT token contract complies with ERC-20 standard. SBT is a stable (relatively to the USD rate) token, the exchange rate of which is artificially maintained, with emissions and burning made during the exchange operations. Exchange contract is a smart contract for automatic exchange of ETH to SBT and vice versa. ETH/SBT rate is regularly updated with an oracle and artificially maintained at 1:1 / USD level. When crediting ETH, the required amount of SBT is being emitted. When withdrawing ETH, corresponding amount of SBT tokens is being burned. It is also planned to implement time restrictions on the token use. If the token is not used in the Betex system for a certain period of time, it is automatically exchanged back to the ETH source address. This may prevent speculations with tokens. Betex smart contract is a management system for liquidity pools (betting baskets). It accepts bids by moving SBT token to a specific pool (basket) for a limited period of time. After the waiting time has expired, the payout is redistributed among the players based on the oracle data. Commission smart contract is the contract-aggregator of commission fees. It charges the entire commission from operations in the system. The distribution of the commission is made by this contract once in a certain period of time (currently, once in 24 hours). Referral smart contract is contract managing the referral program. Betex supports a single-level referral program and redistributes part of the commission to the referral addresses. This smart contract stores the necessary dependencies. The implementation of smart contracts is carried out considering all modern practices and approaches, including the overflow checks, 100% test coverage and statistical control of Gas used.",False

Thereby, we are closing the MVP and beta phase and are officially starting the public operation. This is an important stage for our team and investors who have contributed to the development of Betex.    How it Works?  Betex platform’s interface has been created with intention to make it as user-friendly as possible. The process of placing bet looks like this: a trader picks one of the trading pairs (Assets) and selects one of the six trade intervals (Time), then decides on bet amount (Bet Amount) and, finally, indicates in which direction the price will move: Up (Call) or Down (Put).  Once the outcome of the forecast is known, the tokens of the traders who made the wrong prediction are divided among the traders who made the correct forecast of the price movement direction. At the same time, before paying the payouts, the platform charges a commission of 5% of the total amount of bets placed.  Take Advantage Now  Unlike most centralized systems, the size of a trader’s earnings in case of a correct forecast depends on the state of the common liquidity pool (bets of other traders) and can range from several percent to several tens of times. Win amount is being determined by the volume of the common pool of bets and the ratio of the volumes of bets to each of the outcomes.  We invite traders to register on Betex and experience the benefits of the platform right away. We will make sure to keep everyone updated on the platform’s development.  Are you a broker?  Feel free to contact us via our email to connect to our Platform.",False

To get the tokens on your wallet, you will need to perform a few easy actions to validate your wallet address and to guarantee the receival of your tokens. Please use this guide to get your tokens in a fast and correct manner.  First, navigate to Betex Lab website and sign in in the top right corner. If you have signed up before, you only need to enter your login and password to get to the bounty dashboard. If you haven’t, the signup process will be extremely easy. There is no KYC needed, and we do not require any scans or ID photos from you. When prompted, please enter the wallet address you have used for bounty participation.  After getting to the Bounty dashboard, you will be able to review your final bounty balance on your right.  To validate your wallet, send 0.0028 ETH from the wallet you have signed up for the bounty campaign and entered during setting up your bounty dashboard to the wallet address provided. These funds are used for running the smart contract which validates your address and sends your bounty payout to your wallet automatically. You will also need to have 0.0022 ETH remaining on that wallet to pay the transaction fee for the validation transaction. You can copy the receiving wallet address and use your favorite wallet to send the funds, or you can simply press Pay with Metamask button if you have Metamask installed and would like to use it instead. We recommend setting the gas price at 17 GWei.  After the smart contract validates your wallet, it will send your bounty tokens to your wallet address automatically, and you will receive them just in a few minutes.

What was once a promising industry has now stagnated because of high-profile scams and a widespread lack of accountability. Advances in blockchain technologies offer solutions, which could turn the fledgling industry into a powerhouse. To do this, the industry needs integrity. Traders must be able to trust that the system is equitable. Betex Lab limited has created a platform that solves the trust problem that has burdened the binary options industry.  Betex uses an innovative business model characterized by peer-to-peer binary options trading and unprecedented levels of market transparency and fairness. They key difference is that traders bet solely against each other; never against brokers. The model relies on Ethereum smart contracts. The following review will discuss the differences between Betex and standard brokers. It will also provide an overview of the betting process and the initial coin offering.  Comparison Between Betex And Traditional Binary Options Trading Transparency Blockchain technology allows information about prices, available assets, and market depth to be accessed by anyone at any time on the Betex platform. This transparency is important to making the trading run efficiently. Traditional trading systems, like Forex, lack transparency. This presents several obstacles. It puts investors in a position where they need to form bonds of trust with trading partners. A lack of transparency also makes it difficult to verify transactions and limits the productivity of the market. Transparency issues can also linvite scams.  Provable Fairness With standard brokers, the broker takes part in the betting process. This gives them an incentive to make sure the results of the bet work in their favor. Betex does not bet. Instead, it collects service fees that do not change no matter what the outcome of the bets are. Therefore, they have no reason to manipulate the results of the bets. This means you can trust that the betting process is fair in a way you cannot with most other trading platforms.  Instant Payouts Withdrawals typically take days to go through when it comes to traditional brokers. Because Betex uses smart contracts, payouts are released immediately into your Ethereum wallet. The whole process happens automatically. This is a clear advantage over other trading platforms. No one wants to wait a week or more for a payout when they can have instant gratification. In addition, many of the other trading platforms only allow for one free withdrawal a month. Otherwise, you have to pay for withdrawals. You do not have to worry about that with Betex.  No Deposits Platform users have access to all the operations and benefits Betex has to offer without having to deposit funds into the system. This means you do not have to worry about transaction fees, and you do not have to go through the hassle of making deposits. Most of the popular binary options trading services out there require a minimum deposit anywhere between $5.00 and $10.00. Some even require a deposit of $200.00 or more. Meanwhile, your maximum return could be as low as 80%.  Greater Control Over Your Money  One of the clearest benefits of the Betex platform is that users have significantly more control over their money. When you go through a regular broker, there is always a risk that scammers could end up robbing you of your money. With Betex, you do not have to worry about this. The platform was specifically designed as a solution to the scamming problem associated with traditional binary options trading. This is especially important because the industry is full of unregulated brokers and even the regulated brokers cannot fully be trusted. For instance, the broker could go out of business and abscond with your cash.     Limits Another problem that arises with traditional binary options trading is that brokers are not going to pay up if you are lucky enough to consistently win large sums of money. They will find a way to limit you, either by restricting trade size or limiting bet exposure. The blockchain-backed Betex eliminates this problem.  On the Betex platform, the users constitute a common pool of liquidity. Once the result of a bet comes in, 5% of the total bets goes to the commission. The remaining 95% is distributed across the winners who accurately predicted the price movement. This will always be true.   The Betting Process  The process is simple. As a trader, you select a trading pair. You will also hear the trading pair referred to as an asset. Once you have chosen a trading pair, you select a trading interval. You will have your choice of six time intervals. Next, you will select the amount of money you want to bet. The last step is to predict which direction the price will move (call or put).  Brokers can engage with the platform via the White Label solution. The mechanisms and systems of the Betex platform can be implements on the broker’s own domain. Betex will also provide them with technical support.  The betting process is facilitated by an easy-to-use user interface. You can see how simple the platform is to use with this live preview:  Conclusions Betex revolutionizes binary options trading. The company found a way to use Ethereum smart contracts and advances in blockchain technologies to resolve the dishonest and unfair trading mechanisms that threatened to wreak havoc on the industry. By restoring the trustworthiness and reliability necessary to maintain an efficient trading system, Betex is in a position to bring new life into the industry of binary options trading. Moreover, it is the only trading platform of its kind where 95% of total bets are distributed across users who made correct asset predictions. This is your chance to be a part of groundbreaking movement that could change the industry as we know it.     https://cryptoorders.com/articles/betex-versus-standard-binary-options-brokers/",False

We have launched betexscan.io — a dedicated block explorer that you can use to review any SBT transactions and wallet balances to make sure that all betting process is fair. We believe that it speeds up the research of SBT movements and increases overall transparency level of Betex platform.  On the Betex platform itself, we have added two links near every transaction ID in the list. The first opens the transaction in betexscan.io, and the second one copies the transaction ID to the clipboard to make it easy to review SBT transaction in any other block explorer you may use.  We are also improving our service by launching a ticket support system that is now available on the platform. Press the ‘Open new ticket’ button on the right side of dashboard screen to submit any bug, problem or suggestion directly to our support team. With this form, you can also attach screenshots and your browser’s diagnostic data to speed up the reviewing process in case of a problem.  We’re keeping on further improving of the platform with new features to be released soon. If you have any suggestions, please feel free to send it using any our communication channels, so we could have a feedback from our platform’s users to make Betex even better.  https://medium.com/@betex/betex-block-explorer-and-other-platform-updates-d670eac827b7",False

This token is used for betting in the system, payments to winners, brokers, holders of BETEX tokens, and for the development fund of the platform itself. All operations are fixed in the Ethereum blockchain. The SBT tokens are issued automatically by the smart contract with each exchange request.  With the reverse exchange, tokens are burned. Thus, the number of SBT tokens at each point of time reflects the current amount of funds in the system.  Each trading interval consists of two sub-intervals: during the first one, traders bet on the growth or lowering of the rate (5 min), and after the second one (25 min), the platform determines the winners and distributes the bets of the losers between them.   Logging into the Betex MVP requires a Rinkeby test network wallet with some test ETH balance.   To get a test network wallet, go to MyEtherWallet and select Rinkeby test network in the top-right corner. You can enter any password when prompted, as it is a test network. Save the key store file. You will be shown a private key afterward. Save it to have access to your test network wallet, as it will be required to access the MVC.  To log in your test network wallet, select the Private Key option in the ‘How would you like to access your wallet’ menu and enter your private key. Copy your wallet address,  To top up your ETH test balance, tweet your wallet address for verification. This tweet can be deleted after receiving the coins. Copy the link to your tweet.  Now, navigate to a Rinkeby network faucet, paste the tweet link to the text field and click ‘Give me Ether.’ After the ETH is added to your wallet balance, you may delete the tweet.  Open any MVP of your choice (either gobet.io or betex.io) and press ‘Add new user.’ Enter arbitrary login into the corresponding field and your wallet’s private key to the pKey field. Now you are logged into the platform with some test network ETH on your balance.   Click your username in the top-right corner to get to your profile. On your right, there is an exchange where you can buy SBT tokens for using the platform. Enter the desired SBT amount and press Buy. You will receive SBT to your balance within 20 seconds.  Now you can return back to your account and start betting in your MVP account.",False

This user should not be scammed, namely, when they see an ad message speaking of one thing and get an absolutely different thing after the registration on the website. This user should fully receive the promised functionality of the product and shouldn’t be bothered by bugs or any technical issues. Finally, a user should get some kind of profit from the product. If the product matches these conditions, then we can definitely say that it is a good and promising one.    When I first found out about Betex and its relation to the binary options, I thought that this is more connected to betting, with the possibility to control the results, and, thus, scam the end user. After all, we have all heard about traditional binary options where the brokers are in control of everything, as the processes are happening on their platforms, which is absolutely shady. But, first and foremost, Betex stood out with the ‘peer-to-peer’ thing, which positively distinguished it from the traditional binary options.  After a thorough study of the project, I came to a conclusion that this project is not about the binary options, but about the blockchain-powered technology. Betex platform allows users to bet against each other. In case of the binary options, it involves that ‘peer-to-peer’ thing that excludes broker as an opponent. Thereby, the platform also is not able to act as a broker and influence the result. Betex team was able to create a fully decentralized platform where each step is recorded on the blockchain and cannot be changed. One more important moment is the usage of the average price index, which eliminates an artificial pump or dump of the price.    Before becoming the project’s advisor, I spent a long time communicating with the team and Oleg Torkhov, the Co-Founder. I agreed on the cooperation only when I got personally convinced. That the project meets all user’s demands and doesn’t scam them. The team has made a huge job of creating the platform itself before launching the ICO campaign. The Betex platform is ready, has an attractive UI and is technically well-established. The 95% payouts to the users are really made and this is probably the highest rate on the market.  The global approach of the top management and the team to the project makes me believe that Betex has a big future and it’s coming up already today.",False

Written by Scott Douglas  When I was first approached to help the Betex team, I’ll admit, I was taken back. Binary Options are notorious for gaining popularity in the last few years with many of the companies touting Binary Options as a legitimate investment vehicle, only to see people lose significant amounts of money in a very short period of time. Imagine — combining this with an ICO, how would anyone ever support this project?!  Before we start — let’s look at what Binary Options are. Binary Options sites are marketed to the same demographic who gamble online — unfortunately they represent themselves as a form of investing. They promise huge returns with little every hour, even though the odds are ALWAYS in the houses favour. Essentially you choose anything that is publically traded and you make a bet on whether or not that stock will increase or decrease in a very short period of time. If you’re wrong, you lose everything. Binary Options are usually an all or nothing bet. The issue with traditional Binary Options is not what the individuals are betting on, it’s the marketing and verbiage used to convince people that they have some control over the outcome of their results by being well educated, informed citizens, constantly reading charts, staying up to date on news etc.  Now — imagine combining this horrible manipulative market with an ICO, isn’t that horrible?  Surprisingly, no.  Betex does Binary Options the right way.  Betex has no illusion as to what the Binary Options market is, betting — plain and simple. They realize that gambling is OK as long as the people who are participating in it, understand what they’re doing. Betex sets up their platform as a peer-to-peer platform allowing individuals to place bets on binary Options against their peers (not the house). Betex simply acts as a service provider delivering a platform and using the service fees collected from user engagement as the sole means of operational revenue. They gain absolutely nothing from individuals winning or losing binary option bets and have completely removed themselves from any liability by only allowing fellow peers to bet against each other. They openly advertised themselves as a betting platform and will obtain all required licensing to operating a gambling/betting entity in their jurisdiction.  Leveraging the power of Blockchain technology, Betex will ensure all bets, options and payouts are instantaneous and transparent to all users engaged in the platform. They will implement KYC for both their crowdsale as well as their platform to ensure compliance and security of their users. At the end of the day — this is what Blockchain is meant for, both in practical use as well as in theory — leveraging an existing idea and making it better, safer, more transparent and more accessible to the user.",False

I learned to appreciate thoughtful projects with ingenious ideas and capacity to transform conventional practices. Projects that are destined to become the new black  I feel more than lucky to collaborate with Betex. Yes, it’s an ICO and it changes the whole perception of binary options. Here’s a list of five things that I highlight for myself in ICO projects and how they perform in Betex.  Comprehensive structure There is apparently more to this project than few enthusiasts with a slapdash whitepaper. What strikes me the most about Betex is how thoroughly thought-out every aspect of this project is — from its underlying concept through product features and design to business model and strategy.  Transformational concept Committed to eliminating the issue of trust, Betex was the first and only to introduce provably fair conditions and incorruptible environment to the binary options market. Through a human-centered approach to technology, they offer its users exceptionally peer-to-peer betting experience, thereby, reinventing financial derivatives for good.  User-centered product To translate such a complex concept not only into a clear message but also into a fully-functional product, unlike most blockchain-based, Betex made a significant investment in design and development. I firmly believe that implementing leading-edge design principles for decentralized applications to build an intuitive, user-friendly interface soon will prove to be a significant strategic decision, affecting overall progress of the platform.  Elaborate investment opportunities Undoubtedly, the idea itself along with the approach to its realization would have been enough to attract investors. And yet, Betex offers unparalleled investment opportunities, making its business model simply brilliant. Ultimately, for contributing to the project, investors are entitled not only to potentially tradeable tokens but a genuine source of effortless income. 2.5% commission from overall platform turnover will be distributed among Betex token holders. It’s like to find a goose that infinitely lays golden eggs  Effortless income The thing is Betex profits profit from collecting a service fee from its users. 50% of those earnings will be distributed among token holders, proportionally to the number of tokens they have in possession. In other words, the greater contribution you make, the more significant chunk of service commission you will receive. Meaning, every new active user on the platform will instantly increase your earnings.  It’s that simple. It makes sense.",False

We remind you that the token price during the main token sale will start at $3 and increase progressively, more details here.  The main ICO (token sale) will start on February, 20th. Within this crowdsale, all investors will be asked to go through a KYC procedure and will receive the personal investment wallet address afterwards, just like within the pre-sale rounds.  KYC procedure means providing our compliance team with the identity verification documents and signing a SAFT (Single Agreement for Future Tokens) agreement, which is a contract under which all BETEX tokens will be distributed after Token Generation Event (TGE) in April 2018. We understand that you, as investors, are more interested in getting the BETEX tokens right away, but with this agreement, you can rest assured that you will get your BETEX tokens within 10 days after TGE.  Betex platform will be launched on main network and open for users before the TGE, which makes it distinct from other projects who only start development after the ICO. All payouts will start accumulating right from the platform launch and will be paid out after the TGE to all eligible token holders.  https://betexlab.com/",False

The problem here is the uncontrolled time of the transaction (from the time it hits the transaction pool to the time it was confirmed), as well as the allowable deviation of the system variable (solidity block.timestamp) in 900 seconds compared to the real time.  The lifecycle of a pool includes the following:  Opening/creating a pool  During realization of the Betex smart contract it was decided to give up transaction at the moment of opening the pool for the sake of creating a system of identifiers. Thus, in order to execute a bet, you only need to know the pool ID. If there is no pool at the time of the bet, it will be created automatically.  Closing the pool  Closing the pool is implemented using a system transaction, which is carried out from a predetermined address (and is part of the Betex smart contract management system). The closure essentially means a ban on accepting bets from a certain moment. Closing the pool should occur faster with respect to other transactions (including bets), so this transaction is conducted with an increased gas price.  Payouts  Payouts are realized using a system transaction (or series of transactions), which is conducted from a predefined address. The calculation of winnings and the transfer of tokens is carried out inside the smart contract, so, potentially, such a transaction may not be invested in the gas limit of the block (with a large number of bets), so the system has the opportunity to pay winnings by sending a series of transactions, which makes it possible to work with a large number of users.",False

Betex business model is fundamentally different from traditional binary options.  With Betex, traders bet against each other instead of brokers. The situation when a broker gains profits when a trader losses is excluded. Brokers receive commission from gains, and the platform itself runs on service fees.  In traditional model, brokers operate independently and are not connected to each other in any way. With Betex, brokers use a common pool of liquidity with the same trading pairs. Rewards for traders depend on the state of the liquidity pool in Betex, whereas in traditional platforms the reward in case of a win is fixed, and often is too low to guarantee platform’s profitability.  Betex also has a mechanism of distribution of parts of broker’s income amongst traders in form of sharing of 2,5% of income to all BETEX token holders in SBT tokens. In a traditional binary options platform, whole broker’s income remains with the broker.  Betex is built on Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts, thus offers a completely transparent and open process. Every trader is able to check all money flow based on an ERC-20 SBT token, which makes Betex a provably fair platform. With any other platform, whole trading process is carried out in the broker’s backend and it can’t be transparent.  Unlike any other platforms, Betex doesn’t require a minimum deposit or withdrawal amount and performs in and out operations of any amount instantly.  What also adds to the Betex transparency is that strike and outcome rates are provided by different public sources, weighted based on their trading volume. Traditional platforms usually use one liquidity provider which is often unknown.  Betex has a completely new approach to binary options and creates a new, fully open and transparent way of trading which will be equally profitable for all participants of the trading process, for the first time in the history of such financial instruments.

There are 2 tokens in the system: BETEX and SBT.  SBT (Stable Betting Token) is a token with a stable value of $1.00. This token is used for betting in the system, payments to winners, brokers, holders of BETEX tokens, and for the development fund of the platform itself. All operations are fixed in the Ethereum blockchain. The SBT tokens are issued automatically by the smart contract with each exchange request.  With the reverse exchange, tokens are burned. Thus, the number of SBT tokens at each point of time reflects the current amount of funds in the system.  BETEX is the main token in the system. 50% of the platform’s commission income is distributed among BETEX token holders in the SBT tokens. BETEX is issued once in the amount of 10,000,000 tokens. After that, its quantity remains constant.  The pre-sale of the BETEX tokens will take place in 2 rounds in November-December 2017 under the SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) agreement. Since the BETEX token will have certain characteristics of a security, it will be registered with the SEC and other regulatory authorities within 15 days after the initial distribution.  The profit received between the launch of the platform and the actual distribution of BETEX tokens, will be accumulated on the public Ethereum address and will be distributed among BETEX token holders during 2 weeks or less, after the distribution event is over. Distribution of BETEX tokens is planned to take place in the second quarter of 2018. More information will soon be provided.  https://betexlab.com/",False

In early May 2012, the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission (CySEC) included Binary Options to the list of financial instruments recognized by the law of the Republic of Cyprus on Investment Services, Investment Activities and Regulated Markets of 2007.  Thousands of brokers and traders worldwide were massively employing this instrument back then. It was greatly favored for the simplicity of concept and high chances of success. The industry was experiencing exponential growth until 2014, reaching tens of billions of dollars in its annual turnover.  But something went wrong there. In the following years, regulators from all over the world have been making rather strong statements, claiming that binary options is a deceit and discouraging traders to get involved.  For instance,  American Regulators have issued a “Warning to Investors,” which explained that legitimate platforms for binary options trading must be registered with authorities and comply with a set of rules. And yet, no web-platforms, brokers, or whatsoever, possess the relevant registration in the US.  „The Times Of Israel‟ magazine has published a series of articles entitled “Wolves Of Tel Aviv: The Grand Immoral Cheating Of Binary Options,” exposing the binary options industry as a big scam.

The work of the oracle is built on the principle of publicity and transparency. The results of its work (in the form of payment transactions) will be available for verification through the blockchain explorer (etherescan.io for the Ethereum network).  Every time, the Betex composite rate is calculated as the average weighted of the exchange rates on the main exchanges. Each trading pair has a separate list of exchanges with significant volume for this particular pair. Thereby, the weight factor is trade volume on each of the exchanges.  In case one of the exchanges stops delivering data on the rates, its rate (the latter value) continues to participate in determining the composite rate, the strike rate of which includes the data of this exchange. This prevents sharp artificial jumps of the composite rate due to the redistribution of weight values.  With a fixed rate from one data provider, the courses of the remaining suppliers continue to move the composite course according to the current market situation. This is how we smooth out such an abnormal situation as correctly as possible.  If the data supply by this exchange is not resumed by the start of the new round, the strike rate will be calculated already not considering the rate from this exchange. Thus, such data provider will be temporarily “disqualified” in the Betex system.

Smart contracts were built under the following restrictions: The bet occurs by the means of transferring the SBT token into a common liquidity pool for a given event in the system; The network commission (Ethereum) should be as small as possible; Reward payout (including the transfer of the commission) is realized by a smart contract based on the data received from the oracle.  The architectural system is based on the following smart contracts:  SBT token contract complies with ERC-20 standard. SBT is a stable (relatively to the USD rate) token, the exchange rate of which is artificially maintained, with emissions and burning made during the exchange operations. Exchange contract is a smart contract for automatic exchange of ETH to SBT and vice versa. ETH/SBT rate is regularly updated with an oracle and artificially maintained at 1:1 / USD level. When crediting ETH, the required amount of SBT is being emitted. When withdrawing ETH, corresponding amount of SBT tokens is being burned. It is also planned to implement time restrictions on the token use. If the token is not used in the Betex system for a certain period of time, it is automatically exchanged back to the ETH source address. This may prevent speculations with tokens. Betex smart contract is a management system for liquidity pools (betting baskets). It accepts bids by moving SBT token to a specific pool (basket) for a limited period of time. After the waiting time has expired, the payout is redistributed among the players based on the oracle data. Commission smart contract is the contract-aggregator of commission fees. It charges the entire commission from operations in the system. The distribution of the commission is made by this contract once in a certain period of time (currently, once in 24 hours). Referral smart contract is contract managing the referral program. Betex supports a single-level referral program and redistributes part of the commission to the referral addresses. This smart contract stores the necessary dependencies.  The implementation of smart contracts is carried out considering all modern practices and approaches, including the overflow checks, 100% test coverage and statistical control of Gas used.",False

The platform's commission will be 5% only, the liquidity will be derived from a common pool of brokers, and brokers themselves will integrate into the platform via the white label mechanism. This is the only platform, where as much as 95% of funds are distributed among traders who make correct assumptions. 2.5% (half of the platform's commission 5%) of the total platform turnover will be distributed among the holders of BETEX tokens, accordingly to the number of tokens they own.

There are 2 tokens in the system: BETEX and SBT.  SBT (Stable Betting Token) is a token with a stable value of $1.00. This token is used for betting in the system, payments to winners, brokers, holders of BETEX tokens, and for the development fund of the platform itself. All operations are fixed in the Ethereum blockchain. The SBT tokens are issued automatically by the smart contract with each exchange request.  With the reverse exchange, tokens are burned. Thus, the number of SBT tokens at each point of time reflects the current amount of funds in the system.  BETEX is the main token in the system. 50% of the platform‟s commission income is distributed among BETEX token holders in the SBT tokens. BETEX is issued once in the amount of 10,000,000 tokens. After that, its quantity remains constant.  The pre-sale of the BETEX tokens will take place in 2 rounds in November-December 2017 under the SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) agreement. Since the BETEX token will have certain characteristics of a security, it will be registered with the SEC and other regulatory authorities within 15 days after the initial distribution.  The profit received between the launch of the platform and the actual distribution of BETEX tokens, will be accumulated on the public Ethereum address and will be distributed among BETEX token holders during 2 weeks or less, after the distribution event is over. Distribution of BETEX tokens is planned to take place in the second quarter of 2018. More information will soon be provided.",False
