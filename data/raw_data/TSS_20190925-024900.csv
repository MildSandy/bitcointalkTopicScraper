The Secure Element  which resides in the smartcard chip will act as a secure enclave for the storage of our cryptocurrency private keys. An APP will be developed to securely interface with the SE and sign all transactions without the private key leaving the SE. This will turn the mobile device into a secure hardware wallet.  This is a much safer and more convenient form factor as we no longer need to carry any separate device. It all fits nicely into your smartphone and is totally out of sight of the user.  This will revolution the way we store and transfer our cryptocurrency and make the blockchain safer for everyday use!  David,False

ANN Translations Chinese | German | Russian | Arabic | Indonesian | Filipino Vietnamese | Hebrew | Italian | Romanian | Croatian  What is Token Security Scheme?  Token Security Scheme (TSS) aims to address the existing security gaps in the crypto-currencies eco-system and prevent attacks on any exchange or facility storing such digital assets. With a strong background in digital key management in the payment and banking industry, our team of cyber security experts plan to implement this technology and its best practices to strengthen security in the crypto-currency eco-system.  TSS plan to store crypto-assets such as users’ private keys on Distributed Hardware Security Module (DHSM) infrastructure, which will be set up within Enhanced Payment Card Industry (EPCI) security compliant facilities. These facilities are geographically dispersed in different locations and will be regularly audited by certified professionals to ensure up-to-date compliances. DHSMs will provide a safe ‘Vault’ with proper Cryptocurrencies Key Management System (CKMS) and procedures to mitigate and minimise the risks of digital asset storage in the crypto-currencies eco-system. TSS will allow stakeholders to safeguard digital assets effectively and leave a lasting legacy for their future generations.   TSS is an initiative from 5M Holdings Pte Ltd to improve the security features in relation to the key management within the blockchain eco-system.
