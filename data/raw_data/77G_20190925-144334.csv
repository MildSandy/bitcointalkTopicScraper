GraphenTech is founded by an HP experienced engineering manager who is also a co-founder of an electrical-car production firm. GraphenTech’s headquarter is located in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands.  The company envisions to provide graphene material worldwide and will monetize its products through the  cryptocurrency 77G.   The Future In the near future, all transportation in cities will only rely on electrical power, it would mean no pollution, no noise, and a better breathing atmosphere. It is possible that those vehicles will be recharged  from home in 5 minutes without burning a hole in pockets as prices of fuel have reached an all-time high.  Perhaps in time, travelling from London to New-York will take half of the current flight time through planes more weather resistant, safer, more aerodynamic and lighter, at the same time. It could also be possible that  one day all our familiar gadgets of everyday life would be slimmer, faster while lasting longer. Medical improvements could help people heal faster with better understanding and control of biological processes.  Now imagine an affordable technology that would give millions of people access to clean and safe drinking water.  All these science fiction ideas could soon be part of reality with the development of graphene, also known as the wonder material.   What is Graphene? Graphene is a material with a form of carbon consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a  hexagonal lattice and represents the first two-dimensional nanomaterial produced by researchers.  Scientists theorized about graphene for years but in 2004, they finally isolated a single-atom-thick sheet  of graphene from graphite (the raw material) and subsequently won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2010.  Graphene is the thinnest and strongest material known until now, is just one atom thick (a million times thinner than a hair) and yet 150 times stronger than the same  weight of steel. It is foldable at will and expandable by more than 20%.   It conducts electricity more than 200 times more efficiently than silicon and is made entirely of carbon,  which is the fourth-most-abundant element in the universe!   Graphene's Applications          GrapheneTech's Solution The company aims to provide graphene material worldwide and will monetize its products through the  cryptocurrency, 77G. GraphenTech is founded by an HP experienced engineering manager who is also  co-founder of an electrical-car production firm (which is partnered with various Asian companies). GraphenTech headquarters are located in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, registered at the Netherland  Chamber of Commerce with the number 70985456 and Tax Office NL266123909B01.   Our Products GraphenTech chemical department, the teams have been advancing a graphene production technology  for more than two years. The work of our teams focuses on two main products, Graphene Oxide (GO)  and Reduced Graphene Oxide (rG). These are the two most demanded forms on the market as they  can be directly used for many different applications such as in electronics, energy storage, material  composites, medicals, and so on. The high- quality of our products lie in its elevated purity  (concentration in carbon ≥ 98% / ph5). In a second stage, we will develop nanoplatelets and polymer  fibres to diversify our market with new range of applications. Our industrial production is in the process  of being patented. Later on, other patents will be developed to protect the machines and protocols that are important in the manufacture of our graphene-based products and new applications.   How Will Blockchain Be Utilized at GrapheneTech? At GraphenTech, the blockchain technology will be used at different stages of the project in various  departments. Firstly, the ICO will help the core team to raise the funds required for the implementation  of the industrial project. Tokens will be stored on blockchain wallet and will be used to pay for the company’s  services (useability)  or even exchange them at a later date when its value increases (security).   Once the commercial activity has started, to protectour customer, GraphenTech will be introducing a purchase  protection mechanism that  helps minimize the risk of scams and fraud by providing full payment protection,  acting as a third-party mediator during the transaction, and ensuring the delivery of the graphene and future  other products and services. Smart contracts will be used within our supply chain department to integrate commercial transactions and agreements automatically and  transparently. It will enable disintermediation by  enforcing the obligations of all parties in a contract without the added expense of a middleman.   As GraphenTech is working on agreements with companies to co-develop new products and services, the smart  contract can be the key simplification actor for financial, services, insurance, payments, transfer technology as  patents, production orders and certify the legitimacy of products and services.  The GraphenTech Blockchain development team is working on the next step, migrate from public to a private  platform to integrate customers and suppliers under security environment.   GrapheneTech Token (77G) GraphenTech supported by fintech blockchain companies will introduce its own digital currency, 77G.  These tokens are crypto-assets issued by our company that will increase in value over time at a rate linked to  our future performance, supporting. A strong competitive advantage in the sector.  A Security Token Overall These tokens constitute a digital asset, where the main use-case, and the reason for the contributors to buy the  tokens, is the possible anticipation of value appreciation. The 77G token is an ERC-20 compliant token, whereby  we will ensure price stability by encouraging token holders to temporarily lock up tokens. Our legal experts are in  the process of putting in place all compliance for US and other international laws. The Whitepaper will be updated  as we move forward in this process.  A Future Usability Tokens can change their function over time, especially when tokens are being sold prior to having a product / utility  in place but develop this use-value at a later point. In this case, a 77G token holder will first be able to buy our range  of graphene at a competitive price. A percentage of our production will be reserved for 77G currency holders. With the  partnership agreements between with key actors of the various technological sectors, it will be possible at a later stage  to use 77G to buy a wide range of high-tech graphene-based products like superchargers, batteries, electric vehicles  as well as services like insurance and finance.

The person behind it is called Raul Molina, he did a scam attempt to the Ecuador back in 2017, when he signed a contract as a HP representative (denied officially later by HP) with the government to use the land of the state university named Yachay to create an ""Electric Car Megafactory"", well it was just a scam.  I don't know if some one here remember something about Tesla denying partnership officially and in Tesla's forum with some fake car factory called RedTech? Well, it was Raul Molina behind it too. Now he removed his picture from the graphentech's website and white paper to not being linked.  http://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/221f57c2718e22830cda3d5e93e5b1c1bfbedb2b3e4f34fe2b797d9a20c7e231.png  Please also check the comments at the bottom of this page: https://blokt.com/ico-ratings/graphentech  Due to the massive scam warnings in some cryptocurrency websites, Molina decided to remove himself from the equation just to make people think it is not a scam. Also he deleted some pages, Graphentech was advertised on Foundico.com but after a lot of scam warning post and after being reported as scam, he removed before FoundIco put a warning sign....or maybe they did and inmediatelly Molina removed the page, who knows.  If you wanna know more about his previous scam attemp, with official documents, chats, etc..., find more about it here:  http://www.vistazo.com/seccion/pais/politica-nacional/cronica-de-una-farsa-anunciada-carros-electricos-en-yachay  https://twitter.com/RedTechLeaks  Or Please google it: 'Raul Molina' 'Yachay' 'Red Tech', and you will find some journalist post, just translate it because it is in Spanish.  BTW, the name GraphenTech I think comes from the company GraphenE Tech (with an extra 'e' that I capitalized to be noticed), maybe he choose that name just to be confused on porpuse with that company that looks like offers graphene but is not related in any cryptocurrency.",False

I found out that if you search on Google the words 'graphentech' + 'scam' you will find some of the scam warnings posted on Foundico.com, luckily someone made screenshots of them before Raul Molina took it down.  Just look in the images section after google search, for me the first 5 or 6 images are exclusively related to expose the scam, also there's a screenshot from graphentech's early twitter account showing in the text: ""...who also founded Red Tech, an electric car producer...""  Well, Red Tech was a fake company created to scam the Ecuadorian government on 2017, there's a lot of information about Redtech and Raul Molina on different ecuadorian news papers websites, journals, blogs and social media  .",False

With that I know you are part of the Scam, divowok (I think you are the scammer Raul Pazos Medina, or the other low scammer Frank Vargas, I'm not sure, but definitely you aren't Raul Molina), but anyway nice video but it's not yours, you are using others people videos and info to scam, that video belongs to the Science Channel and was published on Jun 20, 2016....before the fake graphentech company exist, way before Raul Molina tried to scam the Ecuador government with the Red Tech fiasco.  The thing is graphentech is just a scam, simple as that. Please post some building videos or process videos of your own company, no? that's because graphentech has not developed anything, as far as I know Molina is trying to use some Ecuadorian university labs to claim as his own, but Ecuador knows that Raul Molina is a well known scammer.  I'm from Netherlands...and I know the address on Netherlands where graphentech supposedly is set, but is just a warehouse place where I asked some people if they know your company but no idea. Also I know the other address which is just a road with small 2 floor houses, you know which address I mean, the one at Kvk.nl registry.  Sadly that in this, or any other community, there are people like you and the graphentech team willing, at all cost, to scam others. Please find a decent and honest job and help people instead of scam them.  Be sure that I will try to warn other about the graphentech scam  ----  @dzkrb. Graphene wasn't invented, it always existed, and it had been unintentionally produced in small quantities for centuries, since the fabrication of graphite pencils and other related stuff, it was observed for the first time on 1962 using an electron microscope, but was isolated and rediscovered by the 2 Dutch-Russian-British scientist.",False
