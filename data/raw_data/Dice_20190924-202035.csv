This is how it works: the base of the mechanism is the random number generator. Potentially, this system can be controlled from the outside, i.e. the one with the access to a server or programming code is able to directly influence game results.  SPECIAL SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE REQUIRED Average players or novice without any defined game strategy are more likely to be at a high risk of loss. In the traditional poker rooms 80% of players become planktons for 20% of whales.  VULNARABILITY AND SECURITY Currently, casinos store their data in centralized servers and, though the latest encryption technologies in place help keep such data safe, the information still isn’t impregnable. In fact, several cases of hacking have been recorded in the past three years. Online casinos are attractive targets for hackers as a large sum of money flows through them and hacking them could be very lucrative.",False

Cryptocurrency is a form of digital money that is designed to be secure and, in many cases, anonymous. It is decentralized and run by a network of computers instead of a single person or a company.    The money you own is stored in a digital wallet you keep in the cloud or offline on a PC and can be sent to someone via a computer or a mobile device like a smartphone. Each transaction is recorded in what is called a blockchain that is publicly available to all currency holders. Essentially, cryptocurrencies are limited entries in a database that no one can change unless specific conditions are fulfilled.    Every day cryptocurrency is getting more and more popularity and usage across the world. Anyway, the points in favor of cryptocurrency are many, but then again, every form of money or opportunity for investment comes with its own risks.  source: https://www.quora.com/What-is-cryptocurrency-and-its-pros-and-cons/answer/DICEGAME-Platform?share=ceb89637",False

No matter how complicated is the algorithm used in such programs, it does not provide you with 100% random results.

His partner had only to follow the instructions while playing slot machines. In 2008, Norman Clem noticed that he had been losing too much when he plays dice. He detected that he had been winning only in 27% of the cases instead of the announced 49% by analyzing all his gaming sessions for a year.

I am Vadim Shlapokov, CEO of the DICEGAME project, and today I want to take you to explore the History.  For me dice is one of the most mysterious objects in the world, they are directly related to the tales of the past. The Dice by itself gave the beginning to all games humanity knows. The word “Hazard” originally comes from the Arabic expression “az-zahr”, which translates as “dice”. So that the Dice reflects the nature of the Game by itself.  Dice left mark in history of many civilizations: China, Egypt, Ancient Rome, Greece, India. It’s very hard to define, where and when they originally appeared. Archeological excavations provide us with more and more evidences that dice were created in each culture independently. The most ancient dice prototype was found in the Egyptian and Sumerian tombs. It had a form of an oblong flat object (bars, stones) with notches, so-called Dice2 (D2), i.e. yes/no, even/odd.  But most likely this mystical objects are much older than we even imagine. One of the purposes of dice were fortune telling. There is something common between the desire to know your fate and the desire to try your fate, tho. At least dice.  Regarding the question of faith. A legend of Olaf Haraldsson, the 11th-century King of Norway, tells how he wagered his kingdom on a roll of the dice against the King of Sweden. Although the Swedish king rolled the number of twelve, the highest possible roll on two dice, Olaf claimed that God would let him roll higher. He threw them intensely and one of the dice split in half, so that one side shown 6 and another — 1, which when added to the other six, resulted in a score of 13. It was recognized as the winning roll.",False

There is a problem with a low speed in games based on Ethereum and FunFair team solved it by scaling the blockchain: they brought the gameplay out of the blockchain and created their own Fate Channel technology. And, in general, here we understand, that there is no need for blockchain implementation in game mechanics. It is neither good nor bad: in the case of Ethereum, it’s effective.  Fate Channel technology made the process of the game cheaper: only 2 calls to the smart contract per session, despite the number of bets. You have to pay the commission only 1 time: when the game results are recorded in the blockchain, and when there is a payout of the prize (or no payout). But logically, the commission will be multiplied by 2, since there are 2 calls to the smart contract. The cost of fast transactions is about $0.08 USD * 2 = 16 cents, the commission for slower transactions will be equal to 0,02$ * 2 = 4 cents. If targeting an audience with micro stakes, it’s not that small amount of money: when the stake is $1, the minimum commission is 4%, maximum — 16%.

There is no one to decide, whether someone will benefit and someone will lose. The platform is only the organizer of the game, but not the opponent.  The answer is simple: everything is decided by the players by themselves, or rather their physical values directly come into the game.  How would this happen?  Let us tell you.  Uniquely designed algorithm, which determines dice values (a.k.a. Algorithm of the winner determination) is recorded in a smart contract and bases on two main principles:  To completely eliminate the interest in cheating To simplify verification of the results, and most importantly, its understanding. The mechanics of the game are the following:  We take 2 physical parameters from each player. These verifiable parameters together influence the final result of the throw of both opponents.  To make it clear:  Parameter №1: T1, T2 — the number of milliseconds at the time of the call to the smart contract. Simply put, the most accurate time for a roll of the dice.  Parameter №2: P1, P2-value of the phone’s accelerometer.  Accelerometer is an instrument that measures the acceleration of objects during any movement. In case of the DICEGAME platform, accelerometer applies to the shake movement you make to roll the dice.  In accordance, parameters T1, P1 are applicable to the player №1, and the parameters T2, P2 — to the player №2.  The combination of these parameters gives us only 4 possible variations of the dice values.  Dice №1: T1 P1 T2 Dice №2: T1 P1 P2 Dice №3: T1 T2 P2 Dice №4: P1 T2 P2 This indicates that the outcome of the game depends on both players.  So, we eliminate the interest in cheating: to predict the results, players have to conspire, but it makes no sense, because they play against each other.  Verification of the algorithm is as simple as possible for verification: we take the sum of three parameters, divide them by 6, and add 1 to the indivisible excess (so that the values fall within the range from 1 to 6).  T1=101 T2=303 P1=202 P2=404 Dice №1:  1. Sum of three parameters: 101 + 202 + 303 = 606  2. The sum is divided by 6: 606: 6 = 101  3. There is no indivisible excess, so it is equal to 0  4. Add 1 to the indivisible excess: 0 + 1 = 1 — this is the value of the first dice  Dice №2:  1. Sum of three parameters: 101 + 202 + 404 = 707  2. The sum is divided by 6, and because 707 may not be divided by 6, we present this value as a sum: (702 + 5): 6 = 702: 6 + 5: 6. 702 is divided by 6; and 5, of course, is not  3. Indivisible excess — 5  4. Add 1 to the indivisible excess: 5 + 1 = 6 is the value of the second dice  Dice №3:  1. Sum of three parameters: 101 + 303 + 404 = 808  2. The sum divided by 6, because 808 may not be divided by 6, we present this value as a sum: (804 + 4): 6 = 804: 6 + 4: 6. 804 may be divided by 6; and 4, of course, not  3. Indivisible excess — 4  4. Add 1 to the indivisible excess: 4 + 1 = 5 is the value of the third dice  Dice №4:  1. Sum of three parameters: 202 + 303 + 404 = 909  2. The sum divided by 6, because 909 may not be divided by 6, then we present this value as a sum: (903 + 3): 6 = 903: 6 + 3: 6. 903 may be divided by 6; and 3, of course, not  3. Indivisible excess — 3  4. Add 1 to the indivisible excess: 3 + 1 = 4-this is the value of the fourth dice  If you noticed, the values of the first two dice are more affected by player # 1, so they will belong to him, and the 3d and the 4th belong to the second player for the same reason.  In this example the victory of the player number 2 is clearly in evidence: his 9 points against the 7 points of the player number 1.  The actual implementation is a bit more complex: the values of the parameters will be hashed. But in general, we see that the algorithm for determining the winner is simple in its nature and understandable to everyone who is friends with mathematics.",False

It does not constitute financial advice. You should always seek your own professional financial advisor and do your own research before investing or trading.  So you’ve taken the red pill, and now you’re either looking to invest, or have started investing into cryptocurrencies already.

There’s now over 1300 cryptocurrencies on coinmarketcap.com, and dozens of exchanges, and many layers of technologies to understand. The crypto world can be quite overwhelming for newcomers, and it takes plenty of time and research to understand how to get started, and to avoid costly mistakes.  I’ll attempt to breakdown the basics and the major things every investor should know, including what crypto wallets are and how to use them, how to trade, where to trade, what to look for in good projects, and general advice that I’ve personally learned from investing in this space since the beginning of the year.",False

The implementation is done by the means of the smart contracts. So, by tracking history of all transactions we provide transparency and easy way of results verification. The access to the transactions history is available in the client application.  From the engineering perspective of the FM game based on the DICEGAME platform we can specify three main types of algorithms which are required to be implemented in the decentralized and open way with the help of smart-contracts: 1.   Determination of dice value during roll. 2.   Determination of the winner in two players' dispute. 3.   Determination of the winner in a tournament. Thus, a regular tournament is divided into the numerous separate disputes between pairs of players, and each dispute is splitted into several dice rolls.  But, we can easily keep track and control of each stage of these actions. In the next sections there is the detailed description of all algorithms and stages.  Based on the said above, we can conclude that there is no need in RNG as exact formulas in smart contracts are used. Winning odds are increasing, as there is no centralized control and play is conducted with real people.",False

Thanks for excellent question - that's one of our killing features. I won't dive deeply into our formula (since all the details will be available in our White Paper as well), but will say that we came up with a special approach in dice value determination, based on real physical values, which allows to introduce ideal allocation for each dice-face. This logic is wrapped into smart-contracts excluding any possibility to influence on this process. The key principle is that the platform is “Face-to-face”, so we are not a contestant to our players (which is important thing to ponder imo).

How many of you felt lucky at some point, but had no idea of how to take advantage of that feeling? Well, today you may find the answer. Please, allow us to introduce our revolutionary project - DICEGAME.  The DICEGAME platform builds a fair and transparent ground for P2P games. We retrieve user’s trust by wrapping all the game logic into the smart-contracts based on the blockchain. The platform provides tha playground for the P2P game with up 50% of winning odds. We decentralize everything in the DICEGAME platform: only white box algorithms, clear and user-friendly conditions of games, fast and transparent transactions, no limitations on deposits and withdrawals.  The platform ensures a provably fair gaming environment with real-time interaction between users around the world for online-gaming. Thanks to the blockchain technology we connect the distant past and the faraway future of the iGaming world providing the solution for the following problems: operator's credibility and trust in elements of randomness and methods of winner determination. We grant the opportunity to participate in the games on our platform built to meet user's needs and interests.      All key algorithms related to the game mechanics are implemented by the means of the blockchain technology. Blockchain allows to have reliable and secure transactions for bet accepting, awarding and fees charging. All payments and transactions are recorded in the blocks, so users are secured from transaction recall, duplicate payments and cheating. The users are confident in where their money is. As long as blockchain prevents interference in winners determination process, players may be sure in results calculated in a fair way.  Moreover, the secure system requires a powerful engine providing high speeds. To meet both wants and needs we appeal to Graphene technology. Building on the speed of 10k-100k transactions per second, parallelization is used to scale the network up to million of transactions per second, and because there is no transaction fees, counting operations are not required.   • Resolving the problem of player’s trust ⥊ The logic of dice values and winner determination is delivered by the smart-contracts with the help of which we can track the records of input and output data.   • We won’t use random number generator ⥊ Users contest each other, not the platform itself. DICEGAME is just the initiator of a game.  • High level of security ⥊ Decentralization of databases is used in all algorithms of our platform built on the Graphene blockchain. The architecture of decentralized ledgers makes it almost impossible to lose funds or private information to cybercriminals.   • No special knowledge needed to play ⥊ Players will have equal chances to win whether they possess any specific skills related to the game or not. This is the core attribute for all our games.  • We do not impose limits on deposits and withdrawals ⥊ We think that the user should keep control over his own money. Thus, the smart-contracts do not set any limits on cash ins and outs.   • We eliminate the idea of the frozen funds ⥊ We do not exploit users’ money, we just provide the tournament wallet to store the prize fund for a game session. There are no frozen funds, each user has the possibility to check the account of the tournament wallet based on the blockchain anytime.   • Bonus tournaments ⥊ The concept of the project is to conduct regular bonus tournaments (BT) with the prize fund. Each new tournament or one-to-one game continuously contributes to the prize fund of the BT. After the tournament the smart-contract automatically transfers the prize with the withdrawal of platform’s fee. The half of this fee goes to the common prize fund of the BT, which is distributed between all bonus tournaments with the corresponding amount of the prize. Thus, prize funds will have continuous growth.      Token Dice is our internal utility token that allows users to have access to our product of the DICEGAME platform. Through the Dice token we are aimed to develop the platform and integrate it with our own games and games of other vendors. The Dice tokens can be bought, sold, exchanged to any other cryptocurrencies, transferred to other parties by using the 'Dice Wallet' integrated into the DICEGAME platform. We can draw an analogy between the Dice and casino chips, but the sense of real game using real money is preserved. Apart from that, the lifecycle and all activities related to the bonus tournaments are supported by the Dice tokens.    • Tokens for games inside the platform ⥊ The Dice tokens are issued to be significantly utilized in the operation of the platform, i.e. it's our internal coin which can be used in the gameplay inside the DICEGAME platform. When using Dice tokens in games inside the DICEGAME platform there is only 1% of fee charged which is much more less than using any other cryptocurrencies.  • Token for the BT prize fund ⥊ The lifecycle and all activities related to the bonus tournaments are supported by the Dice tokens. After each regular tournament conducted inside the platform the smart-contract automatically transfers the prize to the user's wallet withdrawing platform's fee in the cryptocurrency used in the game. The half of this fee should form the common prize fund of the BT. Only Dice tokens can create the bonus fund.  • Defined Marketing Strategy ⥊ The significant part of the company's income will cover constant marketing campaigns that results in constant addition of players all over the world. As the result of these activities tokens circulation inside the platform will be increased and the price of the Dice will grow up.  • Frozen Team Tokens ⥊ The tokens devoted to the project team will be frozen for 365 days, and the tokens put into the reserved fund - for 180 days.  • Token Sale & Bonuses ⥊ In early stages the ICO participants will be provided with discounts. We are planning to conduct HOT sale with the discount of 40%. Token holders will get a ticket for all bonus tournaments conducted inside the platform.",False
