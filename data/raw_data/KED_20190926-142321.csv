Indeed it is the only thing that ever has"" Margaret Mead  Check out our 1 minute introduction video here: https://youtu.be/PyVUf-Yj0gs  Blockchain technology brings endless opportunities. Interest around it has increased over the last years, yet we have only seen the beginning. Many people are still unaware of its potential, having little knowledge of what it can become. KryptEd is an Ethereum based crypto educational platform for the public to learn, earn, invest and build within and upon the blockchain. Implementation of a thorough gamification model will ensure motivation amongst both users and creators, forming the foundation for quality learning and teaching online.  KryptEd Platform has four main features: • KryptEd Education Platform (KEP) where teachers can offer their services and knowledge to the public, while the knowledge seekers get the best possible information out there from specially selected experts. • Simulator of a cryptocurrency exchange for risk free, real time trading experience. • KryptEd Signature which allows diplomas and certificates to be encrypted and time stamped on the blockchain. • KryptEd Advisors which consists of the most experienced individuals in the field of blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, given the possibility to showcase themselves to find available opportunities to pursue.  KryptEd will not only make knowledge accessible. It will be capable of withstanding the claws of time. By implementing revolutionary technologies like Ethereum Smart Contracts, Swarm and Whisper this decentralized platform will outlive generations, ensuring the data is kept alive for future peers to learn and develop. On the platform, users can create a free account. Access to experts and educational content will be available after completing a set of tasks and redeeming $KED rewards. The way to reach the next set of courses will be open when collecting and hodling $KED, as required by the gamification mechanism. Interaction is a key element of success in education and will be available through Whisper when $KED payment is made to the other party. As an utility token, $KED is needed for the circular ecosystem and gamification model of the platform. Purchasing $KED tokens can be done directly from any cryptocurrency exchange site it get listed on. However, first, we start at OVIS.com.tr  Knowledge is amongst the most valuable assets in this age. Our ultimate vision is therefore to create an educational arena with the environment to empower and motivate individuals to learn about cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. The future of KryptEd lies in becoming a decentralized autonomous organization, where code becomes the company itself and lives on the blockchain for generations to come.  Knowledge is key, and KryptEd will bring you its chain.  KryptEd Vision and Responsibility  Social responsibility is our main reason for starting this project. KryptEd aims to be a DAO in the future, in order to create a long lasting legacy for blockchain and cryptocurrency education industry in generations. This is one of our main goals. A DAO is a decentralized, autonomous organization. It sustains itself and can deal with every request that comes and goes. It will outlive generations, withstanding the claws of time, ensuring knowledge is available for any future individual. It is possible to manage a company using the blockchain. The Ethereum Foundation itself is about to try it.  “Completely independent entity that is exclusively governed by the rules that you program into it and “lives” on the chain” - Henning Diedrich  Code is the entire company. And it cannot be stopped. However, a DAO without its own funds would merely be regarded as a smart contract, not a DAO. Any collection of smart contracts can just be a function library, and it does not have a life of its own. We believe that blockchain technology is a revolution in human history. Starting from Bitcoin, many people are interested in getting into digital money industry without prior knowledge. There are approximately ten million people who understands java-programming language and about five thousand of these people has knowledge in blockchain technology. We want to change these numbers by being one of the front line leaders supplying value to the growth of this industry. KryptEd will have its own funds, KryptEd will have its own content, and KryptEd will be DAO so that many generations can ripe its fruits. This is a service to the real world and a responsibility of KryptEd for the community. KryptEd will be in the online sector, covering topics such as blockchain and cryptocurrency education. Its interface will be user friendly and interactive, with $KED and coinparking as main access system. KryptEd’s method will be based on earning through learning, prosumers content creation, gamification and encrypted certification. The project’s value is its social responsibility for the fourth industrial revolution.  We will create a generation of coders that understands the nature of smart contracts and investors that are smart decision makers. “Decentralized Education Network” will allow equal opportunities to millions of people who have access to internet, yet not enough resources to understand the fourth industrial revolution.  KryptEd Gamification  KryptEd will develop an education platform with a gamification model which will ultimately encourage and motivate the users to learn in a fun way. Earning $KED through completing a set of tasks, achieving high grades in classes, and winning weekly/monthly competitions are all key elements of the KryptEd platform.  In traditional education systems, we have found that students are struggling to achieve their goals mainly due to the fact that there are not enough motivational activities. KryptEd is aiming to change this by implementing a gamification model. It is a crucial factor to attract the students by distributing rewards for them to reach their full potential.  In our extensive research, we found that companies and computer games which use a gamification system are more successful in terms of performance, effectiveness, and satisfaction. There are several ways to implement this system into KryptEd; status, access, power and items.

We are organising education seminars for people with hearing disabilities to learn and improve their knowledge. The goal of the seminars is to establish new terms and ways of explaining blockchain/crypto jargon in silent language to reach and explain for people with hearing disabilities. Ultimate objective is that all Krypted courses are to be translated in to silent language. Also experts with hearing disabilities may also create their own courses and teach.
