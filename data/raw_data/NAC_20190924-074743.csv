Please direct any questions to Nami.Team  Congrats! Nami Internal Exchange Has Been Launched.       Read Full Details on How To Exchange NAC-ETH, ETH-NAC https://nami.io/press/nami-internal-exchange-user-guide/       nami.trade  Blockchain meets Forex  A brand-new financial trading platform with the blockchain technology. Nami.trade is designed and structured to revolutionize traditional trading platforms, since there are lots of inconveniences with which the traders have to deal on a daily basis.    Home   |   Whitepaper   |   Demo   |   Facebook   | |   Twitter   |   Youtube   |   Medium   |     Telegram   |     Blog     Join NAMI Social Media Bounty   MARKET PROBLEM     Currently, trading in the financial markets must go through brokerage firms, from stocks, bonds to currencies or commodities. The operation of these firms/platforms costs a lot of money in infrastructures, operating, selling and other expenses. These costs are charged to traders on each trading volume of their transaction, under different names as spread, swap, commission, tax, etc.  Not to mention that there is a lack of transparency as brokerages can provide inaccurate prices, change spread or take opposite sides of traders’ trades. These not only reduce traders’ trust but also hurt them and have negative impacts on their’s trading performance.    NAMI SOLUTION    Blockchain is a technology that stores and transmits information by blocks that are interconnected and extended overtime, called blockchain. Each block contains information on initialization time and is associated with the previous blocks. Blockchain is designed so that data can not be altered. The information in the blockchain can not be changed and only be added with the consent of all the nodes in the system. Even if a part of the blockchain system collapses, other computers and nodes will continue to work to protect the information.  In particular, blockchain is capable of transmitting data without requiring intermediaries to confirm the information. The blockchain system consists of several independent nodes capable of authenticating information without requiring a “sign of trust”. Basically, blockchain is a sequence of computers that all have to approve a transaction before it can be validated and recorded. Just like sending a box, not a lawyer or a bank but every will confirm that the box is yours.   Blockchain will be the “ledger” to record all transactions of investors. This data is constantly being updated and maintained by peer-to-peer computer network around the world.  In addition, nami.trade uses Smart Contract technology – a decentralized application based in dispersed blocks of blockchain. The basic idea behind a smart contract is that transactions between two or more relating parties can be verified through blockchain, instead of a centralized program like traditional brokers.  Picture that, in order to ensure the security of a contract, we will need legal experts to compile and third parties to help implement it, in traditional ways. Moreover, if any problems with the contract, we will need to base on judicial system to solve it, which is time-consuming and costly.  Whereas, smart contract of nami.trade is executed on Ethereum’s blockchain network, which specifies the terms of the deal and penalties in the event of breach. Smart contract can not be modified by any object, once deployed. Therefore, its ensures the safety and transparency in all transactions of investors on nami.trade.   To go through this point, we need, first of all, to understand why traditional brokers have spread, swap and commission.  First, it is easily observed that it costs a lot of expensed for a broker to come to operation: sales, marketing, infrastructure, etc. These expense stands high as the system of traditional brokers is built on the principles of centralization. Every issue, every transaction is processed by only one organization. An organization working and operation with the principles of centralization will have to encounter with a bunch of problems, where and which lead to costs. Thus, traditional brokers apply the charges of spread, swap, commission to their customers – traders, in order to cover, compensate their costs and make huge amounts of profit. After all, the fundamental purpose of any traditional broker is to gain profit.     Our purpose on creating nami.trade is to build a trading platform for community that does not serve the purpose of any individual, entity like other existing traditional brokers. Therefore, nami.trade need to have a place to liquidate all transactions of traders, certainly built from the contribution of community. We call this place NAC Pool. In addition to the side of trading with no spread, no swap, no commission and trading fees lowering 10 times compared to traditional brokers, contrubutors can put their NACs to the Pool and received their fund certificates as well. Fund certificates are a type of token that recognizes the NAC proportion that a contrubutor has put in the pool. Contrubutor benefits on the growth of NAC Pool. Contrubutors can withdraw NAC corresponding to the NAC proportion in their fund certificates.    There will be a small fee of trading charged to traders to maintain the system and operation, and this is called revenue of nami.trade. This revenue will be divided into 3 parts, 50% is for Token Crowdfunding contributors, 40% is added to the NAC Pool for its development and only 10% remaining is used for operation and community building. We create a community where everyone has their own interests. Traders can trade with no spread, no swap, no commission, lower fees create high profit. Whereas, contributors can benefit when NAC Pool grow. This definitely is a solid community trading platform for win-win situation and for sure, the core value we want to deliver.
