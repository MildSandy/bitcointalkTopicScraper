If you plan to participate in this ICO you must first get KYC approved.  https://stokit.io/#register  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE----- Hash: SHA256   - -  STOKIT is a peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud computing network that allows users from all over the globe to cooperate in the creation of a decentralized internet. Users can sell the resources of their machines to those looking to host their data in a more private, secure, and efficient way.    With your current cloud file storage platform, your files are centralized and owned by an entity, who can have access to these files. With STOKIT, we don't have access to your files, nor does our P2P network, since the files are end-to-end encrypted and only small pieces of the files are kept in each machine.    STOKIT's cloud platform will not only offer a superior technology to the one of traditional cloud services, but it will also strive to be competitive in terms of price and user experience. STOKIT strives to make an intuitive technology that's as user friendly as the one from already existing top-tier services.  STOKIT wants to make sure this new internet is accessible by everyone, regardless of their knowledge, a great focus will be put on providing a seamless transition from traditional services to STOKIT, without compromising on features.    We will reply to all questions in our AMA that will be held on 4th of December 2017.
