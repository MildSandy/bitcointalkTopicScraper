Neil also possesses an extensive engineering background having spent almost 5 years as a full stack engineer at Lenders Direct Capital prior to focusing on his own business endeavors. Jayson Rellis (President) Rellis is an ICO investor and strategist with a number of significant roles in other projects, such as his partner position at Komorebi Alliance. Prior to his passion for the blockchain, he headed up regional operations at Verizon Wireless where he was employed for more than a decade. He is also a contributing writer for HackerNoon. Brian Rankin (VP of Banking Integration) He has interests as an advisor or director for a number of other projects including SigFig, although his most captivating experience noted within the blockchain sector comes from his time as VP for client services at Ripple where he oversaw a number of banking related developments.  Advisors The project have a total of five advisors currently on board. These members are covering a number of areas including marketing, PR, and technical matters. Among these is prolific project advisor Bogdan Fiedur, a blockchain expert whose skills are widely employed and who features on the ICOBench list of experts.  Partners Partnerships are a vital aspect within the MFChain project, given the amount of integration with payment processors and networks which is required. The latest partnership which they have struck is with Zagg Protocol. This is in addition to existing partnerships with:     ShapeShift     Komorebi Alliance     DDEX     Chosen Payments     Loopring     Identity Mind     EduHash These key partnerships ensure a progressive path for the project with more to be developed as the project continues to progress.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of MFChain.  Risks     The strong competition both within and outside the blockchain which exists in a variety of the markets MFChain is targeting is concerning. These include the likes of Dash, UTrust, and Stack. (-0.5)     The broad focus of the project into a number of markets may cause them to lose focus and also leaves them vulnerable as a new project in a variety of areas. (-0.5)     MFChain’s core team, whilst having diverse experiences, have nothing which stands out as highly suited to running this type of proposed multi-million dollar platform, with the exception of their VPs experience at Ripple. (-1)     Full release of the core teams vested tokens will be completed by Q2 of 2019 according to the whitepaper, with full mainnet launch not scheduled until Q3 of 2019. (-2)  Growth Potential     The global payments market alone is heading towards a $1 trillion value. This represents a huge market with almost unlimited potential for growth. (+2)     Moving toward a blockchain based and cashless society, we would expect to see a big migration toward blockchain based ecosystems such as MFChain. (+2)     The broad focus of the project is also positive in the sense of flexibility and scalability. Two very important factors among blockchain based projects. (+2)     The project have maintained a strong and steady following throughout all media channels. This is indicative of the potential and positive sentiment which the community feels toward MFChain. (+3)  Disposition MFChain has harnessed the fundamental principles of blockchain to provide an ecosystem which is both rewarding and flexible throughout. As the community strives to find ways to promote everyday use of cryptocurrencies, the introduction of a system which can perform all of its functions in a cross-platform manner, is an exciting prospect. Although the project team still have a lot of major steps to complete in order to bring MFChain to market, premium among these being to establish more key partnerships, the market is large enough and increasing constantly in size for them to position themselves strongly within if they can continue the current momentum.

Mfchain has a more unique approach to merchant adoption of cryptocurrency, although the huge task of luring merchants is still a question of the mindset of merchants and consumers towards digital assets as a whole. However,  once that barrier is crossed and people begin to source for a reliable platform to conduct crypto-payments, they are more likely to settle for this solution type, which currently only Mfchain provides:  1. Loyalty program 2. Rebate program 3. Multichoice currency payment options 4. Crypto-to-fiat system 6. Masternodes on a 10-50% ROI...  ...and lots of other platform intrinsic benefits.

MF Chain will be launching the MF Mainnet in 2019. We will have a new whitepaper released in late 2018 that covers this in detail.  A large piece of the MF Mainnet is the Innovation Incubator that allows dapps to launch token sales and a multi-cryptocurrency token sale platform. Participants of the Private and Presale rounds in the MFX token sale are awarded 1 MFI token for every 10ETH contributed. These tokens are redeemable in the first five token sales launched on the upcoming MF Mainnet. Here are more details:  - 1 MFI (Modern Finance Incubator) token in each of the first 5 ICO projects per 10 ETH - Max tokens per contributing address is 20 (based on the max contribution of 200ETH) - 888 Max tokens - Token values will be pulled from a reserved pool of tokens for sale in each ICO - Each token will be equal in value - Tokens are transferable and sent to ETH wallet address provided during the ICO - Tokens will NOT be traded or listed on any exchanges,False

MF Chain is bringing to market the first ever rewards program for both merchant and consumers that allow users to earn rewards (in the form of the native MFX token) for purchases made or processed using the MF Chain payment solution. Currently in beta testing with full launch planned in Q3 2018. The greater vision of MF Chain, is the MF Mainnet. A direct commerce integrated smart contract platform with the goal of 10’s of thousands of merchants once live. MF Mainnet will be like no other blockchain, catapulting its capabilities directly into the stream of commerce and allowing ICO and dApp projects to tap directly into this wealth. With a dBFT/POS hybrid consensus method, MF Mainnet will achieve consensus with minimal energy consumption and in an eco-friendly manner. Using an incentivized masternode offering, MFM will achieve decentralization with thousands of globally distributed nodes. MFX token is not a security by common definition. Although the MFX token may have multiple use cases, by design MFX is a utility token used to facilitate a rewards program for merchants and consumers — much like the many very popular credit card rewards programs in existence today. MFX does not offer ownership or shares in any organization. MFX does not pay a dividend nor does MFX offer profit sharing of any kind whatsoever. MFX is not a speculation mechanism.
