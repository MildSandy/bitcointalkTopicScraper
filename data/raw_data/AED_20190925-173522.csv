Yes, our currency is backed by either Gold, Silver Palladium etc.  But the main idea behind AirgeadCoin is that it will let users to merge, let's say, 1oz of Gold, 1oz of Silver and 1oz of Palladium into one coin. If the person who is doing the merging of several precious metals in one knows what they are doing, they will be able to increase the value of that coin that was previously only backed and effected by only gold.  Sellers can choose to sell their unique creation on our exchange, if there is a buyer who is looking to purchase 1oz of Gold, Silver and Palladium merged in one coin.  That's what I mean by ""knows what they're doing"".
