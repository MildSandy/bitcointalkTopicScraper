Why do I say that? Because during the 1 year I participated in this project, many investors were banned from the telegram of the Bobs Repair group. They were banned for asking about this project. Many investors ask about BOB-S or about program rewards for holders but always get an unsatisfactory answer, ""SOON"". And when investors criticize the team's answers, they must be banned. And I can also say that this project only runs all the programs planned by the team, they do not discuss a program with investors or members because they do not receive criticism and suggestions from investors or members. For example, the team does not discuss with investors or members regarding tokenburn (what I mean here is about how many tokens are burned or the token burning scheme). And also as long as I was in the group, I never heard of an apology from the team if there was a delay in a program or announcement. For example, for the launch of the new roadmap, the roadmap launch was delayed and the team did not apologize for that.

We announced our new road map towards the end of Q1 and published it as promised. Why did we wait so long to publish the new roadmap? Well we were still trying to figure out which direction should we go. We were in 13 cities sending jobs to many contractors and were burning through large amounts of capital (we even had a office in India with 8 dispatchers, including salaries for developers, team members etc) with that kind of burning we knew long term we wouldn’t make it so we asked ourselves what can we do to become profitable? How many crypto projects were profitable? All they do is sell their token reserves until they can’t sell anymore. A top 30 cryptocurrency six months ago fired 85% of their staff and closed down all their offices. When we heard this we knew it was time to solve one issue become profitable.   This is whe our CEO decided to scale down to one city and grow slowly. We went from sending out hundreds of leads a day to hiring full time staff members to do the jobs as Bob’s Repair. From January 28th to now we went from burning 50-150k a month to bringing in over 60k in revenue and becoming profitable. By hiring in house workers were were able to control pricing make it 50% less and also have a better understanding of material costs and day to day operation. Today alone we brought in over $3,500 in revenue. Our central costs are the same so it’s nice to see a larger profit margin.  We will publish our decentralized platform as announced in the roadmap but right now our major focus is increasing revenues (increasing the buyback program) hiring more full time employees to do jobs and expanding to Phoenix, Arizona.  We can proudly say we are making more money than spending and are here for the long run. Crypto winter is over for us. Winter isn’t coming.",False

Bob’s Repair sends home repair job calls to contractors throughout the USA. These contractors currently pay Bob’s Repair for every successful job call that is sent to them. The BOB Buyback Program was started in order to reward workers for their efforts by awarding them BOB Tokens after every job that they complete.  In the past, Bob’s Repair would keep the entire fee that contractors paid the company from each completed job. Now, the company takes ⅓ of the fee and uses it to buy BOB Tokens that are automatically awarded to contractors after the completion of a job.  The BOB Buyback program was created in order to allow Bob’s Repair to buy these tokens from the community every day in order to send them to contractors as a reward. Instead of buying the tokens from an exchange, the company has published this BOB Buyback smart contract that will automatically buy tokens directly from any interested sellers in the community, starting at $0.14 USD per token. Click here to sell your tokens. https://bobsrepair.com/buyback/  Bob’s Repair currently values BOB Tokens at the starting price of $0.14 USD.  The amount of BOB tokens purchased from the community will vary from day to day, depending on the amount of successful job calls that Bob’s Repair contractors complete that day. The company is currently making plans to expand its operations to 100 cities in the United States. As more contractors partner with Bob’s Repair and more job calls are sent to them, the company will need more BOB tokens to send to its contractors causing the company to purchase more BOB Tokens from the community for this reward system.  Sample Job Call:  For example, the last completed water heater installation generated $450 in profit for the contractor, with Bob’s Repair earning 15% of this fee, which is $67.50. One third of this 15% transaction fee, $22.5, is used to buy back BOB Tokens from the community at 14 cents per token which are then awarded to the contractor.

Many people bought bobs at less than 0.01 cents... so a slight move in the price they dump and buyback again.  bobs's repair team are blaming bounty hunters and airdrop hunters.  We have never blamed anyone for the price nor made any suggestions about it.  Today we answered numerous calls from our customers and completed a couple jobs in Las Vegas. We are testing our platform before releasing the Beta version in Las Vegas. Key things to keep in mind: Staking/lending smart contract isn't published and our platform isn't live.

The problem: In order to use the BOB Network Escrow and Blockchain Service for trusted home repairs and immutable reviews a customer is required to own and allocate BOB Tokens to every segment of this home repair/new construction job. However, since BOB Tokens are owned by the network, a collective group of entities worldwide, and are freely transferrable, the price of these tokens has the potential to vary. A customer and a contractor may not want to convert their FIAT into BOB Tokens through the course of time it takes to complete a job due to the potential for these market fluctuations and their effect on the amount of FIAT that the contractor would receive after finishing the job.   Solution: In order to provide FIAT customers BOB Tokens and decrease price volatility risk while still keeping the FIAT customer experience simple, the BOB Token Community Lending Pool is proposed.   The BOB Token Community Lending Pool is an open-source smart contract that will allow the BOB Community to send their BOB Tokens to it in order to lend their tokens to FIAT customers at the time of their payment. For example, if a customer is quoted $400 for an installation by a BOB Network Contractor, he/she can pay $400 using their credit card.   At the same time the customer agrees to borrow BOB Tokens from the BOB Token Community Lending Pool at a small cost, for example, $20 USD (the exact percentages and fee allocation are in the process of being finalized).   These funds, $400, are held by Bob’s Repair Inc., or a Bob’s Repair authorized payment processor or an escrow company, (depending on the jurisdiction) while the job is being completed, minus the example $20 Community Lending Fee. The $20 Community Lending fee is used to make an automatic BOB Token purchase off the market by the customer and is distributed to the BOB Token Community Lending Pool evenly.   Effect: As more FIAT transactions occur on the BOB Network more customers will require BOB Network Community members to lend them BOB Tokens to execute their home repair/new construction transactions.   The more FIAT transactions there are on the BOB Network the more BOB tokens will be required by these FIAT customers and the higher the return for community members staking their tokens will be. As FIAT transaction volumes grow more people will be incentivized to purchase tokens off of the market and stake them in the lending pool to take advantage of the interest earned from lending these tokens to FIAT customers.  Important disclaimer: Tokenomics related proposals made by Bob’s Repair, including the announcement regarding the BOB Token Community Lending Pool, are subject to evolve and change at any time in any capacity. Development of various Bob’s Repair tokenomics models are still in progress.",False

When my brother and I attended the Satoshi Roundtable we got to speak to a lot of successful founder/devs and pick their brains about their ICOs. (Fluffy Ponny- Monero, Anthony Dip Iorio - Etherium, Michael Terpin, Jeffrey Tucker, Andrew Filipowski, etc) I personally felt we were not ready to do our main sale mid March.  This is what is going on for the next three weeks prior to the main sale:  1. Currently in Seoul Korea: Finished with d10e conference and met with multiple investors and did two additional presentations. 2. Yesterday a mainstream Korean newspaper interviewed me about bobs repair. The article should be out shortly. 3. Heading to Hong Kong to do an interview with Bloomberg Magazine and be on the Bloomberg Radio Asia Worldwide. 4. In our Las Vegas office, we are doing a financial audit with a third party firm and making sure all token allocation is correct. 5. BuzzFeed will be releasing an article on me. (Until it is published it is not 100%) 6. Reuters will be doing an article on Bob's Repair (Until it is published it is not 100%) 7. Forbes will be doing a piece on us. (Until it is published it is not 100%) 8. Bitfilm.com is working on our commercial should be ready in couple days. 9. March 14th 1 million dollar airdrop with a referral system. 10. March 15th Heading to Puerto Rico for Coin Agenda 11. Our MVPs: Application, Website and SMS API will be released prior to the main sale 12. Announcing a massive partnership that is going to make a huge difference (stay tuned) 13. Hosho.io and Newalchemy.io are doing a security audit on our smart contract. Our team member Pavel Rubin has created over 15 smart contracts for other ICOs so we doubt they will find anything but better be double safe than sorry! 14. We added couple new team members to our organization. 15. March 20th and March 21st. Token2049 Conference in Hong Kong. 16. I have personally turned down a 3mln dollar investment and a 2mln dollar investment because the terms would not be favorable towards all the other people that purchased our tokens. I personally believe we need a high amount of people to have our token so that there is utility to it. One person having 10 mln BOB tokens is terrible for the community.  I am working around the clock with the team to make sure we provide the best possible product before the start of the main sale on April 4th. My brother has phenomena (due to over working himself) and unfortunately, I also got sick. The team and I are working the clock. Yesterday in Seoul I was in Wework for 18 hours and today I have been here 8 hours and will be here for another 5.    Anyways does anyone have any ideas of how we can announce our airdrop? I was thinking on doing something crazy like the time I jumped out of an airplane. hmm I am open to all suggestions!",False

The ico will be started on April 4th, around 30 days from now, you can visit their website.  It is strange that there are so long between the pre-sale and the formal token sale, I want to know if the USA and Chinese citizens are not allowed to join in the token sale? And when can we do the KYC to buy the token, thank you so much. [/quote]     The reason why we are doing our main sale on April 4th is that we wanted to publish our MVP: App, SMS API, and Decentralized Marketplace. We will be announcing a massive partnership (Their dev team is helping us and giving us early access to a certain product). Also, will be doing a 1 million dollar airdrop mid march with a referral program for the main sale. Our goal is to make sure we offer the best possible product prior to launching on April 4th.

The review is tied to the transaction. Only the person receiving the job and repairman can post a review. Let's just say I create 30 fake jobs (get my friends to do them) and now the 31st job happens to be real..if I am a bad repairman I will overcharge someone and or do a bad job. Well, that will be seen on my profile as the last job done now when comparing to thousands of other similar jobs in the area I am not competitive. Repairmen sometimes do two jobs a day if they are small it would be really hard to fake it.. This will also happen on the next job and the next etc....Bad actors cant survive.  What happens if someone does unjust reviews or puts something slanderous?  That's why we are using the Steemit community.

I believe in the power of blockchain technology , on how it can a record data and how no other people would be able to alter this input data. A public record of the labor pricing and labor reviews on the blockchain can greatly help lots of people in finding the right contractor that was given a good review based on services provided to their previous clients.   And another advantage here is the review they put or make in every contractor’s profile is reliable because they are the reviews previous clients made. Reviews based on experience and not just made by anyone else.  Yeah Bob's Repair bring a different approach to blockchain by creating such innovative idea to give a more decentralized system of labour pricing and making all kinds of repair in a more convenience manner, a very smart way of finding the best service.

Prandecki brothers find a solution and later on they found the blockchain technology and they studied it. Until they came to the point that they found Bob's repair, more decentralized and can resolve the problem with false review and more tranparent issue. They came up with ""Bob's repair"" name because they want to make it new. A new and better way than STWP though STWP succeed. P.S.

John McAfee is our Partner and Senior Advisor. He has tweeted about us multiple times and also is listed on our website bobsrepair.com   Bob's Repair is going to have an Escrow Service that funds will be released based on milestones. I do not think people will use it for smaller jobs like toilet installs but it will be needed for an AC install, kitchen remodels etc. Since 2014 we dealt with a lot of issues where the consumer would screw the contractor and even the other way around where the job wasn't done properly.  Quote from: yuvadeep on January 19, 2018, 01:28:20 PM Here, we are talking about the best and truthful reviews of a service apart from having a true set of charges of the services provided. You might be surprised to know that there is a technique called ‘review to be added to the financial transaction only’, by using this system, you can know exact charges of a said service differentiating between labor costs and material costs.  All our reviews will be tied to the transaction.   We are about to announce a 1000 ETH investment and our bonus phase will drop down to 20%.

As to how many countries we will see Bob's Repair, reading further down on their WP shows that they are currently targeting the United States alone before pursuing the international market.  So i guess it's gonna take a little more while before we see Bob's repair in other continents.",False

We are an ERC20 Token. The Bob Application will leverage blockchain technology to fight review fraud. The Bob Application will be built on the STEEM blockchain due to its three second transaction time and no transaction costs. The Bob Application will store all financial transactions that take place on Bob’s Repair on the blockchain. Then, when both sides of a transaction - consumer and contractor - leave a review, Bob’s Repair will link that review to the actual financial transaction. By linking reviews with actual financial transactions, consumers can trust that the review is real and unaltered. Real reviews, from real consumers, provides better information so consumers can make better decisions.  Our Revenue Mode:  To keep prices low for customers and barriers of entry low for contractors, Bob’s Repair will not have membership fees, sign-up costs, or transaction fees. Instead, Bob’s Repair will generate revenue in three ways: the STEEM blockchain, escrow services, and providing targeted beneficial third-party services to contractors and consumers.  ● Escrow Services. For transactions where the parties desire to use an escrow service, Bob’s Repair will earn a 1.5 percent service fee from the funds held in escrow. For escrow services, Bob’s Repair will leverage blockchain technology to ensure that project milestones, reviews, and associated data are stored in tamper-proof format. ● Third-Party Services. To generate revenue and provide further benefits to contractors and consumers, Bob’s Repair will provide targeted loans, insurance products, and decentralized financial products and services for both contractors and consumers ● STEEM Blockchain. Use of the STEEM blockchain will result in revenue for Bob’s Repair.",False

We will be doing an interview with him in couple of days. I will post a link.   Quote from: siddartha1492 on December 29, 2017, 04:38:31 PM Hmm, the big question is how will you get trusted reviews? People who can be influenced by an incentive to post fake reviews on normal sites can also do the same on a blockchain based website. So how does blockchain protect from fake reviews? Between, John McAfee's ICO reviews are no longer trusted!!!  The reviews will be tied to the transaction. There could be couple bad actors but they won't be able to act bad for long because every review will be stored and won't be able to be altered. Now let's just say some contractor finds 4 people and goes through the whole process..the 5th, 6th, and 7th real client will expose him for high pricing, crappy work etc..people will have their transaction tied to the review that will specifically talk about the pricing, time it, what was fixed etc. The issue with home advisor and other skilled trade marketplaces is that they delete bad reviews because these contractors threaten that they won't pay them any more for leads. The worse part is that three guys are charged $30-$75 bucks per lead and only one of them gets the job. This fee is pinned on the customer, therefore, making a simple toilet install super expensive.   GOODBYE PRICE GAUGING, GOODBYE NO TRANSPARENCY, GOODBY ADVERTISING FEES",False
