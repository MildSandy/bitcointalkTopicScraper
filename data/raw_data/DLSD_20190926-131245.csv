Here's are an explain about means difference of smartcontract,I got from telegram channel as file not like, so let me to quote the information : Quote Deal Coin lockup contracts instruction.     Ambisafe prepared 6 lockup contracts for Deal Coin tokens distribution with custom lockup for each tokens holder category (3 lockup contracts with 6,12,18 month deadline for Founders, 1 lockup contract with 3 month deadline for Advisors, 1 lockup with 3 month for Bounty and 1 lockup contract with 3 month deadline for Airdrop).   1. Lockup contract. Each lockup contract holds all specific holder category tokens. For instance, Advisors lockup contract stores all advisors tokens for 3 month with no ability to transfer Deal Coin funds before deadline. Any caller will be able to transfer all coins from lockup contract to only the payout contract (this contract address is hardcoded inside related lockup contract) after the deadline.  2. Payout contract. Each holder from specific category owns temporary, non transferable, Deal Coin tokens (list of addresses and amounts that was provided in sheets) that will be swept to the regular Deal Coin tokens after the deadline. For instance, each advisor will get his unlocked Deal Coins after the deadline and temporary coins will be burned.  3. Technical Details:  a. Any ethereum account could unlock all Deal Coin tokens locked on lockup contract after the deadline. Function unlock() should be triggered on Lockup contract for this. b. When coins are unlocked (transferred to the Payout contract), it’s possible to make tokens distribution via calling function distribute(tokenReceiversArray) (could be triggered by any ethereum account) on Payout contract. After successful distribution, tokens will be swept to the regular Deal Coins. c. If tokens holder could not wait for global tokens distribution, he is able to get his unlocked tokens any time after deadline just by transferring any amount of temporary tokens to any address via transfer(address,value) function on Payout contract or calling sendPayout(holderAddress) on Payout contract.     All other holder categories (Founders, Bounty, Airdrop) will receive their regular Deal Coins in the same way as described above.
