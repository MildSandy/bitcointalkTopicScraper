Therefore, all tickets told and results are available to the public and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain without 3rd party involvement.  A 359.3 billion USD market begging to be disrupted  The offline and online gambling market continues to grow every year. In 2016, the offline gambling market accounted for 359.3 billion USD, while the online market was estimated at 44 billion USD. It is noted that online gambling is experiencing faster growth (10% higher than offline), and is expected to reach 60 Billion USD annually by 2020.  As online lottery has an added value and low market share in comparison to the offline lottery, it seems that this sector has strong market potential in the future. Our goal is to attain 15% of the online lottery market category turnover within the first 2 years of operation.  Our Mission: Mission Decentralized  Lotteries are one of the most popular forms of betting in the world, run by the government and states in most countries.
