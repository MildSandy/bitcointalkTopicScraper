Why is nothing heard about the project?    Today came the great news about the penetration of blockchain technology in the automotive industry:  Car makers BMW,  General Motors, Ford and Renault  are the big names behind a new group announced today to explore the potential of the blockchain in the automotive and mobility space.  MOBI — the Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative — launches today with over 30 founding members that also include Bosch, Blockchain at Berkeley, Hyperledger, Fetch.ai, IBM and IOTA. The group has a fairly broad goal of making transportation “safer, more affordable, and more widely accessible using blockchain technology.”  The blockchain has the undoubted potential to impact a range of industries. The distributed ledger component and smart contracts, in particular, could reshape the way organizations and products use and consume data. Along those lines, MOBI said its scope of focus varies from payments, data tracking, and supply management, to consumer finance and pricing, and more futuristic areas like autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing systems.  It isn’t the first time automotive firms have looked at the blockchain. Toyota is already doing its own research, Renault has joined the R3 research consortium, and Daimler is part of the Hyperledger project from the Linux Foundation. With MOBI, however, the group is focusing entirely on the automotive space and potential use cases rather than automotive as one of a number of industries.  “Blockchain and related trust enhancing technologies are poised to redefine the automotive industry and how consumers purchase, insure and use vehicles,” Chris Ballinger, who is MOBI’s first chairman and CEO, said in a statement.  “By bringing together automakers, suppliers, startups, and government agencies, we can accelerate adoption for the benefit of businesses, consumers and communities,” added Ballinger, who was formerly CFO and director of mobility services at the Toyota Research Institute .  Members of the organization’s board include Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys and a co-founder of Ethereum, and Brian Behlendorf, executive director of Hyperledger .  source",False

It is not within their resources to combine hardware that is capable to reach all the cars currently on the highway.

Companies like Bosch, Fuji, Hitachi, they already have years mapped out for design and manufacturing.

There are many cars on the highway that are fully networked and provide a ton of critical data useful to parts manufactures, parts providers, repair facilities, and consumers.  I've barely scratched the surface.  Fleet management is in need of a device like this monitoring critical sensor output and failures within their network.  That is where blockchain comes in to capture and store this data securely.    There are devices in the market that can read your standard protocol from OBDII.  Engine temp, coolant temp etc.   Those devices do not have access to other modules that do fail and provide information on the vehicle network like climate control, ABS, SRS, or traction control systems.

The project, which started in February 2018, was created to reward drivers for environmentally-friendly driving habits, i.e. smooth and safe driving at low speeds. The project will be in its testing phase for the next three months, during which 500 drivers who follow eco-friendly driving practices will be rewarded with MobiCoins.  According to Cointelegraph auf Deutsch, data from the vehicles will be transmitted to Daimler and converted into MobiCoins, which will be stored in a mobile app. Participants with the most MobiCoins will reportedly receive VIP tickets for events such as the DTM Races, the MercedesCup Final, or Fashion Week in Berlin. However, it is not known whether drivers will be able to convert the MobiCoins to fiat currency or other cryptocurrencies.  Recent months have seen multiple German auto giants embrace Blockchain tech. In February 2018, German car manufacturing giant BMW announced its partnership with VeChain, the blockchain-based supply chain enhancement platform. The same month, Stuttgart-based Porsche announced it has teamed up with Berlin-based startup XAIN to use Blockchain technology in improving locking systems and the capabilities of autonomous cars.  Earlier, in January 2018, Volkswagen’s Chief Digital Officer Johann Jungwirth joined the supervisory board of the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit Blockchain foundation for the Internet of Things (IoT).""

We can actually upload new maps into the vehicle.  The device incorporates features allowing us to perform that function remotely.  We're giving tuners the ability to load performance and economy maps.  Our roadmap also includes being able to upload OEM software remotely that allow customers to take advantage of new features that are published by the OE manufacture.  At this time we're working with many tuning companies giving them a new avenue to load their own proprietary tunes into a vehicle.    GLUON is not developing these maps or tunes.  We're simply providing tuners a resource and tool so they can host their maps on our services, encrypt their information, and upload tunes directly to the vehicle ECU.    The warranty will fall under each provider on our network.  The warranty will fall under the policy pertaining to that particular tuner/supplier.  GLUON has an extensive approval process.  GLUON will only be working with tuners and companies who have been approved by GLUON Engineers and Tuners. Once the submitted tune has been tested throughout our network, it will then be released.  We also have many fail safe features within the GLUON process that allow the car to move forward or not.  You can think of it as a ""go no go"" functionality.  Once our device reads the car, checks all the parameters before moving forward, then it is a simple process.   By working with tuners we also have the ability to read the stock file for each car.  That way if something does happen during an upload, we have the ability to return the car completely back to stock.    If you have further questions,  please feel free to PM anytime.  We appreciate your support.  Chris  ",False

Also taking advantage of the Stratis sidechains  will be a great feature for us and our clients.     Thank you for your support.   ",False

That is just the tip of the features and partnerships we're already implementing now with distributors.

A mechanic reads the errors and starts to order the necessary parts if they don't have. All right? And I note if a driver is irresponsible, then he can't immediately turn to a repair shop and a small breakdown in consequence can lead to more expensive repairs.  But what does Gluon suggest? A car will be equipped with the necessary sensors that will connect with the application and with the general dealer network where driver serve a car. As soon as there is any breakdown the application on the smartphone notifies about it. And a mechanic quickly see the problem. They will be able to contact with driver independently and write down for repair. An error has already been read, they even already know what part is needed to replace it.

Thanks for pointing this out. Please see below requoted with active links.  Some information we gathered and put together for you all. Combination of questions and requests:  1. Your website must be secure HTTPS  Website is secure. https://www.gluon.com  2. Project name  Gluon  3. Token name and ticker symbol  GLU token (GLU)  4. Used blockchain (Ethereum, Omni, building a new one, other)  Stratis Platform. We are the first flagship, verified ICO on Stratis.  You can see the press release here: https://stratisplatform.com/2018/01/17/stratis_partners_with_gluon/  5. One line catch phrase  An Intelligent Connected Automotive Marketplace  6. Concept description 3 - 10 sentences  Gluon’s platform establishes an interconnected network of vehicles where individuals and businesses can monitor, track, tune, and diagnose the issues on them. Despite recent advances in automotive technologies such as self-parking and self-driving vehicles coupled with the improvement of alternative fuel sources, passenger vehicles have been largely left out of the connectivity discussion. Using the Gluon platform (IoT, Cloud Platform, AI, and Blockchain), individuals and businesses are able to compete and benefit from a rapidly changing marketplace. Even with the advent of the Internet of Things, most vehicles today utilize technology to track and report on one vehicle at a time, and only when they are at the repair shop.  Not only can customers diagnose their vehicles themselves, order parts, and request bids on repairs, but they can schedule repairs, send/receive payments for services and goods. Consumers can tune their vehicles for optimal performance and/or regulate their use. Repair shops can diagnose vehicles more cost-effectively and accurately order the correct parts. Vehicle service record, repairs, diagnostics, smog tests are all stored in the Gluon secure blockchain based on the Stratis Platform. Consumers and businesses are given the flexibility and security of paying with and/or receiving cryptocurrency payments in addition to traditional forms of payments.  7. How does the project create value to the ecosystem and differs from competing projects  Gluon’s model is based on generating multiple revenue streams including, but not limited to, hardware sales, software subscriptions, advertising, monitoring services, diagnostic services, data services, e-commerce parts sales, and blockchain transaction processing. Gluon products will enable developers to create ancillary applications that will run on the platform, enhancing its functionality and broadening its appeal. No other projects like it.  8. Incorporated company's country  Incorporated in the USA with offices in the UK, Sweden and India.  9. Website link  https://www.gluon.com  10.

Combination of questions and requests:  1. Your website must be secure HTTPS  Website is secure. https://www.gluon.com  2. Project name  Gluon  3. Token name and ticker symbol  GLU token (GLU)  4. Used blockchain (Ethereum, Omni, building a new one, other)  Stratis Platform. We are the first flagship, verified ICO on Stratis.  You can see the press release here: https://stratisplatform.com/2018/01/17/stratis_partners_with_gluon/  5. One line catch phrase  An Intelligent Connected Automotive Marketplace  6. Concept description 3 - 10 sentences  Gluon’s platform establishes an interconnected network of vehicles where individuals and businesses can monitor, track, tune, and diagnose the issues on them. Despite recent advances in automotive technologies such as self-parking and self-driving vehicles coupled with the improvement of alternative fuel sources, passenger vehicles have been largely left out of the connectivity discussion. Using the Gluon platform (IoT, Cloud Platform, AI, and Blockchain), individuals and businesses are able to compete and benefit from a rapidly changing marketplace. Even with the advent of the Internet of Things, most vehicles today utilize technology to track and report on one vehicle at a time, and only when they are at the repair shop.  Not only can customers diagnose their vehicles themselves, order parts, and request bids on repairs, but they can schedule repairs, send/receive payments for services and goods. Consumers can tune their vehicles for optimal performance and/or regulate their use. Repair shops can diagnose vehicles more cost-effectively and accurately order the correct parts. Vehicle service record, repairs, diagnostics, smog tests are all stored in the Gluon secure blockchain based on the Stratis Platform. Consumers and businesses are given the flexibility and security of paying with and/or receiving cryptocurrency payments in addition to traditional forms of payments.  7. How does the project create value to the ecosystem and differs from competing projects  Gluon’s model is based on generating multiple revenue streams including, but not limited to, hardware sales, software subscriptions, advertising, monitoring services, diagnostic services, data services, e-commerce parts sales, and blockchain transaction processing. Gluon products will enable developers to create ancillary applications that will run on the platform, enhancing its functionality and broadening its appeal. No other projects like it.  8.

WEBSITE    TELEGRAM     DISCORD    TWITTER     FACEBOOK     HOW IT WORKS (VIDEO)      FAQ     WHITEPAPER (COMING SOON)           We bring the entire automotive ecosystem to your fingertips.  Gluon’s platform establishes an interconnected network of vehicles where individuals and businesses can monitor, track, tune, and diagnose the issues on them. Despite recent advances in automotive technologies such as self-parking and self-driving vehicles coupled with the improvement of alternative fuel sources, passenger vehicles have been largely left out of the connectivity discussion. Even with the advent of the Internet of Things, most vehicles today utilize technology to track and report on one vehicle at a time, and only when they are at the repair shop.  With Gluon products, consumers and fleet managers can connect their vehicles with manufacturers, parts suppliers, and repair shops. They can diagnose their vehicles themselves, order parts, and request bids on repairs. Consumers can tune their vehicles for optimal performance and/or to regulate their use. Repair shops can diagnose vehicles more cost effectively and accurately order the correct parts. They can also promote their shops to new markets. Autoparts distributors can track and distribute parts more efficiently. All of these aforementioned constituents can pay for all this using traditional payment methods and cryptocurrency blockchain payments, including our GLU tokens.  Gluon’s model is based on generating multiple revenue streams including, but not limited to, hardware sales, software subscriptions, advertising, monitoring services, diagnostic services, data services, e-commerce parts sales, and blockchain transaction processing. Gluon products will enable developers to create ancillary applications that will run on the platform, enhancing its functionality and broadening its appeal.                   Click to register for ICO Whitelist                       FEATURES OVERVIEW   TUNING  We have developed a patent pending device and app which plugs into the vehicle and allows the user to not only monitor the vehicle outputs (fuel, mileage, range, temperature, etc.), but unlike any other device in the market, our device allows reprogramming of the actual ECU unit on a vehicle through the mobile app. Our current library of tunes is growing as we add more and more premier tuners and their abilities to Gluon. Read More..   FLEET MANAGEMENT  Gluon also gives companies with large vehicle fleets the ability to monitor their entire operations from one location. A single dashboard can monitor where a vehicle is, how much fuel, range, vehicle health and upcoming services required. We felt that a more informed business is a better business and can make the most of a vehicles life with basic knowledge about the vehicles. Read More..   MONITORING  Our ecommerce connectivity plays off of the monitoring aspect of the device. We want our customers to know exactly what issues their vehicle is facing, when a service is due and how much it will cost. With this information at their fingertips, we have partnered with top tier auto parts suppliers to bring the products at the best possible prices to our users. Read More..   DIAGNOSTICS  Safety is a big concern for most individuals, and for parents knowing where your child is and what their vehicle is doing is a feature that we will offer to our customers. The ability to tune a vehicle is also the ability to alert a parent if a vehicle is not traveling within a known/regular path, or even allow a valet mode so one of your most valuable assets wont be taken for a joy ride when put into the wrong hands. Read More..   PAYMENTS  In addition to traditional methods of payment, Gluon is introducing blockchain payments into its platform. GLU Token provides advantages over other payment methods because processing fees are lower, fraud is reduced, currency conversions, chargebacks and settlement periods are eliminated, and they can be used as a reward system within the program.
