Your community is non-existent, nobody reacts to your publications on Reddit, Bitcointalk, Telegram, Youtube. Your project is financially a sinkhole for investors. You ban every day and delete messages on the telegram. Indeed your project at a marketcap weaker than that of Bitconnect! BITCONNECT> DOMRAIDER at the marketcap level, it's a shame.  Everyone has nothing to do with your project, people just wanted to make money, it's gone, now make you at least small and accept that people can not see you anymore and hate you. People are divided by 15 in dollar price since ico and we can not even sell so there is not enough buy order on HitBTC.  On your ICO page it was marked that you were in discussion with Bittrex and there was also the Bittrex logo, almost 1 year later, still nothing.  On your TV commercial you dared to use a picture of poloniex, I laugh again.  You project is a scam, you never needed 40 million dollar, you are like professionals but your project is worth nothing and investors do not support you anymore.  Tristan said at the ICO that thanks to the ICOs you can raise money, but you say well that if you had made an IPO, if the action of the investors was divided by 10, you would all be returned, and you there including Marie.  I deplore this dictatorship and arrogance that drives you on Telegram, you banish people who say the truth.  Very well continue to offer copper tokens to people for free, the minimum would be to offer chips to your first investors to console them for having lost all their money.  Ah yes I forgot, your partnership with archos, a society that is suffering in France, it should not be done in June? it is pushed back to September, so you do not know much to do except collect millions of euros and lose money to your investors.

DomRaider will develop the technological solution dedicated to the world’s first decentralized auctions blockchain network. This article outlines the fundamental stages to implement the blockchain mechanisms to real-time management of auctions worldwide.  This process is described from the perspective of micropayment for an ERC20 token available through the Ethereum network. This depiction can be adapted to any other platform. The process unfolds in 3 stages:  Stage 1: Opening of micropayment channel. Each auction participant places a “deposit” through a Smart Contract, which represents a bid.  Stage 2: Off-Chain exchanges. Exchange of a signed character chain that combines the bid amount and its identity.  Stage 3: Channel closing. Reimbursement of all auction participants other than the auction winner.  It is worth noting that the payment taken to initiate the bid may not represent the total amount, which would allow professional users to participate in numerous auctions (on the basis that they won’t win all of them). We can envisage payment of a small sum, for example 10% of the target amount, on the basis that a delay in payment by the winning bidder is possible. In the event that the amount is not settled, the user may lose their security deposit and get a bad reputation within the system, which may exclude them from certain types of auction.  https://medium.com/domraider/blockchain-application-to-the-auction-mechanism-9c7f557a8e13",False

The use case for DRT tokens is extremely weak.  Nobody is going to want them.   You were all warned about the multiple failings of the project before launch - things like they sell you the tokens and put it through their profit and loss account, as sale of stock, and in return they say the give you nothing, no profits, no dividend, no votes, no influence - nothing.     There were lots of other failings which I won’t repeat as you read them before the launch.  To buy the tokens you had to acknowledge that this is not an investment, and that there was no price appreciation promise and that you would never get anything back.  They didn’t promise you any market for the token.  It was quite clear in the white paper that you contributed the money freely to the company in return for nothing except the DRT token, which was a kind of acknowledgement “thankyou for your contribution”.  It has no more value than the brass war medals you see for sale in every market.  Now you are complaining that its price is below what you paid.  That means you think it is some kind of investment?  They told you that token has no relation to the success of domraider as a company.  You gave away your money, acknowldged in writing that you would get nothing back, that this was no investment, no currency, no cryptocurrency, no security, and now you expect something?  What were you expecting when you bought these tokens?  Did you think “oh they just say this is worthless for legal reasons, but in reality, they’ll make me rich, I trust them”  I don’t suppose you can realistically sell your tokens.  Probably not.  Who would want to buy them?  You have to put it down to one of life’s experiences that you can one day tell your grand children.  Before you all flame me, can I ask you to pick any of the so called “advisors” or “experts” from the whitepaper, and look at their linked-in or facebook page.   Do they even mention Domraider?  In that alone you have your answer as to what you “bought”.  Except you didn’t “buy” anything.  You effectively made a gift to the pockets of a small group of directors.

That’s about $52 worth.  There’s only 4 bids.   On the other hand, there are 100s of sellers trying to sell 23 million DRT tokens at prices of 0.00005 and higher.  My comment that you can’t sell them stands.  Just think, they raised more than 40 million euros, but the most you could get for it would be $52.  Nobody will buy your tokens, unless you have less than $52 worth.  The next seller will absorb the buyers and then there will be no more market.  Sorry, but you lost all your money.

The DomRaider blockchain is a project that a lot of people are working on, and it has many supporters, including people like Eddy Travia or Mougayar, people who believes in designing a worldwide auctions blockchain. Perhaps the word “worldwide” was not understood. Cryptocurrencies have become a way to make easy money, not a way to dream in great projects. More people will receive tokens and more people will be involved in this ""worldwide"" blockchain. The DRT value will not be given by making it an elitist currency, but by making an “exchange currency”. The more a coin is exchanged, the more its value increases. But you have to think long-term. This is the idea that animates the project, not the idea of making fast money.",False

In terms of ICO investment, we feel that 50€ or $60 is not a huge amount, and is attainable for most people. We believe that If people are really interested in investing, that smaller amounts than this, are not really worthwhile for both parties. I hope this answers your question.  Please contact me if you have any other questions and I would be happy to answer them.  Regards  DomRaider Team",False

The  snapping rate depends of the TLD. We have the best rates with ccTLDs like .FR, .DE, .BE and also with other gTLDs. We have thousands of customers who have already use our platform.  In addition, DomRaider is the only dropcatching company with the most TLDs domain names.  Dropcatching is our first job at DomRaider. But I shall insist on the fact that DomRaider ICO is not directly related to domain names. The purpose of this ICO is to create a new auction platform based on blockchain technology. It will be firstly used on our platform, by switching our auctions system to the blockchain network and enlarge this to every business concerned by auctions. An auction platform like the one we are creating at DomRaider will have some significant improvements over legacy systems. For starters, the platform would be scalable, reliable and transparent.  DomRaider’s technology solution will allow for a worldwide auction platform where users will be able to communicate directly. This provides a far greater user base for auctions, and ensures simple and easy decision making and transaction processing at a fraction of the cost of other auction systems.  And the solution will also provide a very fast and secure platform to process and immutably record bids and outcomes. The infrastructure, as it stands, can provide consensus of bids in less than one second.",False

To be honest i never worked with domraider before, but i will test the product within the next days.  After reading the whitepaper i have still some open questions, maybe you can answer them as well:  How many registered users does domraider have as of today? And how many of them are active on a monthly base? You are stating a 98% success rate for snapping domains on domraider.com. How is this number calculated? Asking cause i doubt that your competition like dropcatch.com, snapnames.com and namejet.com is only getting 2% of the cake. How do you see domraider yourself in comparision with similiar concepts like nametoken.io or domaintoken.io?  Thanks in advance!",False
