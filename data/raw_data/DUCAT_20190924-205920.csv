In the last 6 months we’ve accomplished a lot and now I’m proud to show you the DUCATUR SHORT REPORT.  Which most of the projects we’ve done in the last 6 months.  Our largest projects to date are:  ColdCrypto - which is the first cold storage for a smart phone. Better then Ledger, Trezor and that is free. Will be released on iOS first. [Beta-release this week] https://goo.gl/yv5mmu  Courteos - which is a dispute resolution mechanism using blockchain. Allowing for multinational trade to use smart-contracts as legal contracts and in case of dispute go to an Estonia-based arbitration court. [In process of registration of our own Arbitration Court in Estonia] https://goo.gl/uuKypQ  DUXI - which is a cloud service for the multi chain environment we are creating. It will be the backbone of all of our future projects and the first platform for backend DAPP performance on multiple blockchains, as well as our own Multichain Token.  I know you all want to hear about the exchange. We already have a few exchanges ready to list us. BUT We wanted to release a public version of ColdCrypto before we launch on exchange. Also the market keeps on falling now and will keep falling, we are just looking at a short rise right now.  The reason is we want MORE people to know about Ducatur see our products, we want a buy wall that will make the price grow. And we are going to concentrate our marketing on ColdCrypto with inner functions of the DUC token in the wallet.  We still want to go that path. Release a Massive project- ColdCrypto that will get attention and after that list on exchange.  So I ask you all to wait. Right now we are putting the exchange date on March 10th of 2019. It’s a good top20 exchange. I won’t say the name and it doesn’t matter.  Please just look at the progress we’ve done in the last 6 months, winning 6 hackathons, creating many POCs, working on multiple projects. Ducatur will get recognised in the space, we will get even more followers and we will grow.  I thank you all again for helping us, make this project come to life and we will not disappoint.""  Product is really coming along in leaps and bounds from the looks of things. Just gotta hang in there a few more months.",True

SYSTEM FEATURES  TWO-LEVEL RATING SYSTEM The principle of two-level rating will allow motivating the creators of oracles to provide genuine data and make correct decisions. Thanks to the reputation system, the expert groups (running nodes in the DUCATUR Network version) will be ranked, which will reflect the quality of the operations performed. The rating system is built according to the binary principle: the expert's rating can be equal to either 1 or 0. At the moment of joining the node and depositing a pledge in tokens, the expert gets 1 reputation point, in case of giving incorrect data his rating becomes 0 and the pledge burns down.  DECENTRALIZED COURT To create a decentralized court, it is necessary to exclude the possibility of fraud and protect the participants from subjective decisions. For this, destinies must be independent and unknown to both parties. There must necessarily be an anonymous place where the parties can provide evidence for their case. To ensure the decentralization of the community, the arbitrators are selected through mathematical algorithms that analyze the reputation of the arbitrators, their sphere of competence and specific jurisdiction. Payments to arbitrators are taken from the pool of the losing party. The cost of the case is determined by the arbitrator or the client. The price can be equal to zero: for example, to gain reputation. Both sides are responsible for providing data, documents and testimony. In case of fraud detection by one of the parties, an auto-loss or a decrease of reputation to the expert by node are counted. To ensure transparency of the process and motivation for making the right decisions the log-database of all processes with shared access interface is provided.  UNIFIED SYSTEM FOR DATA AND A REGISTER OF READYMADE SOLUTIONS  To connect the oracle (a new data source) to the DUCATUR Network, an information card is formed and placed in a unified registry, which contains basic data about the data provided. The information card contains the following data based on which the rating and issuance in the web interface of the registry are calculated: • Data source - brief information about the data source; • Links to the website, social network; • Data type; • Date of creation - an expert; • Hash rate - the total amount of information in kb that the source has supplied over the lifetime; • The number of errors - per 1000 units in percentage, is constructed according to the log; • Number of experts - the actual number of data sources that it works with; • Pledge - the amount that the expert will pay for the error; • Cost of kb - the price that is required for a unit of information.

Often it is the community that drives sales and further project success. At the same time, we, as entrepreneurs, can not ignore the blurring of the cost of tokens following the bounty campaigns (which investors also notice).  Therefore, we tried to make our bounty program interesting and profitable first of all for those who can help in our project’s development…   Bounty campaign description  Bounty starts on March 25, 2018 Bounty ends when the ICO is over  The bounty pool accounts for 4% of the total number of DUC tokens issued.  When the hard cap is reached the bounty pool will account for 280M of DUC tokens (628 ETH or $ 439K at the rate of $ 700 / ETH)  The token rate at the tokensale: 1 DUCAT = 0.000005 ETH   Bounty pool is distributed as follows:  4% Total Supply (280,000,000)  15% - Bounty4Everyone (42 000 000) 20% - Bounty4Contributors (56 000 000) 30% - Community Growth (84 000 000) 35% - Developer Rewards (98 000 000)  General rules of the bounty campaign:  In order to participate in the campaign, you must fulfill one or several requirements, which are described below (you can participate in several categories, the reward will be added together). It is not allowed to delete messages, reposts or retweets or otherwise abolish the requirements listed below during the bounty campaign. Bounty tokens will be transferred to the ETH wallets of participants after the ICO ends. Each participant will have to register on the website. Unused tokens are burned.  Main objectives/targets of the bounty:  1. Attract new users to the project and increase Bounty4Everyone and Bounty4Contributors brand awareness.  2. Community Growth. Growing the team and/or outsourcing the project’s development. Regional representatives, translators, troubleshooters, articles’ writers, community managers.  3. Developer Rewards. Constant contest for the creation of the best ""million niches"" case for the Oracles’ current business use. Winners (no less than 3) share the volume of tokens.   Bounty4Everyone  Classic bounty program any user of the network can take part in, except for the groups specified in the website rules. In total 42 000 000 tokens will be distributed. We do not use stacks, we pay for each action.  All actions are automated with the help of the https://www.viralsweep.com service but will be manually checked upon the end of the bounty program.   The following actions are possible at the first stage:       Daily Limit: You can collect 1000 Ducats for your activity every day  Since the project is primarily interested in the maximum distribution of tokens during the bounty, we reserve the right to create a new type of tasks, while maintaining the existing reward system. For example: to visit an online webinar, to provide a comment to the proposed case, etc. All participants will be informed in case of new assignments.  Unused tokens are burned.   FACEBOOK  Rules:  1: At least 100 friends 2: Your Facebook account should not be an inactive or bot-account. Only the original Facebook accounts that you use will be accepted. 3: The account must be open for general viewing, and all messages related to the project must be publicly available. 4: It is forbidden to participate from multiple accounts. 5: It is forbidden to delete messages until you receive a token.   TWITTER  Rules:  More than 100 subscribers. Twitter audit must be passed higher than 85%. Only 1 repost per message is counted. You  may not remove retweets until you receive tokens.   TELEGRAM  Rules:  Stay in our Telegram group until the end of the tokensale   Terms and conditions are subject to change if necessary.     Bounty4Contributors  Light version of the classic bounty campaign for the project's contributors. All actions are automated with the help of the https://www.viralsweep.com service. Thus we try to solve the issue of low activity among the contributors.  At this stage, the following actions are possible:      Unused tokens are burned    Referral  One of the main goals of the referral program is to attract new users. We have prepared a very convenient and simple system by which each token holder making a publication becomes a member of the referral system. This means that if after your share, post, link in the comments to us a new member of the bounty comes, you will receive additional DUCats. Statistics on the number of attracted users will be displayed in the Personal Account. Tokens are transferred 2 weeks after the TGE.   Community Growth  For those who want to help the project with their knowledge and skills. Blogger, translator, community, territorial representative - this is for you!  Since participation in this part implies a professional approach and 1: 1 communication, we offer a revolutionary payment scheme. Offer your ideas and specify the payment you want to receive. Our community manager is obliged to answer you in 24 hours. Videos, pictures, tattoos, translations, speeches, flash mobs - we do not limit you in any way.  In order to ensure the transparency of the accruals, we are obliged to publish resulting links to all accepted works and the amount of payments thereon.   Rules for Community Growth:   1: Low quality work will not be accepted; 2: Unique content only; 3: Your work should contain a link to the official website of the project, with your ref link   Developer Rewards  We are searching for specialists and teams that will be able to offer and/or implement one of the Oracles in our network for DUCATUR partners and customers.  It is necessary to choose one of the business verticals https://goo.gl/kqX8sA and to offer your idea of the Oracle to provide the possibility of integration of the blockchain into this business. We can pay for the development in full, employ you or just pay you the commission you want for your help.",True
