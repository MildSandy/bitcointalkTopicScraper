The platform will be the cheapest, and at the same time the safest and most effective tool for business management. The use of Blockchain and Tangle registers in the ERP system will become a milestone in the development of resource management systems.  Diveco Logistics also plans to create several other products within the system. The combination of data from tachographs and GPS transmitters with Blockchain technology will effectively prevent attempts to falsify data and increase their transparency. Thanks to this solution, road safety will also increase, and entrepreneurs will gain the best quality tool for managing the work of drivers and fleet. What distinguishes the project is also the system of dividends to be introduced after the commercial launch of the system. Tokens will be the action of the company and depending on their number, the investor will be able to profit from it.    It is difficult to imagine management of modern enterprise without an IT system for maintaining its resources. ERP systems (Enterprise Resource Planning systems) are often used for these purposes. Their task is to provide decision-makers with timely and accurate data, allowing them to take and implement necessary business decisions, optimizing the interaction of people, materials, machines and cash. All of this is in order to effectively achieve the goals set by the company and to implement all planned tasks in an efficient manner. A typical ERP system (a system for planning enterprise resources), consists of co-operating applications or modules, which use one common database for the entire system. Thanks to this, data entered is available immediately in all modules. Individual modules included in the ERP system automatically integrate in one place all the information necessary for users regarding the enterprise’s operations at all levels and in most of the management areas. Typical ERP systems combine planning, supply, sales, marketing, customer relations, finance and personnel management information. Therefore, they allow the optimal use of resources and organization of processes in the specific industry. An extremely important feature of ERP systems is their flexibility and the ability to adapt to the specifics of a given company.  ERP systems are derived directly from MRP II (Manufacturing Resource Planning) systems, which are information systems for planning production resources. ERP system modules must include: storage, inventory management, sales, tracking of deliveries, procurement, customer relationship management, accounting, finance, human resources management, including staff and wages, as well as transport management, controlling and project management (in addition to planning, balancing and production scheduling, as in classic MRP II systems). In other words, the ERP system supports the implementation of the full economic process from planning sales to receiving payment. Of course, an ERP system implemented in a given company does not have to contain all of the above mentioned modules. How it appears in a particular enterprise depends only on the specifics of a given company and on what goals were assumed during the ERP system implementation process. What is important is an adaptation to the needs of a given company, made possible due to the fact that individual modules of the ERP system are always mutually independent of each other and can work without another module’s presence (with the exception of the basic module). An important feature of a modern ERP system is that they allow the setting of specific access rights for particular employees, while maintaining a standard user interface, thus enabling users to perform planning processes using different methods and introducing changes (corrections) in the planned processes, which are resulting from changes in the planned processes, which are resulting from changes in the external conditions (eg sudden fluctuations in prices of natural resources).  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Diveco Logistics Token  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Platform: Ethereum ERC20 Token Symbol: XDIV Max Supply: 200,000,000 XDIV   -----------------------------------------------------------------   PRE-ICO PRICE: $0.02 ICO PHASE 1: $0.04 ICO PHASE 2: $0.08  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Dates   -----------------------------------------------------------------  PRE-ICO START - 10.04.2018 - 15:00 UTC PRE-ICO END - 10.05.2018 - 15:00 UTC   -----------------------------------------------------------------   ICO PHASE 1 START - 10.05.2018 - 16:00 UTC ICO PHASE 1 END - 10.06.2018 - 16:00 UTC   -----------------------------------------------------------------   ICO PHASE 2 START - 10.06.2018 - 17:00 UTC ICO PHASE 2 END - 10.07.2018 - 17:00 UTC  -----------------------------------------------------------------   Road Map   -----------------------------------------------------------------   -----------------------------------------------------------------    Dividents   -----------------------------------------------------------------   -----------------------------------------------------------------  Referral Program  -----------------------------------------------------------------  You can find your own unique link in the dashboard, thanks to which you can invite friends to join our project.

The first advantage will be the price even 70% lower than usual ERP Systems. Another thing is security and transparency of information due to Blockchain and Tangle. In the Tangle registry it will be possible to integrate not only devices within the enterprise, but also devices of companies cooperating with a given company, so we will realize the concept of Internet of Things in full.
