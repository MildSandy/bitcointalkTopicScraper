A btc price ticker would remain helpful; as well as collateral tickers that outline how much volume is present and moving through the platform. I don't see any sort of price graphs or for that matter, trading tools that would allow users to formulate positions unilaterally on the exchange platform. This development is very exciting. Given any evidence of competence or security from the development personnel involved would attract a significant level of attention from skeptical and cautious investment organizations and business groups involved in franchising.

It has been quite a journey and an effort to get here, but that foundational work is mostly done and should serve us well as we roll out various network features and have a solid foundation and infrastructure to build on top of.

It would be a massive lapse on the part of the project development team to see the market become worthless in comparison to rising trends elsewhere in the crypt o community.

Operating a market based on ethics and the well-being of the community is exactly what the crypt o sphere is all about when it concerns the free market place. If the team simply does not have a plan for their stance in the market place (which I will doubt for the sake of reason), then their place in the trade market will simply fall behind the sector and the project will lapse and it will become insufficient for the community to continue funding. Professionally maintaining their position in the free market in a fair and ethical manner that retains an integrity for their supportive enthusiasts and a return schedule for the investment community is completely within a standard and firm course of action. It is exactly what the community is all about and exactly what the project should aim to accomplish for the value of their project. Having this sort of mind set should have brought them to exactly where we are now (where shares are so available) and it should be certain to bring us to an evaluation that will settle the project into stone, brick and mortar; and without losing the interest and availability to the community that keeps the project popular to be a part of.",False

WTF? Next time they will write about RTA Gamma Release... RTA Delta Release... RTA Epsilon Release... and etc.  Today there is no problem to pay for goods with crypto coins. Today there is a problem in every government. No one wants people to trade for crypto coins. If someone does this, his business will be closed by the government. There is always a reason for the government to destroy any business. Therefore, one should not hope that the graft is the path to freedom.  These guys have sold their coins for 70 cents apiece and for many years they have been fucking everyone's head. There will be no such price, there will not be so many transactions, there will be no such reward for supernodes. Forget this project. I bought a lot of coins, but it was just stupid. These guys are pulling time, they don't need you. There will be no result. Here is my humble opinion. Just think your own head. These guys have provided themselves.  Understand that any business is primarily subject to the laws of the government. Government land, police and all financial organizations, banks and etc. A gradual transition is not effective, and a simultaneous and global is not yet possible and graft will not help here. Miners and investors just lose time and money. Unfortunately, we can only hope for success in speculation.  Even if a state takes the first step, it will be destroyed by other major states. In the world for a long time everything is very strongly connected and no one can leave the game with the dollar. The price for such a decision for each state is very high and exorbitant. There is no such price in any price list. Everything always returns to the dollar and there is no solution to the problem yet.",False

During active public RTA alpha testing, the GRAFT core development team and community have identified several issues with current RTA design, and we are currently working on updating and enhancing the design. All issues and design updates are either already published or will be published soon on github for community review. It’s important to note that there are no fundamental issues in the supernode RTA concept, but some mechanisms such as the authorization sample selection algorithm and supernode proof of stake require some enhancements to ensure overall security and stability of the RTA system. Stay tuned for new and updated RFCs coming.   The core developers also were working on merging recent Monero updates and bug fixes. A couple of hard-to-find deadlocks were fixed, and the fixes are in test cycle right now. Connection management is more robust now. We are working on a “big” Monero merge (we missed some updates but are now catching up), and the first intermediate milestone has been reached.  Meanwhile, the application development team continues working on another part of the GRAFT ecosystem, which we call “customer facing applications”; it includes the mobile and desktop wallet and point of sale apps, payment gateway, hardware payment terminal apps, hardware wallet and payment card (ColdPay), the CryptoFind app, and more. The most important activities in our scope last week were work on an integration plugin for WooCommerce/WordPress (payment gateway), preparation for Verifone testing (terminal app), implementation of Monero transaction multi-signing (hardware wallet on ColdPay card), and Ethereum pay-in exchange broker testing.  Looking forward to another exciting week and Happy GRAFTing!  https://www.graft.network/2018/12/19/graft-weekly-development-status-update-december-19th-2018/",False

ME 13:40 That video didn't answer any question Let's imagine this situation: current GRAFT market price is 208 satoshis  CryptoRobo 13:41 As I said, a lot of the precise details are likely still being worked out, so there is not an answer to the question yet.  Graft team has really improved on communication and explanation of how things will work, to include putting out a lot of good videos to help understand.  Remember, this is ALL new tech and processes, so there is some R&D that gets done ""along the way"", as this eco system evolves.  ME 13:42 I want to buy it as exchange broker 100k at 205 satoshis in meanwhile BTC drops and it drops 10% so new market price is 185 satoshis where is the safety mechanism to prevent me from failing, like I would fail on regular exchange? (if I just leave my bid as is, and not following the market constantly) to rephrase the question - what is the purpose of exchange broker then?  CryptoRobo 13:43 I saw your question about the price fluctuations, and unfortunately, I don't have the answer man.  Is your question just about buying Graft on exchange? an exchange broker is used when:  ME 13:44 No my question was about safety mechanism for exchange broker, since zero details are release about it  CryptoRobo 13:44 a customer wants to pay for their purchase in, lets say....BTC at time of purchase. let me type please  ME 13:44 I don't want a powerpoint presentation with money circulation, that's all we got now  CryptoRobo 13:44 stop responding at every sentence. I am trying to answer  your question a customer wants to pay for their purchase in, lets say....BTC at time of purchase. So, they select the proper buttons at that time, scan BTC QR code on pos device with their BTC wallet (likely from their phone), and their BTC is sent. Now, BTC doesn't move on the Graft Network. Graft Does. So...the BTC comes in, is validated the funds are good, then that BTC needs to be exchanged to Graft, to travel across the network, so it goes to an ""exchange broker"", is exchanged to Graft. Then moves across the network. Now, let's say the merchant wants to accept Graft at final settlement of each transaction. Then he gets the Graft. Now - let's say he wants paid in USD at time of settlement well, then the Graft now needs to be exchanged for USD once it moves across the network, so a pay out exchange broker will take in the Graft, exchange for USD and send that payment on to the merchant. This can be said for any currency so, the exchange broker allows the Graft Network to accept and pay out in any currency make sense?  ME 13:48 Thanks I got that from that powerpoint presentation that explains money flow  CryptoRobo 13:48 ok, so that's all we know at this point we know 0 more than that  ME 13:50 There is Stellar for example that makes literally instant transaction, and there is Graft which takes a lot of time for transaction and now all that with exchanging this to that and confirming this to that, even from technological side it is impossible to make it instant. So I can freely scan BTC code at cashier and step aside line for 15-20 min and return untill everything is confirmed?  CryptoRobo 13:50 I believe there is a lock in period for prices as well - as this all happens very rapidly of course no - because the network validates you have the funds there are also off chain transaction processing capabilities  ME 13:52 It sounds nice but what you are saying doesn't really mean anything. Let's say I am leaving home now and I want to go to store, where I will be in like 20 minutes and I am just transfering my BTC to my mobile wallet  CryptoRobo 13:52 I also believe that exchange brokers can choose whether they'll accept instant or want confirmations, since the network checks the senders wallet for funds available.  ME 13:52 Untill I get there I will have money in BTC wallet  CryptoRobo 13:52 Then don't pay with BTC....simple  ME 13:52 So offchain transactions and validating funds and that LOL LOL ok thanks for your time",False

Unfortunately there was no other way. However, I still follow community closely because I was holding and mining GRAFT for so long that you can't even imagine, and even though there were some turbulence times, this project somehow got close to my heart.   I didn't have a chance to meet team members personally, but I had a chance to have a small chit chat with Dan and Slava via email and to be honest - it ment a lot to me.  I am going to leave behind all that ICO and miners dumping stuff. But I want to share a view on how I see this project, because I see a lot of FUD is going around these days. First you have to understand that entire market is crashing for past couple of months. Total market cap went down from 220 billion USD from 3 months ago to currently around 120 billion USD right now. Whales don't manipulate and hold only on BTC, you need to understand that small markets are so much easier to manipulate. Trust me, I've seen it all. GRAFT has market cap of 700 BTC at the moment of speaking and only 3 exchanges (and those are low volume exchanges). Someone with 2-3 BTC worth of GRAFT can do whatever he wants with this price - that's the way it is.   Yes, I agree that things are going slower than we all expected. I agree that team made some mistakes in the past, for example they didn't hold their community well enough. But what I've noticed over past few months is that things are changing. Sure, they are not online for answer every your question on social networks, but they are present, and there are those weekly reports and someone is reading all this stuff, since for example GRAFT forum was removed from website, like someone mentioned here the other day. So, as far as I am concerned, someone cares. Just compare their communication with community from 6 months ago with last month. Maybe they are not doing perfect job on that area - but they are learning and making improvements there.   What I want you to understand (even though I repeat, I am not any more connected in any way to this project, even as investor) when I had that short communication with Dan and he tried to explain me something, I literally had to ask him to come down to my level and explain it to me like I am 10 years old. That's when I realized that not all of us are made for programming, or not all of us are made for example for communication and ""dumbing down to someone else's level"". Yes, they probably should have bigger impact on social networks, but my vision is they are fully commited to this project and they think that technology will win in the end. This is the time when shitcoins die, it is up to you if you are going to call GRAFT a shitcoin, and I don't want to call any names here, but what does XVG do, for example? Nothing, it can move money from point A to point B. And it has 40x higher market cap than GRAFT. Not once, not twice, FOURTY TIMES. The question is - who will survive these hard times? Technology or Marketing?   There was a lot of talk here (and elsewhere) that development is taking too much time. To be honest - I feel the same way. I don't think for example they should've implement that exchange broker (I still dont quite understand what are safety mechanisms there) but they could've / should've turn to reaching bigger exchange for example, making adoption more easily in that way, insted of making exchange broker who will basically do OTC trading. Ok, they had their vision of the project, if I don't perhaps understand or agree on everything - it doesn't mean that I am right. If I were you, I would give them a couple of more months because I have a feeling they are - finnaly - really close. This definately didn't turn out good for short term investors, but you have to take a look at the whole picture - big things will come in crypto generally. And price is going down like a titanic - it doesn't make sense at all. Nasdaq confirmed launching BTC futures in first half of next year, I mean I strongly belive that crypto will recover - and BTC will reach another all-time-high, it's not ""IF"" but ""WHEN"". Crypto is everywhere, admit it or not. We don't even know what is going on behind closed doors. Nasdaq confirmed that they are actually closely watching crypto market for last 5 years. YO! LAST FIVE YEARS! When those SEC's were denied you could read in their report (for reasoning) that they actually understand the market, they understand what is going on, they even provided links from reddit and legal documents - you don't do such stuff and give so much effort for research, if you don't have real interest in it.   This post went way too long that I thought - but I wanted to say:   1.  Don't be stupid, at these prices GRAFT is absolute a steal, whoever has any crypto knowledge knows that everything comes in cycles. GRAFT's cycle didn't come yet, but when it does you are going to be late. When regular investor misses the train - he missed the train. When someone rich enough misses the train, he pulls the train back - that's what is going on right now with the prices.   2. Do not forget that GRAFT is actually aiming for something. They have one of the best partnership they could possibly imagine. If you are going to whine over the price now or next few months - just sell it. Otherwise print out mnemonic phase on piece of paper, vacuum it and put it in your drawer, like I did in the past. Even though I won't be around for taking part of that, I'm absolutely sure it will skyrocket at some point. They collected 3 million in ICO phase. They also said that when everything is finnaly launched, they will use unsold ICO coins to make transactions on network, so Node holders would start earning from beginning, and try to compensate on start untill real adoption comes in. Well I have a feeling that real adoption isn't that far away as many people think. If they tried to scam you, you wouldn't know their team members and their real names, anyone thought of that?   3. I must clarify this is just my assumption - but remember how there was a talk about new exchange and donations on website and stuff? I think they decided not to go on with that, and to use their GRAFT (check out distribution chart) to slowly collect for exchange listing. You know they won't admit that (they are not even allowed to talk about that, for sure) but that might be PART OF THE reason because GRAFT is bleeding perhaps harder over past few months. Early investors aren't dumping - miners are dumping - but HEY - someone is. Liked it or not, that's how things are done, everything costs these days and so is listing. For short gainers, this is bad. For someone who loves the project - he will understand it and aproove this action. (assuming there is some truth in my assumption)   I didn't had a chance - but don't bring yourself in my situation. Just put some money in there and forget about it for 6 months. I mean, they have partnership with one of biggest POS terminal manufacturors in the world FFS, that's not a small thing. It's like Stellar partnering with IBM (which will open their way into banks since 97% of banks are using IBM in some way, and trust them). Well GRAFT and Verifone partnership isn't much different! If you're looking for fast money, go gamble or something, you missed the project. But hopefully you won't turn back and look on GRAFT the same way that guy who paid pizza 100 BTC is looking back now.",False

Hi #@#@#@#@#@#@,  Thank you for your reply.  I appreciate your frustration, however we are unable to release a coin from maintenance until we are sure all its issues are resolved. I hope I can give you some insight as to why this happens, as I understand parts of cryptocurrency can be opaque and I want to reassure you that your coins are safe.  Cryptopia will only ever put a coin into maintenance if we feel that not doing so will cause more issues for our users. If a wallet is crashing or there is an update that is not optimised for our large wallet sizes, bringing the coin out of maintenance too quickly would cause issues that would take longer to fix than if we ensured that the issue was completely resolved first.  Due to the nature of coin maintenance issues, our devs are working on all coin problems simultaneously, and need to prioritise certain coins so that as few users as possible are affected. As this is different from day to day, we are unable to provide an estimated time for when this maintenance will be complete.  Please be assured that our primary concern is to keep your coins safe and while we fully realise this is frustrating for you and our other GRFT coin holders, please kindly note this is one of our wallet teams main priorities at the moment. We hope everything will be resolved soon.  Should you wish to find out more about what it means when a wallet goes into maintenance, please have a read our knowledge base article here: https://support.cryptopia.co.nz/csm?id=kb_article&sys_id=95a918a1dbed1f009990f6fcbf961985  Thank you very much for your patience, we really appreciate it  Kind regards, Carl",False

Network hashrate is important, but it is not the only factor in blockchain security. The way this hash power is distributed between the miners is also important. ASICs break the balance and facilitate centralization (concentration of hash power) which can be dangerous for the network.  The major network update will apply a new variation of CryptoNight hash algorithm (CryptoNight V8 / CN variant 2) which is currently ASIC-resistant. The source code of the new version 1.5 can be downloaded from master. The binaries for Linux and Windows will be available shortly (please follow GRAFT Twitter account for the notification).  The major network update (aka hard fork) in GRAFT mainnet is scheduled for Wednesday, October 31st at block 207,700 (block 194,130 in GRAFT testnet tomorrow, October 24, 2018).  The major network update means that if you are running the GRAFT network node (graftnoded) you must upgrade to the latest software before October 31st. If you do not upgrade your node before October 31st, it will be disconnected from the mainnet. Note that users of GRAFT mobile and desktop wallets are not affected by the hard fork and should not do anything – as long as they are still connected to the default proxy supernodes (if you are connected to your own supernode, do not forget to upgrade the underlying network node).  https://www.graft.network/2018/10/23/graft-anti-asic-major-network-update-1-5-on-october-31-2018/",False

GRAFT vs Electroneum  Electroneum recently announced real-time transactions available as beta on their network. We wanted to take some time to shed some light on the difference in approaches between solutions like Electroneum and GRAFT.  With their approach, Electroneum is effectively following the centralized model of Bitpay, Coinbase, Coingate, GoUrl.io, and many other centralized crypto payment processing gateways in that they issue an authorization immediately as the transaction enters the transaction pool, without waiting for confirmations on the network. There is little innovation in this approach which is well-known to the industry. With centralized entity in the middle, the buyer and the merchant must rely on trusted party just like with traditional plastic payment processing, which means no privacy, no security, and a single point of control.  Unlike Bitpay and other centralized payment gateways, Electroneum shifts the risk of transaction not getting confirmed onto the merchant rather than absorbing it themselves.

At first glance, this seems like a good situation for everyone who cares about GRAFT, especially for the miners. But let’s compare Monero and GRAFT market capitalization (the dollar price of one GRFT multiplied by the number of tokens in current circulation): $1.68 billion (Monero) vs. $3.76 million (GRAFT). There is a huge difference between these two market caps, but they have the same mining profitability (actually GRAFT is even better). The current GRAFT block reward (the proof-of-work fee that the miners receive when they “solve” the block and successfully add it to the blockchain) today is approximately 1,420 GRFT, so every day the GRAFT circulation grows by more than 1 million (!) GRFT. Unfortunately, many miners abuse the high profitability of GRAFT and immediately dump their mining rewards on exchanges, which keeps the price down as the demand cannot cope with such a rapidly growing supply. Even growing demand cannot catch up to the emission rate because the project is too young. In order to stabilize the price of GRAFT (not to mention any growth), we need emissions to match demand, i.e. more people have to join the community and buy at least 1 million GRAFT every day. This is not a simple task for a blockchain that is 7 months old.  Although the block reward is designed to decrease with every block, the current rate by which emissions are decreasing is not significant enough to counteract the overall supply increase rate from miners dumping. It will be significantly lower in, let’s say, one or two years, but the GRAFT team and supporters—including miners—cannot wait that long. We all need the price to stabilize and even increase in order to make GRAFT successful right now.  Note that ERC20 token-based projects do not have the problem described above because they don’t have a real blockchain. Their token supply remains the same (actually, it is even reduced with every exchange transaction), so they just need to make sure their demand at least remains the same in order to constantly pump the price and the market cap.  With that said, in order to increase the value of existing GRAFT tokens, we decided to correct the emission by reducing the block reward by 50%, so the new block reward formula will be as following:  reward = (M – A) * 2^-19 * 10^-10 / 2  Where M is max total supply and A is current supply.  As you can see, the correction will not change the total maximum amount of GRAFT that will be ever created, it will just stretch the emission curve such that it will take longer to mine the total supply (see the existing and the new emission curves on the diagrams below).  All GRAFT supporters should benefit from the corrected emission formula because it is supposed to limit the daily increase in circulating supply, which will reduce the overall supply growth rate and stabilize the price. Long-term miners will benefit from the reduced emission for two reasons: 1) the price will go up so they will receive the same, or even better, revenue, and 2) the emission curve will be stretch, so they will get a more steady income over the extra years without the need to rely on transaction fees.   The emission reduction change requires a major network update (aka “hard fork”), which will be scheduled for block 176,000 (September 17, 2018). The major network update means that each GRAFT network node must be updated to the new software version before that block/date. Otherwise, the node that wasn’t updated is going to be on the wrong version of the blockchain. The new release will be available for download on September 10, 2018.  As another reminder, a major network update means that if you are running the GRAFT network node (graftnoded daemon), you must upgrade it to the current software release as soon as possible. If you do not install the updated node before the block 176,000, it will be disconnected from the mainnet after block 176,000.  Note that the users of mobile and desktop wallets will not be affected by the upcoming major network update and don’t need to do anything—as long as they are still connected to the default proxy supernodes (if you are connected to your own supernode, however, do not forget to upgrade the underlying network node to stay on the right network).",False

The devs realize that they cannot reimburse all of the ICO participants for the difference in actual price with the funds acquired at the ICO bid. They simply do not have the coins in order to distribute and the flux in the market place would be catastrophic rather than progressive. This way, there is a greater chance and a shorter time frame involved with bringing the market to the level that was represented by the ICO bid. Burning a portion of the coins may only exacerbate an inevitable short. Given that it is more likely for the devs to sell what coins are left from the ICO at a price range that matches the ICO bid, we can assume that it will only help the endeavor that we all stand behind; which aims for a product that is worth several times the original ICO offer.

This article attempts to separate facts from fiction by outlining the lay of the land and Graft’s competitive positioning based on our view of the space.  With that in mind, let’s start with some definitions of key components of the electronic payment chain:  Payment processor — a service provider that processes a payment authorization, settles the transaction, and deposits a merchant payout.  Payment network — a network (or protocol) that provides an infrastructure for processing payments by coordinating the activity among multiple participating parties.  Payment gateway — a service that provides access to a payment network. These categories are important when deciphering what various providers are trying to do.  Centralized Payment Processors The first class of payment solutions that are operating today are the centralized payment processors such as Coinbase and Bitpay. To enable crypto payments, these players simultaneously act as a payment gateway, a payment processor, and a clearing house. There’s nothing significantly wrong with this approach other than the fact that 1) it goes against the principles of decentralization; 2) it’s not a network, but rather a single entity; 3) it doesn’t scale very well because a payment processor needs to be able to handle an unlimited volume of the transactions and provide cross-border support; and 4) they represent a single point of failure and, more importantly, a single point of attack making themselves extremely attractive to hackers. Solution Integrators Integrators usually take existing blockchains and make them work for a specific use case. In the case of payments, they would be the “last mile” solution for making Dash, for example, work at the point of sale. Integrated solutions usually work okay but they only support specific point-of-sale systems, specific merchants, and have limited flexibility. They also decide who gets to participate in the ecosystem and they essentially act as a bank by fulfilling a lot of the clearinghouse functions themselves. Payment Blockchains This category includes legitimate blockchain projects that attempt to facilitate cryptocurrency payments. Dash and Ripple are good examples of payment blockchains, as they have made significant advances in facilitating the use of blockchains for payments. Dash implemented on-demand privacy and on-demand speed, whereas Ripple implemented inter-blockchain swaps. Payment Networks Payment network implies that there are multiple participants that are being connected together to form a network. In the case of traditional credit/debit card processing networks, they are bridging the issuing banks, acquiring banks, and payment processors into something that works in the context of a single transaction.  Source: PYMNTS.com  Processing a payment at the point of sale is a complex chain of events that includes obtaining pre-authorization or authorization from the issuing bank through the acquiring bank, putting funds on hold, releasing the payment for settlement, and, finally, clearing the payment by transferring the funds from the user’s issuing bank to the merchant’s bank account.  In the case of cryptocurrencies, use of such a network implies pre-authorization by verifying and placing funds on hold in real-time, transferring the payment from the payer’s wallet in the currency of their choice, converting that currency into the currency of choice for the merchant, and distributing the fees — all this is accomplished by accepting and coordinating services from service providers. This is exactly what a network like GRAFT is doing (while providing integration points for the point-of-sale applications, and in a decentralized manner to boot!).  There’s only one other network-like solution (other than GRAFT) that’s looking to resemble some fragment of a payment network: the Lightning Network. However, the Lightning Network concerns itself with instant currency swaps, without much regard for fees or compatibility with the merchant point-of-sale systems and processes. It also relies on pre-existing payment channels, making it suitable for repeat transactions as opposed to what you would see in the point-of-sale environment.  Suspects Unfortunately, the blockchain space is rife with projects looking to capitalize on general lack of knowledge to pass themselves off as a legitimate payment solution in order to raise funds. They call themselves payment networks without building anything resembling a network, or a blockchain payment solution without having anything close to a viable solution. Their white papers are usually vague and full of buzzwords with little substance of the specifics of implementation. It’s often painful to watch millions, if not billions, of dollars being flushed into projects that show no signs of real technology or other innovation. Here are some “giveaways” that can help identify suspicious projects:  They are based on ERC20, EOS, or other smart contract tokens rather than dedicated blockchains. It’s very easy to create these tokens, but unless the project will act as a bank and take on the brunt of arbitrage in releasing the funds before they themselves collect those funds, there’s no way for them to overcome the speed issue. They are also subject to the underlying network fees that the token is built on. They advertise a “crypto credit card” that can be processed by a traditional credit card network. The impossibility here is that none of the traditional payment networks will license anyone but an issuing bank to accept network-backed payments. Unless the crypto credit card is backed by their own issuing bank which gets licensed by a traditional payment network (an unlikely scenario), this claim is quite dubious. Those that manage to pull off this feat will become a single-bank-backed, centralized solution, at the complete mercy of the local regulatory environment and traditional network continuous licensing. They are creating their own point-of-sale devices. It’s easy to private label a payment terminal found on Alibaba or similar manufacturer marketplaces. The problem with this is a merchant will not place a new terminal into the store without PCI and other rigorous certifications, not to mention that it would have to integrate with their point-of-sale software. Adding new terminal to a store, or especially a chain of stores, is an extremely difficult and expensive process which implies significant integration, certification, testing, and employee training costs that must be thoroughly justified. Summary There are distinct and important differences in payment solutions, with true payment networks providing the most open and flexible option for payment processing, while centralized and integrated processors can provide “point” solutions. There is quite a bit of disinformation in the cryptocurrency payment processing space, so it’s important to understand how payment ecosystems work in order to tell fact from fiction as you proceed to navigate this treacherous market space.",False

As an ICO investor, I got this email:  Quote Dear GRAFT supporter,    We don’t take promises lightly.  Ever. And this time is no exception.  This, however, is a situation when reconsidering a promise is warranted. The airdrop idea to compensate for the disparity for the ICO buyers was not well thought out (as frequently pointed out by the community) and if we were to proceed, would result in unintended consequences such as significant GRFT float dilution and potential additional downward pressure on GRFT pricing, negatively affecting ALL GRAFT stakeholders including ICO participants.    As such we have decided (after much deliberation) that it is better to cancel the airdrop altogether now and remove this cloud from the market, providing the project with the best chance of organic growth.    We believe that taking this action now will allow GRAFT to best capitalize on the progress with RTA, go to market partners, and other exciting developments we’ll be announcing shortly.  With that said, we will keep looking for other ways to thank our early supporters.   We hope you understand our decision and we can move past this issue, focusing on technology and go-to-market.

PART 1: BLOCKCHAIN AND CRYPTONOTE  Slava Gomzin, GRAFT Co-Founder  Although we have created a lot of materials explaining GRAFT (both existing features and future developments), including countless technical or semi-technical pages, marketing brochures, blog posts, and educational videos, it’s often difficult to see the whole picture while going through all of the specifics. A focus on the multiple features and their design details can obscure the view of the entire system, creating a so-called “you can’t see the forest through the trees” effect. We are getting many questions from supporting community members as well as potential customers and partners about “the big plan”: what is the ultimate goal, and how exactly are we going to achieve it? Whereas the answer to the first part of this question is quite simple and short, the answer to the second part requires some time and efforts. In this series of blog posts we will iterate through the various GRAFT features and try to explain why they are there, and how they help achieve our ultimate goal: Conquest of the crypto payments world.   Part 1: Blockchain and CryptoNote  Let’s start from the very beginning with the blockchain, or layer one of GRAFT. The blockchain is maintained by a peer-to-peer network of computers, or network nodes. We refer to these network nodes as “cryptonodes” to distinguish them from our “supernodes” (a.k.a. “masternodes” in other networks), which constitute the second layer of the GRAFT network (to be explained in a future blog post). The GRAFT blockchain is based on the CryptoNote protocol, which is the most private blockchain protocol in use as of today. In order to save time and resources, we used the luxury of the open source principle and forked the initial code of the GRAFT cryptonode from Monero — the best implementation of the CryptoNote protocol. In addition to acquiring fundamental privacy features “out of the box”, forking Monero provided a high degree of confidence in our blockchain from day one of the mainnet existence. It’s important to note that the code of GRAFT supernodes, which we create from scratch, is also open source, so essentially everything that we add on top of the previously existing features is also available for others to reuse.  Now let’s go back to the initial question and apply it to the blockchain layer: Why a brand new blockchain and why CryptoNote?  We’ll start with the new, dedicated blockchain: Yes, it would have been easy-peasy to run the GRAFT ICO on ERC20 or a similar token, as most people do these days to avoid blockchain maintenance, mainnet, mining, emission, seed nodes, etc. However, creation of the GRAFT payment network requires our own blockchain because we have to modify the cryptonodes as we develop the supernodes so they will support each other and work together. Without the ability to modify the code, we wouldn’t be able to create the network of supernodes and implement features like real time authorization or exchange brokers on top of any existing blockchain or token platform. In addition, there are features such as payout tokens, loyalty points, store credits, gift certificates, and discount coupons that are required for merchants — all of these are based on the merchant tokens platform, which cannot be built without a dedicated blockchain.  Now for CryptoNote: it’s not just “nice to have”, it is absolutely required in order to be competitive with traditional payment systems such as Visa network or PayPal. Ironically, Visa and PayPal provide much better privacy to their customers than most existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Let me explain. When you swipe/insert your payment card at the point of sale terminal, or click the PayPal’s pay button online, there are two entities in the world that are aware of your transaction: the payment network (Visa or PayPal in our case) and the merchant. In reality, of course, there are more organisations that “know” about your transaction because the payment network is more complex. This network includes, at the very least, the issuing bank (the one that gave you the payment card), the acquiring bank (the one that approves the payment), the payment gateway (the one that routes your transaction to the right payment processor/acquiring bank) and the payment processor (which processes the payment and merchant’s payout). However, in any case, this list of organizations is limited because they are under security and privacy regulations, and they have typically implemented some decent security controls that protect your transaction records from prying eyes. Of course, everyone in this list can be hacked or give away your info to a law enforcement agency, but this is a different story (which is, by the way, another good reason to switch to cryptocurrency payments and throw away your plastic cards!). For the sake of simplicity though, let’s assume that random people cannot gain access to your data in most situations.  Finally, let’s see what happens with blockchains. The key innovation of Bitcoin (the first blockchain and cryptocurrency) was the open ledger that is accessible to every node participating in the network because your transaction must be verified to make sure you are not trying to spend your money twice. But this also means that anyone in the world can see your transactions and how much money you have in your wallet! Now, unlike plastic cards, Bitcoin wallets are, in principle, anonymous because transaction records are not directly linked to your identity. At first glance, this feature appears to compensate for the fact that your transaction records are laying there in plain sight on the blockchain for anyone to see. Well, the problem is that there are ways to link addresses to identities. Once this happens, all of your transactions magically become visible forever because the blockchain is always there and it cannot be erased!  Fortunately, there is a solution: the CryptoNote protocol, which hides the sender’s address, the recipient’s address, and the transaction amount , while still preserving the ability to validate each transaction and prevent double spending — and it’s all thanks to advanced cryptography! One day I am going to explain how it works in layman’s terms to unveil the beauty of CryptoNote and its cryptography (the same as I have done to explain RSA and Elliptic Curves cryptography in my book about Bitcoin payments). But for now, let’s just take it on faith that CryptoNote ensures a high degree of privacy for all participants. Moreover, on top of existing CryptoNote features, GRAFT adds even more privacy and hides transaction fees!  Summary of Part 1:  Why a brand new blockchain and why CryptoNote?  The dedicated blockchain allows GRAFT to create a merchant token platform. This is required for features like payout tokens and loyalty programs, and the second layer supernode network, which enables special retail features such as real time authorizations and exchange brokers.  The Cryptonote blockchain protocol provides an absolute privacy to all participants of the transaction, which is required in order to compete with existing payment platforms such as Visa or PayPal that are more private than most exciting (non-Cryptonote) cryptocurrencies.

My first post, but I simply had to reply to this.  I just saw this post about airdrops for ICO investors yesterday and got pretty angry because i didn't see this comming. As an investor and buying up GRFT on different exchanges, I'm a very concerned, no let me correct - I'm 100% sure that GRFT price will drop dramatically after that airdrop as a lot of ICO holders deffently will dump GRFT on exchanges to get some of their money back.  A lot of the GRFT I bought was at 0.00000600 and above I bought it before you announced this airdrop just after I read about the project which sounded promising at that time, at the moment GRFT is worth 0.00000207 I know Crypto is a risky buisness but you are not making it easyer by comming up with these ideas.  I'm not sure what to do, take a very big hit and get out while GRFT is worth just a little bit, or HODL. I think I'll sell Can I or anybody trust the team in the future or will there be another GRFT dump to compensate others or maybe the team, just to undermine the future price of GRFT  This project started up great, but I think you guys unfortunately just shoot yourself in the food, and took a couple of my toes at the same time. Does any body feel the same ?  /Griffelinos",False

They did the following calculation in the announcement:  Example 3 : November 10-18 GRFT price avg 0.0000131 BTC (and the price hasn’t crossed 0.0000262 BTC before then), each ICO purchase of 1 GRFT will receive ONE additional GRFT via airdrop.  Now if we do the following calculations with todays value: About 6M USD was invested in ICO ~ 22M Graft coins. If the price halves as they said here, they will airdrop 22M coins. Now here is the problem. The price today is only 0.00000205. That is 12x that amount in coins. Which means an airdrop of 264M coins not 22M or 50M!. Now if the price goes down to around 120 satoshi, you can double that amount one more time to ~500M Graft. (480M) The price of 120 sat is not coincidental. This is what the price dropped to shortly after the release of the coin on tradeogre but before the pumps that happened.  So now the project has three options:  1. Wait and hope that the coin price will rise and the Airdrop will not happen. This is however a not likely scenario. The project laks fundamental marketing strategy and the coin is virtually not known anywhere.  2. Buy up a shitload of coins to get the price up. This could very well happen, but here is the problem. Doing so is intentional market manipulation, if it ever were to get out shit would go down and i not only talking about the price of the coin.  3. Cancel the planned Airdrop. (Not likely)  Now the airdrop itself is the worst idea yet. Imagine if Facebook, after the IPO and after the stock went down, stated that they would reimburse with new stocks cause the market said it wasn't worth the price they were asking....that is just not how these things works. Also as an ICO investor you take a risk, you agree that you will invest in the project or company for profit or for ideology. This could get you filthy rich or you could loose everything, however this is a risk that you were willing to take. Basically GRAFT is screwing over the community with this move.  And yes i know you as an ICO investor would really like to have your investment back and safe, but think about it. If 500M Graft were released to the market at one go, what would you think would happen with the value? Current Sell orders at tradeogre are around 6M Graft and increasing, now imagine if that was 22x the amount or 200x the amount, Because yes, someone will hold, but some will also see this a great possibility to recoup their risks and investments.  And here is the sad part. I Actually think that GRAFT has some great ideas and a great product. The Veriphone partnership and the the payment systems are one of the leading things i have ever seen in the crypto community and way ahead of other projects that are out there. We were even thinking of implementing GRAFT in our own products. But with this, we see that there really is no strategy behind the decisions being taken, and its sad. If the airdrop happens and the SEC gets word of if, this coin value will plummet faster than a stone in water. And then we are talking risks.  As an investor You know what i would do if i invested a large sum in graft? I would hold it, just up to November 8, then just starting to dump it all. The Graft project has basically give you all a free golden ticket here. Lets say i invested  250K graft. I hold it to just before the airdrop average date and dump it all. Maybe i'll make up about 5% of my initial investment, and the price goes further down.  But here comes the kicker: No matter how low the prices goes i will still recoup my investment. Of the 250K i invested Graft will kindly give me the remaining 95% that i ""lost"" on the value decrease.  How kind of them   And ofc i'll sell that amount as fast as i can to recoup even more, knowing that most of othe other investors will do the same and push the price further down. Now when the market quiets down again i can go in and get tonnes of coins at a ultra low price, if the project even lives that long (as i don't think will happen).  I didn't invest in the ICO and i don't regret it. However i did buy up a good chunk of graft which now is sold. Now i'm just waiting for the airdrop date",False

In this video I give an overview of the Graft supernode and explain how it enables instant real-time authorizations of cryptocurrency payments within the Graft network. The Graft supernode is the most important part of the Graft project because it enables may different important functionalities. Graft is decentralized which means anyone can own a Graft supernode. All that is required is a powerful server and a stake or collateral balance in the wallet associated with the supernode. Supernode stake ranges from 50,000 Graft all the way to 250,000 Graft. Graft also offers delegated staking which allows people to combine balances in order to run a supernode. There are two different types of supernodes on Graft's network. They are called the full supernode, which process real-time authorizations and hosts service brokers, and a proxy supernode, which provides higher price for network users and provides offline transactions approvals for merchants. Proxy supernodes are also used to relay transactions between wallets and the authorizations sample, which is a group of 8 supernode that authorize and validate transactions. The Graft blockchain is comprised of two layers. The first layer works similar to how other single layer blockchains work and the 2nd layer is",False

The only thing that needs to happen is ... well ... its happening already. I will not eat my most prized organ on national television like John McAfee, but I will say this;   Out of all the projects I've witnessed through the years, and some even officially participated in - this is the one that truly nails it IMHO - in terms of philosophy, tech implementation, team credentials and competence, market strategy and (finger's crossed) delivery.   True decentralization, even at the FIAT level (jurisdiction dependent, but hey, its FIAT...)   RTA is kick-ass, and Verifone + Ingenico a fast track to mass adoption. But still, that scenario is still a few good years away from true expression.   The way they are edifying the DEX and reward system - holy smokes batman!

The community is a liquidity provider and sole beneficiary. Incentivized  Supernodes to power the 2nd layer without the BS.   The barrier of entry in terms of tech knowledge is completely eliminated natively. The DEX can perfectly serve as a personal bank to anyone holding a smartphone - no need for anything else.

Just to know: did you invested in the ICO? Just to understand why you are so angry (people will call that ""FUD""...).

Earlier in the year, there were concerns about their net losses/ debt, however, in April it was announced that a private equity firm(Francisco Partners ) would acquire Veirfione for a total of 3.4 billion including debt. So the risk of them going bankrupt anytime soon is close to ZERO.  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/09/verifone-acquisition-announced-shares-surge.html  There are some comments on Reddit about a Verifone bankruptcy, these are clearly from someone who has no idea what they're talking about and was also unaware of the recent acquisition. It's a bit of a joke when you examine some of the posts- One of them even suggested that a struggling Verifone must be thankful for the Graft partnership like Graft was going to save them!  Posts on Reddit were probably moderated for good reason, because, they were total nonsense.  I would not describe 1 million graft being sold as a ""big dump"" when the mining emission per day is close to 1 million and the circulating supply over 300 million. I don't see how it's interesting either when the rumor of Verifone bankruptcy turned out to false( Verifone was acquired by a private equity firm)  and it was also a rumor that was started many months ago. Someone was just clutching at straws trying to justify a recent short-term price movement, bringing the rumor back up, unaware of the acquisition. People always try and rationalize short-term price movements, when often there is no rationale behind them. People are irrational by nature and buy/sell for their own personal reasons.  It should also be noted that Verifone is not Graft's only option. There are various integration options like Incognito( which Graft is currently working on) and Poynt.  There is also a whole industry built around merchant payment solutions, so there are multi avenues to pursue here. Even a private developer could decide to integrate the Graft POS app into generic Andriod based hardware terminals and sell them as a simple turnkey solution with similar functionality to the likes of Pundix- Anyone in the community could do this.  Remember that the Graft POS app with RTA will function on most Android devices- Using a traditional POS terminal( eg a Verifone terminal) is not a requirement, it's just an option.  Example of a generic android POS terminal: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/ZKC-PC901-Android-pos-terminal-with-free-SDK-support-3G-WIFI-Bluetooth-NFC-and-RFID-reader/32860910446.html?spm=2114.search0104.3.144.75cc2f22roW4Kp&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_3_10152_10151_10065_10344_10068_5722815_10342_10547_10343_10340_5722915_10548_10341_5722615_10696_10084_10083_10618_10307_5722715_10059_306_100031_10103_10624_10623_10622_5722515_10621_10620,searchweb201603_6,ppcSwitch_5&algo_expid=c200a489-0c17-4912-bba1-4ce1a41ed0e9-23&algo_pvid=c200a489-0c17-4912-bba1-4ce1a41ed0e9&priceBeautifyAB=0       ",False

Its basicly making it look like they have to choose between miners and and ICO Investors instead of allowing them to choose both.  ICO Investor spends 500 usd gets 1500 graft You say you got 50k In earlier posts from mining for 6 months spending about 3 grand in electricty. If you spent that on graft during ICO you would have 9k graft. I have no doubt you would be on the opposite side complaining.   If the ICO Investors had outright bought 50k graft they would have to have spent 50,000totalgraft/1500graftpurchase = (33.33purchasesx500usd) for a total of 16,667 usd  16,667 usd where you only spent 3k in electricty to mine 50k.  Now under normal circumstances I would say this was a risk to investors they chose to take. However, ASICS hit at the same time Tradeogre NINJA LAUNCHED which means that  the ICO price of around 30 cents fell to 3 cents Literally off just a handful of trades!  This made the 500 usd of 1500 graft worth about  1500x0.03cents= 45 dollars....  So where you spend 500 dollars in one month and recieved probably the bulk of your 50k  at  least 1/6 of it..    those that spent 500 usd now have 45 dollars.... worht of graft...   So yes I see nothing wrong airdropping it back up to 500 USD from 45 USD worth of graft because they bought 500 USD worth of graft and the next day it was 45 usd.  Couple that with this.. what if they would have sold at ICO 3 cents to begin with  then 500 USD would have been provided the same amount of graft they have determined they will airdrop to bring up to ICO price anyway.  If they would have sold 500 usd at 3 cents each they would have recieved  16,666 graft instead of 1500 graft.  and we wouldnt be having this conversation right now!  Now lets throw those numbers into the network we have now at 20 megahash and a price 0.01518 USD each graft... then with 1 kilo hash the average price of v7 coins is  1. Citadel (Rp. 14924) ($1.07) 2. IntenseCoin (Rp. 14042) ($1.00) 3. Stellite (Rp. 13006) ($0.93) 4. Electrodump (Rp. 12908) ($0.92) 5. Graft (Rp. 12852) ($0.92) 6. MoneroV (Rp. 12670) ($0.91) 7. Monero (Rp. 12558) ($0.90) 8. Elya (Rp. 11298) ($0.81)   Which means graft is well within its price point for the network difficulty at current price. Which means if you were mining graft you didn't lose any money if you chose not to mine something else and continued on graft... as sometimes it was 1.07 other times 80 cents per kilohash per hour.  .  They were not wronged by graft but graft is making up for it. No one wants graft to succeed more then the GRAFT TEAM itself I think. They are hte ones who have the entire project to lose.. as of now you miners are way ahead of the ICO investors.. THE ICO INVESTORS made this project a reality. This team isnt just forking a coin they are making NEW CODE for RTA. Therefore alot of time seems to have been spent toward it.   The Point is that ICO INVESTORS  had 500 usd for 1500 graft for what equated at the time to 45 dollars. Miners could spend 500 in electricity in January and get practically 10x that, if you look at the math.. there fore bringing them from 3 cents to 30 cents.. is what 10x  IF the miners could spend 500 in electricity and get 15,000 graft the first month... why is it fair for the ICO investors to spend 500 and get 1500 Coins.. 3cents to 30 cents    This allows for 500 in electircyt for 15,000 graft the first month to miners Ico investors spend 500 and get 15,000 graft in ICO.  I get your concerns but as of now miners recieved far more graft then ICO investors in electricy costs vs ICO purchase The math adds up.    EVen still this doesnt factor in.... the fact that graft is gonna be closer to ICO price anyway in 3 months. So if they are 25 cents of 30 cents.. they are only gonna get a small amount.  An airdrop is usually free coins. This isnt giving anything past the initial purchase price they paid in usd measured in BTC.  Basicly graft was saying had we known it was 3 cents we would have given 10x as much graft per 500 usd.. which would have made it equal to what the miners spending 500 in electricty made.  I have no doubt  you made at least 15k in the first month of mining out of the 50k you had.",False

Right now my 50000 coins are worth $760 USD and my rig have costed me $8000 that you didn't factor in the initial cost. Now, as a miner I am not getting an airdrop to cover my losses; rather my losses will become bigger as I believe the coin price will go down in value as the airdropped coins hit the exchanges.

You lost around 500 to 228 usd.. ICO lost 500 usd to 22.80 cents....  Thats my point I feel its only fair to bring up the ICO investors from 3 cents to 30 cents brinign there 22.80 cents as close to 228 usd as possible.  Now as a miner the soul purpose is to mine and secure the network and as a reward you get a percentage of the printed coin and transaction fees.  While yes short term dumps are good for paying for electricity. You have made the classic mistake of trying to pay off equipment on a new coin. Im sorry to hear that it doesnt cover the miner payments if you invested in hardware.  You should probably put a  few cards in your rig on something like Monera or something that pays out steadily income to meet your payments.  When mining its best to never expect ROI on new coins monthly. this actually leads to hard dumping from miners.  Things will change. They have said that they wouldnt do airdrop if it hits ICO price for 24 hours.  Basicly keep mining graft keep holding. It will go up 10 x easily in 6  months. all graft has to do is go up 6x and bitcoin 2x and in USD its went up to 30 cents. Now of course its meausred in BTC but the point is that you ROI is paid in USD im sure.   You cant expect as a miner for a new coin like graft to pay for your rigs monthly ROI.

""You have made the classic mistake of trying to pay off equipment on a new coin""     aren't we all taking risks mining or ICO investing?

The issue is the emission curve. Any explanation of the price discrepancy between ICO and market must consider emission curve, and I think the team know that.  Investing in an ICO presents risks, such as the coin being worth less than you paid. The airdrop is suspicious, and I suspect it is self-serving.  Edit: and it's not about the electricity or price of coins..of course some people will get coins cheaper than others. This issue is that the airdrop creates weird market incentives, it was some-what hidden for months, and its appears to be a poor business decision. Why not a coin burn?

Why did we do it? As you might imagine, we’ve never before carried out an ICO, less so an ICO based on a live mineable blockchain. As such, we came up with coin pricing based on what we assessed to be a fair market value (very conservatively at that, comparing to other similar projects). One thing we didn’t know was that the price of the coin would be immediately driven down by ASIC miners, creating a large disparity between the ICO and mining price levels. As project leads we felt compelled to make it right by the ICO participants and to rectify this situation. Terms of the Airdrop The following are the terms of the airdrop: If the price of GRFT doesn’t recover to the ICO level (0.0000262 BTC) prior to November 18, 2018 (9 months from the end of the ICO) for a reasonable period of time (24 hours cumulative, according to CoinMarketCap), GRAFT project team will airdrop the difference in GRFTs to the ICO participants in good standing. The effective price at the time will be determined based on a 10 day moving average.  Example 1 ; October 20 GRFT price is 0.0000262 BTC or higher – no airdrop will take place  Example 2 : October 10-18 GRFT price avg 0.0000262 BTC or higher , no airdrop will take place  Example 3 : November 10-18 GRFT price avg 0.0000131 BTC , each ICO purchase of 1 GRFT will receive ONE additional GRFT via airdrop.  The effect of potential airdrop The actual number of GRFT’s issued for the airdrop will depend on the price difference between the airdrop and the ICO price (in BTC). Currently, we estimate that no more than 50M GRFT’s are at stake. The funds will be provided from the undersold ICO funds, and since all the ICO funds were earmarked for circulation, should not result in an increase of the circulation supply. Conclusion We understand the controversial nature of this offer and value community’s opinions and feedbacks. We try to make decisions that are fair to all our supporters, while carrying on the mission of the project. Your support is highly appreciated and valued. Best Regards,  GRAFT Team",False

As a miner that supported your network with all my rig's hashpower, giving stability and security to your network and contributing to the blockchain record keeping; I honestly feel betrayed to hear that you are planning an airdrop to ""ICO Investors!!??!!"". I started mining your coin from the get go, including when your network was under attack right after the fork, I was bearing over $500 USD per month in electricity charges since January. Now, I could've spent that money to purchase the damn coin and subsequently benefit from a senseless airdrop! There is always a risk when you make an investment of any sort and investors fully understand that including myself who invested in electricity and building minig rigs. If coin ""buyers"" are to benefit from an airdrop, there is nothing fairer than extending the courtesy to miners as well since I have just explained to you the extent of the miner's investment in your project. I truly feel that the remaining ICO coins should be burnt as everyone understands the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. Kindly, rethink your announcement and do not dismiss Miner's input. Without miners you have NOTHING and if your network hashrate drops significantly, not only you will suffer from 51% attacks and the further fragmentation of your blockchain, but you will also loose credibility since your network will not have any support!

The major responsibility the team has is with initial ICO investors. That is how things are.  ICO participants are the ones taking the biggest risk, and price is down like 95% for them.  These are also the guys who can potential scale the project 10x in an instant.    Like I wrote before, and as expressed by others already - it does seem a little unfair for miners. But mining is an open race. If you are mining GRFT to support it at a loss without selling, it's no different from devs & team coding without immediately liquid pay. You do it because you believe in the potential mid/long term.   A sensible miner will mine for profit, and if he so chooses buys GRFT. This creates positive price pressure, and negative on competing algos.    Even if mining at a loss, the -ROI is far far less than initial ICO investors.   Plus, if the team were to airdrop to mined addresses... how to separate the opportunist miner from the truly supportive one?   I have to retract my intital statement. The ICO is where you commit your ideas and plans into action, backed by believers, who do their own due diligence, with zero to show for by the team up-front.   From there on it's open game.",False

I would have to politely disagree, the team has no responsibility towards ICO investor other than what was stated on the white paper. Implying that this is a secure investment doesn't hold any water. Investment and secure are an oxymoron. While it is partially true that the investors have the ability to pump the price, miners are the one keeping the records in a decentralized manner in addition to providing mined coins to the investors. Unless investors are fine buying directly from the dev team's supply of coins and they would also keep the records for those investors! This is the definition of centralized currency    They do have a responsibility, yes. As you say, to implement the whitepaper and show their worth. They are the initial investors.  And I'm am not impying any investor pumps. I am speaking of a healthy valuation of the project as the team delivers on the roadmap.  Quote  Mining is not free by any means and if the team will chose to create a distinction in the coin holders base, miners vs investors, I can almost guarantee you that this project will go nowhere unless you become a centralized coin like xrp where you have no input whatsoever and where the dev team would do what they like with the blockchain. A centralized model crypto has proven to be the least liked in the community.   Of course it is not free. That is my point. Serious network securing infrastructure requires serious monthly opreational costs. It is a business, or should be - even at a hobby level. And these miners you describe, are only interested in immediate resturns. The real value of this coin is not in it's mining potential, but on the real world use of the token.  Quote  Then how to separate people that held the coin after purchasing it from the people that dumped it all at a higher value than the current one?    Easy.  1 - If prices rises above ICO initial price, there is no airdrop - as stated in the official release  2 - If price does not rise above ICO, all addresses holding the initial balance or above, are aligible - this is not a statement, just my ideas on things    ",False

I really would like to see the team answer my concerns so I can act accordingly. After all, we all have to make choices at some point or another and live with the consequences. I am clearly unhappy with the team's decision to limit the airdrop to investors and not extend the courtesy to miners which is not fair since both spent hard earned money in two different manners but towards the same goal. Ultimately what I would like to see happening is burning the remaining ICO coins as every previous ICO did, after all it is the right thing to do. IMHO giving investors more coins to dump will double hurt miners, the price of the coin and the overall stability of the project. Now, can you name any successful coin with a grim or non existent network to support its blockchain? The only driver for investors is seeing progress and an adoption of the proposed real-time transactions technology by businesses. Once that becomes a reality, in addition to listing the coin in a major exchange,  the price will unidirectionally climb and will get investors competing for the coin. Again, all I'm asking is for the team to do the right thing and burn the remaining coins!",False

Although we are close to the finish line, we do not release it yet to public alpha. We need more time for optimization, fine-tuning, and QA testing. One of the main reasons for the delay is an issue with communication. Unlike other two-layer cryptocurrency networks which use a separate mechanism for communication between their second-layer nodes, we reuse the existing peer-to-peer network as a basic transport. Our original algorithm finds the shortest and fastest routes between the supernonodes by maintaining a set of P2P tunnels through the network of cryptonodes. The main difference and greatest benefit of using the same communication base for two layers (both cryptonode and supernode networks) is not exposing the authorization sample’s supernodes – because in our design they are not required to have a public IP. Such design is the major difference and significant improvement comparing to other layer two implementations such as Dash masternodes.  Remember that one of GRAFT’s key differentiators and goals is absolute privacy initially provided by underlying CryptoNote blockchain protocol, which is the first layer of GRAFT platform. The fact that the auth sample supernode does not require a public IP attached to it makes GRAFT even more private and decentralized, because the supernodes are less dependant on regulated hosting providers. Without public IP the supernodes are “hidden” behind the large, distributed, and complex P2P network, which makes them less vulnerable to DDOS attacks. At the same time, the hosting and maintenance are less complicated and less expensive for supernode owners. (Note that wallet/POS proxy supernodes, which typically belong to service providers and large merchants, still require public IP address in order to be able to serve wallets and POS/payment apps).  However, such great benefits do not come for free. Along the way we found several issues in existing CryptoNote/Monero P2P communication implementation, which we are fixing in order to make it more efficient, stable, and suitable transport for our purposes. With that said, we anticipate the public alpha of supernode with RTA to be released by the end of July. Meanwhile, we will start a private alpha release for testing in a coupe of weeks, so if you are interested in helping us with preliminary testing please contact us at dev@graft.network.  While working hard on RTA implementation and getting ready to its production launch, we realized that hosting a supernode, either full (authorization) or proxy/gateway, requires a special DevOps skill set, so we are working through making arrangements and building relationships to provide turnkey solutions to supernode owners and merchant service providers.  Payment Apps  We are continuously working on improving the Verifone terminal app so it will be fully polished for production by the time RTA is released. As Verifone have written on their merchant marketplace website, where GRAFT app is listed as the Featured Apps Partner, “Our app partners are working around the clock to help empower our merchants with applications that enrich the customer experience and provide business productivity.” This is absolutely true statement, there is not much to add. Since the Verifone certification was achieved last month, we have done several improvements such as UI redesign (in both terminal app and our wallet), enhanced configuration utility for merchants, integration with CoinMarketCap for real-time exchange rates, and some bug fixes. Also, we are working on Ingenico terminal app integration into their marketplace.  One of important and promising features we are planning to develop is using NFC (Near Field Communication) for initial engagement between the mobile wallet and terminal app, so instead of scanning QR code displayed on payment terminal the buyer will just wave the phone (the same technology is used by contactless payment cards and Apple Pay). Implementation of such a feature will help improve both buyer and merchant user experiences and reduce the overall transaction time. We will keep you posted about our progress in this area.  We just finished design and now are ready to start implementation of the payment gateway which will facilitate GRAFT payments on online shopping platforms. Once implemented, integration with GRAFT payment gateway, among other features, will bring to online merchants and buyers a unique combination of absolute privacy and instant transaction confirmations (using RTA) – something they have never seen before. Plus, after we finish RTA and move to accept broker implementation, they will be able to accept various cryptocurrencies, while keeping the same benefits of privacy and transaction speed.  Wallet Apps  We finally redesigned the app downloads page on our website, so now it’s easier to find all our apps, including wallets, and their releases for various mobile and desktop operating systems: iOS, Android, Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. In recent wallet releases, we fixed some bugs and added new configuration options. The upcoming wallet release will support purchases with real time authorizations using full supernodes (currently it supports a limited version of RTA on testnet only).  CryptoFind App  As our app for discovering and listing crypto-friendly merchants is gaining more popularity among crypto enthusiasts, we periodically release new features and bug fixes. In recent CryptoFind version, in addition to bug fixes, we added a possibility to take a picture of the GRAFT sticker on the merchant’s window so the users can earn better bonuses.

I understand there are plans for an airdrop, to reassure ICO contributers financially due to the price drop.  This will come from the unsold ICO pool.     https://www.reddit.com/r/Graft/comments/84exvw/the_graft_team_standing_behind_their_product/   - What about the miners who do HODL? they contributed to security, efficiency and electricity. Work & money  - What about those who got burried in the sea of ICO and missed the chance, yet have been firmly filling in the order book despite a unidirectional downwards slope? - What about speculative ICO investors, who cashed out and moved on - do they deserve an airdrop?   Please rethink this. IMHO, your attitude is awesome, but I truly think you need to be fairer and distribute to the entire network, regardless of who they are.

The airdrop will occur in December if the exchange price has not reached the ICO price at any time before then. The airdrop amount will only be enough to make up the difference between the ICO price and the exchange price in December. If the airdrop is necessary, it will consist of unsold ICO coins. There were only about 22,000,000 coins sold in the ICO. The price of GRFT is expected to reach the ICO price by December or at least be close enough to make this a non-issue. There are significant milestones and new exchange listings coming before then.  4) current emission is over 1 million per day. That’s normal. You can look at the emission curve on the front page of this thread.  5) there are updates every time that there is something to update.

But as I said I didn't heard something like this before. I am sure that there are some frustrated people after the ICO because the price performed very bad. But that is something ever ICO investors should be aware off upon investing. There is no such thing as guaranteed profit.

Spent amount `1000` was written off your wallet balance, it is not an income.  About `1400`. Assume you had incomes to your wallet of 2400 + 5600, in total 8000. When tx constructed one or several outputs are used, in your case was used output of 2400, 1000 went to another wallet, and 1400 went back to your wallet as a change.

Requires merchants to buy their special POS terminals. Requires merchants to buy PXS/NPXS tokens for fees. White paper does not mention what the fees are for merchants (which means that they are most likely as high or higher than Visa, Mastercard, etc fees). Requires users/customers to pay crypto transaction fees as well. Collects ""credit rating data"" on all users to use (sell?) as the Pundi X company wishes.  Merchants have no incentive to adopt this. It will likely cost them more than just accepting traditional credit card purchases. They will also need to have a regular POS terminal and a Pundi X POS terminal in their store. This system will only appeal to merchants who are crypto enthusiasts or who are willing to spend the extra money to attract crypto enthusiasts to their stores.  GRAFT: Decentralized. Open-source. Integrates with existing POS terminals. Merchants dont need to buy anything. The merchant pays a minuscule fee in comparison to Visa and other options, and the fee is in the whitepaper for all to see. Users/customers do not pay a transaction fee. Private blockchain and no data collection.  Merchants have an incentive to use GRAFT. They will save a lot of money on fees and they will also attract users who prefer to use crypto. Merchants wont need to buy an extra terminal. Their existing terminal can still be used for regular credit/debit cards and crypto.  Adoption Potential:  Pundi X plans to have 100,000 of their POS terminals deployed in the next 3 years.  GRAFT software is already certified by Verifone for use in their terminals. Verifone has over 26 million terminals across 150 countries. When GRAFT POS capability is ready in the next month or two (via supernodes) then GRAFT will already be deployable in millions of terminals worldwide. Thats just the start. Ingenico terminals are up next for certification. Ingenico has 30 million terminals across 170 countries.",False

Of them all, Hashvault has the highest hash rate at around 3M/hs, the rest of them are ALL BELOW 1M/hs. . . So where is the hashrate coming from ? I do not see solo miners mining at +-10M/hs to be very honest, because then you would have a serious problem in that your network is owned by a handfull of miners. So what is the story then ? Are you guys mining yourselves or what would the reason be for this ?

That doesn't necessarily mean that it is one or two miners. There are likely many large miners who have been drawn to this project recently since the network has been stable. It is often the most profitable cryptonight coin to mine and it also has the most potential for growth with the market cap being bottomed out for a while. The high ""hidden"" hashrate didnt appear all at once, so I doubt that it is just a ""handfull of miners"". Much of the network hashrate was from private pools even when the network was at 8 MH/s. It has grown faster since the news of Verifone POS terminal certification, which also seems to have been the catalyst for the price increase. It didn't take very much BTC to buy up half of the orderbook on Tradeogre and drive the price up. That is just a result of low liquidity. Im not really sure what your suspicion is, but the higher network hashrate is good for the network and it has no correlation at all with a price increase.",False

Y’all are busy people, so let’s not waste any time and get right to the point. Payment Apps  Let’s start from really good news – our Merchant Marketplace app just received certification from Verifone – big step towards GRAFT acceptance by brick-and-mortar merchants and a product of 6 months long development cycle in close communication with Verifone. We are working on improving this application as well as building apps for other major players in the area of hardware payment terminals such as Ingenico.  Also, we just started designing the online shopping cart integrations – the first implementation is going to be an integration with Shopify, one of the most popular online store platforms. While it’s not within GRAFT’s charter to produce all the integrations, we take it upon ourselves to provide reference integrations with few leading platforms, paving the way for the independent software developers to take GRAFT to all other platforms.  Blockchain  It’s not a big secret that GRAFT has been forked from Monero – in order to be able to reuse the best (as of today) implementation of Cryptonote protocol, which is the most secure blockchain protocol so far, at least for people who care about their privacy. The idea was (and still is!) to take the open source Cryptonote technology and use it as a tier-1 foundation of the future 2-tier application platform, when the 2nd tier consists of the network of full supernodes (please read the white paper for more details). So the GRAFT dev team was supposed to be mostly focused on design and implementation of the tier 2 from the beginning. Unfortunately, sometimes our plans diverge reality in unpredictable ways, and we admit that it was naive assumption. Instead of working on core development tasks, significant part of the team had to address several problems caused by network difficulty and timestamp manipulation attacks. As a result, we switched to more efficient difficulty adjustment algorithm, which is already used by a few other blockchains, and even managed to improve it. We also followed the majority of Cryptonote community and implemented ASIC-resistant code.  We appreciate a concrete help we receive from the community, including individual contributors zawy12 and jagerman – thank you guys! It’s also worth mentioning that our full time core dev team has been growing as well – we have added two senior core developers and project/product manager.  We are working on another potential modification – Cryptonote Heavy hash algorithm. Although the code change is ready, we are still testing, and haven’t made a final decision when (if at all) to switch to Heavy. We continue monitoring the situation in order to find the best time for changes that require major network update.  Real Time Authorizations (RTA)  Our top-most development priority right now is RTA and we’ve been hard at work doing the R&D and laying the foundation to meet our delivery timeframes. For those of you who are interested in details, here is the “10,000 foot view” of RTA – simplistic, optimistic sequence diagram of the RTA flow: Note that every line of text in this diagram correspondents to hundreds or even thousands of lines of the source code, so this diagram just demonstrates interactions between the main players, without going deeply into the details such as auth sample selection, fee distribution, message broadcasting, etc. We are working on various modules of the RTA so we could compile the full picture: supernode-ng server framework, porting DAPI/business logic into a new framework, and authorization sample communication, which includes both super-fast UDP-based direct communication protocol (for “urgent” messages) and “unhurried” protocol (for regular message transmissions) based on existing P2P implementation.  CryptoFind  Although CryptoFind was not designed to be the core product, its popularity recently skyrocketed, and so now we cannot imagine GRAFT without CryptoFind, which becomes the most comprehensive worldwide database of businesses that accept crypto. We have implemented some new features and improvements in CryptoFind since the last update: added a text search function, which allows you to find nearby points by name or type (cafe, store, refueling, etc.), enhanced the user interface, and created statistics page.  Network Monitoring  Also we are internally monitoring multiple parameters of GRAFT servers using special tools such as CloudWatch and Nagios, we thought that the community should be able to know about the basic status (“up/down”) in real time as well, without the need to ask and repeat the same questions on forums. So we have created a simple public network status monitoring page – don’t forget to check it out!  Happy Grafting!",False

The integration app is running on the RTA Testnet, so not yet compatible with the Mainnet (pending Full supernode release) and some of the configuration options are pending Verifone platfofrm updates, however the merchants and other eco-system participants can start testing things out, in preparation for the Mainnet launch.

They've been working on timestamp manipulation prevention and improved difficulty adjustment algorithm which rolled out in the recent network update. They have also recently announced that they are ""evaluating potentially switching to CN Heavy or a custom algo to further stave off the attacks"". That requires time and testing. They've been simultaneously working on supernodes which is no small task, and they have been working on a redesign of the Cryptofind app with added features.     There is much work to be done in this project. The main net has been live for less than 4 months. There will be bugs and issues this early in the project, and there will not be announcements that the team is working to fix them. Just know that they are always working. Be patient for the announcements to come when the work on any given task is completed.     Price should be completely ignored at this point. GRFT is not on any decent exchanges and was not planned to be listed on Tradeogre. High volume exchanges will not list a new coin until they know that the network is resilient against attacks. As mentioned above, the GRAFT team has been working toward that end. The blockchain is being made more secure, the network hashrate will increase as more miners inevitably come, and real exchange listings will become an option after the GRAFT network has proven itself for a stretch of time.

This update is intended to mitigate recent attacks on GRAFT blockchain and improve the stability of the block intervals. There are two major changes included in this release: timestamp manipulation prevention and improved difficulty adjustment algorithm. The major network update will be triggered at block 68000. The block timestamp manipulation allows a miner with significant hashrate power to generate an alternative chain of several blocks and add it to the main chain. The corresponding code fix will disable this possibility.  The original LWMA-based difficulty adjustment algorithm used the same adjustment rate to increase and decrease difficulty. As the result, it was taking significant time to restore after a peak, leaving users suffering from a higher difficulty. In our novel approach, we introduce an adaptive adjustment rate, making return to a normal difficulty level faster. The mechanism detects a failing edge of the difficulty curve and change the rate accordingly, using the following formula:  The major network update is scheduled for block height 68000. Each GRAFT network node must be updated to the new software version before that block, otherwise, the node that wasn’t updated is going to be on the wrong version of the blockchain. Major network update means that if you are running the GRAFT network node (graftnoded daemon), you must upgrade it to the current software release as soon as possible. If you do not install the updated node before the block 68000, your node will be blocked by other nodes. Note that the users of GRAFT mobile and desktop wallets (GUI wallets) are not affected by the upcoming network update and don’t need to do anything – as long as they are still connected to the default proxy supernodes (if you are connected to your own supernode, however, do not forget to upgrade the underlying network node).  The source code of the version 1.2.1 is now released and available for download from master. In order to check whether you are running the right version of GRAFT network node, launch graftnoded daemon in terminal window (in interactive mode) and type help command. If you are running the right version you should see Graft ‘Beta Lyrae’ (v1.2.1-release) in the first line of the help result.",False

[/quote]   Like this ? https://www.graft.network/paymentterminals/verifone/ [/quote]  This is a good step and as a small business owner, it's not only feasible, but natural to use this option in an area where crypt o investments are dime a dozen, however im also thinking on a scale that appeals to franchising, which normally has POS machines that operate on a very settled basis on an endogenous program. How could this technology be included as a payment option for say a subway franchise? there are franchise businesses that cover several chains and dozens of locations in certain districts and the included option for crypt o payments should be simple and easy to book revenue. Another concern is the stability (and marginal gain) for keeping an asset in Graft tokens. IF I were to provide employees of my business with sample of tokens in order to give them a share of our value, I would need to know that the asset that I'm using as a security for my employees is not only fungible, but worthwhile to consider as an investment. I would proudly consider accepting crypt o payments given the vitality of this project as not only a user friendly experience, but also a practical means of transaction and economic business.",False

The source code of the patch version 1.1.2 is now released and available for download from master. The binaries of the new release are located here: https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/graftbuilds/graft-1.1.2-20180417-release.tar.gz. The major network update itself is rescheduled for block height 64445. Each GRAFT network node must be updated to the new software version before that block/date, otherwise, the node that wasn’t updated is going to be on the wrong version of the blockchain. This release contains the ASIC-resistance changes in the hashing algorithm and enhanced difficulty adjustment algorithm, which are supposed to protect GRAFT blockchain from most hashing attacks and stabilize the block intervals.  As another reminder, major network update means that if you are running the GRAFT network node (graftnoded daemon), you must upgrade it to the current software release as soon as possible. If you do not install the updated node before the block 64445, it will be disconnected from the mainnet after block 64445.  In order to check whether you are running the right version of GRAFT software, launch graftnoded daemon in terminal window (in interactive mode) and type help command. If you are running the right version you should see Graft ‘Beta Lyrae’ (v1.1.2-release) in the first line of the help result.  Note that the users of mobile and desktop wallets are not affected by the upcoming network update and don’t need to do anything – as long as they are still connected to the default proxy supernodes (if you are connected to your own supernode, however, do not forget to upgrade the underlying network node).",False

Patch version 1.1.1 is now released and available for download from master. The major network update itself is rescheduled for block height 65110, around April 14th. Each GRAFT network node must be updated to the new software version before that block/date, otherwise, the node that wasn’t updated is going to be on the wrong version of the blockchain. This release contains the ASIC-resistance changes in the hashing algorithm and enhanced difficulty adjustment algorithm, which are supposed to protect GRAFT blockchain from most hashing attacks and stabilize the block intervals.  As another reminder, major network update means that if you are running the GRAFT network node (graftnoded daemon), you must upgrade it to the current software release between now and April 14th. If you do not install the updated node before April 14th, it will be disconnected from the mainnet after block 65110.  In order to check whether you are running the right version of GRAFT software, launch graftnoded daemon in terminal window (in interactive mode) and type help command. If you are running the right version you should see Graft ‘Beta Lyrae’ (v1.1.1-release) in the first line of the help result.  Note that the users of mobile and desktop wallets are not affected by the upcoming network update and don’t need to do anything – as long as they are still connected to the default proxy supernodes (if you are connected to your own supernode, however, do not forget to upgrade the underlying network node).   https://www.graft.network/2018/04/12/patch-1-1-1-released-major-network-update-block-65110/",False

If you do not install the updated node before April 17th, it will be disconnected from the mainnet after block 67850. In order to check whether you are running the right version of GRAFT software, launch graftnoded daemon in terminal window (in interactive mode) and type help command. If you are running the right version you should see Graft ‘Beta Lyrae’ (v1.1.0-29ae686) in the first line of the help result. Note that the users of mobile and desktop GRAFT wallets apps are not affected by the upcoming network update and don’t need to do anything – as long as they are still connected to the default proxy supernodes (if you are connected to your own supernode, however, do not forget to upgrade the underlying network node).  And finally, we would like to thank everyone from GRAFT community who contributed to the first major GRAFT network update by providing their feedback! We appreciate your support! We look forward to working together on our next major milestone – alpha and beta releases of RTA (real-time authorization) functionality of full supernodes. Stay tuned!  https://www.graft.network/2018/04/10/graft-1-1-0-beta-lyrae-released/",False

They also don't want to go forking out big $ to prematurely list on a top-tier exchange when the core development side is not handled yet.    Stocks.Exchange isn't a great listing, it's more of a short term fix. However, there is a negligible listing cost and it's a step up from TradeOgre( Total Exchange volume is larger, spreads are tighter).  It's also better than just having Graft listed on single( questionable) exchange.  Graft is an innovative project and is very much under the radar at the moment. This is largely because has been zero hype from the team- They are all about development and creating a real product/ solution. They also struggle to articulate what they are actually trying to implement.    Graft is essentially creating new payment gateway at POS( point of sale), that has the option to, but does not require the use of a traditional CC gateway/ processor, or the use of a debit/ credit card( It can all be done in real time via APPs).  It's also quite different from other Cryptonote/ Cryptonight forks, or Payment solutions( Tenx/ litepay etc). Graft is implementing a decoupled PoW/ PoS, with supernodes that profit from real-time authorization( transactions at POS)- This is a large/ challenging development task.  They are integrating their own decentralized payment network/ ecosystem into a traditional POS terminal app for the likes of Verifone & Incognito merchant terminals. In doing so they have the option to bypass the traditional CC gateway and use their own API(DAPI) to process transactions via(RTA) through the Graft network/ ecosystem.

Currently, we are conducting regression tests. The ASIC resistance code in conjunction with the new difficulty algorithm is supposed to minimize the possibility of hashrate attacks – when significant hashrate power (generated by ASIC or large GPU miner) is connected for relatively short period of time and making it difficult for other miners to compete and solve the blocks, until the existing algorithm adopts to a new hashrate and adjusts the network difficulty. This is how the existing algorithm reacts to sudden hashrate spikes in the mainnet:   The following graph shows how the updated algorithm adjusts the difficulty much better after the simulated hashrate attacks:    Although we think the upcoming network update will be sufficient to protect the blockchain from the majority of hashrate attacks, we are also working on original, even more enhanced version of the difficulty adjustment algorithm, which is supposed to provide even better, more “symmetrical” and balanced response to any hashrate fluctuations. Since such enhancements require significant testing, which is very time consuming, we are planning to include it in the next network update (the one after the upcoming update on April 6th), along with the merge of recent Monero changes. As usual, we will follow up with more details soon. Stay tuned!",False

Initially, at the moment of GRAFT blockchain launch on January 16th, 2018, two pools were supposed to ensure better decentralization and stability of the new blockchain; however, rapid growth of GRAFT popularity and mining community made this issue irrelevant shortly after the launch. Now Graft team is seeking a better distribution of the hashrate load, and as the network grows bigger, we are decommissioning one pool to allow operators of independant pools to gain a bigger market share. The URL of the consolidated pool is going to be grftpool.com. Users of both current pools will be automatically redirected from the old urls. Miners connected to the “EU pool” will not be affected. Miners connected to the “US pool”, which is going to be shut down, will be receiving their payouts in full after the mining on the US pool is turned off. The switch will take place on April 1st. We recommend all miners currently connected to us.pool.graft.network to switch to eu.pool.graft.network as soon as possible in order to avoid any unexpected issues. Happy mining!",False

I follow the Electroneum project and the team is great with often updates through emails and tweets. They're probably active on other social channels too, but I'm just not following these channels.

What other recent Cryptonight launch has done that? Most coins have been distributed now, so less people are complaining, progress has been made( but you wouldn't' know any of that because you're just a casual observer throwing stones).  The team on any coin could have potentially premined any amount( along with anyone else)- At least if that is the case then it's unlikely they're going to dump everything on the market at once.  Other recent forks have been way more shady than Graft, look at IPBC,  when their main net went live the reward was 10x greater than what it should have been, due to a ""mistake in the code"". Other forks have launched off the back of forum posts, and now have market caps in the millions, with no product or solution.  Look at Masari, it doesn't' even have a whitepaper!  Saying that ETN or ITNS has utility is clutching at straws lol. They're both good examples of pump in dumps, where early miners made 10-20x.   You are 100% wrong re the pools fees/ network hash.  Go to the official Graft mining telegram group and search for "" official pool fee"". You will see various messages from frustrated pool owners like ""Mojo"" & ""nu-coin.com"" complaining about the 0.1% fee hurting their pools, because, they didn't want to drop their own fees that low. So it was requested for the official pool to go to 0.5% or 1%.  Miners in general were also complaining, because, at one point the official EU pool had the majority of network hash, there was lots of debate over it.  People like me were Nicehashing on the Official pools.  So again your comments about the official pools never having the majority hash rate are wrong as well.  You are wrong on quite a few things.  Are you even in any of the telegram groups? Please let me know your user name so I can check out your posts.",False

This reminds of politicians being prosecuted for corruption defending themselves by pointing out that other politicians are more corrupt. Congratulations. - The POW algo used somehow is a metric for the success of an ICO. - Raising 6mil somehow is a metric for credibility. - ETN had dumps when it hit exchanges but Graft will stay solid. Good luck. - ETN and ITNS have no utility. Look up the definition of utility (if you value track record of actual successful companies, lookup the track record of the ETN leader). - Me posting in their telegram somehow has something to do the success/shadyness of the coin (also, why would i give my telegram nick?)  You have some quite skewed (to be polite) metrics for ""success"", and I wish you the best of luck. I'm not going to join you in name calling, sorry. However, supporting an ICO that runs along mainnet and is intentionally priced 10-20x than mining will not bring you an army of cheerleaders.  I did follow Graft during the ICO, mainly to warn people to stay away from the ICO and prevent them from being scammed.  It must be incredibly reassuring for the ICO buyers at least to see a stranger doing the team's bidding here.  p.s. As I said, the pool matter is a negligible aspect compared to the other aspects, but feel free to pick on it. There always have been pools with <1% fees, as low as 0.1%, just like right now. If the official pool ever had 50%+ hashrate then it could not have been for a long time.",False

Both mining and ICO at the same time only make sense if you have hidden interests, really, then it makes a lot of sense. When you still open mainnet for mining and launch an ICO at the same time, and price the ICO literally more than 10x the price of renting hashpower to mine the same amount of coins, then either (1) you don't know what you're doing or (2) you are a scammer. Good luck investing in either of those two options.  22 mil is around $6m and I feel sorry for anyone who actually spent crypto to buy in the ICO. The amount of coins sold in the ICO is unverifiable though. There seem to be quite a few folks complaining about not receiving their ICO coins. But I wouldn't worry about those ... the team could have itself mined a lot and sold for more than 10x profit. Most of the hashrate has come from solo mining.  Graft is unique among Monero forks? Maybe unique in shadyness. Electroneum and IntenseCoin both offer utility.  What do you mean 27% reserve makes sense? You must be kidding. They already take 8% + 4% for PR! How many projects do you know that take 4+8+27% ... that's almost 40%, Jesus Christ.  Anyone claiming they signed up 140+40 (one hundred and eighty) commercial entities and gives no examples, let alone verifiable ones, should be an alarm.  Sorry, but the pool fee change (a minor aspect compared to the rest) is as shady as everything else about this coin: - it wasn't the only pool wits <1% fee - i never saw the ""community"" complaining about the low fee (link please) - a team of professionals should have thought of those arguments before launching a pool claiming they will keep a low fee. Once again, that is either (1) stupid or (2) a classic bait-and-switch. - there was no risk of consolidation as their pool was buggy at first then never had more than 10-15% of the entire hashrate. Most hashrate came from solo mining anyway (talk about consolidation).",False

In the case of GRFT, there's a roadmap, a detailed whitepaper, the team is listed along with the linkedin profiles, it uses a GPU/CPU friendly aglo so everyone can participate in mining it and it has supernodes to secure the network.  To me Graft offers something that is maybe not unique, but certainly different from ETN which focuses heavily on mobile payment.

From my understanding the Graft project requires a large decentralized network. Graft is never going to take off with 5-10 M/hs of network hash. It needs the kind of Network support that ETN gets. That's why the mining incentives are so high. Regardless of the ICO pricing, over 22 million were sold, so somewhere in the vicinity of 5 million USD. It's hardly unsuccessful when you consider that most of the new Cryotonight coins had no ICO( because they would have barely been able to scrape together anything). They also offer no real product or solution, just a forked Monero chain that offers nothing Monero doesn't. At least Graft is unique here. The 27% in reserves does need to be cleared up, however, the logical reason for this is that the project is very ambitious(Far more than people realize) and if it is to succeed then it's going to require more funding further down the track. Keeping an amount in reserves mean they can raise more capital when the price is far more established. It's not some kind of ""scam"", it's just they're planning now for a successful future I'm not sure why the ICO is priced in BTC, but hardcap in USD. Needs to be cleared up They could very well have signed up that many merchants and partners. All are probably small time. This too needs to be cleared up. The pool fee changed from 0.01% to 1% because the mining community were complaining that only charging a 0.01% was encouraging centralization( going against their decentralized model) because too many were mining on the official pools instead of spreading hash across all private pools, where fees were generally higher( 1-2%).  It had nothing to do with the Graft team trying to profit.",False

Today network is around 47MH/s, and diff around 5.7 billions. So, Graft today is close to another mining coins profitability. Miners will not sell it for extra cheap. There was a lot private transactions on social networks, and people are paying for Grafts. With this strategy developers attract a lot of miners and show that they believe in their project.  If You remember Electroneum (ETN), it was the real mining hysteria when mining starts. During the first night of mining, it was also an extra profitable mining, but after 10 days it becomes close to another coins. There were also a lot of haters who told that the miners get the extra cheap ETNs, that the price will drop etc. When the coin reach the exchange ICO buyers will have 6x profit on their investment (today 8.5x)!!! Despite of blocked wallets for ICO buyers etc...and ETN still have a big mining community.  Is ICO succesful or not, it is hard to say, but this project have a real potential as a payment processor for microtransactions. With Graft ecosystem it will be sustainable to by even a single chewing gum  with crypto or card. This project can make a real help to adopt the crypto in real retail payments.  I hope that developers collect enough resources  in this ICO to make this project live and prosper.  Maybe, there were some mistakes in communications with investors, but I believe in final result.

Still hugely overpriced despite higher diff.  Opening mining during ICO was the first sign that it's a scam, then pricing the ICO at 10x the price via mining (why would anyone buy in the ICO instead of renting hashpower?) kind of sealed it.

In fact, 22 mil is already too much. - a hell of a lot of coins go to the team in some form (4+8+27% reserves - seriously?) - mentions ICO cap in USD, but ICO priced in BTC. - a long series of unverifiable (surreal?) claims, e.g. claims to have already achieved: 140 merchants for the mobile wallet, 40 partners on terminal integration, etc ... Wow, and this coin isn't even on any exchange. Why do you think they don't name any single one of those merchants/partners? (rhetorical question) - team put forward a pool with 0.01% fee because ""we want to help the community, we don't want money for ourselves"". When their pool reached a few MH/s, guess what happened to that 0.01% fee? It became 1%.  Good luck to those who actually bought in this ICO.  p.s.

They drive adoption by getting merchants to accept new ideas and technology (BIGGEST question is what is their incentive) ?  although I am a huge fan of a Crypto POS gateway for the masses (like Pundix in Asia) I wonder how the specifics might work or what will drive some of the small chains (because that's who they would go after initially) to adopt a free crypto terminal that claims to be a Universal Payment Processing Network ?  yo have to go after the smaller chains because SMO's can't afford to go after mom & Pop at first and they can't convince burger king either for a long while.. so how will this work ? Pundi pundi has a nice high tech terminal without an MCR I think it uses NFC to communicate to their card. They raised their ICO goal without much struggle but they promoted nicely with some Youtubers like Ian Malina and such (which cost them a bunch I am sure).  so although I am a big believer in the tech and can see how consumers will be alright by slowly accepting crypto as a medium (unfortunately VISA is needed for most to begin with) HOW will they or WE get the merchants to adopt and learn something more complicated ? free terminals is not enough.. online merchants have a huge advantage and would probably be first adopters of a new crypto payment processor like GRAFT but they will also take Litecoin and others so please explain to me or give me the plan of action for driving Merchants to sign up ?,False

The ""Network Hashrate"" shown on pools is not a real-time value. Its calculated based on the difficulty of the actual block. The calculation is simple: DIFFICULTY / DIFFICULTY_TARGET (where DIFFICULTY_TARGET is always 120 sec = 2min for Graft). For Block #18383 that would be 3242439737 / 120 = 27020331 = 27 MHs. But try it yourself. The ""Network Hashrate"" is an indicator for ""How much Hashingpower would be needed to find a Block every 2 Minutes"". The Pools Hashrate on the other hand is a real-time value, that could be higher than the whole Network Hashrate. If thats the case, there will simply be more than 1 Block every 2 Minutes....  The Graft Blockchain calculates its difficulty over the average of the last 720 Block. If the last 720 Blocks longer than 1440 minutes (720 Blocks * 2 Minutes) the diff will fall. If it took less than 1440 Minutes the diff will rise.  So if a pool put 40MH/s on a 15 MH/s Blockchain, there will me more than 1 Block per 2 Minutes. The diff will adjust, but over the average of 720 Blocks. Then, when the diff rises to a certain point, the pool stops putting Hashes on the Blockchain, leading to less than 1 Block per 2 Minutes. And the diff will fall again.  Using this mechanism is not directly abusing the Blockchain, since its still a valid way to do it. But its putting his own interest bevor everyone elses.   I hope I could clear things up for you and of course Ill be waiting for you on the awesome graftpool.online  Cheers MiRei",False

It basically meands that you need to stay longer on a pool, but your earnings are in average 5% higher.  But do your math, just remeber that you cant compare ""minging 2 hours on pool A and mining 2 hours on pool B"" here.  Cheers MiRei",False

However, I have the following doubts:  (1)  The name GRAFT is terrible, because in the US this is a colloquial term referring to insider embezzlement or corruption.  A glance at Merriam Webster will reveal this, or a search of headlines with the term 'graft' in the New York Times - the vast majority of the articles that come up have to do with corruption.  It strikes me that the founders of this coin are not native American English speakers (the term does not have this meaning in British English, where it means 'hard work', the opposite) and simply did not know this.  But for wide acceptance, there is no denying that the name is a major blunder.  (2)  The supernode system for fast approval of payments sounds like a good solution (and a solution is certainly needed) but how is it protected from hacking and defrauding?  Payments are approved outside the blockchain, which is the only mechanism guaranteed to be fraud-proof (the whole point of its existence).  So how is payment security outside the blockchain going to be implemented?  There is no information about this that I can find in the white paper or on the website.  (3)  I don't understand the business model going forward for point-of-sale.  Either the idea is (a) to partner with existing POS providers, such as Visa and Mastercard, or (b) create a new POS network.  Option (a) is a non-starter; existing providers will not partner with Graft for obvious reasons.  First of all, the whole idea of the coin is to subvert the existing system, and existing providers will obviously regard it as a direct threat to their existence.  Second, there is the whole privacy and untraceability aspect; while we as consumers may like and want this, existing POS providers will not accept a payments system where they can garner no information about payee identities, amounts, track payments, etc.  Apart from security and money laundering issues, it goes counter to the whole direction of their business model, which is to track users and predict their spending habits, etc.  This leaves (b), which means founding a whole new POS network, with new hardware, and getting businesses to accept this.  This requires a MAJOR investment and planning, and is a HUGE undertaking.  Is there any evidence that the Graft team is prepared for this, and/or is capable of it?  Apart from requiring huge investment up front in terms of the network hardware, it also requires getting merchants to sign on the dotted line, and the only way to do this (initially) would be to offer them the terminals for free, which implies even more investment.  How much is this all going to cost?  What is the plan?  Is there even a chance that any merchants would sign up?  (4) Even if (3) can be surmounted, there is the regulatory issue.  Given that merchants would need to sign up to this, how can Graft be guaranteed to be consistent with local regulations in the areas in which it is proposed to operate?  Especially given the money laundering issues having to do with choosing a blockchain whose major feature is obfuscation of transactions and fungibility?  I can see major problems here.  Until there is some sort of answer from the team on all of the above points, I won't be investing in this.",False

I wasn't personally aware of the ""American-english"" definition of the word. Or the meaning in Miriam Webster or The New York Times, for that matter. I think it looks good and is easy to pronounce. And it made me think of skin grafts, which in turn makes very much sense in this case of trying to patch the gap between crypto-currencies and the average consumer.

Graft is a rare ICO project with its own blockchain. The team is so dedicated to mainstreaming cryptocurrency and making a merchant-friendly solution that they have developed a blockchain that is built around the merchants’ systems and processes, bringing together the most advanced techniques in the space and resolving the issues with the other cryptocurrencies.  Soon, merchants with Graft will be able to accept crypto at the point of sale as easily as they do with cash or credit cards.  Running on its own blockchain sets the GRAFT project apart from its competitors that are based on the ERC20 tokens. As such, the Graft blockchain-based network will not be subject to the underlying Ethereum blockchain conditions such as latency and fees, putting the company in a strong position to be able to offer optimum payment services.  Since the introduction of bitcoin, blockchain technology has been said to change the financial system forever. However, nearly ten years after the launch of bitcoin, not much has changed in the traditional financial system due to the impact of blockchain. One of reasons why the adoption of blockchain-powered cryptocurrencies has not gone mainstream is that many of the existing cryptocurrencies were not designed to be effective as a transaction medium (at point of sale) relative to the existing options such as credit and debit cards.  At present, using bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies is more expensive for consumers than credit and debit cards. A consumer could pay up to $30 in transaction fees. In addition, existing cryptocurrencies do not offer merchants, who are unsure about the legal or tax implications of accepting cryptocurrency payments, the freedom to decide in what currencies (fiat or cryptocurrency) they would like to cash out. Graft is on a mission to solve these existential problems and mainstream the acceptance of cryptocurrency.  Transactions on the Graft Blockchain would be confirmed in real-time and transaction fees will be a fraction of those of existing cryptocurrencies, and will be driven by the transaction amount rather than network load as in the case of bitcoin. The Graft Blockchain is also built to encourage micro transactions. Moreover, Graft works with existing payment behaviors and infrastructure, allowing merchants to accept payment in both local fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. In other words, Graft enables crypto payments to work as easily and conveniently as MasterCard, Visa and Amex.  https://bitcoingarden.org/graft-blockchain-launches-mainnet-ahead-schedule/",False

I'm also very curious why this has not been addressed in any way, shape or form. The only single mention of chargebacks is shown below in the section of the whitepaper titled ""Offline Transaction Approvals"". I feel like this not being addressed is a major oversight on an otherwise well thought out ecosystem. I would like to invest in this ICO, but I would be extraordinarily hesitant to do so unless I felt this glaring oversight was adequately addressed. Either that, or an explanation provided as to why it is not an important enough topic for inclusion in the Whitepaper or any of the attached literature.  I would also like to make note of the fact that while the Whitepaper itself is written in a grammatically correct, clear and concise fashion, the website and accompanying materials here and elsewhere seem as if they were written by someone who's either not a native English speaker, or not a high school graduate. Regardless, it's a bad look for the ICO and the ecosystem in general if these issues are also not properly addressed before you begin to approach multi-billion dollar companies who are among the largest in the world to attempt to strike up useful and lasting business partnerships with them...  Please attempt to answer these concerns with substantive responses, so considerate investors such as myself don't feel like we're being led down the path of the crying bagholder...   ***Quoted text from Graft Whitepaper follows.***  ""Offline Transaction Approvals  People familiar with payment card processing know that sometimes transaction can be approved by merchant without getting actual approval from the bank. This is called offline or local approval, or offline authorization, or sometimes S&F (""store and forward"") as such offline authorization is forwarded to the server once the network is back online.  Crypto payments, however, assume that network is available 24/7, and there are no downtimes, which is not always true. In some situations, merchants take a risk and approve transactions locally because the risk of single chargeback is lower than the risk of losing multiple customers. Usually, there is a total limit amount for local authorization. After the system reaches this limit (the maximum risk), it stops issuing local approvals until the network is up again. But in case of short downtime, local authorization can go unnoticed to both cashiers and buyers. Graft merchant point of sale app and single relay supernode will be able to process offline crypto transactions based on the same principle, if they cannot communicate to the authorization sample and get consensus, and the merchant is ready to take a risk. The decision about offline approval will be also based on buyer’s and supernode’s reputation scores.""",False

It’s time for another update! As we are getting close to the ICO, the development team is focused on ICO related tasks at the moment. Early GRAFT supporters, who participated in token pre-sale, know that we used temporary NEM Mosaic grf:tokens during pre-sale. However, we promised to run main ICO on real network – GRAFT’s own blockchain – and we are going to keep our promise. The mainnet will be launched right before the ICO, tentatively on January 16th, so ICO participants will be able to use GRAFT wallets and receive freshly baked shiny GRF coins. GRAFT Networks  We are creating three networks (blockchains), all of them open for public access:  mainnet – actual GRAFT blockchain, production network. This is the blockchain that carry real GRF transactions.  public testnet – an exact functional copy of mainnet for public testing of mining, supernodes, wallet apps, etc. The public testnet was recently hard forked to the mainnet release candidate version.  RTA testnet – a branch that contains real time authorization and other “next” features that are not yet available on mainnet.  The mobile wallet app can switch between the three networks.  Network Node and Blockchain Protocol  We have made several changes required for supporting the supernode activities as well as important protocol changes. One of the main changes is “X100” – increased emission of GRF. The total supply has been increased from 18 *10^6 to 1.8 * 10^9. Read more about the reasons for this increase in this blog post. Note that the majority of GRF will be still gradually emitted via mining within several years. We haven’t modified the emission curve or the number of atomic units; it’s basically just a decimal point that has been shifted by two positions.  Supernodes and Mobile Apps  We are in the middle of implementation of the most important core feature of GRAFT blockchain: RTA (real time authorization), aka “instant approval”. The initial workflow and DAPI have been developed and will be available for public alpha testing on special separate RTA testnet. The mainnet will support a limited supernode and mobile wallet functions at the moment, until the RTA functionality is fully developed and thoroughly tested and debugged. The payment terminal application will be also available through the RTA testnet. CLI (command line interface) wallet currently supports full funds transfer functionality, and can “backup” the mobile wallet by using import / export functions when necessary.  Solo Mining and Mining Pools  Mining is a key function of successful decentralized blockchain. Both “solo” and “pool” mining will be available at the time of mainnet launch. For people who do not want to create their solo mining rigs but still want to participate in GRAFT mining we are creating two mainnet mining pools. Along with the existing test pool, those mining pools will be maintained by GRAFT team and open for anyone to participate. We also provide assistance for anyone who wants to run their own GRAFT mining pool or become a solo miner and eventually a supernode operator. Please check the testnet page on GRAFT website and Getting Started page on the test pool site for mining instructions. Those pages will be constantly updated with more information and various mining instructions and tutorials. Also, please check GRAFT Youtube channel for mining instructions and GRAFT explanatory videos. Happy GRAFT mining!",False

GRAFT wallet addresses now start from “G” for mainnet and “T” for testnet, so they could be easily distinguishable from other wallet addresses. Also, we have introduced a new transaction type flag in order to be able to distinguish between different transaction types. For example, a new transaction that is approved instantly by the authorization sample is different from a “standard” slow transaction (which is eventually going to be deprecated).  Supernode  We have successfully finished the transition of the supernode codebase from Python to C++ – good job, our development team! Essentially, it has been rewritten in C++ from scratch. It took time and efforts, but there are huge benefits of this refactoring: a unified technology stack and generic code reusability. Now both network and supernode are located under the same project in github, so don’t be confused by lack of activities in “supernode” project: it’s been deprecated.  We have started the full implementation of the most important core feature of Graft Network: real time authorization (instant approval). During the PoC phase, real time authorization was not fully implemented, and many core functions were just mocked up. Now we are implementing the real mechanism according to the original design described in the white paper. The optimistic flow is scheduled to be ready for testing by mid December, while the full implementation should be done by the end of the year. It is very heavy lifting from development point of view, but once fully implemented and tested, this feature alone is going to revolutionize crypto payments!  Mobile Wallet, Mobile Point of Sale, and Payment Terminal apps  We are actively working on further development and redesign of client applications, which include wallet and point of sale mobile apps as well as payment terminals’ apps for Verifone, Ingenico, Equinox, and AnywhereCommerce. The most recent versions of MVP apps are going to be open for public testing very soon. Stay tuned!  Mining  Mining is a key function which is required for a successful network setup. As such it is our goal to provide with a simple and streamlined process on how to mine GRF. Our vision is to provide holistic procedure (turnkey) which can be understood and executed by everyone, including non-technical users.  In order to achieve our goal we are currently testing and documenting the best and easiest processes for miner setup and configuration. Our effort is not limited to written instructions, and we are also planning on providing video guides on how to perform the setup and configuration. To minimize the entry barrier for mining we are also creating a template for cloud mining (AMI/terraform) allowing new users to mine with zero CAPEX investment.  Public testnet  The main testnet is open to public. Now you can run your own network node and supernode and even mine some test GRF coins with CPU minder and run basic transfers. Note that currently we do not accept any support requests for the testnet for two reasons: first, it is not stable, and the versions are changing literally every day, and second, we do not have a designated support team yet, and developers are focused on their primary development tasks so we could meet our very tight deadlines. Thus, please connect to the testnet at your own risk. Nevertheless, we are always open for healthy criticism and happy to receive any feedback and bug reports. You can find information about the testnet connectivity, network node, and CLI wallet setup below. The full supernode setup and configuration instructions will be also published soon.  Public testnet seed nodes: 54.207.116.130, 54.207.21.115, 54.233.159.189, 18.231.10.64  Public testnet block explorer: testnet.graft.network:8081  Installing VM  1. Install VirtualBox (another virtualization software can be used, but only VirtualBox has been tested):  https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads  Guest OS is Ubuntu 16.04, x64. Download ISO image using following URL:  http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso  2. Open VirtualBox, create new Virtual Machine  Select menu “Machine -> New”, Enter name, Select “Linux” (Type), Select “Ubuntu (64-bit)” (Version):  3. Select at least 2Gb RAM for the Virtual Machine.  It is recommended to arrange 2Gb RAM per CPU core for faster build.  4. Create new Virtual Hard Disk:  Select “VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image), Dynamically Allocated, Adjust file location (if needed) and select size appropriately. If you set it as e.g. 100Gb it doesn’t mean 100Gb will be allocated immediately – this is just upper limit.  5. Mount installation ISO:  Select your VM in the list, click “Settings”, select “Storage” and mount downloaded ISO as a new optical drive to IDE controller  6. Start VM and install the OS:  Follow the steps: https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-install-ubuntu-desktop#2  Installing the network node and CLI wallet  1. Install git (if not installed already):  sudo apt-get install -y git  2. Clone Graft Network from GitHub repository:  https://github.com/graft-project/GraftNetwork.git  git clone https://github.com/graft-project/GraftNetwork.git  3. Go to GraftNetwork directory:  cd GraftNetwork  4. Install dependencies from the list https://github.com/graft-project/GraftNetwork#dependencies  Use the following command line:  sudo apt-get -y install build-essential cmake \  pkg-config libboost-all-dev \  libssl-dev libunwind8-dev \  liblzma-dev libldns-dev \  libexpat1-dev doxygen graphviz  5. Start the build:  Option A (Use all CPUs):  make  Option B (Defined CPU affinity):  make -j4  for “-j” param select appropriate number of CPU cores available on your system.  In order to build standalone binaries (i.e. to upload it to the server where no dev packages installed), invoke:  make -j4 release-static  Wait until compilation is finished (Approximately 21 minutes using AWS T2 Medium)  6. Copy binaries to the appropriate directory:  Option A (system scope) –  sudo cp build/release/bin/* /usr/local/bin/  Option B (user scope) –  mkdir $HOME/bin  cp build/release/bin/* $HOME/bin  7. Run Graft network node  Under folder /GraftNetwork/build/release/bin, the following components may be found:  graftnoded – Graft Network daemon;  graft-wallet-cli – Graft Network CLI Wallet.  Running Graft network node daemon:  graftnoded --testnet  8. Creating CLI wallet and connecting to the local testnet node  To create new wallet for the public testnet, invoke:  ./graft-wallet-cli --generate-new-wallet --testnet  File location : ~/GraftNetwork/build/release/bin  It will try to connect to the local network node daemon, running in testnet mode, ask password for a new wallet, electrum seed language, generate new wallet, and finally open wallet with CLI interface. Invoke help to see available commands. E.g. CPU mining (solo mining) can be started with start_mining command.",False

So i guess the transaction fee and service fee even distribute 100% will still see it fail cause without miner they cant get this fee , so only thing i can think of right now is the block reward is been reduces (to a point miner dont feel purely mining it is very profitable ) or block reward is to share among node (that make every miner who want to get more is to stake and host a supernode) or everystaker who are interested to get some mining hashes.. with anything getting on a pool it dont serve the unique POW/POS => supernode system   yvmen",False

We have made a lot of plans and promises, and now it’s time for our dreams to start coming true. In order to achieve our ambitious goals, we have put together an efficient team of very talented and experienced developers. Two of them came from Monero project, which is very important for us as we forked the blockchain from Monero, and there will be many blockchain protocol changes.  Network Node, Testnet, and Blockchain Explorer  As an important milestone, we have finished some initial blockchain code modifications which allowed us to set up a public testnet with the first Graft block explorer.    While the testnet is open for access from the Internet, we have not published yet any information on node/supernode setup, configuration, and connectivity since we are still frequently updating it, and we would like to make sure it is stable enough to be open for public view and alpha testing. We will notify everyone once we publish the instructions so anyone will be able to connect and test the basic network.  Supernode  The majority of the work, however, currently is concentrated in supernode code which is — unlike network node forked from Monero — being designed from scratch. The proof of concept supernode was written in Python for the sake of rapid prototype development. After thorough review, the team decided to refactor the supernode code in C++ in order to keep a single technology stack and optimize the development process and network performance. Although the supernode and network node are based on the same technology stack now, the supernode is still deployed as a separate process (daemon), and we intend to keep it this way, at least for the near future.  Mining  Also, we are working on instructions for miners, including GPU and mining pools. Initially, it will be possible to mine on CPU, so the entire full supernode can be hosted on single machine. That’s how the typical testnet supernode is configured. On the mainnet, however, the network hashrate will grow fast, which will require GPU, then multiple GPU, and eventually mining pools to be set up in order to efficiently mine and maintain the full supernode. We are working on providing instructions for GPU miners as well as creating a first mining pool. The GPU mining machine can be detached from the supernode, which enables a hybrid “on premise/cloud” configuration, where, for example, the GPU mining rig is located at home while the supernode is hosted in AWS.    Mobile Wallet, Point of Sale, and Payment Terminal Apps  Finally, we are working on development of client applications, which include wallet and point of sale mobile apps that should look familiar from the PoC phase, as well as new apps running on payment terminals such as Verifone, Ingenico, Equinox, and AnywhereCommerce. Those new apps are going to be different from our existing mobile apps as they are going to be tailored to particular terminal hardware/OS/API/SDK and mostly integrated with third party point of sale software. The terminal apps are very important as they will open the door to the mainstream merchants including top tier retailers. Here is how the typical terminal app will interact with Graft Network:    We are still on initial design phase with those apps, but we believe we will be able to demonstrate the working prototypes before the ICO. Stay tuned!  https://www.graft.network/2017/11/10/mvp-development-status-update/",False

What follows is an attempt to explain how we arrived at the ICO pricing and what all contributed to it.  NOT ALL ALTCOINS ARE THE SAME  There are two types of altcoins (aka tokens) out on the market today – one that sit on top of another blockchain (like Ethereum), and others that implement their own blockchain. The ratio of derivative tokens to custom blockchain ones are roughly 100:1.  It is a lot easier to do a derivative token based ICO – you just write a small amount of code in  Solidity (if Ethereum) – and you have a token you can sell. Doing or modifying a blockchain on the other hand involves a very substantial amount of engineering efforts – the team has to figure out the math and economics behind the blockchain, implement additional capabilities, secure that new functionality, create API’s, in many cases create applications like a wallet, etc. They also have to create a whole new network complete with node installation procedures, upgrade processes, and many other considerations. GRAFT is the latter of the two – while leveraging CryptoNote protocol which addresses privacy, decentralization and fungibility as well as  great work that Monero team has done to improve scalability among other things, GRAFT is having to implement a new communication protocol that allows instant authorizations, a distributed API (DAPI) that allows connections from the POS and other applications, and a set of reference applications for the point of sale  and the wallet – just to name a few high-profile tasks.    DERIVATIVE TOKENS COST MORE  Tokens run on top of another blockchain (say Ethereum), so purchasing a token is not sufficient to run the application that the token represents – you also need to purchase “fuel” (which is the underlying coin/token). The amount of fuel depends on the amount of transactions that the token application represents. Compare this to the blockchain like GRAFT which encompasses the value of entire transaction. As you can see, the cost of a token is more than meets the eye, in some cases much more.     PAY ATTENTION TO VALUATION, NOT TOKEN COST  Valuation (or capitalization) follows a simple formula: (Number of tokens or coins) x (Price of the token / coin). It’s natural for people to think that smaller price of the token represents a bargain, but the critical piece in this equation is the number of coins or tokens that are being issued. For example, which is less expensive (has higher valuation) – 1 billion tokens at $1, or 10 million tokens at $10? It is as you could calculate the latter, with corresponding valuations of $1B vs $100MM.  So when you buy a $10 token from a 10 million token pool, you actually end up with a significantly (10x) larger piece of the pie than if you buy the same amount of the $1 token in a 1 billion token pool. Most token ICO’s are not burdened by emission math (the formula that guides how the coins are mined, making the later mined coins harder to mine than earlier mined coins), so they issue a very large number of tokens (often in 100’s of millions or even billions) and then pricing the tokens low for the perception of the low entry cost.   Top 10 Derivative tokens (illustrating circulating supplies differences)   GRAFT VALUATION IS 1/40 OF DASH  GRAFT’s total final emission (the number of coins to ever be minted) is roughly 18 million (18,446,744 to be precise). We’re pre-mining certain number of coins (45%) to cover the ICO, marketing, reserves, and incentives. This is it. We will never be able to add or pre-mine any more coins!  We have also decided not to siphon off any fees from the transactions to fund the development like some of the other blockchains are doing.    As such we have to make sure that whatever we raise now will be sufficient to sustain GRAFT project until no further development or support from the core team are required (we estimate that to be roughly 7 years with the overall team growing to 30-40 people). This is roughly $25MM.  Now, we also have to account for additional unexpected expenses, crypto-currency fluctuations at the time of the raise, and potential taxable events. This means that we need to need to double the $25MM getting us to $50MM. Since the ICO represents 25% of the total coin supply, the $50MM has to be equal to 25%, which brings the valuation to $200MM, and subsequently the price of the coin to roughly equivalent of $11 USD.   SUMMARY  When evaluating GRF pricing, it’s really important to compare apples to apples in terms of: size of emission (or the number of tokens available) type of a token/coin – a blockchain or a token on top of another blockchain valuation which is a product of number of tokens multiplied by price If you do such comparison, you will see that GRF token ICO compares very favorably against other blockchains on the market:    Current circulation Price Market Cap / Valuation Bitcoin 16,678,650 $6,100.00 $100,000,000,000 Etherium 95,715,037 $310.00 $29,500,000,000 Ripple 38,622,870,411 $0.20 $30,000,000,000 Litecoin 53,819,707 $60.00 $3,250,000,000 Dash 7,687,407 $340.00 $3,200,000,000 Monero 15,345,839 $118.00 $1,800,000,000 Graft (after ICO) 8,301,034 $11.00 $91,311,374  The original post: https://www.graft.network/2017/11/16/how-we-priced-graft-ico/",False

The main eligibility criteria for becoming a full supernode are combined PoW (Proof of Work) and PoS (Proof of Stake): the full supernode must have both a recently mined block and a stake wallet with a minimum balance of 500 GRF.  With that said, only full supernodes – authorization sample members receive transaction fees, while mining nodes receive block rewards only. But every mined block opens the door for the mining node to become a full supernode and earn even more on real time authorization and service broker hosting.  At the very beginning, right after the mainnet launch, the mining can be done using regular CPU. However, once miners start connecting their GPU cards and rigs, the hashrate will go up. We realize that at some point, sooner or letter, the miners will start consolidating into mining pools due to the raising hashrate. Such consolidation will reduce the overall number of “unique” mining supernodes, which may affect the number of supernode candidates that are eligible to become a full supernode.  In order to maintain the combined PoW/PoS scheme relevant while keeping up with constantly rising hashrate, we introduce superstake – a mechanism which allows a single mining supernode associated with mining pool to be linked to more than one stake wallet. Thus, a single mining wallet can be linked to multiple stake wallets, which allows a single miner to maintain multiple full supernodes, which will increase an income from transaction fees. However, only up to 3 full supernodes linked to the same mining wallet can participate in the same authorization sample. Also, the stake for extra full supernodes added to the same miner is doubled in order to compensate for the fact that a single miner controls a larger piece of the network (and receives extra portions of transaction fees).  The superstake approach does not change the existing requirement to have at least 500 GRF stake plus recently mined block in order to become a full supernode. However, the second full supernode connected to the same miner will increase the required stake amount to 1000 GRF each. The three supernodes will require a 2,000 GRF stake per each “sister” supernode, etc. Although there is no limit for a number of superstake supernodes, only up to three “sister” supernodes can participate in a single authorization sample. The superstake supernodes can be also used for hosting service brokers that cannot be hosted together with real time authorization for any reason (for example, elevated security or privacy requirements).

Its fruits are beautiful, and only true art can produce a beauty. Dostoevsky said “beauty will save the world.” The beauty of cryptography will save privacy and security of our world in a time of total connectivity. Look at Elliptic Curves, a public key encryption algorithm used in digital signatures by both Bitcoin and CryptoNote protocols. They are beautiful even if you don’t know the math. They become even more charming when you start understanding. In my recent book I tried to explain, without higher mathematics, in layman’s terms, how Elliptic Curves work. It’s not impossible to understand them if you really want to understand. But they are still huge and mind-blowing. And they are just one piece of CryptoNote protocol, which is one of the highest achievements of cryptography.  CryptoNote stands out of all other blockchain protocols because it provides something we all need: privacy. We often take privacy for granted and only regret when we lose it. Ironically, Bitcoin and its derivatives take a step backwards in privacy area comparing to older payment technologies such as cash or even plastic cards which became an inglorious symbol of compromised security and privacy. Bitcoin creator(s) either did not think about privacy, or simply did not have enough time to resolve all the problems, which is absolutely understandable as they had even more important problem to solve: the very existence of blockchain technology.  CryptoNote keeps all the benefits of blockchain technologies, which are well known, while “returning” the lost privacy features: untraceable payments, unlinkable transactions, blockchain analysis resistance, and confidential transaction amounts. On top of that, Graft adds confidential transaction fee amounts to complete the picture. CryptoNote creates a perfect solid foundation for building a variety of industry-related features which Graft brings to light in order to conquer the world of payments.",False

The service brokers will boost liquidity of each cryptocurrency by enabling various payment options on both buyer’s and merchant’s sides of the transaction. The cryptocurrency service brokers will be implemented in collaboration with existing or/and newly created exchanges. Multiple choices for each cryptocurrency eventually will be available, so they could compete in order to provide better rates and services. The variety of services and automated sign up, selection, and execution processes will keep the decentralized character of the network.  Every single set includes four service brokers implemented for each cryptocurrency. Pay-in and Top-up brokers work with the GRAFT wallet app to allow a buyer to use the selected cryptocurrency as a payment method when making a payment to GRAFT points of sale (POS), native wallet apps, non-GRAFT POS integrated with GRAFT DAPI, or non-GRAFT POS that accepts the selected cryptocurrency. Accept and Payout brokers work with GRAFT POS to allow a merchant to accept the selected as a payment method while conducting payment transactions with GRAFT wallet app or NEM wallets.  PAY-IN BROKER Pay-in broker works with GRAFT Wallet App to facilitate a payment to a native cryptocurrency wallet or non-GRAFT POS accepting the cryptocurrency. In this scenario, the Pay-in Broker creates a regular cryptocurrency transaction in native format for the particular network and sends it to the native recipient address. There is a network transaction fee which is in this case charged to the sender because the transaction is not fully facilitated by the GRAFT network. The payment is not processed instantly because the recipient is not participating in Graft network. This scenario is less beneficial than GRF transaction for both buyer and merchant because of the lower speed of transaction and transaction fees paid by the buyer. However, it is supported by Graft in order to keep the buyer’s wallet flexible and useful even outside of the Graft ecosystem.  Pay-in Broker will instantly exchange necessary amount of GRF from buyer’s account to the selected cryptocurrency. The buyer pays a small exchange fee to the Pay-in Broker, which can be paid in a form of exchange rate.  TOP-UP BROKER Top-Up Broker works with GRAFT wallet to perform on-demand exchange of the selected cryptocurrency to GRF in order to allow payments to GRAFT POS or non-GRAFT POS integrated with GRAFT DAPI. This scenario is the most beneficial for both the buyer and the merchant because all the fees (including the network fees of the target cryptocurrency) are paid by the merchant, and payment is approved instantly. For the buyer, the benefits are obvious – no fees associated with the payment, and ability to pay with the target cryptocurrency to a merchant that does not accept it. For the merchant, it is important to get instant authorization in order to be able to serve more customers in real time, and accept payments in various cryptocurrencies. The fact that all the fees are paid by the merchant, just like with “traditional” credit/debit card payments, allows much better customer conversion rates.  Top-Up broker can also process exchanges on demand with larger amounts and better rates.  ACCEPT BROKER Accept Broker works with GRAFT POS to facilitate acceptance of selected cryptocurrency as a payment method in case the buyer does not have GRAFT wallet. Accept Broker receives funds in selected cryptocurrency and converts them to GRF. The (selected cryptocurrency) network transaction fee is still paid by the buyer, unless the buyer uses GRAFT wallet app. If the buyer uses GRAFT wallet, the wallet recognizes the GRAFT POS and automatically converts the payment transaction to instant transaction in GRF.  The merchant payout is processed by Accept Broker in GRF instantly, hourly, daily, or on demand, depending on settings, or in other cryptocurrency or fiat currency if corresponding payout brokers are activated.  From the buyer’s point of view, the transaction looks similar to regular transaction between native cryptocurrency wallets.  PAYOUT BROKER Payout Broker works with GRAFT POS to facilitate merchant payouts in selected cryptocurrency. Payout broker exchanges GRF available on the POS account to selected cryptocurrency and makes deposits to the associated account instantly, hourly, daily, or on demand, depending on settings.  Payout Fees Payout fees/exchange rates for payouts processed by either Accept or Payout service brokers may vary on frequency of the payout. Depending on transaction volume, daily payouts can cost significantly less than instant payouts since the broker can accumulate more funds and pay just a single network fee for single payout transaction, comparing to paying a separate fee for each instant payout transaction.  https://www.graft.network/2017/10/11/cryptocurrency-service-brokers/",False

We think about both sides of typical payment transaction: buyer and merchant. Monaco only cares about the buyer, which is definitely important. But what about merchants who want to accept both traditional payments (such as credit/debit cards including Monaco ) and cryptocurrencies? In order to do that, today merchants must maintain multiple points of sale, payment terminals, and wallet apps which is absolutely impractical. Graft point of sale app accepts both cards and crypto, and convert payouts (payments for proceeds from purchases) to local fiat currency if needed.  Thus, Graft combines both methods and makes the payment process simple and available in any situation. The buyer can pay with their cryptocurrencies directly wherever it’s possible, but use the plastic card, which is linked to the wallet, in any other place that is not yet familiar with crypto. The same is with the seller. Using single point of sale app, merchant can accept various crypto-currencies and credit/debit cards.  In addition to these main goals, we are designing more services that will be provided by GRAFT network to improve the lives of sellers and buyers. For example, obtaining an instant credit by the buyer, or creating merchant tokens, which will be used by sellers as “private cryptocurrency” for important business functions such as store credits, loyalty rewards, gift certificates, and discount coupons.  There is another interesting and promising feature, which is in conjunction with merchant tokens elevates Graft from “another payment network” to a universal payment platform. This feature is called vchain, from the combination of words “virtual”, “chain”, and “blockchain”. Using vchain, sellers can connect several points of sale located in one store, or even create a network (“chain”) with multiple stores. Buyers can also use vchain to manage multiple wallets linked to each other and transfer funds for free between multiple accounts, which is useful for family or corporate accounts.

Please see the roadmap below and read about GRAFT goals and features. ""let me know if it can ship in other  country thanks"" - yes, the card will be available in other countries.  The Goals of GRAFT project    Our main goal is making the cryptocurrencies as convenient as plastic cards, while keeping the payment secure and private. We do this on both sides of the transaction - the buyer and the seller (merchant). In order to achieve those goals, we need a smooth transition from traditional payment methods, such as credit cards, to more progressive ones, like cryptocurrency. It is naive to believe that buyers and sellers will suddenly forget about plastic cards, which have a strong presence in the market and don’t go away anytime soon. Thus, Graft combines both methods and makes the payment process simple and acceptable in any situation. The buyer can pay with their cryptocurrencies directly wherever it’s possible, and use the plastic card, which is linked to the wallet, in any other place that is not yet familiar with crypto. The same is with the seller. Using the same point of sale app, merchant can accept various crypto-currencies and credit/debit cards.  In addition to these main goals, we are designing additional services that will be provided by GRAFT network to improve the lives of sellers and buyers. For example, obtaining an instant credit by the buyer, or creating merchant tokens, which will be used by sellers as “private cryptocurrency” for important business functions such as store credits, loyalty rewards, gift certificates, and discount coupons.  There is another interesting and promising feature, which is in conjunction with merchant tokens converts Graft from ""another payment network"" into a universal payment platform. This feature is called ""vchain"", from the combination of words ""virtual"", ""chain"", and ""blockchain"". Using vchain, sellers can connect several points of sale located in one store, or even create a network (“chain”) with multiple stores. Buyers can also use vchain to manage multiple wallets linked to each other and transfer funds for free between multiple accounts, which is useful for family or corporate accounts.  And finally, a few words about security and privacy. GRAFT uses the CryptoNote protocol, which is by far the highest achievement of modern cryptography. CryptoNote provides incomparably better privacy conditions comparing to any other blockchain protocol. Payments recorded on the Graft blockchain can not be viewed or tracked. CryptoNote completely conceals from prying eyes almost all the attributes of the transaction: the buyer's address, the amount of the payment, and the address of the seller. On top of that, GRAFT adds another feature that is unique and has not yet been implemented by anyone else: the hidden amount of transaction fee. Thus, serious buyers and sellers, who really care about the privacy of their financial transactions, for the first time have an opportunity to make their payments in cryptocurrency or cards without the risk of spying from competitors, criminals, or just random people.  https://www.graft.network/",False

One example is credit card payment processing which implies a lot of compliance with various regulations, both local and international. But we still want to use those cards, and we would like them to work together with cryptocurrencies. GRAFT Network resolves this dilemma by introducing service brokers which implement specific features that cannot be fully automated by decentralized network. This short article explains how service broker work in a form of instructions for a newbie.  First of all, there are several types of service brokers:   Credit card accept broker Instant cryptocurrency accept broker Instant cryptocurrency exchange broker Payout (exchaging cryptocurrency to fiat currency and transferring to bank account) Identity verification broker  Any existing company-service provider (such as credit card payment processor or cryptocurrency exchange) can become a GRAFT service broker, and thus magically extend their business from “traditional” centralized world to the world of decentralized crypto payments.  1. Setup Integrate with appropriate GRAFT DAPI and test using testnet; Install your own full supernode or make a lease agreement with one or more full supernode owners.  2. Advertise Define your service offer: Client type (wallet, POS, or both), Region (country) or list of regions, Service fees (information about fee structure and/or exchange rates) Identity disclosure requirements (what elements of user identity are required in order to execute the service request). GRAFT Network will broadcast the advertisement messages to all supernodes and make it available to all wallet and/or point of sale clients connected to the network and matching the target audience criteria, along with your reputation score calculated by full supernodes based on historic data stored in the blockchain.  3. Process When a user needs particular service, the GRAFT software will automatically choose the service broker based on the best match or the user criteria and the broker offer. Once your service is selected, just process the service requests and credit or debit the user’s account as a result.    Share service fees with the processing supernode owner if you “lease” the supernode, or earn extra fees if you own the supernode.",False

The Graft NEM based tokens (Graft:token) will be exchanged to GRF coins once Graft network becomes operational, which is preliminary scheduled for the end of the year. We are seeking to sell 135,000 Graft:tokens for 353.7 BTC. Pre-sale will start on September 15th 2017 at 15pm UTC and end on September 22nd 2017 at 15pm UTC. The pre-sale price of one Graft:token (0.001843 BTC / 0.028 ETH / 28.06 XEM) is 30% less than the final sale price which is set to 0.00262 BTC / 0.04 ETH / 40.09 XEM.  The Graft coin is called Graft (GRF), and is the “fuel” of the Graft platform. GRF are cryptographic tokens that will enable purchasers to transact and operate services on the Graft platform when it is launched by Graft. GRF is required for participation in Graft network activities, including but not limited to operating the full supernodes, which provide instant confirmations and other important network services. The total supply (maximum number) of GRF is 18,446,744. The majority of GRF will be created as a block reward by supernode operators during several years of mining. Since Graft uses combined Pow/PoS algorithm, 500 GRF will be required to deposit as proof of stake in order to operate the full supernode. For more details about its uses in the network, please see Graft white paper or/and Frequently Asked Questions: https://github.com/graft-project/graft-white-paper/blob/master/graft-white-paper-1.02/graft-white-paper-1.02.md https://www.graft.network/frequently-asked-questions/  At the time of the pre-sale, the Graft platform will not have been launched. Purchasers in the pre-sale will acquire Graft:token (NEM based smart contract tokens) in exchange for BTC, ETH, or XEM. 135,000 Graft:tokens pre-sold in this manner can be exchanged to GRF coins created in the Graft genesis block. Graft will allocate equivalent amount of GRF purchased in the pre-sale in the genesis block. The genesis block will constitute the inception of operation of the Graft network.  https://www.graft.network/2017/09/07/graft-pre-sale-on-nem-platform/  Website: https://graft.network Email: info@graft.network Telegram: https://t.me/joinchat/EneBw0RALAOjkSL2mdt2Gw Twitter: https://twitter.com/graftnetwork Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/graftnetwork/ Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/Graft/",False

Buyers can pay anywhere with cryptocurrencies or plastic card using Graft wallet app. Merchants can receive payment from anyone using point of sale accepting both cryptocurrencies and plastic cards. Faster payment confirmations are provided by Graft supernode authorization sample, a process that is more similar to Dash masternode scheme. Unlike Dash masternode, however, Graft supernode is not a “wrapper” or a second tier as it is designed to be a monolithic code base that implements both real time authorization and blockchain settlement (mining) features. Such an architecture improves security of the real time authorization process, as payments cannot be settled “off supernode chain” by the “lower” level blockchain network nodes, without supernodes knowing about their existence. Thus, all Graft transactions are authorized instantly without requiring additional fee, by supernodes that are automatically selected by the network using combined proof of work and proof of stake algorithm.  Focus on Privacy Ripple consensus protocol is different, and its main problem is that it does not provide privacy features: untraceability and unlinkability of payment transactions. Unlike Graft blockchain, all transaction information on the Ripple ledger is public. Ripple does not provide the privacy and untraceability that are demanded today by potential Graft users – both buyers and merchants. When we pay with credit card, we share our secret payment information (like credit card number) with some entities – the merchant, the issuing bank, the payment processor, the payment acquiring bank – but those entities are relatively trustable so they try not to share our secrets with the entire world, and no one else can see our transaction history without our or their permission. Oftentimes, however, they fail to keep our secrets (think Target and many other retail mega breaches). With Ripple or Bitcoin or most other cryptocurrencies that are not based on CryptoNote protocol, the story is exactly opposite: there is no central authority that “knows” our secret “card number” (private key), but at the same time anyone in the world can trace our payments on the blockchain and link them to our identities with minimum efforts. By Implementing CryptoNote and other features, Graft brings the level of untraceability of payment history similar to traditional credit and debit card system, while adding decentralization, privacy, and security, which are the features of any cryptocurrency that are absolutely impossible to achieve using traditional credit card payment technology.

Does it mean the wallet content is stored on supernodes which may compromise its security and privacy?  There are multiple elements of the Graft user wallet:  Private spend key - secret - required to spend money; stored in the wallet app Private view key - ""semi-secret"" - required to see the balance and previous transactions Payment address - public - required to receive money  In Graft, the Private spend key is always stored at the client (wallet) and never shared with the supernodes. Therefore, it is not the same as credit card when you share you card account number with the merchant, payment processor, and the bank every time you make a payment. If one of them is breached, your credit card can be stolen and used to make fraudulent payments. If any or even all supernodes are “breached”, they don't have your private spend key so no one will be able to ""use"" your Graft account.  The Graft wallet balance is a “hidden” set of previous transactions. It is calculated by scanning all the previous transactions which are stored on the public blockchain but invisible without view key. Since mobile wallet app does not have direct access to the blockchain, the private view key is temporary shared with a single ""proxy"" (relay) supernode in order to retrieve the wallet balance; the supernode will not store this view key in any database so even if it's “breached” the view key will not be disclosed in most cases. However, even if the view key is disclosed, it only allows to see transactions, not to spend any money.  Users (either buyers or merchants) with higher requirements for privacy can host their own private ""proxy"" supernode with full copy of blockchain. This way they will never share their view keys with the random ""foreign"" supernodes. Most probably, due to limited processing power and other resource limitations, such a private proxy supernode will not be able to participate in transaction processing and earn any block rewards or transaction fees, but it will still be able to validate transactions and view balances privately by scanning the local copy of the blockchain. For users who cannot or don't want to host their own supernode but still don't trust the entire network, Graft creates a special (free) cloud service with trusted proxy supernodes that are protected by multiple levels of security.",False

A: It depends on how you pay or accept payment. Graft platform offers multiple ways to pay (for a buyer) as well as various methods of accepting payment (for a merchant). if buyer pays by Graft plastic card linked to the buyer’s Graft cryptocurrency wallet, he or she relies on merchant, merchant’s payment processor, and acquiring bank, who are not always the best experts in keeping our data safe (remember all those endless mega card data breaches like Target). However, If such a card payment is accepted by a merchant that also uses Graft network and Graft point of sale app, this payment is more secure and private because the Graft card is recognized and handled by the Graft network as internal transaction. This is almost the same as paying with GRAFT itself (graft coins). “Almost” because there are still some “standard” risks associated with using a plastic card, even Graft card, since the card is issued by a centralized institution (otherwise, it wouldn’t be accepted everywhere, including merchants who don’t work with Graft network yet).   GRAFT (coin) is the most secure, private, and least expensive way to transfer funds (although it is important to note that payment is always free for a buyer, because Graft is the only platform that charges transaction fees to the merchant just like in the “real world” of payments, but there are also ""authenticated"" transfers that are absolutely free for both sender and recipient). GRAFT is the most private and secure way to pay because the payment does not leave the network where all the elements of transaction - sender address, recipient address, transaction amount, and even transaction fees - are encrypted and hidden from public view. Nevertheless, Graft blockchain is still public, and transaction is validated by multiple supernodes. Such a level of security and privacy is achieved by using CryptoNote protocol and additional technology designed by Graft.",False

Graft is a global, open-sourced, blockchain-based, decentralized payment gateway and processing platform that anyone can use. Any buyer and merchant can use Graft in a completely decentralized and inexpensive way. Graft ecosystem is open, so anyone can participate by maintaining Graft blockchain and implementing network services. Graft employs payment processing protocols and flows similar to traditional electronic payment systems such as credit, debit, and prepaid cards, which are already familiar to and trusted by millions of users and merchants around the world. This approach enables easier and faster adoption of Graft as a mainstream payment platform, while eliminating the need in centralized intermediaries (payment gateways and processors) currently required to facilitate transactions between buyers and merchants. GRAFT is short for Global Real-time Authorizations and Fund Transfers, but also represents grafting of the new into the old. GRAFT Blockchain is built on the idea that the payment industry can benefit tremendously from the democratization brought forward by the blockchain technology, but only when the right technologies are chosen and combined with the accepted industry workflows and systems. When done correctly, this transition to blockchain-based payments will lead to radically improved credit/debit payment system through the combination of lower transaction fees, tight privacy controls, low rates on credit balances, and connected extra services. GRAFT Blockchain is a socially responsible organization, introduces a decentralized, real-time payment processor and services platform into the global market covering a wide variety of credit and debit payment use cases. GRAFT software that is not subjecto to shared intellectual property (IP) or under an NDA is under an open source license. GRAFT Foundation is a non-for-profit entity, and we intend to operate as such unless we’re forced to change status by the governing laws of the land.    Impact We believe a Blockchain like GRAFT can have a far reaching social and economic impact, removing friction from the systems and enabling new use cases. To provide a few examples: Many new merchants (especially small businesses) able to offer electronic payments Underbanked consumers able to get a credit facility and pay electronically Consumers able to save on variety of fees such as international transaction fees Businesses that conventional banks won’t underwrite able to offer credit and electronic payments Consumers benefitting from significantly lower credit card borrowing costs resulting from peer lending   Website https://graft.network  White Paper Graft_White_Paper_2.01_May_2018.pdf  Telegram https://t.me/joinchat/EneBw0RALAOjkSL2mdt2Gw  Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/Graft/  Exchanges Cryptopia Trade Ogre Stocks.Exchange  Technical Details Blockchain: CryptoNote Hash Algorithm: CryptoNight Block time: 120 seconds Block  Reward: recalculated every block Difficulty : recalculated every block Maximum supply: 1,844,674,400 Transaction confirmation: instant Supernode Proof: PoW + PoS   Free Funds Transfers Between Wallets Neither sender nor receiver pays any fee for limited number of low priority slow funds transfers between wallets.  Universal Mobile Wallet App The Mobile Wallet user can pay using various cryptocurrencies or credit cards.  Spending Card The Mobile Wallet user can pay everywhere using traditional debit card associated with multi cryptocurrency wallet.  Crowdfunded Credit The Mobile Wallet user can instantly request a crowdfunded “credit line”. No credit history checks.  Absolute Privacy CryptoNote protocol ensures full untraceability, unlinkability, and fungibility of Graft blockchain, where sender address, recipient address, and transaction amount are cryptographically protected and “invisible”. On top of that, Graft adds “one more thing”: it makes even transaction fees invisible to public view.  Zero Knowledge Proof Identity Verification Some features such as free transfers or crowdfunded credit require user identification and authentication. Zero knowledge proof technology allows users to authenticate without compromising their privacy.    Benefits for Merchants (Recipients)  Real Time Authorizations (Instant Confirmations) Transactions are confirmed instantly, within hundreds milliseconds to a few seconds, which enables normal in-store and online checkout process.    Low Transaction Fees Fees are charged to merchant to increase buyers conversion rates; those fees are symbolic which enables micropayments.  Special Transaction Types and Smart Contracts Graft Point of Sale apps support multiple transactions types that are unusual for cryptocurrency. For example pre-authorization and capture that are necessary for ticket booking, hotel check-in, or gas station payment. Schedule or Escrow transactions, which are essentially pre-programmed configurable smart contracts, can help businesses set up periodic remittance and subscriptions.  Free Point of Sale App Accepts All Payment Methods Free Mobile Point of Sale app accepts various cryptocurrencies and credit/debit cards, which eliminates the need to maintain multiple point of sale apps and wallets.  Merchant Payouts in Local Fiat Currency Transaction are settled in real time and payouts can be received in local local currency.  Authenticated Buyers Buyers can confirm their identity in order to unlock some special transaction types which require age verification, for example.    Benefits for Supernode Owners (Miners)  Block Rewards Supernode owners receive block rewards. Transaction fees are paid for real time authorizations.  Hosting Service Brokers Supernode owners receive a share of transaction and service fees charged by service brokers  Transaction Authenticated transfer fee: 0 Micropayment fee (less than 10 GRAFT): 0.1% of Tx amount (charged to recipient) Payment fee (10 GRAFT and more): log1000 (Tx amount) (charged to recipient)    Emission and block reward curves  ",False

A: You shouldn't be comparing GRAFT to Ethereum based TOKENS - those are a currency on top of another currency. Similar to Bitcoin, GRAFT's emission (supply) is limited to 18,446,744 coins after every coin is mined. What this means is that we have to make sure that the coin is valued properly at each step of the way, providing reasonable entry price, ICO value, and a healthy upside for appreciation.",False

Many payment systems such as ACH or PayPal allow free transfers between user accounts which create a huge incentive comparing to cryptocurrencies, which charge users unproportional fees regardless the speed and amount of transaction. This feature is perfectly suitable for transactions with low speed requirements, such as funds transfers between family accounts or remittance of employees' salaries. In order to be able to compete with traditional payment networks, Graft provides limited free transfers between user wallets.  Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrency networks usually cannot ""afford"" free transactions for three major reasons:  Lack of incentive for miners Threat of DOS attacks Uncontrolled growth of blockchain  Graft resolves the first problem by logical separation between payment and transfer, so supernodes (miners) receive transaction fees for instant payments which constitute the majority of all transactions, while free transfers are processed “on the background” with lower priority.  The second problem with DOS threat is resolved by voluntary user identification and authentication. Of course, there are no free lunches, so the users should ""pay"" by providing their identity to the network to ensure the reasonable use (by limiting the number and frequency of free transfers per user) and prevent the network abuse. However, using zero knowledge proof authentication technology will allow users to prove their identity without compromising their privacy.  The last problem with uncontrolled block size growth is resolved by a complex of measures: small block interval, unlimited block size, and standard restricted transaction size for particular transaction types such as free transfer. In addition, one of the sides of the free transfer must prove that they contributed to the network by conducting “commercial” payment transaction types in the past.

We call it supernode because it performs more functions than “traditional” network node, and there are different requirements for supernode owners. Yes, Graft network is open and decentralized, and anyone will be able to run a supernode, but there are different levels of supernode and different conditions (and rewards) associated with each level.  Proxy Supernode is the “entry level” - everyone can install the supernode software and host Relay supernode. The only requirement is public IP, but this can be achieved even with home network. Proxy supernode does not mine or provide services, but it can be useful for several purposes; for example, as a trusted relay for those who have highest privacy requirements, so they can host their own “wallet server”, or for large merchants as a “store server” for even faster transaction processing. Miner Supernode can generate revenue by earning block rewards. The only requirement (in addition to public IP) is higher computing power required for PoW mining. Miner supernode is the last step before the next and highest level. Full Supernode is both miner and service provider. It cannot perform its instant authorization functions or service brokerage (credit card acceptance, for example) without mining. In addition, performing Full functions requires a stake - collateral balance associated with supernode address. Hence combined PoW/PoS. Miner supernode can mine without a stake but it won’t be able to provide services, i.e. it won’t be able to earn transaction and service fees. Note that Graft miner does not receive transaction or service fees, only block rewards. Transaction and service fees are only paid to Full supernode that mines, has a stake, issues instant approvals, and hosts network service brokers.",False

Yes and no. They are competitors just to the single feature of Graft network - spending debit card - which is just one of the ways Graft is going to enter the mainstream payments. We think about both sides of typical payment transaction: buyer and merchant. Tenx only cares about the buyer, which is definitely important. But what about merchants who want to accept both traditional payments (such as credit/debit cards including tenx) and cryptocurrencies? In order to do that, today merchants must maintain multiple point of sale, payment terminals, and wallet apps which is very impractical. Graft point of sale app accepts both cards and crypto, and convert payouts (payments for proceeds from purchases) to local fiat currency if needed. Another important point - Graft CryptoNote-based blockchain is absolutely private: sender address, recipient address, and transaction amount are encrypted on blockchain and therefore hidden from public view. On top of that, Graft also adds encrypted (hidden) transaction fees which are visible to blockchain reviewers in all existing CryptoNote implementations.",False
