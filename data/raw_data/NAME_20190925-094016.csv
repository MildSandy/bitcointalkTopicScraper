NAME Token   VName Bitcointalk Bounty Thread: Official Bounty Thread Official VName Website: vname.id   BOUNTY THREAD | WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER | EXECUTIVE SUMMARY | GITHUB | FACEBOOK | TWITTER | REDDIT |  TELEGRAM OFFICIAL GROUP    About Us VName is a global decentralized address verification system based on blockchain technology. In short, it works by matching a user’s blockchain address to their unique nickname or ""VName"". Making transactions highly secure, easy and efficient without compromising user privacy and information. We plan on becoming the universal access point for validating any blockchain address from any network.   What is a DAICO? It's a new financing model that contains the main benefits of its predecessors, the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) and the ICO (Initial Coin Offering). The model was proposed by the founder of Ethereum with the aim of obtaining less risky financing for investors in a decentralized manner. The DAICO format allows token holders to control the withdrawal of funds, while also allowing to close the project in case the team fails in the development, realization or execution of this.  More information on our website and whitepaper.   Overview - What does VName Do? In the last couple of years, the cryptocurrency market has exploded with an unprecedented growth. Along with the increase in market capitalization, number of transactions and individuals actively operating through blockchain wallets and exchanges there has also been a substantial increase in transaction risk and threats.  Among alarming news of hacks and heists, an ever-growing problem of cryptocurrencies has been ignored by the world: human error. Transaction addresses have become so lengthy and complex that one can almost feel lucky when a transaction reaches their intended receiver.  VName avoids human error, preventing users from sending funds to the wrong address and losing them forever. We do this by providing a unique, short and simple username or ""VName"" to each individual on the blockchain. VName eliminates any reading, spelling or checking mistake that may leave you empty-handed.   How it Works?  A user inputs the destination address of the transaction and our helper script identifies this input and automatically shows the corresponding “VName”. The user can, without any modification of their current way of transacting, quickly verify that the receiver of the transaction is indeed who was intended to.  This is important, as our initial focus is not to replace the use of addresses, adoption is not ready for this yet. Rather, we provide a set of tools, scripts, plugins, smart contracts and other verification systems to help users verify specific addresses at the time of making a transaction, regardless on how the user is making that transaction.  We intend to integrate directly with exchanges so inputting a specific address will show the “VName” of the holder of the address. We are already working with some of them. On exchanges where integration is not possible, our browser plugin will automatically detect addresses on screen and show the corresponding “VName”. Other tools will be announced and released at later dates.   Demo?  Yep, we already have a functional demo on our site available. Try it out!. For now it only works for Ethereum Addresses and MetaMask is required for assigning a VName. Search feature does not require MetaMask. You need to use Rinkeby Test Network   NAME Token  The financing mechanism selected will be in DAICO format by issuing VName Tokens under the NAME code. NAME tokens have varied uses on VName, such as verifying a nickname, which makes that name unique and no one else can verify it; buying nicknames of 5 or less characters; and buying verified nicknames from other users in the NAME market. More uses might be implemented in the future.  Assigning a VName to an address will be free of cost (+5 characters, excluding gas costs).    Token Issuance  Distribution Token cap will be of 300,000,000 NAME that will be divided:  DAICO 62% - 186.000.000 NAME Private Investors 10% - 30.000.000 NAME Strategic Alliances 10% - 30.000.000 NAME VName Team 10% - 30.000.000 NAME Bounty 5% - 15.000.000 NAME Advisors 3% - 9.000.000 NAME  Platform: Ethereum    Token Sale Info  Dates will be announced soon!
