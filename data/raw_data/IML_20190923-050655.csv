We estimate this module will be launched, approximately, in the middle of the year. This basic module will be a combined service and market-place functions for tracking and sea-shipping with the block-chain solutions and it will be able to generate initial cash flow. This is the confirmed plan and vision of the Board.  2) To date, we are planning that after the launch of the MVP specified in cl. 1 and the market confirmation of quality, selected by the IMMLA strategy team the ICO will be held. a) In accordance with the plans that were previously announced, funds from ICO are planned to be used for the development of the following IMMLA modules, as well as for marketing and distribution of the product to other geographical markets. b) More detailed information and parameters of the ICO will be reported later, in the second quarter of this year, and will also be linked to the results of the private placement program and/or unlocking funds in the project's Parity multi-sig. The whitepaper will also be revised to reflect the changes and present the details.  1st Quarter plans  3) All issues with the unreceived tokens will be solved by the 16th of February;  4) The website will be updated and The official IMMLA blog will be launched on the Immla.io website this March. It will become the source of all official news and announcements. The telegram room https://t.me/immlacommunity will be the general chat of the Project;  5) IMMLA will start to publish, every two weeks, news on the promotion of product development starting mid of March, 2018.  6) In the second half of March, IMMLA intends to conclude contracts with the main crypto-exchanges for trading IMMLA (IML) tokens. The exchanges list will be presented in March.  2nd Quarter plans  7) In April, IMMLA will begin to conclude contracts with potential IMMLA users to participate in pilot program and subsequent commercial release.  The important changes:  Mera Capital (www.mera-capital.com) has become one of the full-fledged shareholders. In addition to owning a stake in IMMLA, MERA-capital specialists will be engaged as our financial advisors, including, if necessary, providing bridge financing. Olga Pershina, the Mera Capital executive partner will become the IMMLA IR-advisor.  9) IMMLA is pleased to announce that Vyacheslav Neunyvakin, the company's CIO and co-founder, strengthened his position within the company's equity and now becomes the owner of the blocking stake (over 25%). This move reinforces the team's motivation for the speedy development and successful launch of MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and the subsequent successful development of the whole project.  10) The changes were made to the position of the General Director, CEO. Kirill Tyulenev is now the Strategy Advisor on the Board. Vyacheslav Neunyvakin becomes temporary acting CEO and he will combine this position with the position of CIO in the near future.  11) The private placement program is determined by the limits of $ 3 million, and the threshold of bonus non-recurring investments of $ 50,000. The maximum bonus for the program is calculated for investors from $ 500,000 and above.  12) The next Board of Directors meeting is scheduled for the end of February. Any decisions made at that time will be noted and announced additionally.  Yours, IMMLA team",False

This communication is required by the responsible and open approach of the IMMLA management to best serve our community, contributors (token holders) and shareholders. All efforts are being made to satisfy the long-term interest of all groups, both our contributors and potential clients.  In urgency regarding the token unlocking it is necessary to notify the community and all the contributors in the following.  1. Despite of all the difficulties the project has faced: IMMLA is moving steadily towards platform implementation in order to benefit society in the progress of trade and logistics, as well as be mindful of our early contributors. Though the tokens distribution was related to the ICO success (which did not take place due to the set of objective negative factors) IMMLA accommodated the pre-ICO participant’s demand and released tokens earlier.  2. Since funds for the development of the project from the ICO haven't been received and the Parity issue froze the project funds, all the further development of the project in the next month’s till the IMMLA MPV release will be achieved with the new non-crypto equity investors (as reported in the announcement of 14-02-2018), so some changes may and will be made to the initial model of the project.  3. The liabilities associated with initial ICO due to its failure are under review by our legal advisors and equity partners, and the initially adopted ""36% reverse buyback model"" will be revised to a more promising model, to meet the interests of all parties and taking into account the interests of ""early birds"".  Also, a primary consideration, is in usability of tokens within the IMMLA platform.  4. We will announce the planned changes in the IMMLA blog and the official Telegram group, so that the community and the contributors can get acquainted with them and take a weighted and informed decisions. All changes that will be planned are to be included in the updated White Paper will be announced on the IMMLA blog and the official Telegram group in advance.  We remind you that we're starting the regular publishing’s about the platform development progress, so we believe this allows the contributors and participants the best understanding the prospects of their token growth and long-term course. From now and till the ICO period in 3rd Quarter the main and only official language of the official website and blog is English.  Yours, IMMLA team.",False

Dear community!  The tokens distribution for the participants of both preICO campaigns has been generally finished. We have only a few obligations, which will be acomplished next week. Please, check all of your wallets and let us know if you have any questions. Our great supporters - @Obi2024 , @Havin_a_daydream and @khatskevych and me - we are allways pleased to answer your questions.  In order not to be confused, everybody should delete the old custom tokens added earlier in MEW for IMMLA and add the new custom token with the new contract details as follows; Token Contract Address: 0x26Ab4e37a0CA037791C9C935a5691D63466BA487 Token Symbol: IML Decimals: 18  Some guide for those who do not know how to add custom tokens. Open your MEW wallet, you will find Add Custom Tokens, it is at the middle right beside the orange button once you click it, you will need to insert the details above and save.  IML will now be displayed in your Wallet (Note that your IML is already in your address on the blockchain, but this procedure is for you to make it seen on your wallet, with time IMMLA will approach MEW to integrate IML in the list of tokens so that one does not need to add customer tokens).  If you have any issue regarding token distribution please post it in this group https://t.me/IMMLA_unofficial admins are there to sort it out.  Thank you, Roman, the IMMLA team member",False

There is an update on telegram which i am pasting here as well.  #Update05122017  Dear investors and members of the IMMLA community. On the 1st of December, there was a conference call between IMMLA team and Parity to discuss about the issue of the locked funds. Below letter was sent to IMMLA team from parity as an overview of the solution to the issue. IMMLA team will continue to make effort to ensure that this issue is resolved while we forge ahead with other arrangements and discussions regarding private placement and coming ICO rounds.  “Hi,  was great talking to you earlier. As discussed, I'm sending you a follow-up with a high level overview of the solutions (new and existing EIPs) that are floating around at the moment:  1. EIP that addresses general cases of blocked funds: ParityTech is working on formalising these possible solutions and is going to publish them soon 2. 'Address specific solution': changing the Ethereum state for the sole purpose of unlocking Ether that are stuck due to the Parity multi-sig incident 3. EIP156: reclaiming of Ether in common classes of stuck accounts. Proposed by Vitalik Buterin in Oct 2016. Does not cover the Parity multi-sigs in its current form 4. Tokenise locked funds: Idea of creating an ERC20 token that equals some amount of locked Ether and make it transferable through that  detailed information on the solutions is going to be published next week.  Best wishes,  Fabian For the Parity team”  BTW we are expecting to see the announcement talked about above  any moment from now.  Thank you Signed IMMLA Management",False

Thank you for your opinion, Ramon Unfortunately, we were faced with problems that we couldn’t foresaw for objective reasons. For example: 1) A large amount of money was spent on marketing in China and and in other countries (for example, in Korea), where in front of the ICO and at the beginning there were restrictions on this activity.  We  could not even put the word ""ICO"" in the search engines. And because of this, a lot of ICO failed during that period and also we got into this wave of negativity. 2) When the ICO was started, a fake imrnla.io website was launched, in which advertising scammers invested a lot of money - it was the first on Google and other search services. So, we had to completely stop our advertising and start to agitate investors to be cautious because of the possible entry to fake site when investors could lost their money. And as is known, the ICO collects a lot of money at the beginning stage of it, but the solution to the security problems and transfer servers takes more than two weeks. So, we lost a significant part of the marketing budget for the failed advertising in China and the time witch spent on security. Despite of these problems, we have still successfully assembled pre-ISO 2.0. (even  the problem with Parity spoiled the impression), which strengthen the investors' convinced in the project and our model. So now we are getting ready for a private placement round and we are conducting many negotiations with investors. It would be better for you to understand that,basically, all ICOs that collect big money in a few minutes or hours - they are all private placement. Negotiations are being held for several months, then the date is set, the sail is opened, and the first investors simply close the ""order book"". So we are going to make a new round of ICO in the next season, to which we are getting ready even more carefully, so that the early investors could make money.",False

Am being positive and want to believe bounty participants will get there rewads eventually. Try to be calm    Leonid Khatskevych: Obi, [15.11.17 05:38] #Announcement15112017  Dear investors and members of the IMMLA community.  This statement addresses the following concerns: IML token issue, private placement and ICO, how to handle IML tokens regarding the issue of resolving the Parity wallet frozen funds, IMMLA's future plans for the development of the main product, the timing of the implementation of the main phases of the project and some other aspects.  On November 14 at 3.30 am. Moscow Time (UTC + 3) the meeting of the executive board of directors of IMMLA was completed. The topics discussed were aspects of the IMMLA activities and the consequences of freezing some of IMMLA funds on the Multi-sig Parity Wallet, caused by the situation from 6/11/17 (https://paritytech.io/blog/security-alert.html)  Despite the fact that the amount of frozen IMMLA funds is relatively small and is the total volume of investments raised in the framework of pre-ICO 2.0, the legal and market aspects of this fact have a significant impact on the previous plans of IMMLA. This is due to the obligatory use of multi-sigs both in matters of managing the use of IMMLA funds and in attracting investor funds, and in relation to distributable tokens.  In connection with the entire list of dependencies, the IMMLA team, expressing its respect for all investors and the community, is forced to resort to a number of previously unintended measures to protect the interests of the project and ensure its implementation.  1. IMMLA will distribute tokens to all investors in the project and to the members of the bounty campaigns taking into account all previously approved bonuses. However, the free circulation of tokens will be limited in part, until the resolution of the situation with Parity and partially before the completion of the private placement ICO.  2. The distribution terms will be extended approximately until 30/11/2017, which is related to the requirement to develop a new unifying smart contract, not tied to the vulnerable Parity Wallet.  3. Due to the need to develop a new smart contract for the ICO private placement, that is not tied to the Parity Wallet system ( or until the confirmed vulnerability resolution of this Multi-signature system), as well as the advent of the corporate vacation period in Europe (where the main potential investors are involved in the private placement round with which the company is negotiating) and Russia, the deadline and the end of this round may be postponed for a period of 1.5 months to 1Q. However, a final decision on this issue and more accurate information will be announced no later than December 10, 2017.  This is due to the fact that IMMLA will be doing everything it can to meet the previously announced deadlines.  4. Blocking the possibilities of using a multi-sig wallet and the probable postponement of the time for raising funds of private placement investors, forces the service development team to postpone the previously announced release dates for the alpha version, and transportation through the IMMLA platform, from the first quarter of 2018 to a later date. Specific changes in the release dates will be announced later, depending on the development of the resolution with the Parity Wallet issue.  5. In order to balance interest between liquidity for current contributors and IMMLA software development needs, and the ICO participants, free circulation of IML tokens for all groups of token holders will be temporarily limited:  - For the group of monetary contributors: Until the resolution of the situation with blocked funds of pre-ICO 2.0 involving Parity or until the end of the private placement of the ICO round, but not later than March 1, 2018.  - For the group of bounty participants - until the end of the private placement of the ICO round, but not later than March 31, 2018...........",False

I classify the ICOs as ""Super ICO"" ""Average ICO"" ""Lower ICO"", and ""ICO shit"" The ""Super ICO"" are those that are among the ""Top 50"" of Coinmarketcap. (Excluding BTC, LTC, ETH, XRP and other currencies). These ICOs oscillate in the market between 120 to 250 Million USS. AS ""Average ICO"" are those below the Top 50, but are among the ""top 100"". These oscillate between 30 and 120 Million USS. The ""Low ICO"" are those that oscillate between 5 and 35 Million USS. And the ""Shit ICO"" are the ones that fall from 5 Million down .... Which for me is not even worth looking at ...  Needless to say, investing in an ICO today can be considered an extreme investment and VERY risky ... regardless of how good the project and the prospects it offers in the future. And even more when we have much more ""reliable"" and ""solid"" coins such as BTC, ETH, LTC, Monero ..... Which has the prospect that they can yield more between 100% ... 200% to 300% this year or soon. (And with much less risk in relation to any of these ICOs in the market). So for an ICO launched today to be ""attractive"" enough to be able to raise a fair amount of investor funds, it has to offer the prospect that it can value ""at least""  500% in a short space of a time for really worth the risk return to investors. Or it is better to keep your funds in the main currencies, in BTC, ETH, LTC ... It already has perspective of yielding well and with much less risks ..... The possibility of earning a very HIGH valuation was precisely what attracted the thousands of investors this year to the ICOs ... But now, with this huge amount of projects to choose from, new money is being ""watered down"", and few projects have seen more growth and higher appreciation than from the beginning until the middle of that year ... The risk simply is not compensating anymore, because you do not see more the great valuations of before ...  IMMLA wants to create 434 477 177 IML Tokens on the market. And receive more than 120 thousand ETHs from investors ... This means that each IML token would begin on the market at today's values costing around US $ 0.09. (with 1 ETH = 320 USS) Then its total marketcap this project would be close to 40 million dollars, which would already put it in the beginning among the ""Top 100"" market ... So you would not have the slightest chance of expecting recovery of 1000% ... or 500% .... or 300% ...... Even 100% appreciation in the price of the IML Token to that amount would already put it in the TOP 50 .... So already starts with little margin of appreciation in the near future ... Not that 100% is a bad valuation ... or low .... or 50% ...... or 10% ......... Compared with other investments in the market out there .... But in the case of ICO Tokens, if the valuation is not extremely high, it has no sense in investing in this market .... It is not worth losing everything because of 10% ..Or the IMMLA reduces ... or ""burns"" a good part of these Tokens to give more value to each on,  or I see no reason to see a ""rain"" of investors interested in buying all those Tokens that they want to sell .... Everyone continues to wonder why investors rained with MILLIONS in projects of the most RIDICULOUS possible ...... While good projects, and with good ideas did not get so many investors or sell many tokens ... The IMMLA team should understand the following. The reality is that during the ICO phase, the project itself DOES NOT MATTER fo ....  The reason why investors rained with millions of dollars in ICOs this year was not quite the prospect of the PROJECT itself ... The reason the token market attracted so many investors was the possible high valuation of TOKEN .... All see valuations in Tokens of 5,000% or more on the market this year ....... And for investors this is what matters .... The possibility of high appreciation and rapid for the TOKEN .... And not the prospects of the PROJECT itself in the future ... Unfortunately the truth is this .. And IMMLA does not offer anything attractive to your tokens .. Only for the project itself ... But this project can take a while, and risk that most investors do not want to run. The amount of Tokens to be sold in the market must have a value with ""enough"" space in which to expect a ""High"" raise in the near future. In the case of the IML Tokens, in the current individual value, it is totally IMPOSSIBLE for the investor to see those significant valuations that the other tokens had. 1000% appreciation ... It would be impossible for them to visualize this in the current amount of Tokens IML for sale. That s why is not atracting the investors....",False

What i do not understand is why the fuck if there is no code in contract there no refund. If IMMLA are not scammers they will refund pre-ICOs manually and then restart their ICO with blank list.  For now for pre-ICO investors offered 10% bonus and ONLY if they participate in next pre-ICO. Not in any case only if we will participate in pre-ICO. So IMMLA asks pre-ICO investors to spend MORE money if they want +10%.  So... ICO investors have been refunded just because of code in ICO smart contract.  Pre-ICO invesotrs 2.0 may never be refunded as well.,False

The IMMLA team appreciates the interest and support of all those who took part in the ICO round, who believed in our project and its ability to make better international logistics and trade. At the same time, this round of financing wasn't long enough for a number of reasons, so the large investors with whom negotiations are held cannot enter ICO until its end. We would like to give them more time, but we have a strict obligation to the ICO participants to finish the round and return the investments made, if softcap is not reached.  2. Nevertheless, we persist to move towards the creation of a unique logistics product. Finding the required investments remains the main item on our agenda now. We intend to use all the opportunities, which are given to us by the trust of our investors and the deep interest of potential users of the IMMLA service. In order to increase the pace gained in the last 4 months and strengthen positions in negotiations with private placement investors, IMMLA intends to hold an additional limited Pre-ICO 2.0 round. Its features will be the limitation of funds raised to just 600 ETH .It will start immediately after the end of the current ICO round. During the Pre-ICO 2.0, the placement price will provide a 43% bonus to the ICO price, and special conditions will be provided for those who invested during the Pre-ICO and ICO – bonus in 10% of the tokens. More of that our early contributors will receive 10% bonus (plus to their tokens bought during Pre-ICO 1.0). These bonuses will be paid at the expense of IMMLA team tokens (43% bonus - instantly, 10% - after the end of the round).  The purpose of this round of funding is to update the Legal framework and strengthen marketing for the Private Placement and ICO rounds from October 16 to December 30, 2017. The amount of funds planned to be attracted during this round is based on offers and negotiations, and ranges from $ 4.7 to $ 33 million.  3. The round of the current ICO will be completed at 16:30:00 (UTC+3) on October 15, 2017. The return of funds invested in the framework of the round will be initiated immediately. The Pre- ICO 2.0 round will be started at 17:00:00 (UTC+3) on October 15, 2017 and will last until 00:00 (UTC+3) on November 3, 2017.  4. During the Pre-ICO 2.0 round, new IML tokens will be issued. They will be combined with the tokens released during the previous round of Pre-ICO at the end of the second round.  5. During the Pre-ICO 2.0 there will be the fork of Ethereum, that's why the round can be suspended for a period of up to 24 hours in order to determine the major register.  6. In terms of investment, we are guided by the parameters stated in White Paper 2.0, so we see for ourselves the possibility of providing funding rounds in 2018, limited by the obligations of the maximum number of tokens.  7. The IMMLA team understands that our platform creates additional value for the international logistics market following by the reduction of costs of international trade. Therefore, we are persistently and confidently moving towards this goal, regardless of any obstacles that arise in front of it.  IMMLA continues its movement forward!  Stay immling!",False

They spoke at first about marketing expenditures of the current ICO, after which they were ""holding"" the campaigns to release further due to ""problems"" with the system ....... Only that the time of the ICO passed .. and they did not spend anything significant in the marketing of this ICO ... Now they talk about making a new collection of pre-ico to use the funds in marketing in the next future ICO .... They must have spent all the money of the first pre-ico, and now they need to raise more funds in this second pre-ico to ""guarantee"" the next ICO ... Now they can not go back .... Not even if they wanted to give up .... Either they hit right now, or they will face a big problem with the various investors who have given their money to them relying on this success na pré-ico .... I'm tired of seeing ICOs with projects that only exist on paper, and that there is nothing concrete, selling thousands of tokens ... Perhaps the confidence in project is a success was so great that they did not bother to be ""irresistible"" na parte da ICO e na oferta dos Tokens ..... I think the focus now must be on ICO and less on the project, because investors seem to like ""advantages"" in ICO, and it does not matter what the ""advantage"" of the project itself is. Either way or the team makes a ""shocking turn"" in the next ICO, or they will dig a bigger hole still, if they raise more funds in another pre-ico, and again do not get this all-time success ...",False

But I'm not here to defend this Team IMMLA ... quite the opposite.... For me the biggest IMMLA ERROR was precisely the excess of confidence in their product, and the lack of humility towards the market and the investors .... For me they were ignoring that because they have an INFINITELY SUPERIOR product in the market, compared the other ICOs, and this is would already be enough to collect THOUSANDS of ETHs .... and convince millions of investors ....

There was not even the SMELL of Soft-cap ... But I hope the lesson has been learned .... I have several suggestions to make that could correct and improve it .....Some of them were made by other ICOs that also had some ""problems"", but they were correcting little by little and they went very well ..... But I think my words do not matter in this ""big project"" ..... After all I am just a simple and humble investor pre-ico .... Anyway, I'm still on the boat. I consider that in the part of the project, it is one of the best and most professional in which I am participating. In the part of the PROJECT ...

And nevertheless the real situation for you as the preICO investor is the following:  there is only one ICO situation when you can lose - if IMMLA is not get soft cap.  In between softcap and 46000 eths - the share of pre-ICO investors within the total ammount emmissioned is the same or higher than it was assumed in WP_1. Here you win in the share volume.  If 46/47000 eths is rised - the pre-ICOs can fix their 43% profit due to the buyback offer for preICOs ones. Here you win in fast monetezation of your investments.  If IMMLA rises more then 46/47000 eths - you became the tokenholder of the bigger company with less token shares, but with more company's potential and bigger opportunity for token emmissioned to rise on exchange. In thus case you win as middle/long-run investor with bigger IRR opportunity.  The only you need is just to make the decision till the 22th of October.  You puch the comany, the campaign, other investestors and your own interests. It can not lasted for a long time. One week is enough for any decision. I believe you're smart investor and make the best choise.  And, ones again - I'm really sorry for the misunderstandig. Yes, sure, we should be more carefull with any changes in the fiture.

That´s not what happened in telegram and you were there. No one created hype. No one talked about a false site, no one even used the word ""scammer"". We were polite in every moment and you were there, even talking in private with a guy from our group. That´s why i know you know we were all from the same group of investors, and all of us were investors. No scammers, no phising, nothing related with what you are talking about here. And you know what? The group complaining represented by a few in telegram bought nearly 20% of all the preico. And we are now in contact with a lot more of people. I´m pretty sure more than 50% of preico investors are in contact right now outside your network. Don´t believe me if you don´t want to. There´s a reason why you are alone now. We the preico investors were your only community and we are all now pissed of.  But guess what, i´m not talking about telegram anymore. Because that´s a place where you feel comfortable. It´s our word against yours and it has nothing to do with the real facts that are important here.   The normal invest practice is the following - if the investor wants to keep his|her share in any asset in case of additional emmission, he/her needs to buy the additional part of that asset. That is the normal and traditional solution. Maybe it could be some benefits for old investors (not very big, a few percents usually) but it couldn't be under the intimidation or even outstanding pressure.  Right. Then answer me this simple question. Why the founders and team % remains the same after you doubled the supply? Why you received double tokens? You bought them all? Come on, we are not all stupid. You changed the supply in a very early stage, between preico and ico, and by a lot! doubles! what if you decide to give me half tokens keeping the supply intact? You see that right? Well that´s exactly what you have done, only keeping my tokens and doubling the supply. If you change your supply before investment for whatever reason and keep your % so you don´t lose value is fine, no one can complain. But if you do that AFTER receive investment under certain supply conditions you are stealing value from your investors. A lot of value. And not from just any investor, from the ones that took more risk with you and believe in you most!  Under intimidation or outstanding pressure you say... nothing about that was there, nothing, we didn't even start talking outside until you banned us. know why? we didn't want to hurt the project. But then you gave us no other choice.   Thats why we suggested buyback programm. If someone thinks we're scammers - get your money back with the garanteed profit and let them be ashamed of theirs words. Scammers never give money back. IMMLA is serious and reponsible business-project. We go forward anyway, either ICO successful or not, either the scammers make squeal or hackers make ddos-attacs - IMMLA is going to be stronger and closer to our targets anyway.  Your buyback program is fake because it requires a certain amount of eth raised to activate. You are raising eth for a month and you need people to sign for refund in seven days. It´s impossible to ask for the refund and know if you are going to get it. And lets face it, there´s no way you are going to rise between 40K and 50K ETH the buyback program needs to activate. And if you do, it will be long after the period to subscribe into the program expire.",False

I have no idea about that campaign and of course it can be 100% true. i do know for a fact that a phising website was on. I´m sorry about that.   Our security team made the decision to ban the most hyping ones just becouse of the mistrust in scamming group involving. But this is NOT true for sure. You banned people in telegram and it was nothing related to that scam you are talking about. And you were there. I think you are taking some truth and mixing everything and you know exactly that you are doing it.   We should to protect the most of the investors who hadn't involves in that destructive situation. There were around 9-11 persons who were disagreed, but only 4 of them were the true investors, who announced theirs wallets. That argument doesnt make any sense. You dont know how many investors were there. I can tell you this: Everybody you banned was an investor. Everyone complaining was. Don´t believe me i don´t care.   I'm in direct contact with them now, but yesterday it was very difficult to communicate since the scammers and hackers had attaced. I believe we keep in touch with these four and other true disappointed investors. You are not in direct contact with anyone banned yesterday and with no one i´m in contact with right now. And we are now a lot of people. You maybe are in contact with someone, i suppose, but saying that it´s like you saying ""everything is under control, we are in contact with every complaining investor"" so it seems you care but that´s a huge lie.   So, about the misunderstanding. As I said above to Obi - the public market invest practice is the following - in case of situation you want to keep your share in the project if the additional emmission comes, you should buy the wanting asset. But if you are not agree with such approach, IMMLA suggested for you buyback programm. If the conditions of announced buyback programm comes, but we're the scammers - why we would pay? But we're not the scammers, and we'll pay. Just because IMMLA is responsible project. Keep your profit and lets see in future. IMMLA has strong developing trategy and we're sure for our profitability for our investors. Yes, the ""misunderstanding"" is the only thing that matters here.  And the real misunderstanding is that you are mixing different things here. When an additional emission comes, founders and team doesn´t double their shares out of thin air. And you did, so this is not the same situation.   Respectfully yours,  I truly appreciate you are being here showing your face and answering questions with good tone. But something doesn´t feel right. You could have done this yesterday in telegram and you didn´t. You are doing it now when the ico has launched and you are at 0,1%. I would love to be wrong, but i think you are here now giving this answers because you are afraid the ico will fail hard, and you think it can fail hard because what you have done with pre ico investors.

But trust me you better didn´t, this is a huge LOL, you are saying:  We double the supply because we had to, you know, reasons, and everyone with tokens has to buy more if they want to keep their share!! its the only fair thing and how serious and responsible business are conducted blablabla.

We have tokens too but we don´t have to buy more to keep share, let me explain: Thanks to our work the company is going to grow so hard. The chinese people will come in, possibilities, growing, thanks to us! because we do all the work you know, the possibilities are here because we work. so we need to motivate the team! because big challenge! china and stuff!

We came to presale with a very strong consortoum members, advising board and with the core programm inside. I mean Logismart. That were not the results of preICO, that were the results of hardworking team. We invited the preICO investors to be on the board of big ship with the great potential. And we promissed them 43% interest for being the earlest birds among crypto community. That interest will be realised anyway if ICO gets the volume announced in WP v1. For those who wants to realize it. The rest level of ICO is like the additional emmission. That will give IMMLA the ticket to Asia in 2019. I prefer IMMLA going that way, but you - if you think the token price goes down therefore - could sell your tokens, or - if you believe in IMMLA - can buy more tokens of that emmission. That is the standard market behavior.  Or - if you or other ones don't like such aproach or think it is not fair - can think about the idea to keep the tokens share volume the mirror way in every stage of emmission, either highest level or the lowest one, as I've suggested above. We can discuss such approach and I will suggest it to our Board. According to such approach, the pre-ICO investor will be get more new tokens if ICO going the best way, or they should give tokens to IMMLA back for free if ICO going the worse way.

We have even won hackers battle.    IMMLA is the first open logistics platform based on blockchain solutions that is capable to dramatically change the way of contracting of cargo logistics. We are working on the same blockchain front as Maersk. This is a reason of a great interest to our project.  Speaking about great interest, not only investors are interested but vultures trying to steal money. However, about this a little later. First of all, we are exited of community support of IMMLA. Many pre-ICO participants, including the largest ones, supported us. We are in final talks with several major investors. It all inspires us in our way to create disruptive logistics solution.  We are very proud that ICO IMMLA started under difficult circumstances. We became a target for all kinds of jeopardy and fraud after the termination of Pre-ICO. Beginning with August, the IMMLA team received hacker threats, struggled with DDoS attacks, as well as faced all kinds of blackmail. We’ve improved the website architecture and increased the safety of its resources including smart contracts.  24 hours before crowdsale, ill-wishers began a campaign aimed at discrediting IMMLA. This campaign became a disguise of launch of fraudulent clone websites with mimicking addresses. It was planned to raise investors’ funds through these websites, while the main part of the team must have diverted its attention to struggle against provoked public anger.  It was caused by the decision of IMMLA Board to increase the volume of tokens taken as far back as August 2017. It was announced in advance through all official IMMLA channels. This increase was connected with the opened opportunities of earlier launch of the project in China. The campaign was mounted a day prior to ICO on a pretext that the share of pre-ICO investors washes away. Participants of campaign required to increase the number of tokens of Pre-ICO investors at the expense of ICO investors. IMMLA management flatly reject this requirement since it affects new investors. The investors have already had a benefit in the form of 43% discount at Pre-ICO stage at the expense of earlier entrance to the project.  “The current practice of the financial market means that if you expect to maintain your assets share in the total supply in the case of enhanced issue, you just buy the required amount of assets to reach the target value. Moreover, the holders of IML tokens can earn on its price growth, and the holders of presale IML tokens had a serious 43% benefit. Since it was obvious for the most investors, with whom we were in contact, we put our best efforts to reveal a real cause of the campaign and pretty soon found fraudulent resources claimed to be the official IMMLA website. 30 minutes before ICO, a new website — IMMLA.IO — was attacked,” told Mikhail Astakhov.  “When we revealed the attempts of fraud, we focused our efforts to enhance the security of IMMLA and investments of our token holders,” added Vyacheslav Neunyvakin, CIO IMMLA.  At the same time, respecting the interests of all its investors, IMMLA launched a program of buyback of tokens of those Pre-ICO investors, who decided to leave the project under the influence of the provoked anti-campaign. Buyback will be performed at the rate 1 ETH = 3640 IML, i.e. with the possibility to fix a 43% pre-ICO income. It will be possible to buy back after ICO ends if the volume of Eths raised during ICO will be equal to or more than volume announced in White Paper ver.1.0 (46 718 ETH).  IMMLA founders and project management thank participants of the community for patience and confidence. In case of any misunderstanding, please, apply to the representatives of IMMLA in the social networks or send e-mail to info@immla.io.  We are going on to work upon protection of IMMLA investors against fraudsters and permanently announcing the right writing of IMMLA resources. IMMLA ICO is going on. In order to invest in IML tokens, please, visit https://ico.immla.io, copy an address of a smart contract and make a contribution using your wallet. In order to make sure that you do not enter the fraudulent website, please, join the IMMLA communities in Telegram (English, Russian, Spanish). The communities provide for the most relevant information about ICO.  See the detailed information about the project in White Paper ver. 2.0.

You know we were patient and polite for a long time yesterday before we jumped to other forums after you banning us. Why we did that?, because we invested literally hundred of thousands of $ (yes, that much) in your project and all we wanted was things doing right and project mooning like any investor. Team had a chance to fix this but instead they ban us and screw us like this. Really, what do they expect? that we go home to cry?  This is not attack and everybody in the team knows it. Because the only thing we are doing here is bringing facts to light. When you attack someone you use lies and fud. Facts you (i don't know if you are team, if not sorry) recognise and are trying to normalize with that announcement, which is the worst thing you could possible have done.  About timing: We started complaining when we found about it. We found about it looking the ico numbers when it was about to start and were shocked. As simple as that.

The IMMLA vision of situation is the following - we've faced the inimical campaign which was planned by the group of web-scammers just to crash down teh official IMMLA site and community. They provocated that hype just to launch the false site imrna.io (I M R N A) and get the new investors money during the team was involved in that discussions. Thats why they called us as ""scammers"" - they were the scammers theyself. They just needed the hype to distract the team. Nevertheless some of true preICO investors were influenced with such a wrong arguments they had used, and we suggested for them the buyback programm in case if ICO be more successful than our previous estimations. This is the compromiss. On the one hand the confused preICO investors can fix theirs profit from investments to IMMLA much earlier then any another project ever, earlier than official exchange release. On the other hand they can stay the tokenholders of the more successful company, then the previous estimation. The normal invest practice is the following - if the investor wants to keep his|her share in any asset in case of additional emmission, he/her needs to buy the additional part of that asset. That is the normal and traditional solution. Maybe it could be some benefits for old investors (not very big, a few percents usually) but it couldn't be under the intimidation or even outstanding pressure. Thats why we suggested buyback programm. If someone thinks we're scammers - get your money back with the garanteed profit and let them be ashamed of theirs words. Scammers never give money back. IMMLA is serious and reponsible business-project. We go forward anyway, either ICO successful or not, either the scammers make squeal or hackers make ddos-attacs - IMMLA is going to be stronger and closer to our targets anyway.  Thank you Obi, ones again and again! You're really the true friend of IMMLA. We feel your strong support!",False

Unfortunately you are wrong in several things. Maybe you're not, but there were the people who used the situation and rised the hype for scamming new investors. When hype was started they launched the false marketing campaign with the links for imrna.io (false site with the old immla interface and false number of wallet). And we got the ddos-attack the same very time. Our security team made the decision to ban the most hyping ones just becouse of the mistrust in scamming group involving.

There were around 9-11 persons who were disagreed, but only 4 of them were the true investors, who announced theirs wallets. I'm in direct contact with them now, but yesterday it was very difficult to communicate since the scammers and hackers had attaced. I believe we keep in touch with these four and other true disappointed investors. So, about the misunderstanding. As I said above to Obi - the public market invest practice is the following - in case of situation you want to keep your share in the project if the additional emmission comes, you should buy the wanting asset. But if you are not agree with such approach, IMMLA suggested for you buyback programm. If the conditions of announced buyback programm comes, but we're the scammers - why we would pay? But we're not the scammers, and we'll pay. Just because IMMLA is responsible project. Keep your profit and lets see in future.

As an example - so if the volume is rised is less then 46000000 IMLs - let say 30000000 - IMMLA are to decrease the share of preICOs to make the proportion the same as in maximum level. The second part of your post should be described more detaled. We fixed the team bonuses on the same share level just becouse the team should bring the possibillity to rise the investments for our earlier China expansion and for sensors deve group. That is the big challenge for them which can make the huge dividents for all tokenholders, both preICO and ICO. So we decided to motivate them. And the founders share is the same because we use it for the upside motivation for the private placement investors, who gives our common project $500'000 and more. Our PP programe is only 30% of hardcap because the upside for this group of investors is no more then 30% (btw, less then preICO ones have got) and the founders share covers it totally.

Because of such changes the total supply of IML tokens was increased.  Since such changes may have effect to make the share of pre-ico investors less in total volume of tokens than it was announced in White Paper v.1., IMMLA suggests to pre-ICO investors buyback programm on the ICO token price to fix theirs pre-ICO special benefit 43%.  This programm will be realized in the case if the volume of tokens sold on ICO will be more than volume announced in WP V.1.

Get funds from investors, ok.  The pre ico finishes, and you used the funds to build the ico and promote your project thanks to your investors, fine.  Then you changed the total supply, create double tokens from thin air, and keep your % from the old supply, that is, you double your tokens, which is logical because if you don't do it you loose half of the value since you increased supply.  But you didn't increase the tokens assigned to the pre ico investors so they did cut their value in half.  People start complaining, you start banning them in telegram and delete messages. Not nice.  And now you tell investors that they can have their money back if they don´t like the fact that you cut their value in half. Now, that they have already paid the risk for you, now that you already have used the money, now that you don´t need them.  This is a huge red flag for your project as a whole. You are in fact recognizing fraud but not fixing it. Creating an horrible precedent for all your present and future investors, who now knows that you can double, triple or do whatever you want with supply in the future, keep your ratio and make everyone else poorer. And well, if you don´t like it, no problem, we give you your money back. The money that we now don´t need, the money we already used. You paid risk in exchange of nothing. Now you can choose loose value (not because the market, just because we want you to loose value), or to loose even more value. What will you do in further decisions, when real problems arrive?

It's a genius idea to have a decentralized system between the cargo owner and the cargo vehicle. These days, we need this service to end our frustration with shipment delays and damaged goods. We don't get what we are paying for when we'll only keep listening to layers of excuses. Now is the time to have a group to manage both parties. It's a no-brainer thing! The cargo sender and receiver have the right to know the condition of the goods while being shipped. It their prerogative. As for the cargo vehicle, the men behind the service have also the right to be protected against unexpected events while traveling. These men must be insured in case of an accident.  That's why; I salute IMMLA for this project. I'm looking forward for the team to flourish. I have no updates regarding their pre-ICO https://immla.io/?track_id=187289968 but I know it ends sooner than what we expected. I'm hoping more and more people will support them and will realize the big benefits they can get if this project becomes a reality. This is the kind of service we want whether we're an ordinary consumer or a big name in the industry.  People who are in B2B deals need IMMLA. This is their chance to assure the products delivered to them remain fresh and high-quality. Truth is, they don't need to worry about additional and hidden fees. IMMLA makes use of Ethereum, a cryptocurrency that will be inserted in their Smart Contract Technology. This way, all transactions are safely recorded throughout the period of delivery. No cash involved. No credit card.         ",False

Can you explain in details looking forward to hear from you.  Judging by a2bDirect whitepaper, their price optimisation proposal seems to be not transparent. This is number one issue in uber-like applications, that is called so: if you don't have great deal of transportation historical and current data you will not be able to calculate price offer! We have technology of forecasting and data from our BIG partners (Formag Fowarding (GTI), SBS, Hellman and we are in talks to Eurosib, Ahlers etc.) and our pricing model contains future Dutch auctions. Lets compare A2B and GTI (both are working in Ukraine, but GTI is No1 by market share with significant history).  We focus on multimodal transportation (i.e. truck-plane-ship-port) that reduces price or delivery time, when a2bDirect mentions only truck-container solution. Therefore, our ICO target is twice and a half bigger then A2B’s one, for which we plan worldwide expansion and all types of transportation available in 6 years.  What we see in comparison with A2B is that our team is obviously strong in the industrial multimodal experience. We are the multimodal-based crew with an understanding of where blockchain can be effectively utilised for the industry as a whole as well as for each of its constituent part.  Our team of experts are include Hellmann East Europe company, Global Transport Investments represented by Formag Forwarding and SB Solutions with extensive experience in the field of IT solutions for logistics. A2B repels from tracking and adds a block-chain-based process to it. Both approaches have a right to exist, and each of them will find his client.  We already have multimodal experience as the logistic IT solutions that are part of the IMMLA code have been tested and implemented in the B2B segment by our SBSolution team.  We are confident in their quality and in the professionalism of our crew as well as in the capabilities of our product in the B2C and C2C markets.  Overall, we perceive the emergence of two ICOs as a positive signal as it indicates that the market is ready for such solutions both technologically and labour-wise. The presence of a rival environment means only one thing: as a result, the launched solutions will prove even better for the market and, even more so for investors, than it could be if there were no competition.  The logistics market is huge, one of the largest in the world. We expect that new blockchain solutions will appear. However, the first projects will become leaders, as they will set flagship benchmarks for the rest.",False

However, our team are working on the detailed architecture design for such subsystems as payment gateway and IOT. Nevertheless I'd like to say some words additionally. The core part of the IMMLA code is based on the SBS (partner of IMMLA) ERP system for multimodal enterprises. Large number of world-wide freight-forwarders and logistics departments of industrial cargo owners use it day to day, dozens of thousands TEUs. Thats why the horison of project's time-line is so short for the first modules launching. Now the team works on the individual components such as carriers tracking and data handling. We plan to use Sovrin as an identity, you may find out the integration concept within the whitepaper also. And so on. The main difference of IMMLA from others is the multimodal transportation technical coverage and the counteragents transparensy based on the blockchain. There is no such a complete system ever. We won't to reimplement the existing and robust systems, we works on the newest and revolutionary platform where this services will be joint into the one powerful solution. There are a bunch of bonuses for end clients and for business partners. Our SBS partners are very inspired by this idea, they would like to use IMMLA to reduce high cost processes and inefficient manual operations. Blockchain can brings the new generation of relationships in logistic where transparency, immutability and reliability on the first place.",False

On 12th of July IMMLA announced the launch date of the blockchain-based online service for contracting the delivery of cargo. According to IMMLA management’s estimations, the service’s launch into the market will happen earlier than that of Maersk’s services based on blockchain.  IMMLA is planning to launch real third party transportations using smart-contracts based on Ethereum blockchain as early as in the first quarter of 2018. Thanks to readymade solutions in process automation on the ERP level, IMMLA is planning to surpass such market giant as Maersk, for whom transportation using blockchain still remains private development.  In October 2016 the Maersk together with IBM declared their intention to implement a supply chain management system based on blockchain. More over, in September 2016 they did a pilot test of the new concept, however, nothing has been confirmed with regards to further developments in this field.  Read more",False

Webinar on September 29  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4WIxEdBPjw    The mission of IMMLA project is a simple, clear and convenient interaction between the owner of cargo and the transporter on all stages of the freight transport. Furthermore, it aims to do so through the use of blockchain technology and smart-contracts, which would be used in the process of transportation and would completely eliminate trust deficit, information barriers and legal costs. It brings the development of logistics technology to a whole new level as well as it means complete security and confidentiality throughout the whole supply chain.  Website  IMMLA has the world’s best team of experts in logistics and IT, who have developed the leading ERP-solution Logismart. Step-by-step IMMLA team will create a multimodal blockchain forwarder based on the Logismart solution and the Ethereum blockchain.  The logistics market capacity amounts to $8.1 trillion, where logistics outsourcing is approximately $760 billion. IMMLA is about to earn 1% of the cost of transportation serviced, which is a revolutionary low price for a high-quality and safe forwarding service.  We are developing a multimodal deliveries service with decentralized control system for transportation, document flow and payments. We employ Dutch auction of carriers, GPS-cargo monitoring, cargo damage in transit and delivery time monitoring, insurance and credit activities to offer you the best possible prices. The blockchain technology eliminates the risk of unfair business practices and/or non-performance of the contract. We are positive that the spread of high-speed Internet on the transport routes, and the use of blockchain technology have reached the optimum level for IMMLA to be successfully launched.  The updated IMMLA strategy will be presented in White Paper ver. 2.0 that will be published on 11 September.  Proof of Concept is available at immla.dev-group.io and shows the work of the IMMLA blockchain. External monitoring of the IMMLA blockchain is available at ethscan.dev-group.io.  Proof of Concept code is available for everyone on github https://github.com/IMMLA/immla  Screenshot of pre-alpha version of IMMLA system:    Bounty Campaign Thread  ICO Terms&Conditions  In terms of providing distributed value for investors, IMMLA uses its own token IML, based on Ethereum blockchain. During ICO investors have a chance to buy 434,477,177 IML  The sale will take place among 4 lots:  1st lot: 170,053,520 IML tokens. 1 ETH= 3,640 IML 2nd lot: 103,725,856 IML tokens. 1 ETH= 3,549 IML 3rd lot: 100,319,718 IML tokens. 1 ETH= 3,458 IML 4th lot: 60,378,083  IML tokens. 1 ETH= 3,367 IML  Safe ICO  There are two possible scenarios in relation to smart contracts that are issuing IML tokens: 1) If the ICO succeeds, the IMMLA founders will receive 10% of the tokens that will be in turn frozen for 5 months. During this time, IMMLA is going to start servicing the first commercial transportation in the autotruck services market; 2) In case less than 18,000,000 IML tokens will be placed, the raised ETH will automatically return to the investors.  Timing  Start date: September 15, 2017 End date: October 15, 2017  Use of funds The funds raised during the ICO will be directed for the launch of: -a road and sea freight module in 2018 - “air” and “customs” module in 2019 - “forwarding” and “warehouse” module in 2020 - “railway” module in 2021.  In case there will be more access to the expert knowledge and budget, some of the modules may be launched earlier. Each module will include 5 components: · Web service and interface · Delivery analysis service (DAS) · Document management service (DMS) · Delivery tracking service (DTS) · Blockchain  Focus on the Asian logistics market IMMLA has rescheduled the service launch in China and its neighbouring countries two years earlier from 2021 to 2019  Core features of IMMLA:  Confidence and reliability  The decentralized system guarantees the payment to the carrier regardless of IMMLA’s financial condition, the same way it guarantees the delivery or insurance payment to the cargo owner. The terms of shipment, the current position of the cargo, its condition at the time of transfer of responsibility between carriers are recorded through the blockchain, and can not be altered by any of the parties.  IMMLA saves your money  The Dutch auction of carriers optimizes transportation costs. Use of IMMLA will reduce the number of idle trips. A cargo owner with high rating within the system gets credit and saves its current assets.  Easy-to-use  User-friendly mobile and desktop interface. Fully automated transportation and workflow, no need for third-party services; delivery options at your disposal; the service tracks the cargo online, so you always know where it is geographically. With an end-to-end electronic bill of lading, all the practices are able to see the full transportation history.

If this can have a chance to monopolize the decentralized logistics then this would be big. (I tried following you on twitter but it did not work btw). So far, i have seen a lot of promise in this project. But, there are still a lot of my criteria not being met before i would consider investing in this project. I will continue to follow this project. In the meantime, i will spend my weekend to study the whitepaper. I hope to see more details about the road map and its future partners. No community, Newbie account.  Highest risk to be involved in ICO is when it is just really new, like pre-sale ICO. It is almost like a lottery ticket.    Is there a way to verify is this a scam or not? It seems legit though. I mean, there is no way a scam artist would write the whole whitepaper just to trick a few people.  Am i suppose to contact everyone in the team to make sure it is legit? A video documentation would be a good start.  Is there a reason why you guys are rushing this? This is the 1st time i have heard of this project and you guys are already asking for money in just 8 days? It just seems odd.
