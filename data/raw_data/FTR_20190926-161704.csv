With traditional methods for recording transactions and tracking assets, participants on a network keep their own ledgers and other records in systems that do not always integrate. It is clearly inefficient due to delays in executing agreements and the duplication of effort required.  The FactR Mission  The FactR mission is to bring decentralized, immutable Blockchain technologies to the logistics and freight industry. We use escrow based tokens to process commercial invoices for logistics and freight transactions. Via finance partners and permissions based smart contracts on Hyperledger, we have an SDK enabled wallet that can be embedded on any web or native app (in a matter of days).  The FactR Aim  Become the worlds leading fleet and freight management platform Provide a trusted system and industry partner for freight interactions Enable logistics organizations with a trustless way to do business Provide an automated system, with built in security, scale and performance  Why This Will Be Successful  Transportation and logistics is an incredibly vital, yet complex industry. In a typical scenario, there are several parties, ranging from shippers, third-party brokers,customs agencies and the freight carriers themselves. This is coupled with a myriad of different systems,manual activities, required paperwork and regulations Blockchain has the potential to eliminate risks and payment transactions at each stage of the supply chain (or chain of custody) with transparent transactions. It offers all parties involved in the business network a secure and synchronized record of transactions. Blockchain records every sequence of transactions beginning with the freight shipper to the final customer delivery. A regulated industry such as this needs a secure, distributed and permission-based Blockchain which is provided when developed with Hyperledger and coupled with a secure and trusted wallet and exchange platform.
