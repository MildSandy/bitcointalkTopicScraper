Natmin Pure Escrow is a decentralized application that provides pure Escrow Services built on Blockchain Technology. We aim to revolutionize the Escrow industry by utilizing Blockchain Technology to facilitate Escrow transactions for a fraction of the price of conventional Escrow services.  Natmin is a self-regulating system that provides secure transactions between the buyer and seller with extremely low fees. Natmin utilizes smart contract technology to implement and regulate Escrow transactions. This removes the need for a middleman, thus reducing transaction costs and the possibility of fraud.  The Natmin Token (NAT) ensures utmost security and peace of mind between the buyer and seller. It is built on the widely used and accepted ERC20 / ERC223 standard using the Ethereum Blockchain.     Why use Natmin?  We live in a world where convenience has become the great commodity. Our time is precious, and anything that cuts down on wasted time is seen as a boon. Unfortunately, sometimes this convenience can lead to a degradation of quality. It's all well and good to offer a wide variety of products, but it's a vastly different matter to have everyone involved knowledgeable on all products. Sometimes the quality of care you receive is not as extensive as what you would get from someone who specializes in the product you are after.  Would you buy a big-ticket item like a car from a grocery store, or from a dealer whose job it is to know everything about the product they are selling and compare it to others in the market?  At Natmin Pure Escrow, we believe in a superior quality of service. How we deliver this to you is simple: our sole focus and specialty is Escrow services. We don't need to tie you down with unrelated offers or find other ways to grab your business, because our sole concern is Escrow services. We don't need to insert non-Escrow related services into our platform to make it more appealing, because that is not why you need us. You need us for Escrow services, and that is what we deliver. No gimmicks, no loopholes, no wasted time.  All of our time and effort goes into Escrow services. We believe this commitment and superior quality of service is what sets us apart from our competition, and what makes us the wiser choice in all Escrow related services.         The Natmin Token  The Natmin Token (NAT) is a digital token that powers the Escrow platform. It will be used to fund transactions between buyers and sellers. It also ensures utmost security and peace of mind between the buyer and seller. NAT is an unmineable token built on the ERC20 / ERC223 standard using the Ethereum Blockchain, which makes it a widely used and an accepted standard. The upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE) will be the only time Natmin Tokens will be created.  Demo Platform  We already have a working Demo that can simulate a basic transaction between a buyer and seller. Each registered user has Demo tokens to use on the Platform and test it out. Access the demo here: https://www.natmin.io/login?type=demo Watch the demo explainer video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmoWGiqfZrs&      Token Generation Event (TGE/ICO/Token Sale)  Our Token Generation Event will start on 1 September 2018 and end on 31 December 2018. We have a total supply of 400,000,000 NAT and 240,000,000 NAT will be made available for the TGE.   Referral Bounty  Structure will change. More details to be posted soon!   Contact Us  Please contact us on support@natmin.io if you have any questions.

Natmin Pure Escrow is a decentralized Escrow Service application built on Blockchain technology. It utilizes the ERC223 standard and will be released on the Ethereum blockchain.  Do you have a demo/prototype? Yes, we already have a working MVP on the Ethereum Mainnet. Please access it here https://app.natmin.io/  When is the TGE? The TGE will start on 1st of September 2018, and will continue until 31 December 2018.  Will NAT Token be an ERC20 / ERC223 token? Yes it will be built on the ERC223 standard and released on the Ethereum Blockchain.  What is the minimum contribution? There is no minimum contribution.  What happens to the unsold TGE tokens? A token amount equal to 70% of the unsold tokens will be instantly burned, decreasing the total supply. The last 30% of unsold tokens will be made available to be purchased directly from the Natmin Platform when creating transactions. This available token amount will be burned at a rate of 2% each month for a period of 15 months or until the available amount reaches 0, whichever comes first.  Will NAT be a utility Token? Yes the token will be used on the platforms to fund transactions.  What coins will be accepted? We will only accept ETH during the Pre-Sale and Public Sale for tokens that are sold from our website. Exchanges accept different currencies.  What is the Token price? If you buy directly from our website the price is 1 ETH = 1000 NAT. You will also receive other bonuses. If you buy directly from an exchange, the price will vary, and it does not include any bonuses.  Is there a softcap/hardcap? There is no softcap, so that means the project will continue regardless of the amount raised. Since the majority of our tokens are now directly sold from an exchange, the technical hardcap requirement is not applicable anymore.  When will Pre-Sale / Public Sale tokens be distributed? You will receive your tokens immediately after purchase.  Is KYC required? Yes, if you buy tokens directly from our website. If you buy tokens directly from an exchange, please follow their KYC requirements.",False
