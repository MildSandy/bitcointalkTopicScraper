This platform was developed 100% by the mifutu.ro team.  The Dapp is a purely decentralized Smart Contract Architecture that operates on the Ethereum Virtual Machine as a (global) primary and secondary Startups Tokens market place. This platform would allow simpler, faster, paperless documentation in the Startup issuance process, security increases in the ownership record-keeping, and trade executions, exchanging Startup Tokens for value without passing through any intermediary or central server.  We have implemented a solution to the screening centralized problem by using a Dapp Token (GODZ) as an economic voting system reward, giving financial incentives for people to participate in the screening process; and if the voters approve, the Startups can then launch crowdfunding campaigns. To be published and attract voters, a Startup creates a Voting Smart Contract and provides it with some amount of GODZ as an incentive to the voters instead of paying that fee to a centralized trusted third party. This amount of GODZ will be available to all voters in a specified proportion for the winning and losing sides, as a reward after the auction period ends.  Once the startup has received a positive voting result, meaning that the majority of the votes were YES, the startup is allowed to issue its ERC20 Token, and investors then can post bids to buy some of the startup’s Tokens. The Tokens issued by the startup will immediately be available to be traded in Godzillion’s Startup Market.  This Dapp is already developed and will be released after the ICO that the company is promoting. To use this Dapp, the users will need to have some GODZ Tokens. The GODZ will be available to buy this August 25th starting at 22:00:00 UTC, until September 24th 21:59:59 UTC. 300,000,000 GODZ will be created, and 210,000,000 will be available to purchasers (70%), at a Swap Rate of 2,000 GODZ per Ether.  It’s important to mention that this is one of the few Decentralized Applications that is running and ready to be published to the users (investors and Startups), after the Token Sale concludes.

What is Godzillion?  Godzillion is a 100% decentralized platform built in Solidity (Architecture of Smart Contracts) that operates in Ethereum's Blockchain, using a token called GODZ. It allows small businesses to be voted on to access a Crowdfunding market and to issue their tokens in exchange for GODZ. Investors vote on startups to earn economic incentives, then invest in these small businesses, and gain access a secondary market where they can sell (or buy more) Startup tokens. In this secondary market (Exchange) the GODZ can be exchanged for Startups tokens, GODZ for ETH and GODZ for other tokens issued in the Ethereum Blockchain (ERC20). Godzillion’s Dapp runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. It does not use a central server to run user processes or logs.  2. What is it for?  - Decentralizes the process of deciding whether or not to let a company publish its crowdfunding campaign through a voting system.  Investors vote using GODZ, to decide whether a startup will have the right to post its campaign. Existing crowdfunding platforms charge fixed and variable fees and centralize the decision whether a startup will be allowed to post its campaign. Using Godzillion's Dapp, a startup can offer an amount in GODZ as a reward to investors who vote, within a Smart Contract. Investors vote using GODZ and 95% of the reward goes to the voters who win, regardless if the outcome of the election is YES or NO. The losing voters share 5% of the reward. That implies that voting generates profit for the investors who vote, because after the vote they get their GODZ back, plus their share of the reward. - It dramatically lowers costs for users. In the screening of proposals (via voting), issuance of tokens (crowdfunding) and exchange of tokens (exchange).  The Godzillion DApp does not charge fees on the monetary value traded; instead each user only pays the ""gas"" required to execute his request within the DApp. That means lower transaction costs for users, compared to the traditional paradigm of a percentage of the amount of capital. - It increases the liquidity of this class of alternative assets. The dilemma today for crowdfunding investors is that after investing they are ""stuck"" in the investment.  In the Godzillion Dapp, there is a continuously operating exchange for trading these investments.  Because of that, the growing companies do not face the decision whether to reinvest profits or pay dividends.  Investors are not “locked in”. They do not need to wait for the company to pay them a dividend or be acquired.  Investors can go to the exchange and place a sales order for the tokens they bought and thus harvest their capital gains. That possibility of exiting and harvesting gains did not exist in the crowdfunding industry.  Now it is possible because the distributed ledger records both the emission and the trades of tokens.  The procedures for trading are easy and trustworthy, so an exchange can operate smoothly and quickly, with low costs. This means that Godzillion increases the liquidity of crowdfunding investments for investors increases.  3. Why did we create it?  We saw the possibility of overcoming two major difficulties in the capital markets that impact on ordinary people. First, the world's pension systems require more alternative assets to increase their returns and deliver higher average yields over time; and second, start-ups (small and medium-sized enterprises) need to access adequate financing to grow.  Those businesses employ more than 70% of the world's workforce and are not able to get much financing from traditional banks and institutional investors. In fintech terms, a big problem is that this type of alternative assets today is expensive to transact, and so has a low liquidity.  There is no streamlined record of ownership or exchange on a global scale. The low liquidity of these investments puts off many investors, because they do not want to be “locked in” to with no easy way of getting out of the investment.   The Smart Contracts in Blockchain solve the clumsy transaction problem because the emissions (crowdfunding) and exchanges (swaps of value) are registered without possibility of being modified, available globally and without the need of centralized intermediaries.  In order to decentralize the entire Startup financing process, including the voting phase that precedes a crowdfunding campaign, we created GODZ, which function as a voting token, attracting investors to vote by giving them a financial incentive. GODZ are also the units of value that investors use to fund startups on Godzillion.  And GODZ are also the native currency of the Godzillion exchange where investors can buy and sell tokens to harvest their capital gains and dividends.  4. Why use an ICO to raise money?   The objectives of our ICO are: - Sell the GODZ to the public and launch the Dapp with all its capabilities (it is operative and working). - Fund Godzillion's future implementation and development plan as a decentralized global crowdfunding platform.  5. And how will the funds be used? Over a 4-year time frame, 50% of the proceeds will be allocated to a Dapp development plan to add improvements, new functionalities and continuous security upgrades. 33% of the proceeds will be allocated to continue marketing the platform to Startups such as accelerators, universities, government associations and other groups of entrepreneurs, worldwide. Part of that amount will also be used to expand Angel Investors' networks of investors, venture capital funds and partnerships globally. 7% of the income will be spent, over the 4-year horizon, to implement joint work with regulators from different countries, crowdfunding associations, local lawyers and to assure compliance with practices relevant to the implementation of the plan. 8% will be assigned to maintaining and expand skilled staff and to fixed costs, And lastly, we have 2% of the income assigned to unforeseen costs that can crop up in the stages of development and implementation of the strategy.

We are going go step by step in the process of participate in a voting for one of the startups listed in this section.  https://medium.com/godzillion/godzillion-decentralized-application-how-to-vote-f1fdbb3af7eb  Why the Voting System?  In the conventional crowdfunding business model, the processes are to screen Startups’ proposals, then post the acceptable ones as auctions on their websites. Crowdfunding sites attract investors who open accounts on the sites and then bid in the auctions posted on the sites.  The financial intermediaries that operate according to the classic crowdfunding business model receive income by charging upfront fees and fees on capital raised, as they trade securities issuance for cash. The total fee can be, in some cases, more than 10% of the capital involved. In this classic procedure. the fee is needed to cover the intermediary’s operational costs, but viewing what the classic intermediaries do in a more prosaic way, is they screen proposals, and then when the buyer and seller both have accounts with the same intermediary, they transfer records from one ledger to another keeping the settlement process in their purview.  In Godzillion Decentralized Application investors have economic incentives to screen the Startup proposals.  To be published and to attract voters, a Startup creates a Voting Smart Contract and provides it with some amount of GODZ as an economic incentive to the voters, called the Reward, instead of paying that fee to an investment bank or some other centralized third party.  The Reward, an amount of GODZ, will be paid to the voters as follows: 95% to the voters on the winning side (yes or no) after the auction period ends, whatever the result is. Voters on the losing side will get 5% of the Reward.  All voters will get their GODZ back, plus their portion of the Reward.  So after voting the investors will have more GODZ than they started with.  We invite you to be part of our community on: Twitter | Slack | Telegram",False

From that 300,000,000 of GODZ, 210,000,000 (70%) will be available for participants, at a Swap rate of 2,000 GODZ per 1 Ether.  These tokens called GODZ are used to operate our Decentralized Application (DApp), a platform built in Solidity (Architecture of Smart Contracts) that operates on the Ethereum Blockchain. Godzillion’s DApp does not use a central server to run user processes or logs.  In this platform people vote, fund and trade startups 24/7. Startups submit their proposals to be funded with a reward and people vote to decide if will be allowed to post an auction. If the Startup has been voted YES, the Startup can issue their tokens and people can participate in its crowdfunding campaign. You can sell the Startup tokens at any time.  Godzillion DApp is already operating and has already facilitated the financing, via issuance of tokens, of four Chilean startup companies.  In order to decentralize the entire Startup financing process, including the voting phase that precedes a crowdfunding campaign, we created GODZ, which function as a voting token, attracting participants to vote by giving them a financial incentive. GODZ are also the units of value that participants use to fund startups on Godzillion. And GODZ are also the native currency of the Godzillion exchange.  The amount of GODZ sold will let us implement a road map that encompasses four main branches of implementing priorities over the four-year planning horizon. The priority activities and enhancements include specific activities to achieve Development and Enhancement, Marketing and Promotion, and Legal and Compliance tasks and milestones.  In Development & Enhancement our focus is to create new smart contracts related to portfolio management decisions, a smart contract that can manage functionality of a money market, even to develop a Decentralized RoboTrader, among other new features to the DApp. In Marketing and Promotion our focus is to bring Startups to the platform, because as soon as the GODZ ICO ends, participants will hold GODZ and will be waiting for Startups to post their proposals to be voted on, and participants will be waiting to bid in the auctions in which the Startups seek to issue tokens.  We already have a list of more than 50 startups worldwide to publish.  The team is led by CEO Rodrigo Sainz, and COO Cristobal Pereira, both Chilean entrepreneurs with more than 20 years combined experience in the financial and tech sector in Latin America and Europe. They have been working together since they founded mifutu.ro in the year 2013, a company that has created and implemented two platforms in the fintech sector.  Our company has also been funded by angel and venture capital funds from Chile and Europe. People with expertise compose the advisors to the team like John C. Edmunds, PhD Harvard and Finance Professor, Fernando Ventureira, PhD Phanteon Assas and CEO of Stratence Partners, José Luis Ruiz, PhD Wharton and Finance Professor at the Universidad de Chile, David Diaz, PhD Manchester Business School and Business Intelligence professor, and Roberto Darrigrandi, MBA Chicago and Economist.  Token Sale Process  The Token Sale process will start this Wednesday 23th at 22:00 UTC when we open the registration process on our platform at this URL address https://godzillion.io/crowdsale.html. During the registration process, all the information related to security and procedures will be available for the participants. The cryptocurrency allowed to participate in this process will be Ether.  Swap Price is 1:2,000, where 160 GODZ (8%) will be instantly sent from the Swap Smart Contract and 1,840 GODZ to claim on our DApp (92%).  The smart contract that will support this token sale will be a swap. This means that for all the participants that are registered and send ether to our smart contract, they will receive the GODZ immediately. In case the case that a participant wants to buy more than 20 ether worth of GODZ, he will need to upload just two documents that will be available in the control panel of the participant of this token sale. If that information is not available, the GODZ will be frozen in a smart contract waiting for the information from the owner. Individuals and venture capital or private equity funds are invited to participate in this process.  The token sale will be available for 30 days until September 24th at 21:59, and is not available to US Residents.  We invite you to be part of this Token Sale.
