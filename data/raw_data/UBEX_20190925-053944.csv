Bounty tokens are locked for 30days. What seems to true is that all these trades were done by private investors + team itself. Very obvious price manipulation.  In fact if you look at their smart contract on etherscan.io you can see that they only have distributed very small amount of tokens to the public. Its about 0.5% of all publicly sold tokens. They only sent amounts 10.000tokens and less. If you hold 50+ this will take a while. This is basically proves that all that high volume an big pump happened because team itself manipulated the price. Many people wanted to dump but 99% of those people dont even have anything to dump, because tokens are simply not even distributed.(they promissed distribution 2h after token sale end) Fucking retarded ICO. Very negligent and scammy team. Cant wait to dump this crap and never touch it again They never do what they promise but only constant delays and lies.",False

All this lies and ico time 45days delays without any notice. If you set a condition for ico then stick to it. If you tell ico ends August 15 then its your obligation to release tokens to investors. But instead they basically block your investments and ban you for asking questions. And not even better, they seem to be trading their own tokens and dont release tokens to ico participants. If this is not scam then what is ? It's not the first time this CEO Artem scammed people (google Latoken). What surprizes me is that they dont seem to care about their reputation. There is zero trust in this company. Cant wait to dump this shitcoin (if they ever distribute our tokens lol) and will never ever participate at russian projects..

Advertisers who want to purchase the ad slots can book a slot with the help of the Ubex system. Blockchain-based smart contracts help in reducing risks to the users. Ubex Programmatic advertising creates different methods for purchasing advertisements online. To make decisions about transactions they started using some automated systems and algorithms. These transactions can be done without any involvement of a human and by the uniqueness of a population, age, education level, income etc and behavioral data about users available for the platform and the advertiser. When a user visits a web page, where he can see the ads that are available on the webpage.  For the fraction of seconds, you can see website starts loading and the system study the formation of the audience of the website. Thus, it starts matching the data with the client that points and selects the proper advertising format. Later, the auction controls among the advertisers who point out the audience, mainly to the visitor of the website and to those who want to show their advertising on the internet. During the period of the auction, the highest price and the winners are selected in this auction process. The winner who won in the advertisement is uploaded to the website and later shown to the user. The total process of big data processing and holding an auction takes place within 100 to 200 milliseconds. The total amount of work is done by the algorithms and the results are controlled only by the human. As per Magna Global, in the year of 2015, the size of the global advertising reached $465 billion, $493 billion in 2016 and when it comes to 2017 it crossed about $500 billion.  Compare with television advertising, you can see the internet advertising is exceeded and reached a size of $192 billion for the first time.",False

There are several countries including the USA that aren't allowed to take part in the ICO so the only way these people can currently obtain tokens is via the exchanges.  Due to the current low supply (I'm guessing the liquidity's been provided by Ubex) this would explain the price discrepancy.  It's still very foolish to buy at this price however as once the ICO ends and the tokens are distributed the price on the exchanges will fall to at least the ICO price (and probably further if all the tokens aren't sold).

It just doesn't make sense to me.  As the token is now listed they could have simply finished the ICO as scheduled and distributed the tokens.  If they needed more funds due to the price drop in ETH then they could have sold the additional tokens from their '10% reserve' on the exchanges themselves, rather than by extending the ICO.  The only explanation I can think of why they didn't do this is because they're expecting a massive dump of tokens on distribution and the price to plummet.   Which leads to several other concerns...  Who is currently trading UBEX on the exchanges bearing in mind the tokens haven't been distributed yet?    On these exchanges why is UBEX trading at 0.000045 ETH/UBEX?  This is 450% higher than the ICO price.  Why would anyone buy at this price when you can still purchase on the ICO for 80% less than this?  Why did they wait to liquidate the accumulated ETH?  Seems very foolish and essentially gambling that the price would be higher on completion.  If they'd liquidated it as the ICO was running they'd have received the average price smoothed over this period of time.  Far less risky.   A further concern I have is that the ""Total raised"" counter on the website doesn't seem to be accurate in reflecting purchases using BTC and LTC.  I saw around a week ago in the ticker window that someone had purchased tokens with 2 BTC which should have added around 36 ETH to the counter.  It never seemed to register this.  The value didn't increase at all from an hour before this alleged purchase and never incremented an amount close to 36 ETH in the hours afterwards.  Perhaps these purchases are only added at the end of each day or something.  If this is the case it's odd because the tokens are credited to your account almost immediately as I found out when I purchased some with LTC.  Be great if a representative form Ubex could alleviate some of these concerns.  Personally I'm starting to regret participating.",False

Ubex are trying to raise an extra 4800 ETH.  In doing this they've given away an extra 10% compensation bonus on what has already been invested by the community.  Equivalent to 2400 ETH.  So if they sell all the additional tokens (4800 ETH), the absolute maximum they can be better off by is 10% (2400 ETH) plus any increase in the price of ETH.  If they only sell half the additional tokens during the extension and the price of ETH remains the same then they are in exactly the same position they are now (but down 20% of tokens as the unsold 10% would be burned).  If they sell all the additional tokens and the price of ETH drops a further 10% (only $28!) then they are in exactly the same position they are now (but down 10% of tokens).  They could have ended the ICO as scheduled and sold an additional 10% of tokens on the exchanges themselves.  This would have raised the same extra amount, would have kept investors happy and they would have 10% more tokens left in the reserve overall.

No tokens have been distributed yet so they're the only ones with access to them!  Once the tokens are distributed the price will immediately fall to at least the ICO price and probably much further.

Uncertainty results because advertisers are forced to pay for clicks and ads without the guarantee of real sales, difficulty in determining all available channels, and ineffectiveness of advertising channels after the budget is spent. We can list the time losing to find an advertiser, low earnings, unpredictable payments from advertisers, payment delays or non-payments. Ubex aims to solve the problem of low confidence in the purchase of digital advertisements. Smart contracts make it as transparent and fair as possible for advertisers and publishers (owners of ad space on sites), as well as reducing the risks for all parties the least. Ubex understands the needs of the current market and knows that it will take a long time before decentralized solutions are put into the market by applying such an approach, providing a pay-per-click plan, a pay model for targeted actions, the most fair and interesting model transition for advertisers. Google Inc., Facebook Inc. and others are only able to pass decentralized solutions in the very distant future, and this poses a serious risk for successful development. For this reason, Ubex supports both a fully hybrid approach to interaction with traditional DSPs and DMPs, as well as decentralized solutions, as well as multi-currency offers and cryptographic currencies. However, the most important difference is that Ubex is not only a place for algorithmic traffic purchases, but is based on artificial intelligence in a central role in the system. Although a number of projects, such as Exchain and MAD, declare an AI presence in their own systems, the role played by them is marginal. Ubex AI constantly improves the quality of its ad purchases, enables it to detect fraudulent content, and ultimately shows more relevant ads to the user. For this purpose, publishers' data mining is included as a function within the system. Ubex is a decentralized global ad place where companies effectively advertise, and publishers are able to profitably toss their advertising space at their source. Its mission is to create a global advertising ecosystem of common trust and maximum effectiveness. By using nerve networks and accumulated data, advertisers 'bids and publisher websites' interaction will allow a user to select the most relevant ad content at a particular time, maximizing the likelihood of getting the desired results. Applying smart contracts for all types of tracking will remove all indirect links between advertisers and publishers, thereby increasing the economic efficiency of the collaboration, which will help reduce commissions significantly by removing the intermediaries. In order for publishers to create an opportunity to specify their ad space, the advertiser will use the existing statistics in the exchange process to generate potential earnings and an opportunity to pre-aggregate if the rating is high enough. It will allow you to implement a system that scales advertisers to be stored with the full history of their activities to prevent fraud on the block-chain and to enable a mechanism for establishing relationships with the most trusted partners.",False

The user specifies the cost of advertising, or a percentage of the sale, as well as deferred payment. Widgets can be personalized by the advertiser and can also be provided by the exchange. After setting up the widget, the advertiser sets the rules for displaying the ads so that they appeal to the target audience as possible. In parallel with the settings, the neural network provides forecasts of the effectiveness of the customized advertising campaign. The advertiser can monitor in real time all the key metrics for the created advertising campaign.  Publishers can connect their advertising slot to the Ubex advertising platform and start earning as soon as the tracking add-on accumulates enough data about site traffic for further analysis by the neural networks.  The Ubex platform will provide opportunities not only to publishers and advertisers, but also to companies that need regression analysis of user data. The system’s neural core, which is responsible for making decisions at all stages of the life cycle of the advertising material, will have an API, access to which can be provided to partner companies.",False
