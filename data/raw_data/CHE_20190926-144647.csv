Mostly NEM is not a buzzword like ETH is. Many just know about ETH and think the ICO will lead to direct profit. In addition many projects on NEM start as community funded projects and therefore don't run an ICO. But I would guess  that the % of projects still running after a year is much higher on NEM than on ETH,False

Phase 1 is distributing Cache and building some great tools for our Cache users over the next few months. This has to be on NEM v1 (NIS1). I don't mean to sound presumptuous, but we are rather tired of all the ICOs and ""another"" blockchain projects. We want to build products and we want to get it in the hands of people now. We want to monetize now, and we want our audience to monetize now. We don't want hype, speculation, or to even be talked about by all the crypto experts on Twitter. We want to build useful tech that we can deliver now and then grow it like a business - we know how to run a business (and be profitable).  Also, we are using NEM v1 and Catapult (NEM v2), not replacing it. We are building layers on top of it. We are some of the biggest NEM fans out there.  Lastly we are a business and startup. Startups move fast, and are very aggressive. Also we are headquartered in the United States. NEM has struggled to make a presence here. We think we can help spread NEM tech to USA with Blockstart. NEM is a foundation and will never be able to move as fast as a business. This is okay and a good thing. So I see what we are doing as needed and I think we have synergy with NEM.  A Common Scenario  To better answer your question, consider this scenario:  ""I am a business and know I that I need to decentralize critical data. My customers are calling for it. Also I think assets would be great for my product, allowing users to buy and sell and trade them. I can see ways to monetize on them and grow my business. Unfortunately getting started with blockchain is far too complex. I also don't have the budget to hire expensive blockchain developers"".  Ok so we all know this company probably first looked at Ethereum. It likely terrified them. Then let's say they found NEM (which isn't easy to find).  On NEM's website they will see things like:  multisig smart contracts Eigentrust modular Smart Asset system Proof of Importance  A business unacquainted with blockchain will become confused and overwhelmed. They were interested in serving their business needs, but they were served technical jargon that even their best Javascript developers wouldn't understand.  Now consider even just the current version of https://blockstart.io:  The Sale So if a business is looking to create their own cryptocurrency for their own purposes, and they find nem.io and blockstart.io - which of those two websites are they likely to try first?  I'm not trashing NEM here, but blockstart will win every time - why? Because we know developers, we know training (how to make them successful), and we understand SaaS and business. NEM is focused on building robust technology, we are focused on getting that tech into into the hands of developers and businesses and we have the power to do it.   NEM is catering to people IN the blockchain ecosystem. Blockstart is focused on everyone outside of that circle.  Final Thoughts  There is no competition with NEM. We can't operate without NEM. We are actually going to help NEM gain more awareness. We move VERY fast.  - Mark (CEO)",False

Open Source  We will open source the front-end which is an Electron App written in React + TypeScript + GraphQL  We will open source the back-end which is Node, Express, TypeScript + GraphQL  This means any company can launch their own video platform/learning app - they just need to plug in their own video content.  This means that the community can vote on features to build into the main platform, and then they can build it.  Devslopes Decentralized  Currently Devslopes stores video on Vimeo. Vimeo is blocked in many countries (and Youtube and AWS).  We are going to decentralize video. We are prototyping ProximaX right now for this. Basically you would choose what videos to download, download them, and then can watch them. Delete videos from the platform when you no longer want to watch them.  We also want to decentralize meta data.  We will be one of the first major learning platforms to be 100% fully decentralized and censorship resistant.",False

From an automated process on our website https://getcache.io you can purchase Cache with XEM or using Coinbase you can purchase with USD, ETH, LTC, BTC.  What can I do if I have a problem purchasing Cache? It’s super easy to get help! Simply click the blue chat icon at the bottom right of https://getcache.io and we will be right there to help.  You can also send an email to support@cacheout.io  Which currencies can be used to buy tokens? From an automated process on our website https://getcache.io you can purchase Cache with XEM or using Coinbase you can purchase with USD, ETH, LTC, BTC.  We will also accept these tokens outside of Coinbase: BTC ETH XRP LTC XLM DASH XMR  NOTE: Transactions outside of Coinbase using the currencies above are subject to KYC and is a manual process. Please contact support@getcache.io to make payment outside of Coinbase.  What is the Cache token value in other currencies? We will have 3 sales: VIP, Private, and Public. VIP: 1 CHE = $0.018 USD Private: 1 CHE = $0.020 USD Public: 1 CHE = $0.025 USD  Is Cache an ICO? Cache is not an ICO. Devslopes CA LLC is selling or rather exchanging cryptocurrency. Customers can purchase the Cache token with other currencies such as Bitcoin, Ether, and XEM. Devslopes CA LLC is operating as a Money Services Provider (MSB) and must register with FinCEN within 180 days from 05/28/18.  The Cache token can be used by a customer the moment it is purchased at https://devslopes.com as well as through our CacheSDK or through the Cache Wallet desktop app.  Devslopes CA LLC is being transparent in the revenue generated from this “token sale” campaign and has established business and development milestones based on revenue generated.  We use the term “token sale” because we are selling tokens.  When you purchase Cache you are exchanging currencies and there is no promise nor guarantee for value increases in the token, capital gains, nor profits generated from the token or Devslope CA LLC.. Devslopes CA LLC is not issuing out any form of securities, shares, or stocks.  What will happen to the Cache tokens that are not sold? When the public sale ends the price is subject to increase and all remaining public tokens will likely continue to be sold until the supply is depleted.  There is no token burning process.  Is there a hard and soft cap for this project? There are no soft caps because this is not an investment opportunity nor a fundraiser. This is a promotion for the sale of Cache tokens which can be utilized today. We are being transparent on revenue generated during this campaign as well as how we intend to use the revenue generated.  800,000,000 tokens are available for purchase. If all of those tokens are sold then there are no more tokens for purchase. If tokens remain unsold when the public sale ends they are subject to price increase. Our goal is to sell them all until they are all in circulation.  There is no token burning process.  When will Cache tokens be available on exchanges? We don’t know. Our plan is to work aggressively to expand adoption of Cache. Such work includes getting developers and companies to use Cache and our SDKs as well as approaching exchanges. If you are interested in the future of Cache I would recommend you start using it in your own projects today!  Why does Cache use Coinbase? We are realistic. How can cryptocurrency become accepted worldwide if all the good companies get shut down and founders go to jail? We don’t like the fact that Coinbase is centralized, but we appreciate that they are making cryptocurrency accessible.  We use Coinbase because they adhere to KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti Money Laundering) laws. We can’t legally sell these tokens without KYC.  Can I buy Cache without using Coinbase? If you would like to purchase outside of Coinbase you can contact support@getcache.io and we can make a manual transaction. KYC regulation steps may apply to you, such as submitting verification of your country of residence.  We will accept the following currencies: BTC ETH XRP LTC XLM DASH XMR  Because Devslopes CA LLC is a Money Services Business (MSB) we are obligated by law to ensure to issue promised Cache tokens for any payments received.  Please do not send cryptocurrency to Devslopes CA LLC without using https://getcache.io or contacting support@cacheout.io to perform manual transactions.  A note from CEO Mark Price  There are no soft or hard caps for Cache because this isn't an ICO. We are selling tokens as an MSB (Money Services Business) entity in the United States.  Our token can be used today to purchase learning courses at https://devslopes.com and can be used today in any app/website that supports Javascript using our CacheSDK https://github.com/cache-official/cache-typescript-sdk.  We are working hard to pioneer legal token sales here in the United States and therefore we recognize this token sale will not be for everyone.  We also have a big focus on targeting developers and crypto holders outside of the normal crypto circles. We are very keen about onboarding people into the platform who might actually use the platform when it is launched.  We are an honest group of developers, teachers, and entrepreneurs and our #1 focus is all about developers and end-user experience.  Here are some of the things we have done in the past.

It's our priority to give developers something concrete to work with from the get go. We're so excited to get more tools and resources to developers ASAP.  Great question! We will be doing plenty of outreach to potential partners that we see as a fit in both values and functionality. As we build tools that break down blockchain's barriers to entry, we will be producing video content teaching how it could be used in many different circumstances.  With Blockstart, imagine if game developers were able to create digital assets with a few taps and deploy them in a game. There would be a finite amount of the asset created providing a legitimate supply & demand scenario. One problem in game development is that the game creator has the possibility of creating as many or as little of any asset or expansion that they'd like. This leads to a pay-to-win environment which, as I've experienced, is not always fair or enjoyable. Being able to create finite resources that can grow in value as they have a certain rarity is a paradigm shift that's possible with Blockstart.

It is a fork. We don't have the upstream connected if that is what you are referring to.  We are modifying this specifically for Cache. Being as active development is mostly finished on NEM Library we have cloned the repo directly. Aleix told me directly that there will be no more work on it, all focus is on Catapult. But we have a lot of needs and enhancements on NIS1 and this SDK before Catapult replaces NIS1.  We will be doing things like:  Modifying APIs surrounding Accounts, Transactions, etc to be focused on Cache Building more API's to make things simpler such as multiple block validations in single API calls Building in more systems around payments - right now the SDK is very open and flexible, but we are going to make it more focused so business and developers can quickly utilize it  We are basically refocusing everything in the SDK to focus on specific features we think will serve developers and businesses that want to use Cache.  Also we are very open and clear about attribution as can be seen in the readme on the repo.",False

We have over 300,000 developers in our audience. Every developer that uses Cache spreads its usage and value to some degree. We will be onboarding businesses actively.  The reason why ETH/BTC are so hard for companies and developers to work with - is because the tech is not developer friendly.  If I can talk to a business and say, ""We want to help you monetize with cryptocurrency, and it only takes a few lines of code"" then its an easy choice.  We have no shame in saying we are taking amazing technology, built by innovators and experts like our friends at NEM, and then making it insanely user and developer friendly. We want to bring blockchain to the world and it starts with companies like us using open source and for-profit models to make it happen.  So I'm excited to pursue this as a business, and help all Cache token owners be a part of this business.",False

If we used Catapult we would have had to make sure we had a stable network and somehow convince users to host nodes - all without harvesting and incentives. I don't think token purchasers would have felt comfortable buying tokens on Catapult yet.  But know that we are actually coding every day on Blockstart (which is using Catapult) and working also on nem2-sdk.",False
