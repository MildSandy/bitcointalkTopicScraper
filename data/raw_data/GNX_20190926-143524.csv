The financial industry in the game world is at the stage of formation. All existing exchanges or auctions are highly specialized. Blizzard company no have exchanges or auctions. But steam have. But he is too specialized. But it is too specialized and has a number of significant shortcomings. Time to market. Lack of currency trading. We are planning to create a real world-wide, fully-functional financial instrument. We want any vendor or user to quickly use it. Our financial instrument will have a lot of opportunities.
