This type of individualized service allows Cocoon House to meet the diverse needs of young people and their families in all possible ways because every child deserves a home and a bright future Cocoon House currently operates four shelters‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätwo emergency and two long-term‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand is the only Snohomish County agency that focuses on youth between the ages of 12‚Äì24.  One of the things that drew RootProject‚Äôs attention to Cocoon House is their work with LGBTQ+ youth. 32% of the youth in housing at Cocoon House identify as LGBTQ+. Cocoon House is proud to accept and respect a person‚Äôs chosen name and pronouns and is strongly committed to removing barriers and supporting inclusion and diversity in all its forms. They strive to create a safe and open atmosphere for young people, families, staff, community partners and donors.  The RootProject raised $5,200 for Cocoon House through crowdfunding. These funds will go to fund projects like the Intersectional Skill Building Program. This is a crucial element to helping young people develop the skills for adulthood. The program helps equip young people with everything from how to search for a job, to how to write a resume, to allowing them to relax and play video games for twenty minutes. Some Cocoon House residents attending high school use the program‚Äôs technology to help them with their classwork. The program is an 18-week series designed to ensure long-term success and assists participants with everything from personal growth to health topics and independent living.  Stephanie Almeida, Communications Manager with Cocoon House said: ‚ÄúWe are always looking for innovative ways to help meet the needs of some of our most vulnerable community members, at-risk and homeless youth. We are excited to partner with Root Project as a pilot project to use the power of cryptocurrencies to crowdsource funding for critical programs and support.‚Äù  Using the power of blockchain, impact investment and crowdfunding for social good is exactly why we started RootProject. We want to be part of the solution and use innovative technology collaborating with world-class nonprofits, like Cocoon House, to solve the most significant issues facing our society while assisting those in immediate need and ending cycles of homelessness. https://medium.com/rootproject/rootproject-fully-funds-first-project-with-cocoon-house-77664b56214c",False

Following RootProject‚Äôs successful token generation event, we are excited to be expanding our operations in Korea. RootProject‚Äôs token was distributed on April 20, and with this milestone behind us, we are excited to be moving forward with increasing our boots-on-the-ground in Korea and eventually worldwide. Korea has been integral to the success of RootProject thus far and we cannot wait to see what is in store for our future operations here. As we seek to hire for the international office, only three cities are on our watch-list: New York, Seoul and Seattle.  Since RootProject began developing our cryptocurrency and model, Korea has been in the forefront of our work. RootProject‚Äôs CEO has spent more time in Korea than in the international headquarters in New York. Anton and Nick started the ICO there with their first joint international trip, and that level of focus will remain. Jaeho has been promoted to Country Manager, and prominent Korean blockchain leaders have been helpful in beginning the job search for more Seoul-based employees.  Seoul is a pilot city for a number of reasons. First, pilot cities must be very large, for reasons having to do with social scientific inference and economies of scale. Seoul is approximately the population of New York plus Chicago plus Boston. Next, while many Western cities appear to be on the decline, Seoul‚Äôs pace of development has been breathtaking. It is the deepest crypto market, and its philanthropic organizational framework is large yet still growing rapidly and evolving. All of this makes Seoul the ideal place for RootProject to prove out, iterate and test its model.  The previous Country Director and the CEO did not, unfortunately, see eye-to-eye on how RootProject will be managed after the final sale. As a result of this, her and one other employee parted ways amicably with RootProject. RootProject is thankful for their work, and we look forward to supporting their future work, as they continue to support RootProject. Local governance is a value we all share in an industry focused on decentralization. However, the central pledge of RootProject was that of an expert-led organization. This can be seen in the first three post-sale hires, all of whom have PhDs in economics.  As we build our pilot city program, we will likewise be drawing from academic and policy-maker circles, so that the life-and-death work that is the point of RootProject can be maximized. But for local pilot cities, we will hire exclusively from local institutions‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot to play favorites, but because local knowledge is key to success.  In terms of timing, the pilot city build process must by necessity follow the international office‚Äôs build. Pilot city hiring will begin in Q2 of operations, both in Seoul and New York.  Not only has Korea been an important space in piloting projects for social good, but it is also critical as a leader in the cryptocurrency space. Anyone who doesn‚Äôt understand this knows little to nothing about crypto. As RootProject continues to grow, we are actively looking to hire some of the best in the crypto world, as well as charitable and start-up scaling experts. We are now hiring in Seoul as a part of our commitment to expansion in Korea. Watch for upcoming announcements about available positions and new hires in the coming weeks and months. https://medium.com/@nickadamsjudge/expanding-on-the-ground-in-korea-73963dd6e14e",False

Two groups even asked to take the entirety of the ICO‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpublic & private sales. (We said no to both, because that level of token concentration would harm future market support.)  RootProject is building a decentralized ecosystem that links communities and helps nonprofits. That construction isn‚Äôt guided by feelings and hope, but by decades of empirical economic and social scientific literature. Interested in how? Read our business plan.  The precedent we‚Äôre building along the way is perhaps more powerful than the work we‚Äôre doing. For decades, the nonprofit industry‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe third largest sector of the US economy by employment‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähas been searching for a way to fund itself. Industry publications like Nonprofit Quarterly have long documented attempts at financial innovation that would allow supporters to see a return on their money.  The goal of nonprofit financial innovation isn‚Äôt that complex: If you can correlate an asset with a nonprofit‚Äôs size and efficacy, you can put the full power of markets and investors behind true nonprofit behavior.  What has held that goal up also isn‚Äôt complex: Exotic financial instruments are expensive to build and expensive to evaluate. That priciness prevents the creation of liquid secondary markets. It‚Äôs the singular pain point of the nonprofit industry.  Crypto removes those problems. Full stop.  RootProject is the first project to recognize this and to put a plan into action to prove the model out.  How you correlate a crypto asset and a related institution is a domain-specific question. But the mechanisms always are the same: Simple, credible institutional rules that link an institution‚Äôs size and efficacy with the supply and demand of the asset.  RootProject is not a plan to marginally increase nonprofit efficiency. It‚Äôs a model built to put the full power of markets and investors behind nonprofits.  Pull that off and it is a fundamental leveling of the playing field between the pursuit of financial profit and social good. The precedent RootProject‚Äôs success will set will lead to fundamental change in nonprofit funding.",False

The other cofounder, Chris Place, is a Y Combinator Fellow. Their pre-ICO achieved 512% of its initial goal, and their ICO starts on November 14th, 2017. The founders are taking zero tokens and no compensation beyond a reasonable salary.  The MVP When we announced our ICO, we promised our MVP would be delivered within 45 days after the end of the ICO. We ended up making enough early progress on it that we went all-in on getting it done before the ICO.  Today, we‚Äôre very proud to introduce the alpha version of the RootProject crowdfunding platform. We put a lot of work into the design of the platform. Your feedback would help us build a better platform. Your donations to our partner nonprofits will help house homeless teenagers, give technology that builds job opportunities for those below poverty and do lots more!  Because of the RootProject model, which links demand for community crowdfunding to open market purchases of our token‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand because we are rolling our platform out before the ICO begins‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäRootProject will be, to our knowledge, the first ICO where the token-issuing organization pledges to purchase its own token on the open market after its ICO, with funds allocated via a formalized link between the asset and the real-world organizational activity.  Partner Nonprofits As RootProject builds out its on-the-ground capabilities, we‚Äôre partnering with long-established nonprofits that have decades of experience in maximizing donor funds. We‚Äôre honored that they have chosen to partner with RootProject as pilot crowdfunding projects.  In the coming week, we‚Äôll also be announcing partnerships with massive national and international charitable organizations. We‚Äôre starting in Asia on that front, because we believe it‚Äôs important to demonstrate that this is a new, global model of crypto-powered nonprofits, and we don‚Äôt want to have just American nonprofits using RootProject.  For out pilot projects, we‚Äôre starting with three American nonprofits that have exceptional track records. A donation to any of these groups will meaningfully impact the lives of some of society‚Äôs most vulnerable.  Cocoon House helps homeless teens in Washington State, with a focus on LGBT teens. Teens make up a disproportionate number of homeless, as abusive or bigoted parents force their own children from their homes.  Cycle Kids is a national US nonprofit. They provide bikes to impoverished youths. Lack of transportation is a powerful deterrent to pursuing education and employment for those stuck in extreme poverty. Cycle Kids‚Äô years of experience leveraging the simple gift of a bicycle to promote health, education and self-confidence is a good example why we partner with long-established nonprofits. Even ‚Äúsimple‚Äù tasks like giving someone access to transportation, especially when dealing with at-risk communties, can be refined in a way that meaningfully affects social outcomes.  Tech Goes Home is partnering with RootProject to give laptops and basic tech literacy to children below the poverty line. Its goal is to make Boston the first major city to completely eliminate the digital divide.  Next Steps The MVP is a simple crowdfunding platform. After the ICO we‚Äôll be building out our on-the-ground organization and adding to the MVP important decentralized governance & participatory structures, powered by ROOTS tokens.  Scaling RootProject‚Äôs own on-the-ground organizations will take years. Building out the academic boards of experts alone will take months, given how many cross-field questions we face. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre partnering with already-existing nonprofits. The announcement of our pilot partners is above. There‚Äôs lots more coming. In particular, truly massive philanthropy organizations and heads of internationally famous nonprofits have agreed to work with us.  Some of these are even household names. We‚Äôll be announcing these larger groups on a one-by-one basis throughout the ICO.  Changed ICO Dates We very recently began our investor roadshow. Our big first focus was going to be on China, but obviously that changed. Funny story‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähave you ever taken a fifteen hour flight, followed by two hours of travel to a hotel, in order to present your ICO to Chinese investors, only to finally get connectivity and read that China has banned all ICOs? That was the actual timing of it for me.  In discussing the MVP and how we adapt to the China shift with other CEOs of token-issuing organizations, Simon Yu, CEO of StormX, suggested we push the ICO back. We were initially hesitent, but Storm‚Äôs ICO is the hot ICO out there right now, and I‚Äôve got very high respect for Simon as a friend and successful leader. We consulted with our lawyers and major stakeholders: Between our MVP being ready ahead of schedule, major ninternational charity partners coming on board, and the shifts in the global market, the only reasonable conclusion was to move the ICO.  The new dates for the ICO will on November 14‚Äì17th, 2017. We will expedite token delivery, so as to not delay the release of the token for those that participated in the pre-ICO.  In addition, we decided it was appropriate to award another 10% bonus to those that participated in the pre-ICO. We will take this 10% out of the hard cap.  Token Purchases and Bonus Structure Our pre-ICO was conducted in Ether. You can now use Bitcoin and fiat to purchase ROOTS, as well. You can do so by going to RootProject.co and clicking on the ‚ÄúPurchase Roots Tokens‚Äù campaign.  Token Design Finally, after a lot of tweaks, we settled on our final token design. We wanted something that communicated the crypto token plus community and hope, while retaining the seriousness of the work on which we‚Äôre focused. We hope you like it!  A special thanks to our graphic designers, Aline, Alex and Fernando, who have a much more sophisticated eye than us techies!",False

Taxes are a huge problem for those involved in the cryptocommunity since it works both ways. Making profit costs you money. Losing (which isn't quite hard in this last weeks with all the bears on the road) also costs you money. I've invested some eth instantly, but decided to throw in some extra after the recent Sec repport (https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-131). Let's be honest, non of us like to pay Taxes.  The current pre-ico ends in one day, so there's still time to invest and to have some money secured as a hedge against the possible BTC and alt crash after the 1st of August. Since I don't expect BTC and the markets to fall more then 50%, it's a safe bet. Even if the price dumps 50%, you still didn't loose. I also suggest taking a look at their Slack to see how development is going. At this moment the team already suprised me with new developments every day. One of the examples is the fact they already rolled out a smart contract to send pre-ico investors IOU-tokens. This originally wasn't planned but IMO shows the dedication to the project. The video explains a lot, including info about the tax deductions. This project could help the community while helping others. The cry for charity is often heard, but there's a lack of project with another focus then solely making profits. I hope this project may bring a positive change and sets an example for the community.  ",False

That is a great answer to the question about US taking less action.  You also nailed the RootProject's central idea - aligning the interests of investors and the poor. Large firms or individuals can do charity and get profit from doing it, since ROOTS is an appreciating asset.",False

I think that the whitepaper wrote about pilot projects in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Those projects do not use any crypto currency. Am I correct to assume that the Albuquerque program was used as an inspiration for RootProject?  Also, another thing. RootProjects claims to have found a name that alligns the interests of investors and the poor. Could your team provide other examples of concepts, that have done same thing?",False

It's been a huge success - reduced homelessness immensely.  The program is now being replicated across different states in USA.  You can read more about the program here: https://www.cabq.gov/mayor/priorities-initiatives/initiatives/theres-a-better-way  RootProject essentially takes the idea and ""puts it on steroids"". ROOTS is a way to align the interests of investors and the poor, and thus those programs will be much better financed.",False

Not only the displaced and impoverished get to live a more dignified life that will help boost their self-confidence and feeling useful and a part of society again but donors and 'helpers' will get the tax breaks as well, which is clearly a win win for all parties involved.
