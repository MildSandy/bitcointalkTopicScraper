After the beta version of our DLA Center is released, we plan on making a few announcements and updating our milestones/roadmap. Our outreach marketing campaign is also due to begin in a few weeks. Things are extremely early right now.  The legality is a tricky issue. As mentioned in our white paper, the need for a TGE is due to banking issues with cannabis-related businesses. Many banks refuse to take part in the cannabis industry. Although cannabis is decriminalized and essentially legal in many states and provinces, there is still a barrier there which will, most likely, go away with time. Banking problems will also hopefully go away with time. Thankfully, we don't provide cannabis ourselves, as we are developing a platform for legal/medical logistics/sales/b2b purposes.  Outside of the US, legality should be much less strict, which is where expansion may have the most potential.",False
