I'm the CEO and Founder Jason Sosa. Blackbox is not a scam. We are all real people with a genuine passion to make a difference. To date, we've received over 1,000 white list registrations during the pre-sale, recruited an amazing roster, prominent advisors, and spoke to thousands all over the world at conferences big and small. Despite our best efforts and personally investing over $100k of my own money, we did not hit our goal. Many of the registrations were either fraudulent or simply didn't submit the ETH. We're currently in the process of refunding the amounts we did receive. The ICO pre-sale registration has been closed.  Could we have done a token swap or another creative shuffle to spoof our progress? Perhaps, but artificial metrics to boost perceived value isn't what we're about. There was an early decision to stand strong on our values of authenticity and integrity in our vision, and for how we conduct ourselves. This is something I'm glad we didn't want to compromise on.  Over the last year, we've worked really hard and learned a lot. A team of over 50+ people went in full force expecting the market conditions to remain favorable. These are some of the most brilliant people I've ever worked with. Our fundraising strategy depended on crowdfunding to make this happen. Many small donations. We knew that our project was not necessarily investable with traditional private investors or VCs due to the nature of upending a labor model for the economic system. Our vision is to inspire and gather like-minded people to unite for a better way to work. We didn't want to build on top of the money over people model that has exemplified the way business gets done. We want to make a cooperative model between talent all over the world, and remove barriers to opportunity as a long term vision. We understood it was a big audacious goal to unify labor and capital and that it isn't something that can happen overnight.  The project started as a social experiment uniting people from all over the world to build the infrastructure as a connective tissue required for a ""decentralized future of work."" However, without a substantial investment from a benefactor, social impact fund, non-profit, family fund, philanthropy institute, or some kind of partnership, we won't be able to build the MVP solution or platform as planned in our timeline and roadmap.  So where does Blackbox go from here?  Blackbox AI will continue to provide information architecture for intelligent ecosystems as a consulting professional services business.  Blackbox Foundation will continue its mission, but the timing for an ICO doesn't look favorable right now. Q2 doesn't appear to look any better. Over the next few months, I'll continue to work on projects, speak, give interviews, and promote the decentralized philosophy we pioneered and inspired so many to contribute to this Future of Work project. One of the challenges that need to be solved is breaking down the narrative to something that is relatable and immediate, not 10 years in the future. The best way to validate this concept is to make a proof of concept on a small scale. That is where we'll be focused until the market improves. Real and substantial progress for this governance model comes from affecting people, not just bits.  We are always looking for clients, partners, and believers to help us bring this vision to life. To all the people that contribute to our vision and continue to support us, thank you. We will rise like a phoenix when the timing is right.",False

Jason Sosa –  Co-Founder and CEO. In 2002 he founded a music research service for radio stations which was acquired by Troy Research 8 years later. Went on to found IMRSV, a technology company focused on emotion recognition for media and market research insights, which was acquired by Kairos in 2015. Founded BlackBox AI, a diverse group of acclaimed Ph.D. experts, tech founders, and former executives focused on areas where artificial intelligence and blockchain can lead to a direct and measurable business ROI Ben Stewart – Co-Founder and COO.  Played on the 2011 UCONN Nat Championship basketball team. 2 years as Synthetic Equities Analyst at UBS Investment Bank. 2 years as Strategy Analyst for Carlyle Group. 1.5 years as Software Engineer for Betterment. Roland Schmidt – Partner and Solutions Architect. He’s been involved in the computer world since 1995. Physicist and former Sr Manager, Software Engineer, Solution Architect. Formerly at Whirlpool and Dematic. Tom Bowles – PHD from Oxford. CERN. 20+ years experience building companies and teams using a combination of deep technical knowledge, business development and finance (trading/investing). Matthew Knapp – Marketing, pro-growth hacker. Upper level managed at Apple, Yahoo, and Beats by Dre. Jay Swartz – Chief Scientist. Data Scientist with over 40 years experience working with Apple, IBM, Seagate, and Sun (Oracle). There are ten more team members listed with similar top-shelf qualities.  Verdict Blackbox makes the bold claim of being the “future of work”.  As of now, it’s more like a fascinating experiment, with tremendous potential.     “Blackbox token enables increased transparency, equality, and profitablility for the betterment of all. We are embracing change and using our strength as a collaborative community to rethink ways of doing things based on the common good, rather than the non-reciprocal interests of profit over people institutions. By removing barriers between organizational silos, we streamline communication, co-develop advanced tools, share the best practices, and gain interoperability to unlock a world of new possibilities. The future of work is here, and we provide a path forward into a new alternative form “  Risks     This will be based on the Ethereum blockchain which isn’t fully developed or capable of scaling yet. -0.5     The complexity of this project could keep casual users away. Founder Jason Sosa says, “As an entrepreneurial-minded network, we aren’t for everyone. We compete for hard-to-find talent such as data scientists, machine learning engineers, solution architects, founders, and most of all — we compete against the status quo.”  -1     The BlackBox Manifesto is kind of threatening. Hard to imagine big business not trying to do everything they can to keep Blackbox from succeeding -0.5     There are already several competitors including Gigster, Upwork, and Top Talent. However, none of them hold a candle to Blackbox in terms of potential. -1   Growth Potential     One of the most skilled teams ever seen in crypto. +3.5     Each organization inside the Blackbox Network will be able to exchange business plans/ideas with each other while keeping their own custom government structure or mold intact. +1     The low $10 million market cap leaves plenty of room for token value growth. +3     Already a strong community: 17,000 Twitter and 24,000 Telegram followers. (The company gave 2% of tokens away as bounty for marketing) +2     The name Blackbox is a reference to Saturn. Typically throughout history, companies that reference Saturn in their name thrive.+1  Disposition This is a top-shelf ICO that goes way deeper than what this analysis provides. It’s definitely worth looking more into. 7.5/10",False

Blackbox is comprised of three distinct elements:   The Talent:  A global group of self-sufficient professionals with highly sought after skills (PhDs, executives, and technologists) unified by a passion and purpose for the decentralized future of work (DFoW).   The Tech:  Blackbox OS (BBOS) is a collaborative software that uses machine learning to optimize people, teams, and projects distributed around the world. It is the backbone for creating and executing smart contracts by providing resource management, planning, value assessment, reputation, skill evaluation, buy in, and dispute mechanisms.   The Token:  The Blackbox token enables an efficient payment method and trust transaction engine for all members of the network/ecosystem. This is key for enabling frictionless transactions inside the closed environment. Additionally, interoperability minimizes the pains of vendor account management (AP/AR) for passive or micro-tasks that would otherwise not be possible across centralized organizations.

ICO project launching is a very complicated business, as you said it yourself ""MOST PROJECTS"" do such thing.  There's a lot of dynamic variables involve in ICO launching and those dynamic variables are hard to predict and changes every time like marketing campaigns, sales pitching where conferences/gathering may somethings move their dates, or some good events pop up out of nowhere but you know it's a good group of potential investors so you go there too and pitch there and that will cause delays in your timeline, and a myriad of factors.
