The Blockchain technology is capable of making online gambling open and fair.  The FairWin company has decided not to stop there and make their game platform on the Ethereum blockchain even better…  Faster  The main problem of the majority of existing platforms on the Ethereum blockchain is that they are insufficiently fast. Every bet is recorded in the blockchain system and players have to wait a few seconds and even minutes for every transaction and every bet. The game loses the lion’s share of its charm. That is why the FairWin team has developed FairChannel. Now you only have to make two transactions on-chain — when you begin the game and receive tokens and when you leave the game and withdraw your tokens. This way game speed is accelerated.  Brighter   FairWin is not simply a fair game platform on the Ethereum blockchain, it stands for bright and memorable games with magnificent graphics. A whole team of designers works on the visual aspect of the FairWin games. Even people who are not interested in gambling will not be left indifferent. At least, we hope so.  More ambitious  Since 2008 our team has been engaged in online casino games development. If our technology gains recognition in the course of our ICO, we plan to develop games on the Ethereum Blockchain as we consider that the future of the gambling industry belongs to it. We understand that the ICO is only the first step in the development of our company and it is an opportunity to gain acceptance on the international level. We hope that it will give us a powerful impulse for development.  More humane   Working in the gambling industry we realize that it has negative consequences. In many countries of the world casino activity is illegal. However, we do not consider that the ban on gambling is capable to solve the gambling problem. With the development of online casinos it became even more accessible — now it is possible to play in a casino without leaving your house. Therefore it is much more important to make gambling safer for players and to soften negative consequences of gambling. The blockchain technology minimizes the risk of swindle by game organizers and makes casinos safer. We hope to attract attention to our project and change the gambling industry.
