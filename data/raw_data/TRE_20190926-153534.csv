These businesses will now be able to join TRESARO and sell their own items for profit and to support various causes. All users of the platform can look forward to not just a wide variety of clutter, but also brand new, quality items for sale at affordable prices. And we are happy to announce the first retailer to join the platform — Jar Computers (http://jar.bg). Jar Computers are one of the oldest and largest IT retail companies in Bulgaria. With their addition to the TRESARO platform, users will be able to buy thousands of high-quality computer parts and accessories, as well as whole desktop and laptop computer models by renowned global brands. Jar Computers will be donating 10–15% of price of each item they successfully sell on TRESARO. About TRESARO Founded in Europe, TRESARO will be the world’s first blockchain-based marketplace platform that combines three sectors: e-commerce, crowdfunding, and charity. The innovative sales, crowdsourcing, and fundraising platform will revolutionize the way people and charities support each other, trade and donate. TRESARO plans to use blockchain to build a global, self-regulating economic marketplace. The project will give new value to otherwise unneeded items via the ERC-20 token TRE. People and businesses will be able to buy and sell goods with the option of donating TRE to their favorite charity or a cause. TRESARO will provide a trust rating to every charity and crowdfunding initiative, even to each user, based on their previous behavior on the platform. The European startup was founded in 2017.

How many people are searching for money for a sick friend ? First we will target them. They don't have resources and tools to build good campaigns. TRESARO is just that - a tool that can help you run a successful campaign. When you make a campaign in TRESARO you actually make a web shop where people can buy and sell items in your favor, then you just need to share the link to that web shop to your friends and to people online. This is a very powerful tool for small campaigns. Also we build trust in them, something they lack. Also this helps us spread the word about TRESARO, everywhere people post their campaign link people will see what TRESARO is. And believe me, small campaigns will post it as much as possible. Then the big charity names will come. For them we will have a special team to invite them. We will setup their pages (this is also possible for all campaigns) and the only thing they need to do is collect and spend the donations. This is how we are going to attract charities and crowdfunding campaigns.  The first sellers will be the friends of the people who runs the small campaigns and people that are just for the crypto. When a friend of yours come with a request for help will you take your time and post a unnneded item in his favor ? You will. Then your frineds will do it as well. Thats how small charities operates - word of mout.  Buyers will be atracted by the items and by the will to help. If you need a phone from where you will buy it ? From a big retailer where you dont know where your money will go or from a charity and help somebody ?    Of course, when the big charity names come to the platform they will bring their userbase with them. Every charity comes with a userbase that will start selling and buying stuff.  In the mean time TRESARO will be promoted everywhere.  And thats just small part of how we will attract users. We are updating our WP with more info.  ",False

A marketplace where people buy and sell clutter, while helping charities and crowdfunding initiatives. Clutter is all the things we no longer need. All those items and products that clutter up our house. We can’t just throw them away because they’re perfectly fine and still worth something to somebody.  TRESARO gives new value to old clutter via the ERC-20 token TRE. People can now buy and sell clutter with the option of donating TRE to their favorite charity. TRESARO will provide a trust rating to every charity and crowdfunding initiative, even to each user, based on their previous behavior on the platform. TRESARO's blockchain will offer passive income perks by allowing token holders to earn and donate even more TRE by running a node.  Most people are inherently altruistic. They really want to support crowdfunding initiatives and donate to charities, but they never get around to doing it. TRESARO creates a whole new way of supporting charities by making it much easier and profitable for everyone. Now there’s no excuse to keep holding on to your clutter!   Why TRESARO?

You will do it with items you no longer need. For example, if you have a friend that needs a medical treatment what you gonna do to help him ? The obvious answer is that you will start asking people you know for donations. But not everybody will give you his hard earned cash. At the end people will give you less that what you need. With TRESARO you can setup a charity campaign, explain what is the case and put some items for sale. People can buy those items or they can list their items in support of the campaign. We all have unused and unneeded items in our homes. They just sit there and do nothing. But there is value in them. Somebody somewhere needs them and he will buy them. It does not need this person to know you, he will give you money just because he needs the item but in the same time this is support for your cause. This is how you will expand your local cause to a global level thus getting more support. People from around the world can support you just because they need some of the listed items in your cause. You will have a ""web shop"" like page for your campaign and you can send the link to whoever you wish. We will give you the tools to make your garage sale a big success.   And that's available for crowdfunding campaigns as well. An indie musician can fund his or her new album. A kid can funds his new bike. Endless possibilities. We are also currently talking with big charity names to join our platform. One day your old cell phone can cure cancer.  We think that people are inherently altruistic. They really want to support crowdfunding initiatives and donate to charities, but they don't have cash to do it. The good thing is that we have items. We just need a place where to do it.",False

Last week, TRESARO started its private pre-sale ahead of their public sale, and are expecting tens of thousands of TRE trailblazers to participate. TRESARO will activate a Relay Token with 2% of its circulating token supply within the week following the successful completion of the token sale.  A Relay Token holds two connectors of equal weight, one holds a balance in TRE, and one keeps a balance in BNT. This allows TRE token to be convertible with any other token in the Bancor Network, at a formulaically calculated price. The higher the balance held by TRE Relay Token’s connectors, the higher its liquidity depth in the Bancor Network, and the lower its price slippage, meaning that larger conversions can take place at expected rates.  “We are excited to see thousands of people and businesses across the globe joining our quest for improving how e-commerce functions while making charity and crowdfunding more transparent. The listings of the TRE token have already been confirmed on multiple exchanges, but we wanted to join a decentralized liquidity network too,” said Javor Ninov, CEO of TRESARO and member of the board of directors at the International Decentralized Association of Cryptocurrency and Blockchain (IDACB). “We are happy to be able to take advantage of the features offered by a project backed by industry evangelists such as Tim Draper.” TRESARO’s TRE token private sale started last month and had already initiated conversations with interested parties spanning from more than 60 countries across five continents. The public pre-ICO round is planned to begin in August 2018, and the official ICO will start in the first quarter of 2019. TRESARO will start issuing token emissions by the end of March 2019. The online marketplace will begin operating by the end of next year.  About TRESARO Founded in Europe, TRESARO will be the world’s first blockchain-based marketplace platform that combines three sectors: e-commerce, crowdfunding, and charity. The innovative sales, crowdsourcing, and fundraising platform will revolutionize the way people and charities support each other, trade and donate. TRESARO plans to use blockchain to build a global, self-regulating economic marketplace. The project will give new value to otherwise unneeded items via the ERC-20 token TRE. People and businesses will be able to buy and sell goods with the option of donating TRE to their favorite charity or a cause. TRESARO will provide a trust rating to every charity and crowdfunding initiative, even to each user, based on their previous behavior on the platform. The European startup was founded in 2017.  About Bancor Bancor Protocol is a standard for the creation of Smart Tokens™, cryptocurrencies with built-in convertibility directly through their smart contracts. Bancor utilizes an innovative token “connector” method to enable formulaic price calculation and continuous liquidity for all integrated tokens, without needing to match two parties in an exchange. Smart Tokens interconnect to form token liquidity networks, allowing user-generated cryptocurrencies to thrive. To convert tokens instantly, visit the Bancor Web App or join the Bancor Telegram group for more information.",False

TRESARO MARKETPLACE INVITES CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS TO ENROLL The alpha version of the platform will open doors to the first wave of non-profit organizations wanting to take advantage of the early bird perks offered by TRESARO  SOFIA, BULGARIA, June 29th, 2018 — TRESARO, the world’s first blockchain-based marketplace platform that combines three sectors: e-commerce, crowdfunding, and charity, today opened its registration for non-profit organizations wanting to accept donations through transactions made on the new marketplace. Due to its funding success, warm media reception, and the upcoming alpha version, TRESARO is now officially accepting listing applications from non-profit organizations. Companies of all sizes and industries are invited to take advantage of the perks available for early adopters and get listed on the world’s first blockchain-based sales, crowdsourcing, and charity platform. Users are also invited to join the revolution — they will soon be able to register on the platform, and they will be able to perform transactions, i.e., buy, sell, and donate. As it is an alpha version, users will only be able to pick campaigns that have been added manually to the system by TRESARO. Transactions in the alpha version of TRESARO will be done using ETH instead of TRE. Charitable organizations that pass a rigorous verification process will get exposure to millions of potential donors from day one of the platform launch. TRESARO encourages organizations not to wait until the last registration day, as verification processes can be lengthy and priority will be given on a first come first serve basis. Even though all users will be able to create and run their own charity or crowdfunding campaigns on the final version of the TRESARO platform, charities will only be marked as verified after passing TRESARO’s thorough verification process. TRESARO will allow users to support charities and crowdsourcing initiatives by selling the things they no longer need. The new platform will enable users to buy and sell virtually anything with the option of giving away TRE cryptocurrency tokens in support to their favorite charitable cause. TRESARO will utilize the power of blockchain to assist philanthropic organizations to get a new stream of donations in a transparent and easily accountable way. “We are readying our alpha version of the TRESARO platofmr for launch. Thanks to our talented tech team, we are ahead of schedule, and I am happy to announce we just entered a phase where we can invite charitable organizations to start the process of enlisting with TRESARO” said Javor Ninov, CEO at TRESARO. “At our launch, early adopters can start taking advantage of our platform before anyone else.” TRESARO is currently in substantial negotiations with multiple globally recognized high-profile charitable organizations and is expected to launch an alpha version of the marketplace in the next few weeks. The first version of the marketplace will be ready by the end of August 2018, and the final version will launch sooner than later in 2019. Non-profit organizations wanting to be included in the alpha version (and gain access to the perks available for early adopters) must express interest by July 31st, 2018. TRESARO invites you to take advantage now and not wait for the next open enrollment window.

Thank you for pointing that out. Let me break down that sentence in two parts so it’s easy to understand what we mean:   Quote TRESARO creates an entirely new way of supporting charities   Yes, we do that by enabling anyone to sell anything for TRE tokens, while setting a certain percentage of the profits from each successful sale to be donated to their favorite charity and crowdfunding initiative on the platform. Of course, they can also choose not to donate anything and to keep all their TRE token profits. But we at TRESARO think that most people are inherently altruistic and will donate when it’s so easy to do so. Think of it as a having a garage sale combined with donating to your favorite cause. It’s a win-win-win situation: sellers can get rid of unwanted items, make some profit and make the world a better place. What’s more, TRESARO enables any charity to hold its own “garage sales” on the platform, with 100% of the profit going directly to the charity. Another unique feature of TRESARO is the ability for users to easily run their own crowdfunding initiatives. An indie musician can fund his or her new album, for example. A sick or injured person can fund his or her medical treatment. All of that funding comes from people selling their unwanted items and getting rid of the clutter in their homes.  Quote making it much easier and more profitable for everyone.  Look around in your home and I am sure you will find at least a dozen items and products that you no longer use. They just take up space and gather dust. Why haven't you sold or donated them yet? Because it’s neither too profitable nor too easy to do so. With TRESARO you can sell all that clutter and donate a percentage of the tokens to the charity or crowdfunding campaign you like. This provides profit for the charity - your clutter helps their funding. The benefit for you is that you sold an item that previously you did not see value in, and you have some free space now. And you made some money out of it (if you donate only a percentage). And keep in mind that usually items auctioned for charity usually make more money than when sold on a regular market. We at TRESARO aim to take advantage of this - the incentive for the seller to sell his item on our marketplace will be two-fold: First, there’s the possibility to make more money by listing the item on TRESARO than, say, eBay. Second, donating a percentage to charity is very satisfying and fulfils an emotional/psychological need we all have, the need to help our fellow human beings. Altruism feels good, that’s why most people donate to charities. (There is a strong selfishness component to altruism, according to many psychological studies). When you sell your clutter on TRESARO, you profit both financially and emotionally. Last but not least, converting your clutter to TRE tokens might end up being one of the best decisions in your life - the more users join TRESARO, the higher the price of the token will rise. Converting something you do not need to TRE tokens and just keeping them in your wallet might turn out to be a good investment. Even the charities/crowdfunding campaigns can benefit from that.   Of course there will be perks for people who list items to support charities - this is how we will encourage our users to donate and to not only sell. Items listed to support charities sell quicker than the ones that do not help a cause. Take a look at our whitepaper. It gives you an idea of our business model.
