Even though I am aware that ETH blockhain is really robust and actually a pretty good solution, I am still wondering when do you plan to implement your own blockchain?  I have noticed on your website that you plan to launch your on chain in the near future. What exactly does the “near future” mean?  We are expressing that there are plans for it. We hope you can follow our project for future progress and announcements.  what would be your plans regarding your own blockchain? For example if we compare your future blockchain with  ETH blockchain (which is robust and good as someone already stated), what would make your blockchain better than ETH? When ETH is compared to Bitcoin for example we already know the differences between these two. And what would your new blockchain offer us that is better than ETH blockchain?
