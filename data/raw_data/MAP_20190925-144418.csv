Only a few companies will have experienced teams to be able to process and analyse collected data as well as offering professional services on top. We are one of those.  Having our own token is key to us building out our tech, paying our data collectors, building support, driving marketing etc.  The main buyers are companies in the autonomous vehicles, mapping, smart cities, location spaces. The autonomous car market is expected to be worth between $450 - $750billion dollars by 2030. By October 2017 already $80billion2 had been invested in autonomous cars, with the USA and China leading the market.  Thanks again",False
