Personally, I do not understand too much that having changed timmings of the project, etc., invest time in a wallet or an explorer that while Jibrel Network works in the chain of ethereum can be used in this same platform because they are already done and thus seek to optimize efforts to ensure that JCash is up to date as soon as possible, in any way, in a matter of partners that support the operation of JCash, it seems that they will be counted on ""in a few months"". Although after reading the update report, it is not easy to draw concrete conclusions, which is what as an investor you may need after all this year of corrections in the roadmap, etc. As it is well said in it, the stable coins that are entering the scene (that appear suddenly, are announced and WORK) are taking advantage of us after a year of exhibitions, presentations ... but without operative developments ... the key is know when JCash will have direct utility. When will it be in exchanges and / or will it have steps to fiat or direct applications in those terms? Thank you.",True

To better understand our approach, one needs to truly understand the function of Stable Coins.  Why did Gemini launch a coin? Circle? and now other larger institutions are looking to introduce their own.  The reason is distributed ledgers are accounting software. They track balances in a decentralized ledger. Nothing more. Outside the crypto-world, entities do not need stable coins to hedge against crypto-volatility, or as a mechanism for day-trading. The reason they require stable coins is to track real-world value, but using shared ledgers.  Jcash is a cash ledger that will power various blockchain powered applications and use-cases. If we want to build financial solutions, we require a cash ledger to start.   When will JCash have direct utility?  Jcash is currently live and utility will be promoted across two elements:  Target       Use-case       Approach Individuals       Hedging       Begin marketing Jcash to community Enterprises       Cash Ledger for Different Applications       Continue building pilots   We have focused on use-case two, primarily because compliance has been more straightforward and easier to undertake when dealing with known entities. In addition, the value behind this bucket is much larger.  Currently in our Enterprise offering, we are focused on:  1. Bond Issuance on Ethereum 2. Commodity Trading / Trade Finance / Warehouse Financing 3. Peer to Peer FX 4. Remittances   In addition, with the Jwallet and Jsearch coming online, if products have success and adoption, Jcash will be successful once incorporated as well.  Hope that helps.

My examples all refer to the screenshot which you can find here: https://i.imgur.com/4BDtwA2.jpg  Currently, 186.43 jEUR, 84.09 jGBP and 480.04 jUSD are circulating. Basically, this means that someone has sent ETH to Jibrel and received jCurrency tokens in return, so that they are now in use.  Whenever a jCurrency token is in circulation, it has to be backed by JNT. This can be explained best using jUSD as an example. At a current price of $0.10 per JNT, 4,800.40 JNT would be required to cover all 480.04 jUSD in circulation (JNT requirement = Circulating amount of jUSD / JNT price). For currencies other than jUSD, these must first be converted into the theoretical value of USD at the current exchange rate, because the price of JNT is also in USD and only then the JNT requirement can be determined. Another example: 186.43 jEUR is currently in circulation. However, you cannot divide this amount by the JNT price, since it is given in USD, so that the theoretical value of jEUR in jUSD must be calculated first. At the time of writing, the conversion rate from EUR to USD is 1,1635. If you now multiply the amount of 186.43 jEUR by 1.1635, you get the theoretical value of 217.91 jUSD, which you can divide by the JNT price of $0.10. As a result, the JNT requirement for 186.43 jEUR would be 2,169.10 JNT what is almost identical to the 2,168.80 JNT shown in the screenshot.  Solvency required is the sum of all JNT requirements (2,168.80 for jEUR + 1,098.64 for jGBP + 4,800.40 for jUSD = 8,068).  In terms of liquidity, any value greater than 100% means that more than enough JNT are available to fulfil the solvency requirement. A large value indicates that more JNT have been pledged than would actually be needed. It can be calculated as follows: JNT Pledged * 100 / Solvency Requirement.",True

However the team have stated several times that they are intending to implement these systems to make such transactions possible.  As there is currently not much information regarding the withdrawal of JCash via bank transfer, I cannot say whether JNT will be necessary for this or whether it will be burned. I personally assume that JNT will not be burned, but will be kept by the Jibrel DAO to ensure a higher solvency.  The team's last statement was that JCash will be backed 75% by JNT and 25% by fiat.

Thanks again to Neuthor for his answers, which I suppose in a private and personal way - if he is not a member of the JNT team -. I, anyway, will continue to expose my doubts in this thread opened by the Jibrel Network team. Many of us do not believe that a medium as fast as the telegram is suitable, but rather a forum where exhibitions are more leisurely and are perfectly recorded in time for anyone to access and take advantage of them. It is possible in days, weeks, months, the JNT team reappears with their great words appealing that if things go crooked, they wait for us with open arms in the future, once we change our opinion. Actually, I have no idea how you can be so disrespectful, paint your inattention to the color that they paint. It really is an imposition difficult to assume at the investor level ... but hey, you do not have too many options after having fallen more than 90% from the price reached on its release to the market. It is evident that this position does not stimulate the Jibrel Network team enough to address the doubts that this may generate for those who, trusting in their good work and their project, have entered into it.  Well ... the matter: We have already seen the JCash toy, its solvency test, etc ... now well: Why can we create JCash? Do you accept that token somewhere? Some exchange, financial entity ... something? We go there, we overturn our ethers and exchange them for USEFUL currencies? Is that what we have to contribute as investors, not with what remains of our investment, but with other investors? In the month of AUGUST, a member of the team confirmed in this thread that JCash was ACTIVE. Like entering the link facilitated to make conversions, it only gave options for Switzerland, UK and Germany ... later, before the normal complaints that it was not like that, it qualified that it would be ACTIVE for users of those countries 3 weeks, after which it I would be for the rest. Is it active now? They consider active a token that is not accepted anywhere ... or is accepted in many and we are not well informed  With little hope that this consultation will be taken care of, I leave it in the thread for believing it to be of interest to the community ... appreciating that anyone outside the structure of Jibrel throws a little light on the matter, in case of being able to it. On the other hand, a suggestion: If Jibrel Network is not going to attend your official btctalk thread ... why do not you close it? While it is open, the disregard suffered becomes quite difficult to grasp.  A greeting and Thanks forward.",True

Simply put, if you expect ETH to fall, you can switch it to stable Jcash to protect yourself against falling rates. At the moment Jcash is not accepted anywhere, but in the future merchants could use Jcash to accept crypto currencies by converting them to Jcash or accepting Jcash directly. There are also several pilot projects with financial institutions, governments and regulators in which Jcash and consequently JNT play a key role. However, these pilots take their time and understandably some parties prefer silence regarding the collaboration or specific details. Jcash will definitely not be usable on unregulated exchanges due to legal requirements, as most exchanges don’t take KYC and AML/CFT requirements serious enough. Jcash was rolled out with a soft launch in Germany, Switzerland and the UK to pilot the product with a small group first. Besides the optimization of the onboarding process, there are still a few bugs that need to be ironed out before Jcash can be offered to the wider public. This is from the Chinese Community Response that has been released earlier this month (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wbgt5AdK3Kf8gr2od-z8ALv1Bs7rpKKs/view?usp=drive_open):  “The next iteration of Jcash will include a larger number of countries, and additional Jcash tokens will be minted as the adoption of the cryptofiat solution increases. Marketing efforts for Jcash will be targeted to the jurisdictions the product is rolled out in. There is a comprehensive plan for Jcash customer acquisition with referral agreements, digital and traditional advertisements, airdrops and joint initiatives with institutions planning to use Jcash.”  The next update will be released on October 5 on Medium.",True

Personally (and without knowing what implies the closure of work in Jcash regarding entry into action of a bank or another type of possible partner) the situation is very clear: A lot of promotion and no development on the table.  This is a double-edged sword for several issues:  Promotion, talks, stellar agreements that have been able to transcend ... have been a good part of the impact of Jibrel.  But the more you talk without support ... myor is the gap between selling excellence ... and having ... NOTHING. And that is very negative and can mark the value of your word, which is very important in any proposal.  Everything can go from a (possible) great marketing (very positive) ... to embrace a flatly negative image of charlatanism.  The case is that after a year open to the public and 8 months with the announced Jwallet (more than enough time for a product test), the timmings have become distorted and have lost a lot of credibility. Objectively: It has been a long time without getting that product completely closed and guaranteed ... I do not understand all that delay without taking it with more effort.  On the other hand, the Jwallet will be the first review of the developments of Jibrel Network ... in a proposal that, beyond the crypts that move the Jwallet, will move assets of the highest value among organizations / users of the largest seriousness and reputation ... with which the output of this first product can not afford any error or can be definitely fatal to the project.  In my opinion, it is not time to make the gap between ""theory"" (promises) and real development even bigger. I have already read that more devs have been hired in the last month or two months ... but it may be worth it not only to shorten dates, but to produce above what is reasonable and to hire even more.  The movements of Jibrel, the talks of the 2 members that came out of the AA a couple of months ago, the ""suggested"" contacts ... were very positive and exciting ... and now, with all due respect, the disappointment is , precisely for that reason, being even bigger and harder.  Equally ... it does not seem appropriate to work with third-row exchanges that may spill your reputation of disability or insecurity. More are worth few ... but serious and reputable.  I do not know when the roadmap and the timmings will come out EXACTLY ... but, as I said in previous posts ... it is information that I miss EVERY DAY. Every day that passes, without a comprehensive and honest explanation, I see that what I have in my hands with Jibrel is NOTHING ... and not because basically it is like that, but because I would not even know how to explain it. As an investor and part of the community, I need to have something much more solid and more assimilated. I insist that I do not know if an AMA or a detailed explanation of the roadmap less ""official"" than what seems to be announced is ABSOLUTELY recommended.  Yes I can affirm, with no intention of belittling anyone, that my optimism towards the project is seriously altered ... something that, frankly, saddens me greatly. Right now I see things VERY different from a month or two ago (and it is not a matter of pure speculation, but of faith and hope ... currently, I find it very difficult to remain in the project).  Anyway, I do not want to enter into a negative loop around the same issues that would not lead to anything positive and as I believe that, humbly, my positions are clear, I only leave my thanks for your attention, greetings and wishes of the best decisions.",True

And, as it seems, his line of impressing the market through these channels still persists. And personally, it seems to me that they have not understood something as simple as that the crypto market is SATURATED with promises and easy words.

Each year I enter with a solid position in 2 projects, this year, JNT was one of them. My identification with their asset tokenization approach was robust, really strong. An expected approach, as the next crypto step, came at a perfect moment.  His initial image was also very attractive. Reputed advisors and contacts of greater interest.  I know perfectly that technology has its cycles, that dabate does not deserve to lose a minute in it.  But I just do not understand how a wallet, after 9 months open to user testing, and of course, I suppose, a team of technicians, may not have received the study and sufficient level of proof to not be supported and openly guaranteed to esast heights of the evolution of the project. IN 9 months only a product can be contrasted and not having done it gives me an impression of sloppiness or dismissal that leaves me stupefied. Precisely with the technical rigor that an approach like Jibrel requires to be reliable. I do not know how something so elementary can be ""overlooked"" in a project that shows the HIGH LEVEL of this one in other of its faces ... and for that reason I am stupefied.  I hope that a misunderstanding or a failure of attention has been, although it is not explained enough ... but this project must draw a resounding ""point and separate"" with this lamentable chapter. My impression is that the image has prevailed abroad rather than the strength and technical consolidation of its proposal - that is why I am seriously assaulted by finding the same line of irrelevant communications that seem there only because I do not break the communicative timeline or that of a image backed by extense factors or reputations ... than another where the solvency and robustness of its technical developments are at the heart of its contribution and more at such absolutely elementary levels as a wallet, an explorer, etc ... My impression is that it has neglected that extension of the project, precisely when without it, the project is nothing. I am not inside ... but that is my sincere impression and as such, I transmit it, as a kind of feedback that could serve as an alert. I hope that someone serves as a reflection (and point of inflection, that what I read, has already been contemplated with the increase of technical personnel).  I am supporting the project, although the months until the first development generate serious uncertainty and I know I am taking a considerable risk for it ... but that is not going to be relieved with twits reminders about saving my private keys, about ""imminent and mysterious news-bomb "", nor celebrating the global notoriety of the project will have a few venues here and there ... that notoriety is earned with serious and effective work. Same as the support of new partners in the project, both at the level of investment and collaboration.  I sincerely hope the best for everyone and that all this happens as a bad episode that served as a lesson to know exactly where the important thing is.  With this, I close my contribution on this point, because I do not think that giving a thousand laps will help the least, even to the precise work environment to reset the necessary issues ... and the last thing I want is to disturb.  I hope that helps",True

It is currently in the alpha, but it was recently announced on Twitter that the beta release is around the corner (https://twitter.com/JibrelNetwork/status/999735507037933569?s=20). I have already tried the Alpha-Wallet and it is very simple to use, but at the moment I don't recommend storing large values on it.  The roadmap on the current website is, as you have noticed, outdated. I also raised a question on this matter in the Telegram Group. One of the co-founders replied that although there are development delays, they have nevertheless made great progress and established a office in St. Petersburg.  The deleted announcement on Twitter was a bit unlucky but I’m sure they had their reasons. Just wait a week or two, I mean, it was posted only a few days ago. But I have to admit that the communication between the team and the community is expandable and the fact that different information are spread on many channels like Telegram, Medium, Twitter and YouTube, doesn’t make it better as it takes a lot of time to search through all channels to find useful information and announcements. In their AMA, Talal has stated that a email subscription box with regular updates regarding the team, products, events, issues but also the progress they’ve made, will be part of the new website.  I hope my answer was helpful and I would like to end with a quote from Talal, which I fully agree with. He said that “this is a marathon and not a race”. A common mistake in marathons is running too fast at the beginning and then collapse as a result of sinking strength. As Jibrel is definitely a long-term project, the comparison with the marathon and the race fits very well.",True

I do not know if you are an individual or part of the collective of Jibrel Network ... in any way, I sincerely appreciate your note, thanks to which, I will grant a stand by to my positions in the project.  I came to confirm that my post was still unattended and if so, I was going to settle my positions in Jibrel network, despite being the project that has attracted me most since last autumn.   The truth is that I am quite tired of the discourse of ""great effort"", ""talented team"", ""long distance race"" etc etc ... it is the most adopted resource in a crypto-ranking where the intrusion and the low quality of the projects, unfortunately, every day is more abundant and does not contribute more than outstanding topics of good faith on the part of the investor, so every time I find it, I start to tremble. But I guess it would also be the case of the commitment of who is really moving in those terms and as such I will accept in this case (pushed by the special attraction I found in the JNT project, everything is said).  Regarding twitter, not only do I refer to the disappeared, but to the succession of them, along with the first alluding to the JWallet that you also comment. They are superimposed strategies that I did not expect to find in a project that, imo, would be more based on the diligence and discretion that preside over the areas to which Jibtrel is directed ... and away from the ""cosmetics"" so recurrent in projects of low category looking for free time or shine. And from there, personally, my disappointment at that point, because marking the timmings artificially does not show much respect for those who, with the full legitimacy that the free market provides, analyze the evolution and compliance of the roadmap ... and also, I understand that Jibrel Network must be rigorously away from this type of low-risk practices that is identified with the huge group of charlatans that exists in the bloickchain and to which I sincerely believe that it does NOT belong ... so much attention with it.  Likewise, I knew the Jwallet and I have not even tried it, because, with tokenization of bonds and other assets in perspective, I understand the handling of cryptocurrencies as the most affordable challenge of that wallet ... and if it is not even able to guarantee its perfect working in this first scenario, I'm not interested for now ... since it would not clear my biggest doubts about the impeccable and non-negotiable security that the operation that Jibrel proposes (and must) make available to the public in such a delicate objective yours. I am waiting impatiently for that final version of the wallet and that its departure marks after it the required rigor in the points that, on their own initiative, they establish in their roadmap.  Likewise, I hope with the greatest interest that this stand by allows me to continue joining a project so promising in its exhibition and that is the face we see in the future at each step of this project. I leave here sincerely my best wishes for it.  Greetings and many thanks again for your explanation.",True

We have tracked the tokens, but the only way to mitigate the damage is to ensure the tokens cannot leave EtherDelta.  This means all JNT withdrawals are suspended at EtherDelta. If you purchase JNT you will not be able to withdraw these tokens. You will also allow the hackers to liquidate the frozen JNT and walk away with your ETH.  Please avoid using EtherDelta / ForkDelta until the situation is resolved.  Thank you!",True

EEA isn't the biggest deal, but it does provide us access to a lot of potential Enterprise users working in this space, and access to a lot of insight.    What is becoming clearer every day is that Jibrel Network does not fulfill roadmap nor at the minimum level of getting its Jwallet. A lot of talk around the world promising the most splendid future ... but development = 0.   We cannot deny that we are behind on a few timelines, but we hope to release the majority of our products in quick succession. We reallocated all our resources to jCash over the last 6 weeks, and it is ready pending regulatory sign-off.  The jWallet Beta infrastructure has been ready for a while, but requires significant front-end work until release, which we are ramping up again now (we also hired two front-end devs to help reduce bottlenecks hereE).   I do not know the grace that the delay with an operative wallet will make the owners of the more than 2 million JNT tokens that have been hacked tonight in coinrail. More than 2% supply of the project.  We've released information around this, and are working with Coinrail to ensure token holders who lost JNT from the hack have a clear process to recover their tokens.   Meanwhile ... a lot of costume, a lot of fantastic prophecies ... but not a wallet ... that has any blockchain of the fifth division.  A few weeks ago I read that JNT had offered to audit the movement of their repositories of Github to show transparency regarding their activity (something that many blockchains have done). Well, there were four indicators (I can not find the link) ... and the 4 were worst, among the lowest in the ranking.  Then you hear the Jibrel Network conferences here and there and everything is ""brilliant team"", ""hard work"" and blahblahblah ...    This is discussed a lot in our telegram channel, since all our core repositories are private, it seems activity is limited. But we released screenshots and will release a walkthrough of our Github so people can see the significant activity that has been committed.     Hope that helps!",True

Generally, the API calls provided by Infura are quite limiting. So we powered our jProducts with our own nodes.  We then needed to build node management tools as ETH nodes go down frequently. With this solution in place, we decided to offer it publicly, leveraging JNT as well.  Quote from: Virtuoso on April 23, 2018, 09:22:19 PM I think Jwallet should be released any day now according to the medium post.

We've experienced a few bottlenecks (primarily front-end development) with all our devs working hard towards a jCash open alpha.   Quote from: theleaf on April 12, 2018, 06:22:49 PM  What is proof of solvency? in simple lay man terms? too many new terms in crypto, proof of stake/work/authority,etc..    Proof of Solvency is just a bidding / staking mechanism to facilitate the trading of traditional assets on-chain.  All banks are required to maintain a capital adequacy requirement, to ensure any liabilities are sufficiently backed.  For crypto-fiat, we use JNT in smart contracts to prove that the system is solvent against CryDR liabilities. So if there is 10 jUSD represented, we hold the equivalent value in JNT for immediate redemption (i.e. a user can send 1 jUSD and receive the equivalent in JNT and liquidate that). As long as the DAO is holding more value (in JNT) than it has committed in liabilities (CryDRs), users can trust that the system is sufficiently solvent, should all users decide to redeem their CryDRs at once.  In addition, in certain transactions, an escrow is used to facilitate the transaction. E.g. If I want to sell a house, I may use a third party escrow agent to facilitate the transaction.  So if you tokenize an asset, you need to put the equivalent value in JNT locked in a smart contract, as long as the underlying asset is still in your name. Once the asset has cleared (i.e. transferred to the new user), the JNT can be redeemed.  This is to prevent people from selling token representations of off-chain assets, and then exiting their positions off-chain. i.e. selling the house, while the other user only holds a token, and no capital markets / real estate / other regulator has adopted a tokenized ownership system.   Hope that helps clear some things up!",True

Scenario a: The JNT price goes down to $0.1 and I choose to convert my jUSD to JNT. You hold 4000 JNT with a value of $400. How will I be compensated for the remaining $600? You don't hold those tokens right? Scenario b: The JNT price goes up to $1. I convert my 1000 jUSD back to 1000 JNT. What happends with the remaining 3000 JNT I deposited? 4) Is the guarantor a bank? 5) How does your contract with the guarantor work? Do you pay them regularly and they in turn hold a sum of USD equal to the outstanding number of jUSD? 6) Let's say the JNT price skyrockets and all JNT holders then exchange their JNT for jUSD.

We hold 1000 USD in the bank (hopefully post ICO, we hold more than that). The Jibrel DAO holds JNT in reserves.  You come to exchange ~0.055 BTC (US$ 1,000) with the Jibrel DAO.  The Jibrel DAO already has 1,000 jUSD, backed by US$ 1,000 with Jibrel AG. The Jibrel DAO uses JNT to prove solvency to you, as a jCash holder.  The Jibrel DAO gives you the 1,000 jUSD for your ~0.055 BTC, and exchanges the BTC for 4,000 JNT on an exchange - proving to you, it holds this value on-chain.  When JNT goes down in price. The Jibrel DAO needs to increase its Proof of Solvency.  Now instead of needing 4,000 JNT to prove solvency to your 1,000 jUSD it needs 10,000 JNT.  It needs to go to market for the remaining 6,000 JNT. By doing so, it provides price support for JNT.  Jibrel AG, liquidates a bit of the cash backing the CryDRs, to prove solvency to you on-chain.  Because by JNT decreasing in price, the Jibrel DAOs demand for it increases, as long as JNT holds a non-zero value, the Jibrel DAO / Jibrel AG can stay solvent.      Scenario b: The JNT price goes up to $1. I convert my 1000 jUSD back to 1000 JNT. What happends with the remaining 3000 JNT I deposited?   Now the Jibrel DAO only needs to hold 1,000 JNT to Prove solvency to you.  If there is additional demand for jCash. People can exchange BTC directly for jCash, the BTC is then directly liquidated into Fiat, and the Jibrel DAO has sufficient JNT to prove solvency for the new fiat cash.  This system allows for sustainable growth, without the need for a high degree of trust / centralization.      4) Is the guarantor a bank?   In some cases, guarantors are for specific assets. So lets say you’re a treasury bill broker, you can already sell treasury bills today. Why can’t you sell them on-chain? By acting as a guarantor, you are merely porting your business, or bringing a small part of your business, on-chain.      5) How does your contract with the guarantor work? Do you pay them regularly and they in turn hold a sum of USD equal to the outstanding number of jUSD?   See above ^ we act as the software play for existing financial institutions, we tokenize their assets (using JNT to back it), and they use their own licenses to transact with their assets on-chain.     6) Let's say the JNT price skyrockets and all JNT holders then exchange their JNT for jUSD. At this JNT price alot more jUSD are minted and thus the guarantor will have to hold alot more USD. What if they are unable to aquire it?   This is the job of Jibrel AG / Jibrel DAO. To always remain solvent and always keep proof of this solvency on-chain.  This is the element of centralization (which is why we wrote “without… high degree of trust / centralization” above, instead of full decentralization).  That being said, the JNT is transparent with the DAO. The contracts are audited by New Alchemy and the financial accounts will be periodically audited by PwC.  We seek to be fully regulated by relevant Capital Markets regulators (i.e. FINMA), so we hope to provide a transparent, and fair service.   Hope that helps answer your questions!",True

But you didn't answer wether JNT is inflationary or deflationary. Will there be mining?  Also, another question: As far as I understand, the main point of your project is stability, for example regarding companies raising money through ICOs. If they raise their money with jUSD instead of Ether they will significantly reduce the volatility risk. For example, not reaching the soft cap in USD even though the soft cap in Ether has been met (due to Ether price dive).  Now, bitcoin futures are soon to be launched. Maybe ether futures will follow soon. This would enable companies to hedge the ether they recieve from investors to the initial price level stated in the whitepaper.  Does that not somewhat negate the purpose of this project?",True

This will definitely impact the overall market share of the project. Not going to gloss over that. But the hedging market is massive.  In addition, futures will be listed on off-chain traditional exchanges. So these tools may not necessarily be available to all participants looking to hedge. For example, converting BTC / ETH straight into FIAT is also a hedge, and will capture about 80% of hedging market. Tether, and Futures are another mechanism.   The way Jibrel does it is it used JNT as a Proof of Solvency, or gold standard - i.e. the Jibrel DAO will always match off-chain assets, with JNT on-chain, to balance against tethered token liabilities.   JNT itself is deflationary, un-mineable. - finite supply (200MN).",True

Questions:  1. Once you have jUSD. These tokens will be redeemable for a dollar's worth of JNT. Whatever that may be.  JNT is used by the DAO to balance accounts. So if JNT price stays constant, the DAO only has to hold 1000 JNT to back your 500 jUSD. If JNT appreciates, the Jibrel DAO can print new CryDRs.  Best to look at it as users converting BTC -> jUSD and back.  The JNT balancing act is done by the Jibrel DAO as a proof of solvency.

It is said the token will be priced 0.25 later on.  While reading the website i also read:  > Given the extreme volatility of ETH and BTC, it would be difficult to hold liabilities in fiat currency (CryDRs) while holding volatile and uncorrelated crypto-assets. Using JNT, a closed system is established allowing for the system to self-balance.  And that is the part that make sense, due to the fact that you want insitutions to hold assets in your currency.  So if it is not that volatile, can we expect 10x, 20x, 30x from the currency or is this a ""different kind"" of ico with a currency that is not supposed to inflate/deflate that much?  EDIT: What I also don't get is that since when you buy jUSD for example you are getting 1 dollar worth of JNTs, the volatility of the cryptocurrency shouldn't matter much, as the person who hedged USD doesn't care of the price of the crypto he is hedging on, as long as the value is guaranteed.

My question is, who are the 'Guarantors' within the Jibrel ecosystem? And what incentives an entity to become a 'Guarantor'?  The needs of all stakeholders could be successfully met by bringing the stability of traditional financial instruments to the blockchain. This can be accomplished by minting tethered tokens with one­to­one backing of the underlying traditional asset they represent. Using such a method, tethered tokens can be used to denote a currency[5] or even a commodity[6].  By developing a ‘guarantor’ that houses traditional assets and issues tokens representing ownership of the underlying assets, one can enable a wide­range of currencies, commodities, money market instruments and other financial tools, to be openly traded on­chain.  3.3 Tethered Tokens Tethered tokens will be required to create traditional asset­backed tokens. For every traditional asset held a tethered token is minted. Upon the underlying asset being sold, the token is destroyed. .  3.4 Guarantor In order to ensure tethered tokens hold their respective value, a guarantor is needed. The guarantor will hold traditional assets and issue their respective tethered tokens, as well as redeem and destroy tokens in return for the release / transfer of ownership of the underlying traditional asset.",True

Security - no single point of failire  2. Transparency - the funds that get contributed do not move until the JNT is delivered - i.e. every single contributor who sent ETH or BTC to their designated wallet address, still has it there. This allows them to monitor their funds until the JNT is delivered.  3. Seamless top-up / refund - with a separate address for each contributor, adding funds and increasing contribution is automatic. In addition, processing refund is seamless and we have already done that for some contributors.   We're sorry you think the pre-sale transparency is lacking, we hope you'll participate in the main sale on Nov. 27th, where the process will be a direct JNT faucet.",True

Thanks for the interest in the Jibrel Network.  The Jibrel Network will facilitate a wide range of assets, but no listed (public) equities. For listed equities, you can check out LA Token or Polymath. As these are interesting projects as well.  At Jibrel, we do not do listed equities for two simple reasons.   1. In the US at least, most trading is done through High Frequency Trading (HFT). So current block times are not feasible for HFT.  2. Front-running - Public blockchains are public... so you cannot prevent front-running (AirSwap are working on a cool workaround).    Also, please note - our tokens introduce Smart Regulation (real world regulation translated into solidity and deployed into an on-chain rule-book), so even for US Financial Assets, etc. only people authorized to hold the asset in the real world, will be able to hold it on-chain. So in your example, it is likely these tokenized assets will only be tradable between US citizens, residents or accredited investors.   Hope that answers your question!",True

For example, JNT is used to purchase and redeem CryDRs (tokens representing real world assets).  So when a user purchases JNT and converts it into a CryDR, that JNT is removed from circulation. The higher the demand for traditional financial assets on-chain, the higher the demand for JNT.

In most cases, for illiquid assets, the real asset is held by Jibrel AG (Zug, Switzerland entity) or by a licensed banking partner (who acts as a custodian).  In more nuanced cases, the underlying asset is securitized (off-chain) and the necessary legal paperwork is undertaken to securitize the underlying assets income and purchase it through Jibrel AG. Once this process is complete, the asset is tokenized on-chain.  We are building then necessary off-chain infrastructure to be able to streamline this process and get faster at turning it around.
