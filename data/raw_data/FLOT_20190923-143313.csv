Commission will be paid in ETH to all token holders with 2 days after tokens distribution. Afterwards, commission will be paid out after each lottery drawing.",True

The only tokens to not accumulate commission are the tokens that remain unsold and will be frozen after 15/4.  So a person buying tokens on 14/4 will receive just as much commission per token as someone buying tokens on 1/1.  I thought it seemed more logical to not accumulate any commission for unsold tokens and to only start accumulating commission as soon as a token was purchased. Luckily commission is so low that it's not really such a big deal. It just shows the lack of thought that's gone into the whole thing.  Please address my main question only.",True

But all of them forget and avoid to talk about one MAJOR thing - FIRELOTTO.COM is a running lottery. Before running the ICO FireLotto team AT FIRST created a fully decentralized lottery platform, launched it and only after that started its ICO.  The main idea of ICO - is to raise funds for a PRIZE POOL to be big enough for people all over the world will be interested to play.  People play and win in Firelotto.com every day. Team enlarges the Jackpot every week and now days it is over 960 ETH.  So how all those things that SCAMERS talk about can influence a running lottery?!?!? I don't see a way.  Lets ask ourselves a question - Why would somebody so actively try to say so much shit about the project and avoid to admit obvious things like growing prize fund, running software, SEC confirmation, fiat payments, world known affiliate partners and etc?  The main purpose of saying shit is not to warn people to stay out from investing into a project. THE MAIN IDEA is to earn money for such criminal activity. Their business is very simple. The ask for money so they leave ICO alone. If ICO refuses they attack it on and promote their social accounts. Once the account been pumped up they sell. So SCAMERS do not real care of who to talk shit about. Its their little dirty business. And they are not talented enough to think of something else. To create. They only know how to anonymously destroy.  With such actions scammers do not help the project - they are trying to kill it and thus thee DO NO CARE AT ALL about investors.  Firelotto.io and firelotto.com is a successful project already. And no matter what SCAMERS will do its already in the ETH network, it can not be shut down or influenced by any body. People play and win every day, we will continue to increase prize fund and do affiliate integrations. Yes they make our life a bit harder but to win is always not easy. Our team knows what to do and will continue its everyday hard work.",True

But all of them forget and avoid to talk about one MAJOR thing - FIRELOTTO.COM is a running lottery. Before running the ICO FireLotto team AT FIRST created a fully decentralized lottery platform, launched it and only after that started its ICO.  The main idea of ICO - is to raise funds for a PRIZE POOL to be big enough for people all over the world will be interested to play.  People play and win in Firelotto.com every day. Team enlarges the Jackpot every week and now days it is over 960 ETH.  So how all those things that SCAMERS talk about can influence a running lottery?!?!? I don't see a way.  Lets ask ourselves a question - Why would somebody so actively try to say so much shit about the project and avoid to admit obvious things like growing prize fund, running software, SEC confirmation, fiat payments, world known affiliate partners and etc?  The main purpose of saying shit is not to warn people to stay out from investing into a project. THE MAIN IDEA is to earn money for such criminal activity. Their business is very simple. The ask for money so they leave ICO alone. If ICO refuses they attack it on and promote their social accounts. Once the account been pumped up they sell. So SCAMERS do not real care of who to talk shit about. Its their little dirty business. And they are not talented enough to think of something else. To create. They only know how to anonymously destroy.  With such actions scammers do not help the project - they are trying to kill it and thus thee DO NO CARE AT ALL about investors.  Firelotto.io and firelotto.com is a successful project already. And no matter what SCAMERS will do its already in the ETH network, it can not be shut down or influenced by any body. People play and win every day, we will continue to increase prize fund and do affiliate integrations. Yes they make our life a bit harder but to win is always not easy.

Well Tommy, I for one, am pissed off at the project because I am listed as a scammer. It would be so easy for you to acknowledge that I have never personally attacked the project. I asked a couple of questions and then was added to your list. Despite showing adequate proof that I own Flot, you continue to dismiss the fact that I am an investor. I have even provided proof that Fire Lotto is sending emails to my private email address. The only way for them to have my address is because I invested with that address.  Even with all this proof, you still will not admit that yes indeed I am an investor and not one of your so-called scammers.  It is this, and this reason only that leads me to believe that the whole scam conspiracy is fake. Also, it has been proven that at least two of the names on the list are fictitious.

This of course, for myself anyway, makes me question earlier post in which it appears she has denied being associated with Fire Lotto.  Of course, being able to view this directly on her twitter account versus a screenshot, I do believe she is legit.  I don't know what the agenda is of the other persons mentioned in the scam team list. I am simply an investor that is pissed off.  My grievance with Fire Lotto lies solely with the inaccuracies of information they post; not so much what is posted by others.  I also admit that it has occurred to me early on that I have been supporting possible, actual scammers because of the negative posts I have been making or reposting.  Despite my reassurance that Ronnee is legit, I still feel that Fire Lotto team is more misleading. For example, I can post something with a screenshot that was said on Telegraph which conflicts with what is said here and they flat out decide to call me a scammer instead of addressing the conflict. This is unprofessional in my mind.  I can not speak for the other persons on this list. I do believe though that there are at least one, maybe two others who are in fact investors besides myself.  As long as Fire Lotto team continues to not address certain accusations in a reasonable way then they will always feel the presence of negativity on this thread.  I can't stand any of the admins here or on Telegraph. I did, however, PM keti_gav and ask her why, Fire Lotto team cannot simply post affirmation on this thread about Ronnee. If they did that, then I, a so-called scammer could state that I agree. But for some reason, they fail to do that.  Anyway, still many questions and strange things going back and forth here. I still do not feel comfortable about having invested my money in the project.  And I am still super pissed off that my name is on that list. Knowing I am in fact an investor and on that list, makes it hard for me to believe anything they say.",True

Ronnee Ades is not a current adviser, why is she still listed as being one?  Ronne Ades is a Strategic Advisor and she is on board.  https://a.radikal.ru/a10/1803/89/db39be9a7bd6.jpg  2. Robert Matuk is not an adviser, why is he still listed as being one?  https://imgur.com/a/LHPQ1 - its a fake account like many others that scamers use. Robert Matuk is onboard with the project and help us to communicate with US market.  Knowing that our project been attacked by scamers and we receive threats our project members never respond to any private requests. Below you may find a screen shot our communication.  https://a.radikal.ru/a17/1803/61/aa7602f7a1c0.jpg  3. The return on investment example in the white paper is incorrectly stated as 20%, it should be 8.4% (if someone paid USD 0.38 for their FLOT tokens, less if they paid more).  The return on investment was estimated for large investors at the pre sale round. Its an ESTIMATION. Its impossible to predict the exact return. Estimation was made based on market analyses and a possible market share that FireLotto can achieve within a several years. The lottery market research used for estimation could be found here: https://firelotto.io/marketing_report.pdf  3. After the failed CashPokerPro project where investors lost pretty much their whole investment, you started ICOLAB.ME, which listed 2 advisors (Jake Brukhman and Adam Draper) who were not involved with the project at all. Jake posted on Twitter: ATTENTION! ""http://icolab.me/ is listing myself and @AdamDraper as advisors to their ICO. I am NOT in ANY WAY affiliated with this project, this sounds like a phishing scheme or scam. Please be advised."" You later closed the website. We're afraid you're going to do the same thing again. What is your version of the Icolab.me story?  ICO and Internet is a network where may people and projects may intersect. Also, there are many fake news created by scamers that they apply to prove their words. Our team is responsible for Firelotto.io. Scamers intentionally avoid talking about other team members and our partners such as Qiwi, 1Xbet Shangri La. World know companies that make a due diligence of the project first and then cooperate. Everything we do to make the project better stays out of their attention. And it all began after we refused to pay them money (before the ICO started).  4. Please prove to us that your application for a gaming license with the Isle of Man Gaming Commission is indeed being processed.  Our business model states that promotion and sales of FireLotto will be mostly made by affiliate partners under White label. These affiliates have a gaming license at the country where they operate. Thus legal issues and responsibility relies on them.  Our legal team is checking the necessity of farther steps to obtain itself a gaming license at a present moment. A legal status of Ethereum and other crypto currencies is still not defined by most of the countries. For example, in Russia, crypto is not recognized as an asset and can not be used for debt recovery in case of bankruptcy.Ethereum block chain is anonymous and decentralized. The platform was integrated into Ethereum block chain and can not be influenced or shut down by any government or men. Thus there is no risk for platform to stop operating. As people play and win in FireLotto using Ethereum from legal point of view they do not play for money. They play for numeric electronic codes. Such legal approach can not be recognized as illegal. Every legal system says that everything is legal unless it was directly forbidden by the law. There are no laws at this moment that regulate such activity. Once regulation of crypto will be more clear we will proceed with obtaining Firelotto a gaming license.   5. In a scenario where 50m tickets remain unsold, and therefore frozen for 1 year, the team will hold 20/50 = 40% of the commission collecting tickets in the first year and 70/100 = 70% of commission collecting tickets after one year, meaning the commission for investors will be halved one year from now. Why are the unsold tokens not burned?  The unsold tokens will befrozen for one year and will not participate in revenue distribution. After one year these tokens will be sold to investors. Commission from tickets sales will be distribute only to token holders – actual investors that hold their token on private crypto wallets. We need to enlarge prize fund of the lottery and burning tokens that could be sold to investors doesn’t seem logical.  6. Why does your token contract only have 5 transactions?  FLOT tokens were pre mined and now allocated and frozen in investors account till the ICO is over. After ICO they will be available to be moved to investors private crypto wallets.  7.  FireLotto claims ""full decentralization and transparency"", which seems quite an unrealistic claim when token distribution occurs manually, the team can update the software and we're not allowed to see any source codes.  We placed detail information how smart contract for token distribution will work. And now its been actively discussed in Telegram channel. After we receive all votes and opinions of the community we will present this smart contract for community expertise and independent professional audit.  8. FireLotto uses three different addresses, first Cyprus, then Singapore and finally in Hong Kong, with the Singapore address apparently being in a beauty mall... What's the explanation for that?  SEC regulation of crypto currencies and ICOs changes every day. We were advised by our legal team to use Gong Kong jurisdiction for the company that will notify SEC about token sales. Every running multinational business has more than one company. Depending on the legal approach different companies and jurisdictions can be used. The main idea - SEC compliance was achieved.  9. How are you allowed to sell tokens to US citizens without using KYC? Under SAFT agreement. Token sales procedure was checked by SEC and our notification was confirmed.  10. Mr. Eduard Ageev, CEO of  Passado Co Ltd which is the Fire lotto operating company has nothing to do with Fire Lotto and is not listed on the website firelotto.io    Its our internal decision who to place on web site. Mr. Eduard Ageev, CEO andPassado Co Ltd were closely checked by SEC under their procedure. We submitted legalized foundation documents, financial reports, beneficiary info and many other documents to SEC. Also there was a personal meeting with them. Once everything was checked by SEC officers our notification was filed and confirmed.  NOW LET ME ASK A VERY SIMPLE QUESTION: IS FIRE LOTTO A SCAM OR NOT?  FIRELOTTO.COM - IS THE ONLY IN THE WORLD FULLY DECENTRALIZED RUNNING LOTTERY BUILT 100% ON BLOCKCHAIN. May be that is why so many scamersare trying to bad mouth about it?

I guess you really need to visit your doctor... Dozens of members asked you hundred times to stop posting that bullshit about scammers and just answwer to simple questions.  1. Ronnee Ades is not a current adviser, why is she still listed as being one?  2. Robert Matuk is not an adviser, why is he still listed as being one? https://imgur.com/a/LHPQ1  3. The return on investment example in the white paper is incorrectly stated as 20%, it should be 8.4% (if someone paid USD 0.38 for their FLOT tokens, less if they paid more)  3. After the failed CashPokerPro project where investors lost pretty much their whole investment, you started ICOLAB.ME, which listed 2 advisors (Jake Brukhman and Adam Draper) who were not involved with the project at all. Jake posted on Twitter: ATTENTION! ""http://icolab.me/ is listing myself and @AdamDraper as advisors to their ICO. I am NOT in ANY WAY affiliated with this project, this sounds like a phishing scheme or scam. Please be advised."" You later closed the website. We're afraid you're going to do the same thing again. What is your version of the Icolab.me story?  4. Please prove to us that your application for a gaming license with the Isle of Man Gaming Commission is indeed being processed.  5. In a scenario where 50m tickets remain unsold, and therefore frozen for 1 year, the team will hold 20/50 = 40% of the commission collecting tickets in the first year and 70/100 = 70% of commission collecting tickets after one year, meaning the commission for investors will be halved one year from now. Why are the unsold tokens not burned?  6. Why does your token contract only have 5 transactions?  7.  FireLotto claims ""full decentralization and transparency"", which seems quite an unrealistic claim when token distribution occurs manually, the team can update the software and we're not allowed to see any source codes.  8. FireLotto uses three different addresses, first Cyprus, then Singapore and finally in Hong Kong, with the Singapore address apparently being in a beauty mall... What's the explanation for that?  9. How are you allowed to sell tokens to US citizens without using KYC?",True

Do not invest in this ICO, because this project is a SCAM and in the text below I will prove you why. I will file a legal suit to the relevant court of law.  The company “Passado company Limited”, which the team presents as an operator of the Firelotto has nothing to do with the project – nor its director or its owners are among the team members, presented on the official Firelotto.io website. Here is the way how you can verify it by yourself.  This is a screenshot from the official Telegram channel of the project, where the team brags about being registered with the SEC:  https://imgur.com/a/fX6ia  All you need to do is take the first part of the “Accession number” and input it to the official SEC’s EDGAR database https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml. Here is the result:  https://imgur.com/a/lB592  As you can see, the director of the company is someone Ageev Eduard Viktorovich – you won’t find his name on the FireLotto website (they will now probably add it, so here is the saved version of their website from the 13th of March https://web.archive.org/web/20180313180326/https://firelotto.io/ ). Also take a look at the previous name of the company – “ORIENT TRANS COMPANY LIMITED”. After googling for this name I found this guy’s profile in the Russian social network - https://ok.ru/profile/172067460095. I wonder if he knows at all that his company makes an ICO. In addition, I found his another company with almost the same name as the previous one at Passado, but registered in Russia (he is also a director there) – Orient Trans Group https://zachestnyibiznes.ru/company/ul/1082537004549_2537054212_OOO-OTG. If you look at their website http://www.ottg.ru/, they are just a company involved in international logistics and I highly doubt this guy knows anything about Firelotto ICO. Obviously, both companies were created for international trade and have nothing to do with the Firelotto ICO and their tokens.  To be sure, I also checked the Passado Co Ltd for its owners – you can do it for the additional payment on the official Hong Kong government website https://www.icris.cr.gov.hk/csci/. Here are the free results:  https://imgur.com/kEwXv9P  The company was registered on the 25th of April 2008 – long before the Bitcoin was even created. Here are the results from the paid inquiry:  https://imgur.com/a/gOgCM  As you can also check, mr Mikhail Matuznyi is not presented on the Firelotto website as part of the team.  I assume this to be a complete deception of potential Token Holders and already contacted my lawyer. I saved all the necessary information and in the next couple of days will file a legal suit against these guys to the SEC and other relevant court of law. In the meantime, I recommend all the team members to think twice before flooding this forum with false accusations, preventing the lawyers and other law enforcers from their direct duties.

What you see here is one more attempt by the admin to remove the questions from the thread. There is no sense to ask the questions privately through email. We all are asking the same questions and so, why should the questions not be out in the open for everyone to see. It is my belief that questions sent by email will have no better results in being answered than they are here on this thread.  Let me remind you that I wrote support@firelotto almost a month ago and have never received a reply from them.  Here is link. https://i.imgur.com/7Se5LPF  Please note that in my message to them I address the issue of scam activity on this thread. I state that I feel the admin is not capable as he puts investors names on the 'scam team member' list. I ask support what they intend to do about the situation. I ask them if they will put someone on the thread that can straighten all matters out. I clearly identify myself as an investor.  Support team @ Fire Lotto has never responded to my concerns.   avoid to admit obvious things like growing prize fund, running software, SEC confirmation, fiat payments, world known affiliate partners and etc?   Our project is already working and brings profit to its investors.  In my limited knowledge, I can see that the prize fund is growing. I think I understand that of course, some sort of software is running. I dont understand what SEC is, nor do I see anything that better helps me understand it. I do understand the gaming license from Isle of Man, but have yet to see any proof that there was ever an application submitted.   Why does your token contract only have 5 transactions?  I make no claims to fully understand what a token contract is. But, I do understand that only 5 transactions seem suspicious. This claim alone makes me wonder if there actually is a growing prize fund or if it is simply made to look that way in order to continue to lure investors.  I would like to see more proofs and transparency around the code. I can't read code but will trust the conclusions of those that can read it. I'll even take Ket-Gav's or Tommy Cash's word if they post the code on this thread and explain it to us.  In regards to the extortion letters from scammers who are demanding money. I expect the Fire Lotto Team, to not pay any money what so ever to any scammer. I expect, that given you have such a great lawyer on your team that you needn't give in to the scammers. As long as your project is above board, as you claim, then there is nothing for your project to worry about.  As for the so-called scammers on this thread; one of whom is myself, please note that I am not, nor ever have asked for money. It has never been my intention either to discredit the project.  To be honest, I am not sure why you seem so worried about the five or six members here who are asking questions. I know you see it as an attack, but really they are just questions which you have trouble answering. It would seem reasonable then that we take the questions elsewhere; does it not?  From what I gather, you have a strong member list on your Telegraph Chat. There, you can not ask questions as we do here, otherwise, you get kicked off.  So look at it this way. You have a bulletproof following over there which from what I understand is way larger and more positive than the people on this thread. As long as you maintain control on Telegraph, you shouldn't worry about the adverse effects that just a handful of investors have on the project.  If I thought I was welcome on Telegraph or that my messages to support would be acknowledged, then I might not have to be here in the situation I am.  I see nothing wrong with taking our questions to Ronnee. You should fear nothing from that as she is one of your advisers.",True

Crypto-tokens that are securities must comply with the laws for traditional securities. The definition of a security is very broad, but does include (by recent clarification) practically all crytotokens that are not utility tokens that have immediate utility and whose value is not tied to the profits of a company or project.  ALL ICO's MUST BE REGISTERED AS PUBLIC OFFERING!  Registered Public Offering  A registering a public offering is what a company does before an Initial Public Offering (IPO). It involves Form S-1, and the creation of a prospectus.  The costs of producing the prospectus and registration materials, plus the ongoing reporting obligations, are so expensive, that practically no company executes a registered public offering without also “going public” on a secondary stock exchange such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. Otherwise, the costs greatly exceed the benefits (liquidity and access to capital that the major secondary stock markets provide).  The huge advantage of a token registering for public offering, is it allows the token to freely trade on U.S. secondary markets between ordinary U.S. investors. The implementation of doing trading via an exchange seems straight forward (deposit/withdraw tokens to/from brokerage account). No idea the implication of trading on unregistered exchanges (probably a bad idea), nor the implications of peer-to-peer trading.",True

She is very friendly and our conversation took an interesting turn when she said she'd contacted FireLotto and they even told her that ""the scammers"" our out to get them and would be coming for Ronnee too. She said be happy to assist in getting our questions/worries/issues addressed and we can send them direct to management through her.  So I suggest we collect any and all outstanding issues (from unused token smart contracts to closed source github repos etc.) in one message and we can then get some answers, skipping over the strange admins here, because of them we are only slipping further into ""you're a scammer"". ""no, YOU're the scammer"" territory. In order to ensure we some get real answers, the questions have to be as fool proof as can be.  Please avoid any scam accusations as they may still be premature (my faith in that is low) and let's keep the language polite.  I suggest: - Ronnee Ades is not a current adviser, why is she still listed as being one? - Robert Matuk is not an adviser, why is he still listed as being one? https://imgur.com/a/LHPQ1 - The return on investment example in the white paper is incorrectly stated as 20%, it should be 8.4% (if someone paid USD 0.38 for their FLOT tokens, less if they paid more) - After the failed CashPokerPro project where investors lost pretty much their whole investment, you started ICOLAB.ME, which listed 2 advisors (Jake Brukhman and Adam Draper) who were not involved with the project at all. Jake posted on Twitter: ATTENTION! ""http://icolab.me/ is listing myself and @AdamDraper as advisors to their ICO. I am NOT in ANY WAY affiliated with this project, this sounds like a phishing scheme or scam. Please be advised."" You later closed the website. We're afraid you're going to do the same thing again. What is your version of the Icolab.me story? - Please prove to us that your application for a gaming license with the Isle of Man Gaming Commission is indeed being processed. - In a scenario where 50m tickets remain unsold, and therefore frozen for 1 year, the team will hold 20/50 = 40% of the commission collecting tickets in the first year and 70/100 = 70% of commission collecting tickets after one year, meaning the commission for investors will be halved one year from now. Why are the unsold tokens not burned? - Why does your token contract only have 5 transactions? - FireLotto claims ""full decentralization and transparency"", which seems quite an unrealistic claim when token distribution occurs manually, the team can update the software and we're not allowed to see any source codes. - FireLotto uses three different addresses, first Cyprus, then Singapore and finally in Hong Kong, with the Singapore address apparently being in a beauty mall... What's the explanation for that? - How are you allowed to sell tokens to US citizens without using KYC?  Anything else to add?  PS With regard to Elena Bogdanova having two different pics, I think the difference could be down to make-up and lighting.",True

But all of them forget and avoid to talk about one MAJOR thing - FIRELOTTO.COM is a running lottery. Before running the ICO FireLotto team AT FIRST created a fully decentralized lottery platform, launched it and only after that started its ICO.  The main idea of ICO - is to raise funds for a PRIZE POOL to be big enough for people all over the world will be interested to play.  People play and win in Firelotto.com every day. Team enlarges the Jackpot every week and now days it is over 960 ETH.  So how all those things that SCAMERS talk about can influence a running lottery?!?!? I don't see a way.  Lets ask ourselves a question - Why would somebody so actively try to say so much shit about the project and avoid to admit obvious things like growing prize fund, running software, SEC confirmation, fiat payments, world known affiliate partners and etc?  The main purpose of saying shit is not to warn people to stay out from investing into a project. THE MAIN IDEA is to earn money for such criminal activity. Their business is very simple. The ask for money so they leave ICO alone. If ICO refuses they attack it on and promote their social accounts. Once the account been pumped up they sell. So SCAMERS do not real care of who to talk shit about. Its their little dirty business. And they are not talented enough to think of something else. To create. They only know how to anonymously destroy.  With such actions scammers do not help the project - they are trying to kill it and thus they DO NO CARE AT ALL about investors.  Firelotto.io and firelotto.com is a successful project already. And no matter what SCAMERS will do its already in the ETH network, it can not be shut down or influenced by any body. People play and win every day, we will continue to increase prize fund and do affiliate integrations. Yes they make our life a bit harder but to win is always not easy.

This project has all the signs of being a scam.  I first posted here on this thread on February 15th. I stated that I had just invested in the project. I asked a question regarding the number of tickets that needed to be bought in order to collect the commission.  Due to the admins' inability to fully understand the English language, he kept referring me back to the Whitepaper, which obviously did not contain the answer I was looking for. Eventually, they did answer the question in a way that I understood, although, that answer is still not officially written into the Whitepaper.  My second question was regarding the number of tickets being sold on the lottery. I could not find where this information was available. They instructed me where to look and I did and I found it. I thanked them for that information.  Next, I informed them, that they had misspelled the Isle of Man, Gaming Commissioners name. They had it written as Health, whereas the proper spelling was Heath.  At this point, I was told that my postings were trivial in nature and my name was added to the 'Scammer Team' member list.  In the course of 18 days my faith in this project went out the window. I have seen nothing but lies coming out of the mouths of the admin and other leaders on this thread.  Although I have proven on numerous occasions that I am an investor, my name still remains on the list of scammers.  Trust me, Fire Lotto is not interested in offering the investor a positive and strong sense of security. They have been asked many questions over and over again by many people on this thread and absolutely refuse to provide adequate answers.  They do not like anyone asking anything regarding what appears to be weaknesses in their code or the credibility and/or strength of their team. Much of the information about their team appears to be fake. They have offered no valid response to prove such allegations false.  The CEO, himself, Roman Demidov and several other members of Fire Lotto team were also involved with previously failed CashPolerPro scam.  Naturally, anyone who invests there money in a project wants to know their investment is safe. As such, we look into the project. I don't believe anyone here is creating accusations or actually looking for things that are wrong with the project. But obviously, in the course of taking a closer look people have found things that don't add up and they voice these concerns. These concerns are then met with quick dismissal by the admin and then regarded as nothing more than an attack against the project.  I advise anyone who is considering to invest to read thoroughly from start to finish, both the Whitepaper and all the posts on this thread. In my opinion, 'Fire Lotto Project is a SCAM'  Regards, flaggin (proven investor in the project)",True

The effort done in promotion consists of going to gambling trade fairs, which is really not that expensive to organize and they've collected more than 3 million usd already, their goal is to keep the money coming in during the ICO. It seems typical for scam ICO's to have a really low soft cap (hurray, the project goes ahead!) and a really high hard cap, so you don't have to stop the project early on in case it catches on. The approach was also unusual that they had a private sale until 15 January, then one month public pre-sale, then a break of a month (why?), then the ""real"" ico from 15 March for a month. They seem to have stretched it out as much as they possibly could.  Nearly the whole team is the same as the one behind CashPokerPro, which was very similar in that it promised a very high price after ICO (the markets decide that price, not the ICO team) which was based on nothing. The price of CashPokerPro tanked after ICO and very little communication was done to investors, essentially the project was bled to death. When I did get a reaction from CashPokerPro on this, he said the project is still under development and that a product will be presented ""soon"". It's an easy defense that you can keep up forever.  There's just too many unanswered questions for it to be a legit ICO.  Just suppose they're genuine, why would you advertise it in an irresponsible way with the occasional lie thrown in. If you're the CEO of an ICO like that, would you not sit down with your team and simply address everyone's concerns? Take away doubt and double the amount of investments? Instead, they call people with criticism liars/scammers and don't address any questions/concerns. In fact, even good scammers would probably just address most of the questions/concerns in order to get more investments.  So the FireLotto team isn't just a bunch of scammers, they're a bunch of bad scammers. Coming up with a working product was an absolute stroke of genius though. They're just letting themselves down with the ""customer service"" team.",True

I think you're underestimating how you are feeding the negative thoughts surrounding this project with the strange personal attacks (black PR, paid shills etc). Just address the outstanding issues, clarify the 3 addresses, clarify the adviser issue, back up more statements like ""4 months until gaming licence"".  Another dodgy example from the WP: 12. How much will your tokens cost in the future? Token prices are influenced by many different factors, including political and economic ones. We can compare our product with TrueFlip, an online lottery that is already operating. If you look at the diagram below, you will see that the average price of the TFL coin (True Flip lottery) is about USD 1.00 (USD 1.05 as of October 20, 2017), (USD 3.29 as of January 07, 2018). [TrueFlip charts] We believe that the price of the Lotto token will exceed USD 1.00.  ICO's rarely make price predictions for after their ICO, prices are made by markets, not by the ICO team. Your claim of a USD 1 valuation is based on TrueFlip being worth USD 1. But you're forgetting one very important issue here, TrueFlip's total supply of tokens is under 9 million, circulating supply under 7 million. So by your reasoning, since TrueFlip is worth ~USD 9 millioni in total, so should FireLotto, since it's such a similar company. So a total valuation of USD 9 million, divided by the total token supply of FireLotto of 100 million tokens, meaning an estimated price per token of USD 0.09.  That piece of information should never have been allowed into the white paper in the first place. It's incorrect, misleading and based on thin air.

Sounds great, but is it really that good? First of all, let's assume they will actually sell 16 million tickets per year (~nearly 44000 per day, currently after being active for more than 2 months: less than 400).  I paid USD 0.38 for my FLOTS, assuming a return of 3.2 US cents per year that would be 0.032/0.38*100 = 8.42%  Looking at the increasing cost of the tokens, that yield is only going to get lower:  2. How much will one token cost? 15 March 12.00 UTC - 21 March 12.00 UTC - 0.50 $ - Annual yield 6.40% 21 March 12.00 UTC - 27 March 12.00 UTC - 0.60 $ - Annual yield 5.33% 27 March 12.00 UTC - 2 April 12.00 UTC - 0.70 $ - Annual yield 4.57% 02 April 12.00 UTC - 08 April 12.00 UTC- 0.80 $ - Annual yield 4.00% 08 April 12.00 UTC - 15 April 12.00 UTC - 0.90 $ - Annual yield 3.56%  The only way you could achieve 20% with 16m tickets sold is if you paid USD 0.16 for your tokens, but who paid that?  This is even an updated version, the old version of the white paper stated: ""Yield per token is 1.60 U.S. cents from each 16 million tickets sold, ..."" So the white paper was updated but they don't use any version management, they still pretend it was written in January.  As for the advertising campaign they keep mentioning, nobody has seen any advertising, the only thing they do is go to trade fairs (which is great) and they have the referral campaign (15% of ticket sales). There doesn't appear to be another advertising campaign pulling in 40+ thousand gamblers per day. All they say is soon, it will happen soon, after ico, after a few months, etc.  I asked them about these calculations, that 20% was a bogus percentage and they couldn't really deny that my figures are correct. Yet, no changes were made. They might as well pretend that they're going to sell 100 million tickets per year, works wonders for the return on investment.  I really thought I signed up for something new, something that would change things, finally I would be on the side of the lottery that always wins, unfortunately I'm now financially linked up with these rude Russian clowns.",True

The tokens that are not sold will be frozen and not accumulate any commission for the first year (until the end of the year? 12 months into next year? From/until what date?). So currently about 20 million flot sold out of a possible 77 million, 3 million flots bounty and 20 million flots for the team. Just say they sell another 7 million flots over the next few weeks until ico end.  Then the total will look like this: 27 million flots sold, 3 million bounty: 30 million flots Team holds: 20 million flots Unsold: 50 million flots  Now let's calculate some commission for an average month. We'll take the most recent draw as being representative of an average day. 4x20: 97 tickets, 5x36: 96 tickets, 6x45: 165 tickets = 358 tickets sold On average about 30 days in a month and an average ticket price of USD 2. 358 * 30 = 10,740 tickets sold in the month * USD2 = USD 21,480 Commission 10% of ticket sales. USD 21,480 * 10% = USD 2,148  The unsold tokens do not share in the commission (yet) but will be unfrozen/sold after the year is over. So commission per token = USD 2,148 / 50,000,000 tokens = USD 0.00004296 So per 1000 tokens = USD 0.04296  Cost to collect commission is playing in the lottery once at a cost of USD 2 (adding $0.20 to the commission), which seems a bit steep.  In this scenario the team holds 40% of the total tokens that share in the commission (20m out of 50m) and after the year is over they will hold (and be allowed to sell) 70% of all tokens (70m out of 100m), seriously diluting the share in commission.  In the worst case scenario they stop developing the website and leave it hanging like they did in CashPokerPro, just walking off with the investments to date. Best case scenario: the website gets successful and the investors do well, the team gets filthy rich.",True

So why do you post them?  This is such a minor lie on your part; how then am I to not believe the larger accusations being made against Fire Lotto?  Just because I am an investor does not mean I won't question what I see as being false information. I don't care to be represented by liars.

The are no such members by name of 'flagpole and Circles' This is something that you have made up in order to have people believe that the project is being scammed. And when I ask why you post these fake names, you refuse to answer. Instead you say that I, the investor, who is asking simple and real question, has an attitude.

I have read all of 'kermatis's' posts. They have only ever asked questions about the project. Questions only. But because they kept asking the same question to which you could not or would not provide an adequate answer, you put them on the 'Scam Team"" list. Please explain your reason for this.

Crypto-tokens that are securities must comply with the laws for traditional securities. The definition of a security is very broad, but does include (by recent clarification) practically all crytotokens that are not utility tokens that have immediate utility and whose value is not tied to the profits of a company or project. A registering a public offering is what a company does before an Initial Public Offering (IPO). It involves Form S-1, and the creation of a prospectus. The costs of producing the prospectus and registration materials, plus the ongoing reporting obligations, are so expensive, that practically no company executes a registered public offering without also “going public” on a secondary stock exchange such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. Otherwise, the costs greatly exceed the benefits (liquidity and access to capital that the major secondary stock markets provide).

However I think they are a scam that won't last long.  I was in their telegram group and I discovered in their white paper that each share for annual dividend payouts is only worth 3.2 cents per share (page 11 of their white paper). When I mentioned this in their telegram group (they must have thought that people would think the payout is too low) they immediately banned me and called me a scammer! This is how they treat an investor? I demanded a refund and they told me I can sell my shares once their ICO is listed in an exchange.  I looked deeper into their background and I noticed they are the same team that runs Cash Poker Pro. Cash Poker Pro was a failed ICO that is 100% a scam. Everyone who put money into it lost money and the project never launched. They never responded to any of their investors, and instead they're quickly launching this new Fire Lotto ICO instead!  Also all of the photos on their ICO site are completely fake.  There is a lot of suspicious movemenents of Ethereum payments through the blockchain. They regularly move 100 to 500 ETH out of their wallets and through several other wallets that then is used to buy other ICOs! That totally doesn't look scammy!

Having an open/public source code (all of them) adds credibility to the project and it's kinda expected nowadays, but as a (somewhat) developer myself, I can understand the reasons for wanting to keep the code hidden. Especially now when projects are being forked or copied all the time, I wouldn't want to expose all of my work for someone to copy it and possibly create a competition for myself. But on the other hand, I can't have a total confidence that the project is 100% legit or decentralized or whatever if they keep a major portion of the code hidden.

As for 'kermitas', I have been reading all the questions that he is asking. You give him answers but you do not give him answer to question he is asking. Do you not think that perhaps you do not understand his question properly because you do not understand the English language properly? You call him a scammer because he asks questions; fair questions.  The other problem I see here is that there is never any answer from the official Firelotto team. Why is that? Can you explain that, please?  As an investor in this project, I have no choice but to inform other investors that this is a scam. I am not trying to get money from anyone.

After a recommendation from a friend and reading positive ICO assessments, I invested in FLOT in the presale. Only later did I discover the Telegram group, unfortunately.  The admins there were very rude to their potential investors, somebody asking about the odds for the various wins in the lotteries was told to calculate it themselves. Often questions and answers went like this:  Q When will you offer xxx? A After ico/soon  Q What will the roadmap for 2018 look like? A What do you suggest?  Q Where can I see the current advertising? A A lot depends on flot investors creating promotion  It just didn't feel right, they had no real answers. Several times people were told to check the white paper, even though the white paper didn't really contain that much detail. When I read the white paper more closely, I found some basic errors (incorrect roi calculation, usd 1 expected valuation really based on nothing but some different lottery token being prices at usd 1 (with far less tokens in circulation) and a few others) and alerted the admins. I assumed they'd correct this asap, since the wp is such an important document.  But nothing happened.  When I asked them again a few days later I got questions like: What errors? So I would list them again, they'd sheepishly agree that it should be corrected and told me that would happen ""soon"". Again nothing happened. When I piped up a little louder about this, they booted me out of the Telegram chat after writing the immortal words: ""Thank you for your contribution"". I contacted the admin in pm and he said they'd get me to correct the wp in exchange for flots, I thought that would be a handy job. But then the pm went silent and I never heard from them again.  My investor friend was still in the Telegram group and asked the admins about the questions I had asked. The admin's answer was that they were ""collaborating"" with me, which they were not.  FireLotto is all held together with lies and empty promises. ""After ico"" is a great one, that's when all the cash has been received and can be divided among the team, all the while pretending to still be developing and improving, then slowly decreasing apparent output and in the end you just stop responding to anything and start a new project. If law enforcement knock on your door you can always say it's still ""in development"".  You have to hand it to them, having a ready and working product was a great move.  For anyone looking to invest now: Buyer beware!  PS After asking a question about the new SEC rules, under which FireLotto is supposed to be registered with FinCEM in the US, my FLOT investor friend got kicked out of the Telegram group too. It's just no way to treat investors with genuine questions.",True

I'm not a investor of that scammy project. I invested only in two projects so far. The first one was Enigma Catalyst and the second one was Tezos. I sold all my enigma tokens at X10 and now waiting for Tezos listing on exchanges. As you can see from my trust rating a lot of scammers left me negative feedback because I was correctly calling out ICO scams to warn members, especially deeponion, bitconnect , ethconnect, lendconnect and worldcore scams. I was doing that a long time before they exitscamed and were exposed as a obvious scams.  (Check my posts from the very beginning) https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=1094569;sa=showPosts So all that accusations from Fire Lotto scammers are nothing but a fake and bullshit. Now lets move to this scammy project. Is Fire Lotto a scam? The answer is YES! Why?  CEO of Fire Lotto Roman Demidov was involved in countless scams. 1 Cashpokerpro (Failed and disappeared with investors money) 2 ICOLAB.ME (Stole the identities of Jake Brukhmanand and Adam Draper to advertise them as advisers of that scam ICO. Scammers deleted the website) 3. Fire Lotto (2 different fake addresses on website within one week, false statement about gambling license, false statements about SEC) All this can be seen here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2579275.msg31624935#msg31624935  And the most important thing. After being exposed Fire Lotto scammers are not answering any questions of community members.  There is only one answer to all question and you can read it here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2579275.msg31643586#msg31643586  Fake extortion letters (Probably written by scammers themselves to mislead the community.

I can't believe the way Firelotto is handling this situation as it is. They seem only driven to promote the project and upcoming ICO. They have some real problems here at the moment and they just aren't addressing them.  From what I've been reading lately it does appear that they are being scammed by some group who wants money from them. However, if Firelotto is indeed legit then they have nothing to fear from the scammers.  My name now happens to be on this list of supposed scammers and I am pissed about that. I am a legit investor having bought FLOT. My investment here is my first step into the world of cryptocurrency, so of course, I would have a newbie account. I have actually posted a screengrab showing my purchase into their project yet they still want to tell everyone that I am part of the SCAM TEAM. Not wanting to look into, correct or acknowledge that they have made a mistake makes me feel they only have one objective and that is grab what money they can and fuck the people that bought into the project.  I have contacted Firelotto support regarding this matter but have not yet received a response from them.  I don't really care to be involved in this, but this is my money and I have a right to call them out as an investor. However, as anyone can see here, they are showing no signs of looking after their investor. Call him a scammer instead.  One thing I don't understand now and I am not claiming to be a businessman of any sort is why would a project have so many people working with it that were connected to another recently failed project. They must have known that at some point people would start connecting the dots.  So is this really just a scam, intended to make some quick money and then fold? I don't know. What I do know is that Firelotto is very slow to protect the investor.",True

You wrote: Quote The guys said that they were removed from there, but they were removed very long  So you claim that Adam Draper and Jake Brukhman knew that their names were posted on the icolab.me website? Right? And they told you what ""they were removed from there"". Well, let's fix this statement here and ask them if it's true. It will be fair.  Roman, all your attempts to justify yourself do not work. You just look ridiculous - fake screenshots, incredible stories about extortionists and mysterious partners who made the site.

I started to eventually feel safer about investing and bought in just before the presale ended. It wasn't until I asked my first question on the forum and got some shitty ass response from ket_gav, that I started having some real doubts.  I invested with that saying, 'invest only what you can afford to lose' and so was always aware I was taking a gamble. If I just outright lost the money, I could handle that, but to be called a scammer is something else. Totally pisses me off to no end. Whatever I can do to bring these guys down now, I am prepared to do.  There are YouTube videos and several other forums where people are asking questions about this project.

For example: 000000000000000000229a9deacb0ed81b54afb92581e9b5b2e25dbd3a8069a2  Step 2: An array of all the numbers that can be drawn is built. For example, an array for the 6/45 lottery will consist of 45 elements from 1 to 45 inclusive.  Step 3: The last n bytes are taken from the bitcoin hash, where n is the number of balls drawn. For example, n = 6 for the 6/45 lottery.  Step 4: Each byte received goes through the modulo operation and is divided by the remaining number of elements in the array of all available numbers. The remainder serves as an index of the number that has been drawn from the array of all available numbers. The number that has been drawn is transferred to a separate array of numbers drawn and is deleted from the array of all available numbers.  Step 5: This iteration is repeated n times in order to get all n numbers drawn.  An optimized code for a smart contract is shown below.  function getWinNumbers(string randomStr, uint numberCount, uint numberCountMax) constant public returns (bytes){  bytes32 random = keccak256(randomStr);  bytes memory allNumbers = new bytes(numbersCountMax);  bytes memory winNumbers = new bytes(numbersCount);  for (uint i = 0; i < numbersCountMax; i++) {  allNumbers = byte(i + 1);  }  for (i = 0; i < numbersCount; i++) {  uint n = numbersCountMax - i;  uint r = uint(random[random.length - 1 - i]) % n;  winNumbers = allNumbers[r];  allNumbers[r] = allNumbers[n - 1];  }  return winNumbers; }",True

This scammers are trying to lure you into completely illegal activities. The SEC has no present rules that address cryptotokens specifically, only securities in general. Crypto-tokens that are securities must comply with the laws for traditional securities. The definition of a security is very broad, but does include (by recent clarification) practically all crytotokens that are not utility tokens that have immediate utility and whose value is not tied to the profits of a company or project. A registering a public offering is what a company does before an Initial Public Offering (IPO). It involves Form S-1, and the creation of a prospectus. The costs of producing the prospectus and registration materials, plus the ongoing reporting obligations, are so expensive, that practically no company executes a registered public offering without also “going public” on a secondary stock exchange such as the NYSE or NASDAQ. Otherwise, the costs greatly exceed the benefits (liquidity and access to capital that the major secondary stock markets provide). So do you really believe, that Fire Lotto that does not have a operating license, that is registered in offshore and operated by Russian criminals will be listed on NYSE or NASDAQ ??   This is another confirmation that this project is organized and orchestrated by criminals.  Now let me introduce you to Fire Lotto Scammers.

So what I get is that smart contracts are secret because Fire Lotto is sooo afraid that somebody could copy them.  On my other technical questions, like potential bugs during withdrawal process, they could not simply ask developers and publish the answer here. Instead they said that there will be an audit done by some external company and maybe I will find answers on my questions there, in that audit.

The cost of transactions will become very high and people will prefer to keep their ETH on cold wallets, hoping the currency will start growing in the future. If this happens, we will have to switch to an alternative cryptocurrency with a commensurate level of security, accessibility, and speed of operation. However, it will take some time. 3) We believe that the blockchain technology can solve current problems in the lottery industry like no other tool. Its implementation will bring the lottery industry to a new level of development, making it as transparent and accessible as possible. Have you ever considered the option of switching to another platform? take for example the Ethereum classic. But there should be more akin to Waves.

Available online and borderless, such a system can resolve several challenges of traditional lotteries.  The proposed lottery will employ the random number generation (RNG) method, which is secure and fair and prevents manipulation and fraud. This project implements a completely secure RNG method based on the current version of the Bitcoin decentralized protocol.  We will offer two types of lotteries: instant lotteries and draw lotteries. The Roger’s Wheel instant lottery is a mix between the traditional wheel of fortune and a slot machine. In this game, players can place bets ranging from 0,003 ETH (~USD 2.00) to 1 ETH (~USD 1,000.00) and choose a payout rate from 2 to 20, which will be used to multiply their winnings. Next, the player spins the wheel divided into 21 sectors with different payout rates on them. If the wheel stops at the player’s chosen rate, he or she will instantly have the winnings (the bet multiplied by the payout rate) transferred to their cryptocurrency wallet. The player can turn an unlimited number of wheels in one game, which reduces the waiting time and increases the number of tickets bought by the player. The wheel rotates for 20–30 seconds. The randomness of the game is ensured by ETH blockchain-based RNG. Its description will be given later in the text.  We offer three types of draw lotteries: 4/20, 5/36, and 6/45. Our platform allows for the addition of new types of lotteries in the future. The player enters the lottery site with a traditional and user-friendly interface, where he or she can buy almost an unlimited number of lottery tickets and choose numbers for each ticket. Tickets are bought in one click through the user’s cryptocurrency wallet. An Ethereum transaction goes to the smart contract of the chosen lottery, contributing to the prize pool. 70% of all lottery ticket sales are allocated to the prize pool. Table 1 shows data on the distribution of lottery funds.  More information you can get here https://firelotto.io/whitepaper_en.pdf",True

Congratulations to all of us, we performed Soft Cap !!!  Informatoin about PRIVATE KEYS! I also want to provide information about PRIVATE KEYS.Player enters his private key so its easy and convenient for him to purchase lottery ticket without leaving lottery web page. Otherwise player needs to copy address of the smart contract, go to his wallet, paste the address and make a payment. Its too many hard steps to buy a ticket and we will lose all the players. But if such type payment seems convenient and safer for some players we will make a necessary update soon. Thus, there will be 3 safe ways to purchase ticket: 1. Directly from lottery web page using private key (using especially registered wallet for that), 2. Payment from players wallet registered at some third party resource, 3. Metamask (plugin to your browser).  Fire Lotto never store private keys. It is just solution to buy lottery tickets If you find where Fire Lotto store privat keys,  you will get 100 eth!!!

Both Fire Lotto and Cash Poker Pro are both operated by the same company: Tavaron Media Group. Do you even have a company website for this? Only info I can get is the company was established since 2014.  2.) What is the relationship between these two ICOs/projects? As I can see, the Fire Lotto CEO, namely Roman Demidov, who is also the advisor of Cash Poker Pro. For those who are interested to know, Cash Poker Pro did their ICOs sometime in the Q3 of 2017 and their ICO price is the same as Fire Lotto, which is $0.50, but God knows this Cash Poker Pro coin (CASH) price dropped to about $0.10. In term of ETH, the initial price of this Cash Poker Pro was 0.0018 ETH / CASH and now its price is 0.000072  / CASH on etherdelta.com, more than 17x fall in price (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2056999.280), so will this Fire Lotto share the same fate in next couple of months? Even though you claim you have a finished product now. P/S: Cash Poker Pro team never even answer the questions asked by their community on bitcointalk, twitter and so on. So far, they only updated news once per month. LOL!  Even though your presale price now is $0.35, but I don't think I can invest before you clarify some of these doubts. Thanks!",True

A situation in which the global community stops using cryptocurrencies or they become banned and criminalized in most developed countries.  2. The use of Ethereum, the main means of payment at the moment, as an investment tool similar to the way Bitcoin is now being used. The cost of transactions will become very high and people will prefer to keep their ETH on cold wallets, hoping the currency will start growing in the future. If this happens, we will have to switch to an alternative cryptocurrency with a commensurate level of security, accessibility, and speed of operation. However, it will take some time.  3. We believe that the blockchain technology can solve current problems in the lottery industry like no other tool. Its implementation will bring the lottery industry to a new level of development, making it as transparent and accessible as possible.

You're just trying to hide it all guys.  The truth is that you have made the site icolab.me, to create the illusion for your CEO as a experienced specialist, which he certainly never was. To do this, you took the names of famous people in the crypto industry, but place them to a separate site, in the hope that no one will understand in detail.

My name is Roman. I am CEO of Firelotto. I am happy to answer all your questions.   Mr. ""Trolling"" I'm thinking your whole life is a scam. Received an order from Mr. ""Trolling."" Mr ""Trolling"" deals with black PR and spreads lies. In early January 2018, he began to extort 3 bitcoins from us in exchange for good reviews, and if we refuse, then black PR will begin. Here is the correspondence with it     https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lZvJZtdc4JISzS-0kABKMT3g0JxIU9B8  Tim and Adam wrote in Tweeter https://twitter.com/jbrukh/status/950443915999629314  ""ATTENTION! http://Http://icolab.me/ is a listing and @AdamDraper as advisors to their ICO. "" I'm NOT ANY WAY associated with this project, it sounds like a phishing scheme or a scam. ""Please be informed.""  In other words, Jake and Adam are not related to the Icolab. And they believe that this is phishing and cheating and suggest not to contact icolab  What does this have to do with us?  Nothing. That's why we do not see anything in their words: 1. About the Roman Demidov - not a word 2. About Firelotto - not a word 3. About Danil - not a word  What is icolab? What connects me to this project?  Everything is very simple and elementary. My partners were going to launch the project icolab. I was invited to this project as an expert, and of course the co-founder. The project was supposed to select the best start-ups of the World and accordingly launch them through ico. The project did not start, the site was abandoned, and people were left on the site, although they had to remove everyone. Including myself. The site was not advertised anywhere. The site is essentially a draft and is located at 8,308,633 place. Anyone wishing to do this can check it out on independent resources https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/icolab.me  Who likes you if you are posted on a site that has not started and you no longer take part in it ?! The guys said that they were removed from there, but they were removed very long .... So the guys wrote that if we do not participate. I would have done the same if administrators had been dragging out time  Now when everyone became clear, I think we put an end to this meaningless conversation with Mr. ""Troll"". I do not even want to react to his spam anymore.  Most recently, among the best start-ups in Asia was the choice. And our project FIRELOTTO was chosen among 1000 startups. I was personally invited by the government. A big investor and a venture capitalist, such as Tim Draper, came to this event. As a result, our startup was in the top 3! This video tells about this  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lfAbECDqj01VrKuTZtmiozWj-Oo9l6wr  In this video we were invited along with well-known experts. We talked about the implementation of blockchain architecture in state bodies   https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ahal_znySD5o3f_LUUizeZJBFXzFM2LA  If you have any questions, as well as there are cool ideas for the promotion and improvement of our project.

Right? And they told you what ""they were removed from there"". Well, let's fix this statement here and ask them if it's true. It will be fair.  Roman, all your attempts to justify yourself do not work. You just look ridiculous - fake screenshots, incredible stories about extortionists and mysterious partners who made the site.

A situation in which the global community stops using cryptocurrencies or they become banned and criminalized in most developed countries.  2. The use of Ethereum, the main means of payment at the moment, as an investment tool similar to the way Bitcoin is now being used. The cost of transactions will become very high and people will prefer to keep their ETH on cold wallets, hoping the currency will start growing in the future. If this happens, we will have to switch to an alternative cryptocurrency with a commensurate level of security, accessibility, and speed of operation. However, it will take some time.  3. We believe that the blockchain technology can solve current problems in the lottery industry like no other tool. Its implementation will bring the lottery industry to a new level of development, making it as transparent and accessible as possible.

How do you plan to minimize regulatory risks, especially those related to the Howey Test? The main difference between the security token and the utility token is that the first one enables its holder to get profit without doing anything. A person can simply buy a token and get dividends. Having analyzed the current international legislation, we adopted a set of measures aimed at making it clear that our tokens should not be classified as security tokens: - Holders of our tokens will get commissions from sales rather than dividends. This system will be in essence the same as the system of referral payments discussed earlier. - In order to receive commissions, each token holder has to play the lottery. In other words, each token holder will have to buy a certain number of lottery tickets every month in order to be able to receive commissions from sales. The number of tickets and the frequency of purchases are being calculated at the moment and will be announced later. Given that one lottery ticket costs only 2 U.S. dollars, token holders will not have to spend a lot of money on buying lottery tickets, and at the same time this measure will help us solve legal issues and stimulate the lottery. -Together with lawyers and advisors from New York, we are discussing the option of inviting a professional investor to our team. This will enable us to attract funds from U.S. citizens to our ICO in accordance with the rules and requirements established by the SEC and U.S. government.",True

Winnings are automatically paid in full within 90 seconds of the drawing. Transfers are made to the cryptocurrency wallets that were used to buy the winning tickets. In the draw lottery, every 10th ticket wins a prize. What makes our lottery special is the fact that our winners will always win. The thing is that many lotteries have a payout rate of 1 for two matching numbers, which means that players only win back their bet.  However, we should remember that there is a tax on gambling winnings, which means that the player who guessed two numbers will lose at least 30% of their bet rather than win anything. In our lottery, the minimum payout rate for two matching numbers is at least 1.6, which means that the player will get paid back more than one and a half of the cost of the ticket.  Fire Lotto token holders will also have sales commission transferred to their cryptocurrency wallets after the drawing. The sales commission rate will be fixed in the smart contract. Commission will be paid in ETH. Token holders will be free to use their share of sales commission as they wish. All processes and distribution operations in the system will be carried out based on the mechanisms built into smart contracts, which will exclude the possibility of their being influenced by the lottery organizers.  Everything will be done autonomously, honestly and transparently.  http://image.ibb.co/hzEc6m/26219835_2043655725916670_1967937331583694924_n.jpg",True

Players have always question the genuineness the tickets sold, the pool for the money accumulated, identity of jackpot winners, and the security of Random Number Generators, or RNG. Several high-profile cases of lottery manipulation like the 1980 Pennsylvania Lotto scandal and the recent conviction of Eddie Tipton in 2010 has not only increased player's concerns, but eroded market confidence.  The growing penetration of the internet and adoption mobile devices has resulted in increased accessibility to lottery platform. However, most of them remain inaccessible to players due to regulations or underdeveloped market. Those who can participate have no control over how much money is collected from ticket sales and when they do win, can have up to 60% of their winnings withheld.  Fire Lotto, an international Blockchain lottery, has announced their token sale to address this issue. Launched in December, the ongoing first phase - a private pre-sale - will put their FLOT token in the hands of early contributors and participants.

Unlike other ICOs, our ICO will follow the launch of the lottery rather than precede it. The product will be launched on January 01, 2018. The beta version is available for testing today! The lottery will be launched with a minimum prize pool of USD 1 million. On the day when the lottery is launched, we will publish its source code on Github for inspection. The lottery will be launched in the operating mode, which means that users will be able to enjoy all its features, play, and win. The moment the lottery is launched, transfers will be automatically made within the smart contract to the wallet responsible for collecting sales commission and paying them to token holders.  - The pre-ICO will open on January 15, 2018 and close on Februaru 15, 2018.  - The ICO will open on March 15, 2018 and close on April 15, 2018.  This means that when the ICO opens, investors will be surprised to see not only a finished product, but also a huge prize pool available to be won and sales commission distribution among token holders in real-time mode. This ICO roadmap is going to be implemented for the first time ever, and it will become a distinctive feature of this project.",True
