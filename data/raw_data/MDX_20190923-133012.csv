I've heard good and bad from people about the KYC process, including annoyance at having to constantly reconfirm investment.  We've also -finally- received an 'official' update on crypto investments... April 20th... *groan* StartEngine has offered to cover the cost of us amending our offering to extend, and I believe we will take advantage of that offer to allow non-accredited cryptocurrency investors a chance to get in at this most advantageous stage.  Edit: If an investment hasn't cleared prior to a close the money will get disbursed to the 3rd party escrow account, then to us after the clearing period.  Quote from: diepvien98712 on April 06, 2018, 02:18:30 PM An interesting idea. Tell me when the work will be completed?  I have been working closely with our CTO over the last weeks, we have deployed an internal blockchain and private IPFS, we will be hosting a workshop at Colorado University of Boulder showcasing some of this work this coming weekend. In the next 1-1.5 months we should be ready to launch a minimum viable product demo as we transition into our Regulation D 506(c) offering for accredited investors only. We are hopeful that our platform will be launch ready in late Q4 2018 early Q1 2019.

Not sure if the KYC changes depending on level of investment on a Regulation CF, but presumably StartEngine just does the minimum necessary checks.

See: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180420005069/en/StartEngine-PrimeTrust-Announce-Reg-CF-Crypto-Escrow  I sent out a poll to our StartEngine investors and followers that indicates over-all support for another extension.

The reason we can't accept cryptocurrency is entirely because StartEngine has so far refused to make it available for Regulation CF offerings despite offering it for Regulation D 506(c) and Regulation A+ offerings.

Good to know, sounds like you’ve got a very proactive team.  I invested; though I wonder if the funds will clear prior to your anticipated close... looks like the funds take 10 days to clear SE’s automated clearinghouse and you might be closing in <5 days.  What happens if the timing is not aligned?  Also it took <3 min to invest... pretty quick.  I was also a bit surprised that the subscription docs weren’t sent by start engine or even linked to the payment page... maybe a bit TOO streamlined?  How long will you keep the offering open?

Current EMR systems as centralized silos with limited communication capability, inadequate transparency and a lack of interoperability. These infrastructure problems can be solved by MedChain.  The 21st Century Healthcare system requires interoperability - The ability of computer systems and software to exchange and make use of key patient information, allowing primary healthcare providers to communicate with additional providers such as labs and pharmacies. But currently-available Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems might not follow the patient between providers and might not facilitate effective communication.  MedChain Is The Solution                      Provider Benefits Utilizing MedChain's blockchain and software, heathcare providers can have near-instant access to medical records of new patients, and could potentially save several  billion dollars each year in fines associated with data breaches.  In addition to significant savings, patient information can also be kept secure with extremely reduced risk of identifiable data being leaked.           Patient Benefits Utilizing MedChain's smartphone and web applications, patients will be able to eliminate and/or avoid redundant testing due to lack of record-sharing between providers.  Health records can also be near-instantaneously available in cases of emergency, including when the individual is non-responsive but has their smartphone on them.  The MedChain Blockchain  The MedChain Network protocol is based on a Data and Application Layer integrating an ERC20-Standard or similar token on an Ethereum based blockchain.  Mining, data validation, data storage, proof-of-storage and proof-of-retrievability will be provided by a network of decentralized and federated servers as part of the blockchain protocol in conjunction with MedChain software (via both patient & provider apps) for trading MedCoins, converting MedCoins to Entry Tokens, and to ensure payment for blockchain Entries.  The MedChain blockchain will function as a hash depository for the decentralized storage network, which will be fully auditable and verifiable by a network of federated servers. The federated servers will be paid with MedCoins in return for storage space and retrieval of information.  All storage and retrieval requests will function with the use of Entry Tokens rather than MedCoins.   Federated mining nodes will be compensated with MedCoins for executing valid and verified transactions.   Why MedChain?  At the moment many '[Suspicious link removed]panies in the healthcare field are excluding the U.S. market for several reasons, largely to avoid SEC scrutiny, but also because HIPAA compliance can be hard to understand and adhere to for the uninitiated.  Our founders have extensive experience in the healthcare field, particularly healthcare IT, and as entrepreneurs.
