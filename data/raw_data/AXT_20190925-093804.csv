We’re proud to announce this project to the Bitcointalk community. In this announcement thread we’re going to describe the project, the team, and point you to a variety of resources you can use to learn more about us and what we’re doing, and to connect directly with us. Much of the information presented in this post has been sourced from our White Paper and website. Thank you for your interest in our project!   Join us on Telegram, follow us on Twitter, and “Like” our Facebook page. This is the primary way we intend to engage with and update our growing community.

Project Preface Imagine for a moment having access to a global online automotive marketplace offering hundreds of thousands of vehicles, financing, insurance, vehicle service contracts (i.e., warranties), auto parts, performance aftermarket parts, and more; all powered by blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. Now imagine that an automotive technology company with over 250,000 registered members, motivated by a vision to change the automotive industry and the car-buying process, was out to make that happen. That’s what DASHUB is doing, that’s what this project is, and it’s called the Automotive eXchange Platform (AXP for short).   Token Sale Process DASHUB Inc. will offer the AXT security token to accredited investors in three phases: Pursuant to the Soft Cap and Hard Cap detailed in the Token Distribution section of the White Paper, phase (1) consists of a private presale (CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS!); Phase (2) will consist of a public presale with a minimum purchase amount and tiered bonuses which can be found on https://axt.io during the time of sale. Phase (3) will be the ICO, open to US and international accredited investors.  Prospective purchasers should visit https://axt.io to register for the crowdsale. All potential purchasers will be required to undergo KYC/AML screening and accreditation verification.   Overview of the Automotive eXchange Platform (AXP) The Automotive eXchange Platform (AXP) will be a blockchain-based platform produced by DASHUB to enhance DASHUB’s current automotive business. DASHUB intends to integrate its primary website www.dashub.com with the AXP using an Application Programming Interface (API). Being the first interface for AXP, consumers will interact with the AXP through www.dashub.com and an integrated wallet.  At the core of the AXP is a decentralized distributed ledger and a special type of Smart Contract called a Vehicle Smart Contract. Essentially, through a series of initial business and consumer Use Cases (detailed below), a new type of public vehicle history will be created. And because the AXP’s token (AXT) will be integral to the functioning of the platform, a new type of economy can emerge from within the automotive ecosystem. Within this potential new economy DASHUB is exploring a pioneering revenue-splitting model, laying the groundwork for mass industry-appeal and mass industry-adoption.  This approach does not require mass industry-adoption to function properly. DASHUB’s initial Use Cases for both their business and their consumers will function as intended, generate value, and lay the foundation for expansion into the industry. In the following subsections you will learn about each initial Use Case.  Use Cases (a brief overview)  For a detailed look at each Use Case we encourage you to read the AXP White Paper hosted on https://axt.io. What you will find below is a brief overview of each Use Case to give you an idea of how the early-stage platform might look.           Scaling the Platform DASHUB hopes to use the momentum generated by the launch of AXP (with DASHUB as the first interface for the AXP) to scale the platform to the industry at large. It is anticipated  that some of the companies that come on board will use the existing Vehicle Smart Contracts created by DASHUB, and that some of them will create novel Smart Contracts to be used on the platform. DASHUB has a long-term and expansive vision for the platform’s potential growth that involves:  Automobile manufacturers Dealer management systems (DMS) Dealerships Fleet enterprises Auction houses Floor plan companies Financial institutions Insurance companies Warranty and vehicle service contract companies State and regulatory bodies, such as: Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) Department of Transportation (DOT) and related agencies such as the National Highways Safety Administration (NHTSA) Local law enforcement Auto parts and the performance aftermarket Autonomous vehicle integrators IoT integrators Auto racing Logistics companies  The team knows that such a grand vision cannot coalesce without a lot of hard work, hitting the pavement, and by cultivating strategic partnerships. This work has already begun with several penned partnerships, and many more that are still being developed.   Who is DASHUB? DASHUB inc. (a Delaware, USA corporation) is an online automotive marketplace that operates www.dashub.com with a staff of about 20 FTE (Full Time Equivalent). The website was launched in 2015. It all started when the founders identified an opportunity in the market for re-marketed auction automobiles. They saw that every year millions of vehicles were being auctioned to dealers and other companies for up to 80% off the retail value, and that these vehicles were largely unavailable to the general public. DASHUB was established to offer these vehicles directly to the general public, all through their online automotive marketplace (www.dashub.com), and through direct partnerships with the auction houses. Anyone who wants to browse the inventory or purchase a vehicle through DASHUB registers as a DASHUB member. DASHUB members then have the option of bidding on and/or purchasing vehicles through DASHUB’s auction portal, thereby potentially saving thousands of dollars.
