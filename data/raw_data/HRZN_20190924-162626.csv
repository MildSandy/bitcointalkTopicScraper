Gigabit LTE will be crucial to the success of the 4G Advanced and 5G networks, providing high-bandwidth coverage for customers.  While firms such as AT&T and Verizon have already announced that they would be rolling out these new networks, although users might not be in a position to use such speeds on their mobile phones until 2019. Horizon Communications already plans on using Gigabit LTE to provide high-speed internet and cell phone connections to customers in its markets.   What is Gigabit LTE and how does it work?  LTE stands for long-term evolution and Gigabit LTE is the advanced form of LTE. Right now, most mobile phones make use of the wireless 4G to connect to other devices. Gigabit LTE derives its name from the fact that its peak speed is at 1 gigabit per second.  Gigabit LTE is made up of three components; the 4x4 MIMO antenna and radio, carrier aggregation (CA), and 256 QAM. The 4x4 MIMO refers to the antennas that aid the phone in picking up different signals. The CA identifies different radio frequency bands and picks the one with the most speed. The 256 QAM transmits the huge data bandwidths. All these components work together to deliver high-speed wireless connections.  How is the Gigabit LTE being used in homes and businesses?  High speed internet is becoming a necessity in today’s world, and it is no wonder that telecoms such as Horizon Communications have identified this need and have risen to the occasion. Smart watches, cars, homes, and business operations are increasingly demanding stable internet connectivity.  The same technology that drives communications for cell phones will be used by Horizon Communications to provide fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, which is a watershed moment for ISP’s to capitalize on. LTE’s advancements have increased to the point of overcoming the speed of coax and fiber-optic services, at a hugely competitive rollout price and time of installation.  With Gigabit LTE, internet users are able to download such things as TV shows and games on the go. More homes have Wi-Fi connected television sets, lighting, smart security systems and other IoT appliances designed for convenience. Gigabit LTE is able to support multiple smart devices and different data streams on the telecommunications network, giving customers options in getting service to their deceives.  Businesses will be able to do live video-conferencing, sharing of large files, and online training is now possible. Gigabit LTE will also enable the pulling of files off the cloud storage faster.  Gigabit LTE will enable startups running on a lean budget to operate without having to invest in network infrastructure or a broadband connectivity, thus enabling virtual offices. Applications such as Accounts, CRM, Business Intelligence, and other data-intensive applications will work seamlessly whether you are on the go or working from home. This technology will see more companies build industry-specific apps. Lean startups will be able to respond faster to market demands and therefore, compete with established businesses. Bigger firms will be able to get information faster and make data-based decisions more effectively to deliver a better client experience.  These are only some of the impacts Gigabit LTE will have on homes and businesses. It is currently available in about 25 countries and devices such as Samsung Galaxy S9 and iPhone 8 already support it.  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon. He has 18 years experience in information technology and telecom solutions, a veteran in Fire and EMS Services, a crypto enthusiast and a member of the Bermuda Government’s Cryptocurrency Task Force.  Horizon Communications is an upcoming fixed wireless internet and cellular service provider looking to provide services in Bermuda, the Caribbean, and Central America before expanding internationally.  While utilizing 4th generation and soon 5th generation wireless technology, it will also heavily incorporate blockchain and cryptocurrency technology, one of the 1st ISP’s in the world to do so and the 1st to tokenize their services using an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).

The letter showed up in my post office box, sent via first class mail from a place called DMAC — short for Direct Marketing Action Company. It was four pages long, filled with an almost breathless writing style that laid out the amazing money making possibilities for a video production business. It told of a guy from Arkansas who had become a millionaire with almost no experience in video production and explained his easy to follow formula for how to do the same. And the cost was only $195 for the package on how to do it.  Although something seemed just a little bit off about the whole thing, I was intrigued by the ideas that the letter brought up. Making how-to videos seemed like a really good idea. You make the video once and sell it many times over. It was an idea that had the potential to scale up. Most of the other business plans for video production involved doing specialty work like promotional videos for businesses, television commercials or even wedding videos. Doing specialty work was a way to make a living, doing how-to videos sounded like a way to make a fortune. I was in, and sent a check to DMAC for the information package.  A few days later, the package arrived. It was a series of three informational “books” — they were more like long magazine articles, a couple of videotapes and a one-year subscription to the “Video Marketing Newsletter”, all of which was written by a guy who was writing from his desk in Hot Springs, Arkansas. It covered a lot of material, and only a small percentage of it had to do with video production. His basic claim to fame was that he had done an instructional video on how to build your own satellite descrambler box. Apparently, he knew some people that were willing to show him how to do it, so he videotaped them and made a crude video that covered all of the steps needed to build a descrambler. This was before Dish Network and DirectTV, and the home satellite systems of the time consisted of a giant dish with a complicated set of receivers and descramblers that picked up the same signals that the networks used to deliver programming to their network affiliates and cable systems all over the country. Certain networks used a primitive scrambling unit to prevent home users from picking up movie channels like HBO or raw network feeds. The cost for a descrambler was high and required a high subscription price, so there was some demand for a way to bypass the scrambling.  This guy looked for ways to market his video and started using direct mail methods. Within a few months, his video had sold a bunch of copies and he had made over $200,000 in pure profit. It was pretty clear that the video was legally and ethically shady, but he was only selling an information product and he had not done any of the actual hacking needed to make the descramblers. Legal and ethical questions aside, he had figured out that selling information products was a great way to make a bunch of money and now that VCRs were present in just about every household and video was inexpensive to produce and somewhat unique, producing “how-to” videos looked like a big growth opportunity.  I bought into that idea, but balanced it out with the practical need to make enough money on other projects to pay for the equipment and labor to do the work. I put together a business plan for a video production business, and set it up so that any local specialty work would cover the income needed to stay operational, and a percentage of time would be set aside for working on information products. When I put my final equipment list together, it looked like I was going to need about $10,000 to purchase a Video Toaster, three editing VCR decks, an S-VHS camera and the needed accessories to do basic video work. But if I hit the jackpot on a video like this guy did, I would pay that money back in a hurry!  I did not have that kind of money just sitting around, so I was going to have to get a loan. Dad had set up a partnership for me and my siblings called LEMM that was occasionally used as a partner on some of his cattle feeding ventures. I did not have the borrowing capacity for a $10,000 loan, but LEMM did, so I visited with dad and our banker about starting this video production business and having LEMM provide the security. Dad was not real excited about me starting the business, as he felt it was going to be a distraction from my broker job. I was very adamant about wanting to do this as a part time venture, and I had put in a lot of work on a business plan that showed exactly how I was going to make it work. The banker felt that the business plan was decent, and I was able to get the loan. Dad had not given his full approval for it, and was in fact going to tell me that we could not do it, but I had already gotten the check, completed the paperwork and signed for LEMM. It was too late now, and that monthly payment looked like it was going to be easy to handle once I was bringing in some video production revenue.  Soon after the loan was approved, I had to make a trip to Eastern Nebraska to visit another brokerage in Grand Island. The author of the information package that I had purchased, lived near Clarks, NE, about 35 miles from Grand Island. I decided to call him up and see if I could stop by to visit about some of the things that were in his information package. He seemed hesitant at first, but finally agreed to a meetup.  On the drive to Grand Island, I was overflowing with questions about how I could grow my video production business, what kind of equipment I should get next and what kind of projects I should be focused on. After all, this was the guy who was selling the plan and he had to have a lot of great knowledge that he could pass on to me that would help me take my business to the next level. I couldn’t wait to meet this sage and pick his brain.  When I arrived at the farmhouse I was met at the door by Evan Williams, another farm kid about my age who had also gone to the University of Nebraska. I started to pepper him with questions about the video business and it soon became clear and he did not really know much about video production. He showed me his room in the basement, where he had a computer, piles of specialty magazines and neatly organized shelves full of books, papers and videotapes. One of the shelves was marked “Video Production Package” and had a few copies of the information package that he had sold me. Evan was not an expert in video production, he was a direct marketer. He had purchased reprint rights to several information packages and placed ads in specialty magazines for the packages. When someone responded to one of his ads, he sent out a finely crafted letter that made it sound as if that package had all the answers they would ever need about the subject. The package that I had bought for $195 probably cost all of $15 to print and $3 to ship.  I felt like Dorothy after she discovered the Great and Powerful Oz was just a little man from Omaha hiding behind a curtain. I was expecting to meet a business guru, and instead I met another frustrated farmboy, who had dropped out of school and was living in his parent’s basement selling reprinted information. However, my disappointment soon vanished, because he had something to show me that he thought was way more exciting than direct mail marketing or video production.  Evan asked me, “Are you on the Internet?”  I had no idea what he was talking about. There was no Internet when I was in college, just a bunch of mainframes and green screen terminals in the Computer Science and engineering departments that looked like relics from the Cold War. I had seen ads for 1200 baud modems and Compuserve in Byte Magazine, but had no idea how they could be very useful. There was no Google or Yahoo, and Mosaic 1.0, the first web browser, was yet to be released to the public. No, I was definitely not on the Internet.  “What exactly is the Internet?” I asked him.  Evan booted up his computer and I heard the modem tones that sounded like a fax machine and in a couple of minutes some primitive graphics from the Prodigy online service popped up on his screen. He showed me email, bulletin boards and best of all, newsgroups. This was right in the middle of what came to be known as the “Eternal September” among old-school Internet users, when a seemingly endless stream of new users discovered the Internet newsgroups through Prodigy, Compuserve, Delphi and America Online.  “This is going to change everything,” he said.  Despite the clunky graphics and pokey interface, I could see that this was a game changer. Having the ability to get information about nearly any subject and direct access to experts was a simple and yet very powerful concept. All of the shelves full of information packages on the back wall were going to be obsolete very soon.  Another subject that we talked about was “multimedia”. Multimedia computers — machines with high powered graphics cards, CD-ROM drives, sound cards and graphical interfaces were now the must have item. Educational programs and titles were coming out for these new multimedia computers, and multimedia production was picking up steam. The graphics and sound capabilities and the seemingly limitless storage capacity of CD-ROMs meant that these new, low cost personal computers had a much larger potential utility for education and entertainment.  I left Evan’s house with a renewed energy. I squeezed a multimedia computer and modem into the equipment list. It was time to pick a name for the company, and it seemed like the name should have media in it. One day my father made the remark that I was good at coming up with “inventive” ways to waste my time. I took that as a compliment and used it as part of the name for my enterprise — Inventive Media. I cleared out the spare bedroom in my rented farm house, ordered my computer and video production equipment and waited for it to arrive.  When the equipment showed up, it was like Christmas! I hooked everything up as quickly as I could and started teaching myself how to use the system to make videos. The Video Toaster and AmiLink editor, hooked up to a set of Panasonic S-VHS editing decks was far better than anything I had used in college and almost as good as the broadcast quality gear I had worked with at KSTF. The Video Toaster could do all kinds of cool things, like character generation, special effects and even animations. For the next couple of weeks, I raced home from work to immerse myself in instructional videos on how to use the Toaster and all of the related software that came with it. When I was done with that, I fired up my 14,400 baud modem and dialed long distance to Cheyenne, Wyoming so that I could get online with CompuServe and America Online. My monthly long distance bill started to look like a loan payment, but the access to information was addictive and it was refreshing to be able to interact with other people with similar interests even though I was sitting in my little two bedroom farmhouse in the middle of nowhere. At some point, I picked up a copy of Boardwatch magazine, which carried a list of BBS’s (Bulletin Board Systems) and found out that there was a local BBS in Scottsbluff, run by a guy named Jerry Allen. I called him up and met him at his house in Scottsbluff, a little place crammed full of computers with a few phone lines in the back for his BBS. The BBS scene was interesting, but it lacked the worldwide level of interaction that the Internet had.  The next few months were a blur. The video production business started to take off and I was able to establish a little bit of regular work doing commercials and promotional videos. My brokerage job started at 6am and was over at 3pm, so I had plenty of time to work on the video business after work. My boss at the commodities brokerage let us put together a short market report for the nightly news on KSTF, so I was able to visit the TV studio after work every day to deliver the report and hang out with my friends that still worked at the station. By May, I had Eric working with me part time on the video production work. He had a natural talent for it and having him help on the production side let me find more business, write scripts and work on building the business.  One of our customers at the commodities brokerage was a computer teacher at the community college named John Harris. He also raised cashmere goats and it sounded like they were gaining in popularity. That seemed like it might make a good informational video/package, so I worked out a deal with him to be the subject of our first informational how-to video — Raising Cashmere Goats for Fun and Profit. Admittedly, the subject did not have a lot of sex-appeal. But it was a specialized subject and it was pretty easy to market to people interested in the subject through classified ads in goat magazines and online on rural living newsgroups. Production on the video went well and I wrote up a fairly detailed book to go along with the video with the information John had given me. We priced the package at $50 and placed our classified ads in Goat magazines and online. The first order came in the next day — from an engineer at Digital Equipment Corporation in New Hampshire, who was looking to raise some goats on his farm. Over the next two years, we sold over 100 copies of Raising Cashmere Goats for Fun and Profit, and it generated more money than any other single project that Inventive Media worked on.  By the summer of 1994, I was ready to move on from the commodities business. I told my father that I was ready to quit and work on the video production business full time. He felt that I was caught up in the excitement of it and that it would not be a good career move, so he asked me to stay on through the end of the year. I committed to stay until December, and spent the rest of the year setting up plans to go full time with Inventive Media.  During my online searches through the video production forums I came across a man named Chuck Hemstreet, who lived in Fort Collins, Colorado and produced specialty videos. After a trip to Denver, I stopped in Fort Collins to visit and he told me about a new venture he was starting. He was planning to purchase time on the newly available cable access channels and air promotional videos about local businesses as part of a business showcase program. He said that he might have some work for Inventive Media if we were to relocate to Fort Collins.  Fort Collins was a popular destination for young adults from Western Nebraska that wanted to get away from home. It was home to Colorado State University, close to Denver and growing rapidly. Eric and I had talked about moving to Fort Collins, and it certainly seemed like a lot more fun place to be than Scottsbluff. From the outside, it seemed like there was a world of opportunity waiting there, and we had a chance to get in on the ground floor of a new and exciting opportunity in video production.  Late that fall, I met a man named Jim Hanna who was preparing to start up an Internet service in Scottsbluff. He had hired a consultant named Howie Grapek, who lived in Fort Collins and was helping Jim setup his ISP. I had lunch with the two of them and it was very interesting. Howie was a high energy, very positive guy, and he had all kinds of stories about the cool things he was doing in his regular job at Hewlett-Packard and on the side with his hosting business called Knightweb. He invited me to come down and visit his office in Fort Collins the next time I was in town and told me about a community Internet group called FortNet that he was involved in.  That pretty much sealed the deal. It was Fort Collins or bust! On December 1, 1994, I gave my two weeks notice at the commodities office. I had a great feeling of relief and excitement about the future. Eric and I lined up an apartment on the south side of Fort Collins and an office space for the video business. As soon as the Christmas holiday was over, we packed up and moved to Colorado.  The first few months went fairly well. Chuck had lined up our timeslot for the show — 7pm on Thursday nights. At first we thought that was a great spot, but it was quickly overrun by Friends and Seinfeld, leaving few people to watch our locally produced business showcase. It was a thrill to see something that we had produced on television, but it came with the realization that few people were watching.  Based on Howie’s recommendation, I went to my first FortNet meeting on the Colorado State University campus. In Scottsbluff, I was one of the very few people who even knew what the Internet was, much less spent any time on it. At that first meeting, I was surrounded by computer science graduate students, power-user geeks from Hewlett-Packard and people that made their living by being extremely smart and capable with computers. I was the dumbest guy in the room, by far. After sitting through the presentations and discussions about Unix based systems, modem configurations and systems administration — all of which was completely over my head — there was a time at the end of the meeting for open questions. The group was intimidating — it felt like the second semester of CompSci all over again. But I had a question that needed to be answered. I had read about the Mosaic web browser program, and wanted to get it running on my computer but I couldn’t figure out how to download it. Timidly, I raised my hand. The moderator pointed me out and I stood to ask my question,  “What is the command to download Mosaic from a terminal prompt?”  Here we go again, I thought, as I prepared to deal with another room of people looking at me like I was the village idiot. There were a few stifled chuckles and a guy a couple chairs away from me audibly sighed and said  “Sz.”  That was all I needed.  I offered my thanks to the group, went home and downloaded Mosaic. There was still more work to do — I had to sort out the weird complexities of how to get a TCP/IP stack running on my Windows 3.1 computer and learn the basics of troubleshooting a dialup-PPP connection. AOL and Prodigy hid all of those things behind their user software, but there was no way around it this time — I had to get it figured out. Eventually, I got Mosaic running on my PC.  Opening up that web browser for the first time was an epiphony. I was used to text-based browsing, which was fast but clunky and always felt very dry. Mosaic added color, different font sizes, clickable links and pictures. Someone from FortNet recommended Yahoo as a great place to search for information. Yahoo searches lead to an astounding amount of good content, and links to FAQs about how to setup networks, troubleshoot problems and even design your own web pages. I started teaching myself how to learn online, absorbing as much information as possible. I kept showing up for the meetings, and got invited to the after-meeting events where all of the sysadmins would hang out. My studies of the Unix FAQs had given me enough knowledge to hold my own with the group and eventually I was accepted into the group of sysadmin volunteers that helped to run and maintain the network. It turned out that a lot of the initial intimidation I had felt was not a true reflection of the FortNet volunteers. They were funny, warm, very smart and often socially awkward, and we enjoyed a great camaraderie.  While it was great to get an opportunity to learn about the nuts-and-bolts of the Internet at FortNet, the business climate in Fort Collins was not as good as we were expecting. Before we left Scottsbluff, we started production on a promotional video for the Scottsbluff Chamber of Commerce, an 8 minute video that generated $5000 in revenue for Inventive Media. In Fort Collins, we were only making about $600 for a comparable type of video — a criminally low amount considering the hours of work that went into producing them. We were scraping by on $300 and $500 projects, the business finances started to deteriorate as bills piled up and more money had to be put into the business. Fort Collins was an expensive place to live, and in our line of work it seemed like there was always someone better or willing to work for less. We were dependent on Chuck for work, but he was struggling too, and had his own bills to pay. Half of our work was still coming from Scottsbluff, and we were making frequent trips back home to pick up these projects. I had even started doing some web page design and computer consulting, but it wasn’t enough to keep Inventive Media alive.  Eric and I had been friends since grade school, but the failure of Inventive Media and associated financial strains had taken a toll on our friendship. By fall, he had moved back to Scottsbluff and I was living by myself in Fort Collins. In December, I started looking for a job and wound up as an office manager for a startup company called GeoSpatial Consultants. GSC was established to win contracts at the nearby Rocky Mountain Arsenal to do environmental analysis and cleanup work. I jumped right into the job and did the entire setup of the office space, buying furniture, setting up the network and doing all of the odd jobs that needed to be done. About four months in, GSC received the contracts, but within a month political strings were pulled by the previous contractor and our contracts were revoked. By the end of June, GSC had closed up shop and I was out of a job.  When GSC closed, I went back to Scottsbluff to figure out what I was going to do. I also had a suspended license, due to a speeding ticket that was not paid on time, but I didn’t know about it because the mail was sent to an old address. To add insult to injury, I was arrested for driving without a license and was now stranded at my parent’s house.  To say I had reached a low point would be an understatement. I had gone out on my own, moved to the big city and failed epically. It was too expensive to live in Fort Collins without a job, so I had no choice but to move back to Scottsbluff. My friend Danny gave me a ride to Fort Collins so I could get my license reinstated and start loading up my belongings. Fifteen miles along in the return trip, the engine in his VW Van started sputtering, and left us stranded in Wellington. I had to call my mom to have her pick us up. The comedy of pain had no shortage of punch lines.  My venture in Colorado had left me broke, jobless, carrying an inordinate amount of debt and feeling like a big disappointment to my family. I felt a lot like the late Chris Farley’s Saturday Night Live character Matt Foley, who ended up living in a van down by the river. Except I was living in a trailer house out by the pasture. I sat down with my dad after dinner one night, and opened up about the depression and frustration that I was feeling. The gist of his advice was to “get back on the bike and start pedaling.” I told him I didn’t know where the bike was and I had no idea where to go once I found it. His response was that I should be at work at the feedlot the next morning at 7am, because there was work to be done and there was no reason to be sitting around feeling sorry for myself.  The next day, I showed up for work at 7. It was a weird feeling at first. The other workers at the feedlot knew that I did not want to be there, and weren’t sure how I was going to handle it. There was nothing that I wanted to do more than get away from the feedlot when I went off to college, and here I was loading feed trucks, helping to work cattle, cleaning pens and doing the grunt work at the feedlot.  It was exactly what I needed.  I started to get into a groove, and developed a rhythm with the work. Even though it was not mentally challenging, it felt really good to be outside and work as part of a team. Before college I had been dismissive of the work and borderline incompetent. Now I took the job seriously, performed my job to the best of my abilities and developed a rapport with my coworkers. Over the next few months, my frustration and depression started to fade, and it felt like I was earning back my self-esteem day by day. I started to not worry so much about living in a trailer house, being broke and driving a $25 car. I knew that I was capable of more, but I needed a mental reset, and working that feedlot job gave me a new perspective and appreciation for hard work.  During the time working at the feedlot, I was doing a few video production and computer consulting jobs on the side to make payments on the equipment loan. Eric and Danny had rented an office in Scottsbluff to have as a hangout place, and it had a big room in the back so we setup the video equipment there. When they did not want to pay the rent any longer, I took over paying the rent so that I would have a place to work away from the cramped, non-air conditioned trailer house. A lot of hours were spent at the office in town just to enjoy the air conditioning when it was hot outside. The video work was tedious, mostly wedding videos and the occasional specialty project. One of the worst video projects was for a horse association in Sterling, Colorado. We had grown up spending a lot of time at horse shows when we were little, and spending hours around a dusty, boring arena that smells like horse manure was one of my least favorite childhood memories. For this project, I had to video tape two days of a horse show. The first day, I had to videotape for 20 hours straight with only two short breaks. I only managed to get in three hours of sleep the night before, and instead of putting me up in a hotel room, the group shuffled me off to sleep on a couch at the National Guard armory. The second day, I videotaped for another couple of hours, and then picked up my check. To this day, I think that was the hardest $500 I have ever earned. I hated to do it, but that is what had to be done to pay the bills and keep up with loan payments.  By the spring of 1997, my head was in a much better place. I had reconnected with my old friends and made many new ones. The video business was boring, but consistent enough to generate some income. I had steady computer consulting jobs, helping people with their Internet connections or fixing computers. There was a lot going on with the local Chamber of Commerce, and I started to participate in their business networking activities and getting involved in community functions.  One of the community functions sponsored by the Chamber was an event where they brought in a “futurist” to help community members visualize the trends that were shaping the world and how our communities could change to benefit from them. I was hired to videotape the sessions for the Chamber, and invited my dad to come along to one of the sessions. Three of his friends, Roger Frank, Vinc Aulick and Max Miller attended the session. We had a good conversation after the session about things that the community needed to have to prosper, especially when it came to technology. One of the most talked about subjects during the sessions was Internet access; how it was an important equalizer for rural areas and a necessity for keeping up in a global community.  I had known about the Internet for a few years at this point, and had spent quite a bit of time helping to run FortNet during my time in Fort Collins. I was also doing a lot of Internet related tech support for customers of the local ISP, Prairieweb. Prairieweb had a policy of only accepting payment through direct deposit, so I had a group of 20 or so customers, mostly businesses, who would pay me for the service, and then I would write a check to Prairieweb on the first of the month. I was doing this mostly as a favor to people who did not like dealing with Prairieweb, and it made me think that there might be enough room in the market for another ISP.  It was time to move on from the feedlot, and I knew what I was going to do.  I was going to start an Internet Service Provider business.",False

It has met the computing and storage needs for businesses as well as saved untold amounts in IT infrastructure.  Horizon Communications has a strong market for small, medium and large enterprise customers in our market and it’s important that even as an ISP we do our best to educate and help our business clients with security.  While the cloud really is “just someone else’s computer”, companies are able to offload much of their storage and processing needs to more efficient and purpose built systems which are handling data for many other clients or tasks.   There are 2 types of cloud computing solutions; private and public clouds. In a private cloud, data is stored on the company’s intranet and is a great option for businesses with their own data center. On the other hand, in a public cloud, data is stored in the provider’s data center. The main difference between them is that in the former, the company is responsible for the maintenance and management of the data center, while in the latter, it is the provider’s responsibility.  Though highly advantageous, cloud computing comes with its fair share of challenges just like any other technology. IT experts have raised concerns about information security due to file sharing apps and storage of sensitive company data with third parties as is the case when you use a public cloud.  Cloud computing security concerns and how to address them  · Lack of due diligence  Most of the problems related with cloud computing are technical. However, if the company does not do a comprehensive research on their policies regarding the cloud, resources, and a clear plan, a security gap is bound to come up. Oftentimes, lack of proper due diligence leads to the company migrating quickly without proper evaluation on whether the cloud provider will meet their expectations.  · Data Breach  Data breaches are bound to occur even without cloud computing, but companies using this technology are more susceptible than those which do not. Data stored on the cloud should be encrypted and also protected with audited Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificates. Most cloud providers offer VPN tunnels that provide encrypted connections to off-site employees. Thus, smooth communication and information safety are well protected.  · Malicious use of cloud services  The cloud is not immune to DoS or DDoS attacks, phishing, and other cybercrimes. The company’s IT team should scrutinize traffic and analyze data flow to minimize such attacks. Cloud providers should be immediately informed of such attacks quickly so that they can arrange for immediate mitigation.  · Insider threats  Though this might seem unlikely, it’s sadly more common then most companies realize. An authorized employee could take advantage of their privilege to misuse information as financial forms and customer accounts. Instances of accidental leakage of information are also common for companies using cloud computing. Most cloud service providers algorithms to detect threats by analyzing data access patterns along with historical content ownership. Intensive training of employees, especially those that are authorized to access sensitive company data will help avoid accidental leaks.  · Data loss  Data storage on the cloud is a shared responsibility between the client and the provider. While most of the providers have standardized security procedures on their end, it is the client’s responsibility to ensure that they have back-ups in the event of data loss.  In spite of the above concerns, cloud computing continues to gain popularity as its advantages outweigh the challenges. Understanding the risks involved in its implementation will help you establish the right mitigation procedures.

ICO launches are a new phenomenon in modern times. Just like with new startups, new products and ideas launching on sites like Kickstarter, new ICO’s are launching weekly. Some claim unbeatable returns using revolutionary technology, but is every project worth your attention?  There are ton’s of experts, website and reviewers looking into these projects, but at its core, there is just a few main things that should be high on your radar when looking to invest.  Here’s are a few key items on what should be in a strong ICO.  The Whitepaper  An ICO whitepaper is a documentation of what the ICO’s architecture, mission and the processes towards achieving it, the technology overview and other aspects of the business. In as much as the whitepaper should impress the reader and show a pathway to success, it at its core needs to be realistic, honest and lay out the pro’s and con’s of the business plan.  What is the problem being solved and how realistic is the solution?  Just like any other business, the ICO Company must have identified a need or an opportunity in the market. Not every token sale solves real world problems with obtainable markets like the one offered by companies such as Horizon Communications. For instance, Horizon Communications have identified the need to have fast and reliable internet and cell phone service throughout the world, which is currently not the case. Be wary, you do not need to be an expert in the field, but you should know enough to detect something maybe amiss.  The project should provide a detailed plan on how they plan to meet this need. An outline on how they intend to deal with issues that might arise once they roll out their solution should be included on the whitepaper. Horizon Communications have identified the problem that is lack of high-speed internet and where it is available, it is costly. Along these lines, they intend to set-up infrastructure and provide Next Generation data services.  The team matters… Alot  No matter how great an idea a company has, the team is vital, perhaps the most important part of the company itself. Has this idea generated enough interest to bring on quality people? If the team is light on manpower, that speaks to the actual chance of success of the project and faith in experts to get it done. Do they have experience in this particular industry? Many people have great ideas and while we should not discredit newcomers to a field, it helps to bring experience to quickly navigate past pitfalls. Have they proven their ability to execute? As a student of startups as I build Horizon, one common theme among those both as Founders and Investors is they need an ability to power through the up’s (and most importantly the downs).  The ICO’s location  Nearly 1/3rd of ICOs fail to include their location on the white paper. Knowing where the ICO is located is pertinent to the investor as they will know what rules govern that particular region. Besides, investors are on the lookout for rules that will protect them in case of ICO delays or even fraudulent activities. A legitimate ICO whitepaper, like Horizon Communications’, should detail the company’s exact location and have a list of their top management. Horizon is set to be headquartered in Bermuda, launch its initial markets there and in BVI and has a road map to expand to multiple countries in a few years.  Token description  A whitepaper should also outline how an investor can sell, buy or transfer tokens. Tokens as well as how they can be used should also be described. A whitepaper should also indicate whether the ICOs founders will have reserve coins and outline the ways through which they can liquidate them. Transparency is important. Knowing how many tokens are being reserved and for how long will show if the company has long term faith in the success of its offering and services.  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon.

This is due to the lack of enough finances, labor, and resources for the implementation of IoT systems. In fact, while some are aware but disinterested in IoT implementation, a significant percentage is not even aware of its existence. Unbeknown to them, not implementing such systems only limits their chances of success. SMEs can embrace IoT by observing the following:  Adjust their business processes to enhance productivity  Through the incorporation of new technology, businesses can streamline complicated processes. Business automation systems can be implemented and used to simplify core operational tasks, hence improve business efficiency. The automation of tasks will ultimately lead to fewer employees as machines carry out some tasks.  Through high-speed internet such as is provided by Horizon Communications, workers could be connected through the cloud where just-in-time training could take place. Through the implementation of IoT, huge tasks will take a shorter time to accomplish.  Alter their perspective and take note of long-term goals Everybody fears change, including SME owners. Oftentimes, it is this fear that makes them not implement IoT strategies and, consequently, hinders them from achieving their long-term goals. SMEs should view the implementation of IoT as a means towards achieving their goals and objectives.  Horizon Communications is dedicated to providing SMEs with high-speed internet through which businesses can identify new opportunities by carrying out timely data analysis. Resources will not have to be wasted on conventional marketing techniques as there are vast numbers of marketing avenues through the internet.  Continuous learning  Continuous acquisition of skills should be the goal of every SME owner. This way, SMEs can learn on ways they can add value to the products and services they provide so as to maintain and attract customers. Through internet services such as those provided by Horizon Communications, the SME can collect real-time data on the current customer trends. This way, they can tweak their products or services to suit these trends. They are also in a position to communicate regularly to their clients on the additional product or service features.  Implementing IoT systems will only lead to increased returns on this investment. While it might not be possible to do that overnight, SMEs can take one step at a time so as to realize their full potential.

Horizon is the first telecom ICO and will be deploying their high speed internet services in 2 countries in the Caribbean by Q4 of 2018. The company would be expanding to Central America and then internationally according to their whitepaper.  The company is incorporating blockchain technology in their services and the Horizon token whose pre-ICO commences in March is seen by many in the blockchain community as token whose utility makes it valuable since it is backed by a service oriented company that’ll provide for needs of a region.   For Horizon there are a number of benefits to partnering with a company with this technology. As an ISP their mission is to provide world class telecommunication services to customers and in doing so leverage the power of the blockchain. The solutions they create is what has attracted partners such Gladius.  The companies envision a number of mutual benefits. Horizon can as an ISP use their excess bandwidth as part of the global decentralized CDN and DDOS Network to help their customers and other companies around the world get protection from outages or attacks. This would provide a revenue stream for the company and ensure utility of all available bandwidth that might otherwise be wasted despite being paid for.  For customers, Horizon is building the Gladius software directly into customer portal alongside other partners. This shall allow Horizon Customer use and install the software correctly on their home computers creating another layer of decentralization.  The Founder of Horizon Telecommunications, Gilbert Darrell said that the company is confident that their ICO will meet its hard cap due to the interest shown by corporate and individual investors in the sale. Before the launch of their public presale, the company has received strong support and interest from private investors companies. The presale is an opportunity for those investors who could not buy the tokens during the private sale. The presale commences on March 19.  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon. He has 18 years experience in information technology and telecom solutions, a veteran in Fire and EMS Services, a crypto enthusiast and a member of the Bermuda Government’s Cryptocurrency Task Force.  Horizon Communications is an upcoming fixed wireless internet service provider looking to provide services in Bermuda, the Caribbean and Central America before expanding internationally. While utilizing 4th generation and soon 5th generation wireless technology, it will also heavily incorporate blockchain and cryptocurrency technology, one of the 1st ISP’s in the world to do so, while launching an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as apart of their capital raise and blockchain integration.

Countries and governments continue to develop smart cities to effectively serve the drones of people who migrate to the urban centers, but typically live on the outskirts and commute. Smart cities use software and hardware solutions to solve crises and meet the demands, which needs data networks to provide communication between these solutions, a new business model for Horizon in the suburban environment that we find easily supports our business model. The computerization of transport systems and other infrastructure results in higher standards of living, more comfort, and higher efficiency to the smart city dwellers, but what effects do smart cities have on the economy?   Improved mobility  An updated infrastructural system is one of the key features of a smart city. Installation of smart transport systems would imply safer roads and reduced congestion, which would lead to the cities saving about $800 billion according to a study by Dataflog. Data shows that city dwellers spend 15% of their driving time in traffic congestion and 20% in search of parking space. In the smart city, real-time data offers the city dwellers the fastest route to their destinations and helps them avoid congested roads. Mobile parking apps significantly reduce the time one would have spent looking for an empty parking slot. Consequently, employees will spend less time on the roads and more time on their jobs.  Improved technological innovations  For a smart city to continue being efficient, technologies have to be perpetually updated and improved. There is a constant demand for technologies to be developed across the wide array of industries. As more urban centers aspire and implement strategies to become smart cities, ICT firms respond to the increasing demand by developing technologies. Consequently, new tech companies are on the rise with thousands of job opportunities being created.  Optimal use of office spaces  ICT devices installed in office spaces collect data from office spaces to ensure maximum efficiency. For instance, occupancy is monitored and communicated in real-time. This makes it easy for businesses looking for renting space to find one.  A smart office building reduces the time it takes for the businesses to set up their ICT equipment and start working. Besides, the working spaces are more comfortable as smart devices are used to control temperatures and the lighting, thus maximizing on employee productivity. The overheads of a smart building are further reduced through the installation of automated heating and lighting systems.  The business’ security can also be enhanced through the linking of the CCTV cameras to a mobile device. This allows the business owner monitor who comes in and out of the building. The installation of cybersecurity systems reduces the risk of internet breach.  Smart cities have a hugely impacted on businesses, a factor that has had a ripple effect on the economy. Increased profits and higher efficiencies are only some of the benefits. Internet connectivity is essential for the collection and feeding of real time data. Through the provision of a wireless LTE internet service, Horizon Communications intends to become a leading player in telecommunications worldwide.  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon.

Horizon Communications, a telecommunications company that has launched an ICO to bring high speed internet and cell service worldwide, finds the integration of blockchain into the company provides numerous benefits to its ability to compete internationally. More and more startups in finance, healthcare, and other industries are embracing blockchain technology. However, it is important to fully understand the technology and know the benefits and areas for improvements that are underway.  The other challenges that this technology must address are:  Costs Though the fees accrued from transferring value are significantly reduced and the process streamlined, blockchain technology is still new. The software necessary to run this technology has to be customized for the specific firm. The people resources that are conversant with this technology have to be employed, which adds to the expenses. Hence, adopting this while eliminating existing systems will likely be an expense that governments and corporations might not be willing to undertake. Increased adoption and more developers entering the space, as well as the open source software being released, helps combat development costs.  Security The key benefit of Blockchain is an immutable record of transactions that is verified by a distributed, unaffiliated system of computers. The technology however susceptible, if unlikely, to attacks in situations where only a small group of miners control more than half of the blockchain’s mining power. It’s important that decentralization and transparency is a key feature of the blockchain used, which is a hallmark of the top projects in the blockchain space.  Privacy Most blockchain technologies in use are publicly visible. While this is an important feature, it would have to be addressed when it comes to citizens, governments and corporations who need to restrict and protect access to sensitive data. A permissible blockchain, where people access data related exclusively to their tasks would take time to make and customize. More projects are incorporating full encryption and zero-knowledge features to underpin the trustless transactions that blockchain allows, ensuring privacy and security of the transaction, which go hand and hand.  Regulation There is currently no legal framework to regulate how blockchain technologies process their financial transactions. While freedom from over regulation is a hallmark of cryptocurrency and blockchain, we still live in a world governed by laws and rightly so. The key is always balancing regulation with innovation and advances in technology. Regulators need to come up with a way of handling these changes and enforce laws that will be used globally to ensure more stability. As this slowly rolls out, for example in Bermuda where Horizon is headquartered, larger players will be able to enter the market to bring more capital and talent to the industry.  Scalability Blockchain technologies are still new and therefore, still have trouble supporting a huge number of users. More users result in higher transaction fees and slowed transaction speeds. These scalability issues have to be addressed before this technology is fully adopted. Implementation of the lightning network and segwit for Bitcoin and sharding for Ethereum are steps to help dramatically improve the technologies ability to scale.  There is no doubt that blockchain technology will have a place in both the private and public sector in the future. However, these challenges show that there is still a need to have improvements made on the current technology for it to be fully embraced.  Horizon Communications aims at playing its part in the implementation of next generation technology through the provision of high speed internet in areas with poor to no connectivity, implementing blockchain in the core of our users services and partnering with technology companies who are driving innovation in the space.

There has been watershed moments for companies suffering from hacks, social media companies collecting massive amounts of data on users and even your run of the mill everyday identity theft.  Horizon Communications is dedicated to protecting its users security and privacy, keeping a keen eye on ever advancing technology. At the outset cryptocurrency, utilizing tough encryption, wasn’t designed for full privacy, although the features are quickly coming.  Bitcoin’s network, for instance, has been in the public domain, with every wallet address and transaction visible to every person in the network. While such data may not contain much, transactions can be traced to specific IP addresses and expose the identities of the wallet owners. Other cryptocurrencies have identified this loophole and succeeded in creating privacy-centric cryptos.  Companies like Civic are building decentralized secure services that allows digital identities to be controlled by the individual, with secured release only of specific information to companies and vendors. This also allows KYC to be passed, at the users express permission, among companies. Some such as the Dash coin, formerly Darkcoin offers more flexibility of either carrying out transactions either publicly or anonymously. Other cryptos are public or private by default. This feature, along with the speed with which transactions are carried out has caused this coin to gain popularity. Adoption of privacy coins is on the rise. Monero, which is among the most popular privacy-centric crypto has listed more than 100 merchants and other users who are accepting this anonymous coin as a mode of payment. Privacy-centric cryptos are meant to be used to pay for even very low transactions, which results in more users and therefore, more value. Transactions and user identities are impossible to trace. For instance, Monero makes use of ring signatures. Whereas a single signature is used for each transaction in other cryptos, several users sign when you transact in a Monero network, forming a ring. This obscures the source of the original transaction making it totally untraceable. Transactions have become cheaper and much faster. Digital currencies have for a long time struggled with scalability issues. These have resulted in the increase in transaction fees and slower transaction speeds. Privacy-centric coins including Zcash, Dash, Monero, and PIVX are working on transactions to become much cheaper and faster compared to others such as Bitcoin, a vital necessity. More and more users are shifting from infamous cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to privacy-centric coins due to the need for security, which also has the added benefit of privacy. Though it’s entirely possible that these advances will be implemented into the current top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum, allowing new projects to fully test and vet new features taking the risk out of the top projects for making a mis-step.  This technology allows for security on networks to take another step forward. Data security, especially for a telecommunications company, is extremely important. These are solutions Horizon Communications is very much excited to implement.  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon.

Investors can buy the tokens with cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum or bitcoin.  Mr Darrell said the ICO was going well and attracting “a number of purchases every day”. He said the company intends to begin installations before the end of the year.  “I’m quite elated really at the level of support we are getting both in Bermuda and internationally,” Mr Darrell said. “We hit a few technical snags that delayed us a bit, but as anyone who’s ever been in business will tell you, no matter how hard you work to hit deadlines sometimes things are out of your control.  “We aim to sell the ‘presale’ within a few months, which puts us on track with many other successful ICOs. Everything is going great, so now we will start to ramp up our marketing of the ICO to the various outlets and the crypto community in general.”  The presale, which will involve 10 per cent of the total 100 million tokens the company intends to distribute, is offering investors a 60 per cent bonus on token purchases.  Local investors are participating already — a small number, Mr Darrell said, but their contributions have been “surprising and quite significant”.  “I certainly wasn’t expecting that level of buy-in — however I am a very strong proponent of local companies being supported by fellow Bermudians,” Mr Darrell, a member of the Bermuda Government’s Cryptocurrency Task Force, said.  “When my grandfather, Gilbert O. Darrell, started Bermuda Container Line, he, alongside Fernance Perry and William Brewer, gathered the support they needed from the community to get off the ground, or more to the point, on the water.  “I feel we’ve lost a bit of that ‘community spirit’ over the past many years, I’m glad its starting to come back.”  Buying HRZN tokens will be the only way people can use services on Horizon’s network, but for those who are not “crypto-savvy”, the company will aim to make this straightforward, with payments in regular dollars made for services being exchanged for the token.  “It doesn’t mean anything for the customer, but for people with the HRZN token they will see even greater value as it will be underpinned by the growth and strength of our customer base and network,” Mr Darrell said.  The Regulatory Authority of Bermuda, which oversees the telecommunications sector confirmed last Friday that Horizon does not have the Integrated Communications Operating Licence or a spectrum licence from RAB that it would need to offer the internet service. It added there was also a moratorium on awarding new ICOLs.  Mr Darrell is confident that this will not be a barrier to Horizon’s plans.  “We have at present a signed agreement with a licence holder and we’ve been approached by other companies, who are single-service companies, only providing one service, who realise the disruption that having such an advanced company as Horizon means to the marketplace.  “We’ve also been approached by other companies in the Caribbean who realise that if we enter the market they have a limited runway.  “While we are under confidential talks, Horizon has been approached by other countries in the Caribbean to also start up our services there as well, so I think we’ll be looking to expand as quickly as possible to other markets.”  Mr Darrell said that four years ago, licences had been granted to all incumbents in the island’s telecoms sector.  “I imagine that the purpose for licences was to impart a level of regulation on the telecommunications industry,” he added. “However placing a moratorium on licences, coupled with the mass buyouts and consolidations, along with little to no penalties when we have substandard internet, leaves telecommunications in Bermuda lacking.  “The RAB recently released a statement that shows, in my opinion, they clearly understand the telecommunication landscape in Bermuda is far from ideal. I look forward to working with the RAB to help improve that situation.”  Horizon intends to use fixed wireless technology that is already in use in other parts of the world, utilising established telecommunications towers on the island, with customers receiving the signal through a receiver unit at their home. The firm believes it can launch with speeds of 300 Mbps.  We are aiming for the third or fourth quarter to begin to install customers,” Mr Darrell said. “As we progress in the ICO, which is still early stages, we will be getting resources in place as quickly as possible.  “A great advantage of our business and technology is we are able to roll out services quite quickly compared to stringing hundreds of miles of cable everywhere.”  • For more information, visit Horizon’s website at https://horizoncomm.co",False

Having a reliable network in emergency situations like this becomes very important for many people when they need to communicate with the government, rescue teams, and other entities regarding rescue efforts, including the need for supplies and medical attention.  When it comes to telecommunications, people have depended mostly on wired networks. Cable and fiber networks are prone to damages when these natural disasters strike, already straining systems that are overloaded and adding to corrosion issues copper networks face.  Even a small storm or flood can render wired network useless. People lose the use of communications equipment in emergency situations that they would otherwise have relied upon for making contact with rescue teams. It is also important to note that natural disasters very often strike without any prior warning and this is why choosing a functional and resilient telecommunications network during an emergency situation is critical.  In 2005, Hurricane Katrina swept through the southern central coast of the US causing $125 billion in damages. For many weeks, countless people were left stranded and without hope as their line of communications were cut off due to the catastrophic damages caused by this devastating hurricane. Why did they lose their ability to communicate so quickly? Because Telecommunications / Internet relied solely on cable or copper wire networks which were largely destroyed during the onset of Katrina.  That disaster marked one of the greatest turning points in telecommunications in the US, when many companies shifted their focus to 4G LTE. The reasons behind this shift were that wireless networks, are resilient in emergency situations. People can still keep in touch with law enforcement, rescue and other government bodies to ensure their safety. Emergency Response Teams are able to locate impacted communities to help them relatively quickly.  Horizon Communications, a company specializing LTE wireless communications, is working to deliver high-speed and reliable wireless internet service to Bermuda, the Caribbean, and Central America. These regions are prone to natural disasters and they usually suffer high levels of damage from sometimes unexpected and devastating natural phenomena. In areas affected by previous disasters, a subsequent installation of a wireless LTE network has proven to be very effective in re-establishing telecommunication services quickly for emergency services in particular.  Horizon Communications is ready to build a wireless network and provide extremely functional high-speed LTE services as a solution for keeping the population safe when disaster strikes. The company sees its mission as providing reliable telecommunications services where and when they are needed most.  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon. He has 18 years experience in information technology and telecom solutions, a veteran in Fire and EMS Services, a crypto enthusiast and a member of the Bermuda Government’s Cryptocurrency Task Force.  Horizon Communications is an upcoming fixed wireless internet service provider looking to provide services in Bermuda, the Caribbean and Central America before expanding internationally. While utilizing 4th generation and soon 5th generation wireless technology, it will also heavily incorporate blockchain and cryptocurrency technology, one of the 1st ISP’s in the world to do so, while launching an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as a part of their capital raise and blockchain integration.

Horizon is building an advanced wireless telecommunications infrastructure network, launching 1st in the Caribbean then looking to expand worldwide.  The company’s token, HRZN, is created on the ERC20 standard and will be used to gain access to services provided by the company, such as internet, cellular services, VOIP, IPTV and access to services through their blockchain partners such as Gladius and Bubbletone, with future partners already in the works.  The company has plans to list the token with exchanges, for example Binance who is opening offices in their headquarters of Bermuda. The HRZN token will be driven by the value it provides as more and more customers join the Horizon Communications network, based around their core service high speed internet services.  Simplicity for the non-cryptocurrency savvy customer is important for Horizon. On their customer portals, the company plans to make payment options as easy as possible, where on the backend any fiat or other crypto payments would be used to purchase the HRZN Token from various exchanges. With constant buy pressure put on the HRZN Token, through a seamless process for the customer, Horizon anticipates this would given an added value to the Token.  Potentially see several millions of USD worth of orders occurring yearly, as the company plans to expand into 6 countries in the 1st 5 years of operation. Horizon estimates that in the smaller markets in the Caribbean, 15% penetration is very possible. It’s numbers are more conservative in the bigger countries, with 1% being the goal in a few years. With those estimates in mind, it is possible that Horizon does over $100m USD in business within the 1st 5 years of operation.  Since the number of total tokens is limited to just 100m, everytime a customer purchases a Horizon service (monthly internet, cell phone usages etc) that transaction from their payment will be exchanged for the HRZN Token. Because Horizon wants to further cryptocurrency adoption, if the HRZN Token or other cryptocurrency is used, a 5% discount on the USD price of service will be applied.  With Horizon retaining 17% of the HRZN Tokens for the team and future use, the company is strongly motivated to not only provide a top rate telecommunication service, but also is aligned with the interests of the Token buyers to ensure they bring value to the company and the token.  Horizon’s Founder Gilbert A. Darrell stated “Horizon’s goal is clear and simple, provide the best telecommunication service possible, using advanced wireless technology and blockchain integration. We feel strongly that by providing a great core service, utilizing these technologies, we can provide a great customer experience while bringing value to the company and a strong use case for the token.”  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon.

For entrepreneurs, taking a leap of faith that you have a great idea is the only thing we have going for us. It’s a long, tough road to start a company and only, as they say, the strong survive.  So when someone posts “FUD” about your company, you seek to set the record straight. It’s great they care enough about Horizon to write an article, they just didnt have all the facts. Here below is my response.  Image result for FUD Hi, thank you for writing a rather in-depth piece on Horizon. You’re correct, Horizon is building a high speed wireless telecommunication service leveraging the strength and power of blockchain directly for our customers benefit.  I wanted to speak to a few of your comments in the article.  Telecommunications License (ICOL): I find your knowledge of the local market… interesting. Are you a competitor? haha.  Horizon has a signed agreement to use another license to operate in Bermuda, we have also been constantly approached to potentially purchase other companies in the market who are struggling with single vector only services (radio, tv, phones etc). We have also been approached to expand our business to a number of nations in the Caribbean, where telecommunications is at least as bad as in Bermuda.  In Bermuda the Regulatory Authority has had a moratorium on new telecom licenses almost since coming up with the concept in 2014. When 1st created, licenses were handed out (for free) to anyone who wanted to operate in the sector, from internet, cell phones, tv, radio etc. However, soon after, a rash of mergers happened, coupled with no new licenses being handed out, resulted in a very noncompetitive landscape.  I would suggest the desire for competition has not been served by the license situation. However the new CEO of the Regulatory Authority seems to understand that and has recently stated the license situation and may be willing to grant Horizon our own license independently.  http://www.royalgazette.com/business/article/20180424/ra-mulls-compensation-for-internet-outages  Either way, our team has built telecommunication companies throughout the Western Hemisphere and we have a clear roadmap for operations in Bermuda and throughout the Caribbean.  Token Exchanges: You seem fairly knowledgeable about ICO’s, as such you would recognize that must exchanges require large sums of money to become listed and exchanges also want to make sure the ICO was a successful before entertaining listing of that token. Seeing how Horizon has only just entered its pre-sale we expect those conversations to begin in a few weeks. Also, Binance has just decided to move to Bermuda, which I suspect would give us a bit of a headstart with their exchange.  https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-signs-agreement-with-bermuda-govt-on-15-mln-investment-jobs  Inital Pre-sale Date: As with any startup, sometimes you miss your goals no matter how hard you try. We had some technical issues to work through on our payment portal and wanted to ensure quality over speed to market. It’s important that our website worked well, just as its important that our internet service is of a very high standard, hence we again we look for quality as our defining feature.  Once again thank you for taking the time to review Horizon, please feel free to contact me with questions before you write your next article on our company.  Cheers!  Gilbert A. Darrell",False

Gadget enthusiasts were gifted with the appearance of more devices with various high-end features like virtual/augmented reality, facial recognition, voice commands, etc. Car lovers were given better self-driving vehicles and smart homes are now a “thing”. This year, 2018, is set to bring more spectacular breakthroughs in the telecommunications and technology sector. Let’s see what this year has to offer.  AI Domination Artificial Intelligence technology has been under continuous development since the cyber-age started, and 2018 is looking like a good year for it to take a huge leap forward into people’s lives. More and more machine learning capabilities are now being inserted into different platforms, such as social media websites, smartphone applications, and even autonomous vehicles. It wouldn’t take long before it becomes a necessary part of our tech-driven lives. The potential power of AI technology is overwhelming but that doesn’t mean you should compare it to “The Terminator” movies.  Internet of Things (IoT) Last year, we’ve witnessed new and amazing gadgets like the smart speakers Google and Amazon offer. More and more, we have access to the devices and software that make everything we do faster and easier. And that’s what internet of things is: digital centralization at its finest. 2018 is potentially the year when tech companies will start presenting more centralized, automated, and convenient applications and gadgets to help us manage everything in just a few clicks and swipes.   5G Network Connection Many experts and analysts believe that 5G network connections have yet to make their appearance, potentially two years from now. With the constant advancements that technology and telecommunications companies make, the 5G world is not that far away or far-fetched. We can think of 2018 as the year when we’ll be seeing more and more 5G network teasers. Large telecommunications companies are vying to be the first to give their customers faster internet speeds. With a race this competitive, there’s always the possibility of a sooner introduction of 5G.  Better Voice Recognition Technology It is thought that voice automation/recognition technology has not been given all the attention it deserves. Due to more popular trends, it hasn’t been able to take the wheel and drive us to more sophisticated technologies. That’s probably going to change in 2018. Users of technology are seeking more and more opportunities to automate their world. In conjunction with the AI technology and IoT, voice automations/recognition technology can really be the key for better connection and automation. Soon, we’ll be able to communicate better and with more devices.  What does the future hold? Every year, we witness several new advancements in technology. Since the start of the 21st century, we’ve been on a high-speed ride with breakthrough after breakthrough—and 2018 won’t see a slow down by any stretch. We can all expect to witness more exciting, futuristic, and amazing tech advancements in the future.  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon.

Smaller carriers are also lobbying the FCC to revisit the FiberTower licenses and Straight Path’s millimeter wave licenses acquired by AT&T and Verizon respectively. The Competitive Carriers Association (CCA), which represents all carriers smaller than AT&T and Verizon, argued that the acquisition of these licenses has enabled these 2 carriers to have a real market advantage, thus making it more difficult for smaller carriers to compete. As the name suggests, the CCA strives to make the telecommunication industry a fair playing field for large and small carriers alike.  Interestingly, another CCA member continues to conduct trials of 5G technology by utilizing the spectrum in the 28 GHz and 60GHz ranges. Another test was conducted two months ago using Cohere Technologies’ 5G turbo connect fixed wireless access solution at 3.65GHz, which is said to provide better 5G coverage inside buildings and in rural areas. CCA also sees the 3.5GHz, which is also known as the Citizens Broadband Radio Services (CBRS) band, as a great opportunity because of its characteristics and accessibility to affordable equipment.  What does that mean for startups like Horizon? We believe that the major leap forward to 5G will provide all small carriers a fair chance in the telecommunication industry. It is in Horizon’s best interests that the CCA is working to ensure there are opportunities for growth and expansion for small telecommunication companies. Using the CBRS band, Horizon will be able to acquire the equipment necessary for our upgrade to 5G as it hits the market. The future is bright for Horizon, as we project a positive growth and opportunities to expand until we achieve international coverage. As the new age dawns on Horizon, we invite you to be a part of this project through ICO, by purchasing our Horizon Tokens.  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon.

We soft launched the ICO at the end of April / beginning of May to start stress testing the website, payment processor etc and put things through its paces. We aim to sell the “pre-sale” within a few months, which puts us on track with many other successful ICO’s. Everything is going great, so now we will start to ramp up our marketing of the ICO to the various outlets and the crypto community in general.  I’m quite elated really at the level of support we are getting both in Bermuda and internationally. We hit a few technical snags that delayed us a bit, but as anyone who’s ever been in business will tell you, no matter how hard you work to hit deadlines sometimes things are out of your control.  Having 7500+ people in our chat room on Telegram (a popular chat program similar to Whatsapp) shows we have real traction in the blockchain / cryptocurrency communities. I think we’re a bit of fresh air in ICO’s. We’re building an “infrastructure” company, where almost every other ICO is building software solutions. This is quite uniqe, we’re certainly breaking a lot of ground. We have a great team that has done this business time and time again…. solving a real problem that people worldwide can relate to. We’re bringing all the advances of wireless technology coupled with blockchain solutions that really drives our competitive edge. The people who are experts in these field really understand how groundbreaking that is.  We’ve also decided that buying and using the HRZN Token will be the only way people can use services on our network, but we’re ensuring that for people who arent crypto savvy that this is an easy process. On the back end, payments made for services will be exchanged for the HRZN Token. It doesnt mean anything for the customer, but for people with the HRZN Token they will see even greater value as it will be underpinned by the growth and strength of our customer base and network.  Are many local investors signing up?  - We’ve had strong support locally with a number of local buyers, a relatively small number, but their contributions have been surprising and quite significant. I certainly wasnt expecting that level of buy in, however I am a very strong proponent local companies being supported by fellow Bermudians.  When my Grandfather started Bermuda Container Line, he alongside Mr. Perry and Mr. Brewer gathered the support they needed from the community to get off the ground (or more to the point, on the water). I feel we’ve lost a bit of that “community spirit” over the past many years, I’m glad its starting to come back.  ICO’s are a new model and cryptocurrency adoption worldwide is a faction of 1%. So getting even some in Bermuda to buy our token, which we’ve already done, would be a major accomplishment and we’ll be looking to push for that number in the coming weeks / months. A lot of it just comes down to education and awareness.  Everyone understands the internet though, so even if they didnt get a chance to buy into the Horizon Token, they will greatly benefit from us entering the market.  When do you hope to start an internet service in Bermuda?  — We are aiming for Q3 / Q4 to begin to install customers . As we progress in the ICO, which is still early stages, we will be getting resources in place as quickly as possible. A great advantage of our business and technology is we are able to roll out services quite quickly compared to stringing hundreds of miles of cable everywhere.  Have you applied for the appropriate licenses from the Regulatory Authority Board (RAB)? And are you confident the RAB will grant the licenses to Horizon, as there is a moratorium on awarding new licenses at the moment, I believe?  — We have at present a signed agreement with a license holder and we’ve been in talks with other telecommunication providers in Bermuda for a larger possible strategic partnership. There are a number of “single vector” companies, only providing 1 service, that realize the disruption having such an advanced company such as Horizon means to the marketplace. We’ve also been approached by other companies in the Caribbean who realize that if we enter the market they have a limited runway.  The RAB recently released a statement that shows (in my opinion) they clearly understand the telecommunication landscape in Bermuda is far from ideal. I look forward to working with the RAB to help improve that situation. Horizon has been approached by other countries in the Caribbean to also startup our services there as well, so I think we’ll be looking to expand as quickly as possible to other markets. Our team and advisors have built telecom companies throughout the world, so at its core this is “old hat” for us, but now we’re bringing together the right Bermuda has a rich history of great business ventures starting on our shores and bringing positive change to the entire world, Horizon will be no different.

Having a reliable network in emergency situations like this becomes very important for many people when they need to communicate with the government, rescue teams, and other entities regarding rescue efforts, including the need for supplies and medical attention.  When it comes to telecommunications, people have depended mostly on wired networks. Cable and fiber networks are prone to damages when these natural disasters strike, already straining systems that are overloaded and adding to corrosion issues copper networks face.  Even a small storm or flood can render wired network useless. People lose the use of communications equipment in emergency situations that they would otherwise have relied upon for making contact with rescue teams. It is also important to note that natural disasters very often strike without any prior warning and this is why choosing a functional and resilient telecommunications network during an emergency situation is critical.  In 2005, Hurricane Katrina swept through the southern central coast of the US causing $125 billion in damages. For many weeks, countless people were left stranded and without hope as their line of communications were cut off due to the catastrophic damages caused by this devastating hurricane. Why did they lose their ability to communicate so quickly? Because Telecommunications / Internet relied solely on cable or copper wire networks which were largely destroyed during the onset of Katrina.  That disaster marked one of the greatest turning points in telecommunications in the US, when many companies shifted their focus to 4G LTE. The reasons behind this shift were that wireless networks, are resilient in emergency situations. People can still keep in touch with law enforcement, rescue and other government bodies to ensure their safety. Emergency Response Teams are able to locate impacted communities to help them relatively quickly.  Horizon Communications, a company specializing LTE wireless communications, is working to deliver high-speed and reliable wireless internet service to Bermuda, the Caribbean, and Central America. These regions are prone to natural disasters and they usually suffer high levels of damage from sometimes unexpected and devastating natural phenomena. In areas affected by previous disasters, a subsequent installation of a wireless LTE network has proven to be very effective in re-establishing telecommunication services quickly for emergency services in particular.  Horizon Communications is ready to build a wireless network and provide extremely functional high-speed LTE services as a solution for keeping the population safe when disaster strikes. The company sees its mission as providing reliable telecommunications services where and when they are needed most.  Gilbert A Darrell is the Founder of Horizon.

The move was not really surprising as the regulation pressure mounted.  The tech giant seems to have preempted expected regulations, not wanting agencies like SEC coming after them in the wake of any stringent measures imposed by regulators. With ad platforms washing their hands off ICO, the pressure is higher on current and future ICOs to make inroads in marketing awareness among investors.  However, observers and analysts are of the opinion that the ban will be of long term benefit to ICO ecosystem and blockchain community because the effort required to sensitize investors will be too laborious for scam companies. ICOs have been blighted by scams since it became a mainstream phenomenon. This is one of the reasons regulators have been ill at ease with the fundraising method in which mostly companies that have not been vetted by anyone are permitted to raise funds from unaccredited investors who know little about the ecosystem.  The Google ban, though affecting ads doesn’t affect search terms, so companies would have to market their ICOs on Google through search optimization. Marketing through search engine optimization is certainly not the sort of process most scam companies would like to go through since they usually are in a hurry to grab the money and get out.  It is estimated that Google made $25 million advertising ICOs last year. Obviously, they had no options judging from recent happenstances, especially as it concerns regulations and the ever present possibilities of scams. There is a consensus among industry watchers that the ban is not the end of ICOs. Rather, it is an opportunity to sieve the wheat from the chaff in terms of giving opportunity for genuine companies with the requisite capabilities to thrive.  The frenetic assertion that ICO is dead is rather anecdotal. The pressure on digital currencies must be viewed from long term perspectives. It is a known fact that over the years, prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurtencies have shown volatility, however, with the benefit of hindsight, the overall trend has been upwards  Mr Gilbert Darrell, the Founder of Horizon Communications, a startup whose pre-sale commences on March through April, speaking about the rampant ICO ban said “ While this puts pressure on those startups using ICOs as a means of funding, it means that only the legitimate companies who can provide real solutions will rise above the rest and gain real organic momentum in the marketplace. Perhaps the unforeseen benefit of these ad bans is that we will see much higher quality companies come through and enter the marketplace with solutions that solve real problems.”  Despite the merits of initial coin offering as a means that fintech and startups have leveraged on to raise funds. One in ten companies involved in ICOs have been found to be fraudulent. The loss to investors are eloquent testimony to this. Compounding the issue for the fundraising method is the post ICO performance of many big names in the ICO space. Companies such as Tezos which raised $232 million in ICO sales have been embroiled in class action lawsuits. The Tezos token is today worth $3, down from $4.53 at the beginning of the year.  Perhaps hardest hit by regulatory fears and investor disenchantment are cryptocurrenies such as Bitcoin. The falling prices has made most new coin listing unable to gain traction. Investors now wonder how to select the very few tokens that are not buoyed by marketing hype. No one wants to buy a token worth $2 in the morning and $0.02 at night.  Anna Barbev, the cofounder of ICOBox said, “The Google ban is still a blow to the industry”.  What is observable through the stages ICO has gone through is that the system is evolving and professionalizing. Investors are now better informed and are selective towards their investment despite being deluged with projects that have little chances of success. “Every eye is on the lookout for value backed ICOs, that is our experience at Horizon Communications and we challenge startups to offer value because this is still a very viable means of funding” according to Gilbert Darrell whose company wants to rollout state of the art internet and communications services starting in the Caribbean and Central America, expanding globally.

Basically, what this means is that the end user or a company can have ownership rights to certain information that is secured by blockchain technology.  This comes as welcome news for Horizon Communications as it serves as an indication that we are moving toward an age where everything is digitalized. While this may seem like a small step into this technological utopia, we think that this will form the foundation for many other states in the US and countries internationally to follow suit until we have a fully legal system in place for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.  Similar bills have already been signed in other states such as Florida, Nebraska, and Arizona.. The Nebraska bill has not been voted on by the full Assembly. Last May, the governor of Arizona signed a similar measure into law. Although the advancement of the legal protection of the blockchain technology and cryptocurrency has been slow and incremental, we welcome an age where a digital contract is just as valid as a written one.  What does this mean for companies that utilize cryptocurrency? Although blockchain is highly resistant to hackers, it doesn’t mean that hacking is impossible. As the legal protection begins to extend to blockchain data, we have another layer of protection for both our ICO and our company. One of the great benefits for blockchain is building a trustless system of transactions, as we move towards that future having some legal “backup” is great to see.  Electronic transactions will also be under this lawful protection. Overall, it allows companies that use cryptocurrency to function with more protection than just the existing technology. This also means a safe investment for our ICO investors and we believe that once the legal system is refined, cryptocurrency will function exactly like the existing physical currency.[rb1]  At Horizon, we are optimistic that the future legal protection of blockchain technology is a very positive and beneficial change. Not only are our projects off to an excellent start as we are expanding rapidly, but governments are also doing their part to facilitate our growth.

In fact, in his opinion, cryptocurrency should be treated just like any other physical currency.  Moreover, Australia has also begun implementing blockchain technologies since December of last year. There will be a crypto-friendly airport terminal hosted at Brisbane as the first airport ever to be compatible with the crypto technology. Australians have also been able to purchase crypto at newsstands all across the country since March 1 2017[rb1] .  As we move toward the future with cryptocurrency, we see that there is an ongoing effort to embrace it, as displayed in the United States, Bermuda, Japan, China, and many other countries as well.  So, what does that mean for companies that use cryptocurrency as a means of investment? With governments’ involvement in cultivating a crypto-friendly environment, there are signs that cryptocurrency will soon be universally accepted and may become one of the most viable and widely used currencies of the future, even exceeding the use of dollars. This means cryptocurrencies will continue to be valuable and usable, and we expect that their usefulness will continue to grow in the coming years. Therefore, investors through ICOs can be sure that their digital currency can be used widely.  To all the companies building solutions in blockchain and cryptocurrency, this is welcome news since they can expect investment through that system to be viable in the future, especially for startups like Horizon Communications.

The company plans to deploy state-of-the-art telecommunications equipment in the Caribbean and Central America, with an ambitious drive of spreading their services worldwide. Their aim is to provide high speed internet services to replace obsolete technology that is easily disrupted by natural disasters.  The Horizon ICO is set to introduce a unique twist to crowdfunding. The company would be giving investors of the token a sort of equity in the business as well as a buy back clause as found in the whitepaper. This means that in future, all holders of the token will have the option of selling it back to the company. This was incentivized by the company’s confidence that the token will be worth much more than it is presently valued.  The company’s president, Mr Gilbert Darrell recently announced that the Horizon pre-ICO will soon be live. The company has been working round the clock to ensure a seamless delivery for the presale. One of the collaborations they have made is the integration of Coingate, a cryptocurrency processor that supports up to fifty digital currencies including bitcoin and ether.  Mr Darrell said that with Coingate, non techie investors would be able to purchase the Horizon token easily since the platform is user friendly.  With the Horizon ICO launch in view, it ushers in a new era for the people of Bermuda and the Caribbean who have been beleaguered by slow internet services due to ageing and outdated equipments. It also heralds a class of cryptocurrency participation that gives investors more than a token, but an insured equity in the business with the buyback clause. Investors would have opportunity of building a portfolio of valuable crypto asset while supporting a company that solves real problem facing everyday people in a region.  One phenomenon that seemed to have been absent in many ICOs was the purpose meeting aspirations to solve the need of people. It is obvious that aside moving cryptocurrencies around, many projects rarely solve problems bedeviling people. This is the reason Horizon vision has stood out among crypto enthusiast and why there are eager pool of investors awaiting the ICO launch.",False

The Internet has become part of life for millions of people around the globe. Different types of internet connections have emerged to fulfill the users’ needs; most notably are wireless networks and wired networks. With the current dominance of wired networks, many people are still skeptical about switching to the wireless network. As a company with ambitions to become a leading internet provider, Horizon Communications will change your mind about how an ISP network can be implemented.  Horizon Communications comprises of a team of dedicated people who will deliver a high speed and reliable internet across the country, including remote areas. They are working to achieve the goal of making an internet connection more accessible to anyone and everyone. But how can another type of Internet connection be more accessible than today’s systems of connection? The answer? It is the wireless network.  Without the need for cables, internet access will become much easier. It is well observed that wireless networks can enable more devices to be connected to the internet at the same time while wired network requires cable to be hooked into each device to allow them access to the internet. A wireless network, on the other hand, makes it possible for users to roam freely with their laptops, smartphones, and tablets as long as you are in the range of the connection. This is how convenient a wireless network can be.  With the complication of reliance on cables for a connection, a wired network is prone to damages when disaster strikes, (storms, floods, other natural disasters for example) This makes choosing the best option for your internet connection very important. Horizon Communications will be able to repair issues very quickly should disaster strike, with wireless ISP’s in the Caribbean during the past 2017 hurricanes able to rebuild within weeks.  Many people still argue that speed over wireless networks tends to be slower than that over cable. While this is true in most cases, Horizon Communications are adopting technology that was originally used by major cell phone carriers, with LTE allowing 150mbps today with further advancements just around the corner. With the incorporation of blockchain technology, Horizon can bring additional features of speed, reliability and scalable not to mention the amazing advancements we are seeing in blockchain.  With Horizon, our customers will find an ISP that should be the standard world-wide. We are proud to ensure that as an outstanding company in providing high-speed internet Horizon Communications will be able to deliver the fast and reliable wireless internet connection to our customers and expand globally.

During our initial launch, Horizon will be establishing into the Country of Bermuda and BVI in 2018.  As we grow, Horizon will be looking to deploy in to similar markets, other Caribbean Islands and in the near future parts of Central and South America.    Business Profitability in Bermuda With capturing only 15% of the home and small business market, within a few years in our initial launch, Horizon aims to bring in an estimated $43.7 million in gross revenues, with $26.2 million in gross expenses leaving a cumulative net income of approximately $17.5 million over that period.  As Horizon Expands into cell phone services and other markets, we expect our profit to increase substantially.  Expansion into other markets      Horizon's advanced technology allows for tremendous range and coverage.  This means Horizon only needs 4 distribution towers, allowing us to 95% of Bermuda's homes and businesses, as well as offshore coverage of 15+ miles.     Horizon will deliver full Telecom services at launch including:           Horizon Communications is offering our Token, the HRZN Token, to buyers.
