Can anyone confirm or deny? There Telegram channel is like tumbleweed. Their Investors portal no longer works. There Twitter account has not replied to anyone asking a question re distribution.  I am copying info off LinkedIn thanks to Dr. Sean Larkin, D.C. - Ⓥ  Prior to the ICO date, I communicated with one of Palau’s senators and he confirmed that RAcoin is a scam. Gambling in any form is illegal on Palau and there are no plans for a casino there, and they have had no dealings with the company supposedly called RA Entertainment. Attached are news clippings sent to me by Senator Mason Whipps.  https://www.linkedin.com/in/mason-whipps-bb0a985/  In addition to the newspaper clipping images, here is a link to the article in the local newspaper's website.  http://islandtimes.us/govt-probes-online-gambling-scam/  I asked for help to spread the word and show how fast we can all work together to stop a confirmed ICO scam. The ICO listing websites were the most proactive and responded the best, far better when compared to the news services, with only a couple of notable exceptions.  Below are some of the ICO listing sites which listed RAcoin. What I had suggested was for them to not remove RAcoin, but instead to mark them as a confirmed ICO scam. This being the most helpful in reducing damage and demonstrating the integrity which we need to be able to trust any ICO listing service. Every service listed was contacted and the action taken noted.  https://www.trackico.io/ico/racoin/ (scam warning posted upon notification)  https://www.listico.io/ico-calendar/racoin-ico (scam warning posted upon notification)  https://topicolist.com/ico/racoin (page has been removed)  https://www.coinschedule.com/ico/racoin (given lowest rating, then subsequently delisted)  https://icobench.com/ico/racoin (responded, no observable action taken)  https://icomarks.com/ico/racoin/  https://icotracker.net/project/racoin  https://www.icoalert.com/?q=RAcoin&is_v=1  Below are just some of the press releases. The ideal action which was suggested to these news sites was for them to write an article about the situation and to forward the current press release link to their own article about the RAcoin scam. Every news service listed was contacted and the action, if any, has been noted.  https://coinworldstory.com/racoin/ (scam warning posted upon notification)  http://www.the-[Suspicious link removed]/2018/04/10/ukraines-ra-entertainment-nets-10m-in-presale-to-build-vegas-in-the-pacific/ (page has been removed)  https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/racoin-raised-10-million-in-2-days-to-upgrade-global-gambling-industry  https://news.bitcoin.com/pr-introducing-blockchain-to-the-non-digital-world-with-gambling-token-racoin/  https://bitcoinist.com/racoin-new-global-gambling-cryptocurrency/  https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/racoin-ico-rac-token/  https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ra-entertainment-inc-introduces-racoin---cryptocurrency-for-the-real-world-gambling-industry-678746743.html  When a scam is reported our blockchain and cryptocurrency news services need to have a better system for being informed easier, investigating and taking action rapidly.  We need to work together so we can effectively help stop any ICO which is confirmed to be a scam. In terms of damage done it doesn't matter whether you're the victim of the scam or not, scams have a ripple effect which harm all the businesses and people involve in blockchain and cryptocurrency.  It would be far better for us to figure out good ways to 'unofficially' self regulate rather than allowing problems, which will ultimately bring more outside regulation attempts, with the justification being that it's for our protection. Centralization and control, intentional or not acts to stifle the growth of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. We don't want this because, as often is the case, far more harm is done to more people in the name of protecting them.  Edit 5/30/18: Here is the original version of the RAcoin website with their false claim:  https://web.archive.org/web/20180502191644/https://racoin.io/  Here is the current website and social media for Racoin:  https://racoin.io  https://www.linkedin.com/company/racoin/  https://www.facebook.com/racasinopw/  https://twitter.com/RAcoinNews  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtyGrvHTO7LCa4IAJyjMUdw  https://t.me/racoinnews  Spreading the word about this was important for the reputation of Palau, and to help prevent people from being cheated, and to also help and maintain the trust in future ICO launches done in good faith.  For all of us who care about the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency... When an ICO is without a doubt confirmed to be a scam, then we should all help spread the word to others and assist in contacting entities who are unaware that they are helping promote an ICO scam. In this way we help prevent harm to the innocent and help protect our own community's current and longterm interests.

If something changes, we will inform you.  Quote from: fatty_but_happy on May 25, 2018, 11:25:47 AM Can your token be mined? No, this token is utility token, so there's no such option.  Quote from: STAyre on May 25, 2018, 11:26:59 AM Admin, was there an increase in the cost of the token? For now 1 RAC costs approximately 0.00594 USD  Quote from: collinstar on May 25, 2018, 11:28:10 AM why exactly ETH platform, and how is it different? Ethereum has a high “immune” system where a third party can’t make changes to any data. It has proven itself that is corruption free because of the impossibility to make any censorship. Apps connected to Ethereum rarely, almost never go down and cannot be shut down. You can use ethereum for fundraising with the use of smart contracts for various projects. Ethereum has no limit in Megabytes. Also, the algorithm that is used to mine Ether tokens is called “ proof of work” and successfully avoids hacker attacks.  Quote from: littlebeetle on May 25, 2018, 11:29:32 AM Can users somehow help you to launch some of your software things? If there will be such possibility, you will be informed Stay tuned and follow the news!  Quote from: PizzaTraveler on May 25, 2018, 11:30:41 AM Can you give me link for your smart contract? You can see the current code of our smart contract on GitHub.  Link: https://bit.ly/2jOVhlg  Quote from: FloodZone on May 25, 2018, 11:32:28 AM Airdrop still running? Yes, it is still going on!  Quote from: David1978 on May 25, 2018, 11:33:17 AM What will you do with unsold tokens? The unsold tokens will be locked up for a year.  Quote from: Levis on May 25, 2018, 11:34:18 AM How are ra wallet and ra exchange connected? RA exchange is interactive with RA wallet, as it supports coin to coin trading, anchor currency trading, OTC trading with fiat and cryptocurrency withdrawal.  Quote from: yongyong on May 25, 2018, 11:35:12 AM hi, is there any competitor for the project? RAcoin is a progressive ecosystem with multiple hotspots around the world. We have our rivals, but they specialize only in one function. Moreover, the blockchain technology fully integrated in the business makes it innovative and non-reachable for many competitors.

At the moment RAcoin has several use cases: • Payments for all goods, services and accommodations provided in the Palau World Casino and Hotel complex, which will be built and open regardless of how much money the crowdsale of RAcoin raises. • Payments in other casinos and hotels that will collaborate with RA Entertainment Inc. and join the RAcoin eco-system in the future. • Deposits and winning withdrawals on gambling and betting online platforms. So far RA Entertainment Inc. has agreed to allow a European casino company to integrate RAcoin into its sites. The sites will implement RAcoin as an alternative method of payment no later than three months after the crowdsale is completed. The company is open to negotiations with other potential partners. • Iterative “operating” jackpot along with one-time “crowdsale” jackpot. The first one will be played out each time the special standalone account will accumulate 100,000 21 RAC. The second one will be launched only once, at the end of the public token sale.  We don't say it`s better than the traditional currency, we say it’s much more convenient, efficient and profitable than fiat. We work hard so it really would be more popular and worldwide accepted.",False

The industry does not avoid innovations but there has always been a missing piece that kept it conservative. Even online gambling was only a minor breakthrough that still lacks transparency, privacy, and security. No matter we’re talking about land-based casinos or internet casinos, ordinary gamers never can be sure that the algorithms function properly. Using blockchain technology operators can remove the weak places. Let’s skip the question whether some of them really want this but generally it could increase the level of safeness and fair gaming across the industry. Worldwide utilization of cryptocurrencies is another big step towards the new gambling era. However, Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies not always can solve specific gambling issues. In a perfect world, there should be a single utility token for global gambling infrastructure. RA Entertainment Inc. accepted the challenge and designed RAcoin to unite standalone playgrounds into an open and close-knit environment.
