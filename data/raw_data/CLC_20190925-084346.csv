Kuznetsk Coal Zone  The development of the coal fields of Kuznetsk Basin, (sometimes called the ""Kuzbass"") transformed the Siberian steppe. The south sector of the Trans-Siberian Railway became a great industrial center because of the activity surrounding the coalfields. These ancient reserves of 13,000,000,000 tonnes grew to 450,658,000,000 tonnes. In 1937, the 50 mines in this area produced a total of 17,300,000 tonnes. The coal production of this zone was comparable with that of all of British India, and half of that produced by Japan. Kuznetsk coal was the best in the USSR, with high energy and low sulphur content. The total anthracite reserve was 54 million tonnes; and was used in the Ural-Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine. Siberia is also the coldest winters to survive, this includes freezing temperature such as -50 degrees.",True

Quote Seven months of winter per year froze the ground, making it hard to mine. During the brief summer months, the ground turned to slush. Buildings had to be raised on piles, so that they would not sink from the warmth of the building melting the permafrost. The main processing plant had to be built on better ground, found 20 km away from the mine. The winter temperatures were so low that car tires and steel would shatter and oil would freeze. During the winter, workers used jet engines to thaw and dig out the permafrost or blasted it with dynamite to get access to the underlying kimberlite.

And if again you would have studied the video of the project, you would have looked,  In occasion of extraction! We do not say that we mine coal. We say that we resell coal, buying it from other coal enterprises and subsequently sell it to the countries of Europe in the company with whom we have a contract for the supply of coal. Once again, we did not say that we are mining coal, we are planning to mine, as we are ready to do this and we have experience in the coal industry, for this we are collecting investments to start the development of coal on our own site. In accordance with the contract, contract work.  Why do we collect investment in the coal mine? Because we have contracts for the supply of coal, and we do not have where to buy that volume of coal. which we need under the contract. Due to the large deficit and the high demand for coal at this time. The opening of the cut was a weighted decision, but at the moment the investment in this project. And we limit this together.  We work transparently and openly. Yes, we are somewhere not strong in terms of marketing, in terms of social networks. But we are strong in the real world, in terms of conducting and developing business and opening new projects. We think this is much more important than making good marketing for a product that either does not or does not go, due to the fact that it does not assess the market and the weak in terms of real business and competition.

It didn't dawn on me that noble Russians who use Twitter amassed their followers from outside Russia.   Okay, you got me on the latter part of your post. Yes, a video blog 100% brings cred to a project just like it did for HashCard and Arbitao. Dudes, if you want the community to believe you're the real deal, I suggest your team have their picture taken in front of Big Ben sans scaffolding.  So, you're tying to raise U$2M during your ICO so to commence strip-mining coal on property you may or may not own, eh? U$2M isn't very much money for your intended operation considering said amount would be used maybe to purchase one of these bad boys ...   What about them giant dump trucks you'll need to haul the coal to ... wait for it ... YOUR on-site coal preparation plant?  To be uber-fair, I suggest you reply along  the lines of ""we'll get back to you in 24 hours re your concerns"" but forget to return, abandoning this forum. That's how you build cred here.",True
