We aim to onboard institutions, businesses etc. on  our  platform  to  provide  services  via  our  platform  for  real  life  use  cases  using  one  or  more  of  the  features  available  in  our  ecosystem.  We  are  already  in  positive  talks  with  many  of  such  organizations and institutions and have been successful in getting them onboard as our partners.   Stage 2: This stage actually runs in parallel to Stage 1 and relates to onboarding consumers on our  ecosystem.  Our  Rewards  Program  for  referral  of  new  Users  in  particular  will  serve  as  a  key  to rapid consumer adoption of our platform because of the network effect based on which the program has been designed.  Stage  3:Educating  masses  about  our  eco  system  and  our  solution  using  PR  agencies.  During  this stage we will highlight the key features and present the value proposition of our solution to a wider audience via advertisements, events, conferences, running campaigns and so on.  Stage 4:This stage starts once our platform has gained initial traction. Within this stage we will partner  with  public  and  government  organizations  for  offering  their  services  via  our  platform  or  using  our  API’s.  This  will  in  turn  help  with  a  broader  adoption  of  the  solution  by  even  more  consumers  and  open  up  avenues  for  continued  growth  and  creation  of  value  for  our  platform.  In  particular,  we  are  aiming  to  collaborate  with  government  agencies  and  provide  basic  government  services  on  our  platform  to  help  drive  the  mass  adoption  of  our  platform  at  a  rapid  pace",False

Our platform, however, takes it up a level more by making the network more secure and trustworthy owing to the identity and credential verification possibility, as discussed earlier. Solving one of the major issues plaguing professional networks today, around the topic of completeness and correctness of the data shared in individual profiles – that is our mission. The vision that we share for the future of professional networks is when members no longer have to question whether the identities and data associated may be trusted – irrespective of the profile or the data content. We, at Lynked.World Professional Network, are ready to be the torch bearers of such a beneficial change, uplifting our professional lives and relations in many different ways. With our combined effort, thoughts of suspicion towards digital identities will say goodbye as we welcome this new chapter with thoughts of faith.",False

We aim to onboard institutions, businesses etc. on  our  platform  to  provide  services  via  our  platform  for  real  life  use  cases  using  one  or  more  of  the  features  available  in  our  ecosystem.  We  are  already  in  positive  talks  with  many  of  such  organizations and institutions and have been successful in getting them onboard as our partners . Stage 2: This stage actually runs in parallel to Stage 1 and relates to onboarding consumers on our  ecosystem.  Our  Rewards  Program  for  referral  of  new  Users  in  particular  will  serve  as  a  key  to rapid consumer adoption of our platform because of the network effect based on which the program has been designed.  Stage  3:Educating  masses  about  our  eco  system  and  our  solution  using  PR  agencies.  During  this stage we will highlight the key features and present the value proposition of our solution to a wider audience via advertisements, events, conferences, running campaigns and so on.  Stage 4:This stage starts once our platform has gained initial traction. Within this stage we will partner  with  public  and  government  organizations  for  offering  their  services  via  our  platform  or  using  our  API’s.  This  will  in  turn  help  with  a  broader  adoption  of  the  solution  by  even  more  consumers  and  open  up  avenues  for  continued  growth  and  creation  of  value  for  our  platform.  In  particular,  we  are  aiming  to  collaborate  with  government  agencies  and  provide  basic  government  services  on  our  platform  to  help  drive  the  mass  adoption  of  our  platform  at  a  rapid  pace.",False

Our Business Development and Marketing team has laid down a concrete marketing strategy to reach out to businesses and consumers:  Stage 1:Our focus during this stage is to be introduced and accepted by different organizations, institutions, businesses etc. through partnerships. We aim to onboard institutions, businesses etc. on  our  platform  to  provide  services  via  our  platform  for  real  life  use  cases  using  one  or  more  of  the  features  available  in  our  ecosystem.  We  are  already  in  positive  talks  with  many  of  such  organizations and institutions and have been successful in getting them onboard as our partners.  Stage 2: This stage actually runs in parallel to Stage 1 and relates to onboarding consumers on our  ecosystem.  Our  Rewards  Program  for  referral  of  new  Users  in  particular  will  serve  as  a  key  to rapid consumer adoption of our platform because of the network effect based on which the program has been designed.  Stage 3:Educating  masses  about  our  eco  system  and  our  solution  using  PR  agencies.  During  this stage we will highlight the key features and present the value proposition of our solution to a wider audience via advertisements, events, conferences, running campaigns and so on.  Stage 4:This stage starts once our platform has gained initial traction. Within this stage we will partner  with  public  and  government  organizations  for  offering  their  services  via  our  platform  or  using  our  API’s.  This  will  in  turn  help  with  a  broader  adoption  of  the  solution  by  even  more  consumers  and  open  up  avenues  for  continued  growth  and  creation  of  value  for  our  platform.  In  particular,  we  are  aiming  to  collaborate  with  government  agencies  and  provide  basic  government  services  on  our  platform  to  help  drive  the  mass  adoption  of  our  platform  at  a  rapid  pace",False

Our Business Development and Marketing team has laid down a concrete marketing strategy to reach out to businesses and consumers:  Stage 1:Our focus during this stage is to be introduced and accepted by different organizations, institutions, businesses etc. through partnerships. We aim to onboard institutions, businesses etc. on  our  platform  to  provide  services  via  our  platform  for  real  life  use  cases  using  one  or  more  of  the  features  available  in  our  ecosystem.  We  are  already  in  positive  talks  with  many  of  such  organizations and institutions and have been successful in getting them onboard as our partners.  Stage 2: This stage actually runs in parallel to Stage 1 and relates to onboarding consumers on our  ecosystem.  Our  Rewards  Program  for  referral  of  new  Users  in  particular  will  serve  as  a  key  to rapid consumer adoption of our platform because of the network effect based on which the program has been designed.  Stage  3:Educating  masses  about  our  eco  system  and  our  solution  using  PR  agencies.  During  this stage we will highlight the key features and present the value proposition of our solution to a wider audience via advertisements, events, conferences, running campaigns and so on.  Stage 4:This stage starts once our platform has gained initial traction. Within this stage we will partner  with  public  and  government  organizations  for  offering  their  services  via  our  platform  or  using  our  API’s.  This  will  in  turn  help  with  a  broader  adoption  of  the  solution  by  even  more  consumers  and  open  up  avenues  for  continued  growth  and  creation  of  value  for  our  platform.  In  particular,  we  are  aiming  to  collaborate  with  government  agencies  and  provide  basic  government  services  on  our  platform  to  help  drive  the  mass  adoption  of  our  platform  at  a  rapid  pace.",False

We aim to onboard institutions, businesses etc. on  our  platform  to  provide  services  via  our  platform  for  real  life  use  cases  using  one  or  more  of  the  features  available  in  our  ecosystem.  We  are  already  in  positive  talks  with  many  of  such  organizations and institutions and have been successful in getting them onboard as our partners.   Stage 2: This stage actually runs in parallel to Stage 1 and relates to onboarding consumers on our  ecosystem.  Our  Rewards  Program  for  referral  of  new  Users  in  particular  will  serve  as  a  key  to rapid consumer adoption of our platform because of the network effect based on which the program has been designed.  Stage  3:Educating  masses  about  our  eco  system  and  our  solution  using  PR  agencies.  During  this stage we will highlight the key features and present the value proposition of our solution to a wider audience via advertisements, events, conferences, running campaigns and so on.  Stage 4:This stage starts once our platform has gained initial traction. Within this stage we will partner  with  public  and  government  organizations  for  offering  their  services  via  our  platform  or  using  our  API’s.  This  will  in  turn  help  with  a  broader  adoption  of  the  solution  by  even  more  consumers  and  open  up  avenues  for  continued  growth  and  creation  of  value  for  our  platform.  In  particular,  we  are  aiming  to  collaborate  with  government  agencies  and  provide  basic  government  services  on  our  platform  to  help  drive  the  mass  adoption  of  our  platform  at  a  rapid  pace",False

We  are  already  in  positive  talks  with  many  of  such  organizations and institutions and have been successful in getting them onboard as our partners.  Stage 2: This stage actually runs in parallel to Stage 1 and relates to onboarding consumers on our  ecosystem.  Our  Rewards  Program  for  referral  of  new  Users  in  particular  will  serve  as  a  key  to rapid consumer adoption of our platform because of the network effect based on which the program has been designed.  Stage  3:Educating  masses  about  our  eco  system  and  our  solution  using  PR  agencies.  During  this stage we will highlight the key features and present the value proposition of our solution to a wider audience via advertisements, events, conferences, running campaigns and so on.  Stage 4:This stage starts once our platform has gained initial traction. Within this stage we will partner  with  public  and  government  organizations  for  offering  their  services  via  our  platform  or  using  our  API’s.  This  will  in  turn  help  with  a  broader  adoption  of  the  solution  by  even  more  consumers  and  open  up  avenues  for  continued  growth  and  creation  of  value  for  our  platform.

Our Business Development and Marketing team has laid down a concrete marketing strategy to reach out to businesses and consumers:  Stage 1:Our focus during this stage is to be introduced and accepted by different organizations, institutions, businesses etc. through partnerships. We aim to onboard institutions, businesses etc. on  our  platform  to  provide  services  via  our  platform  for  real  life  use  cases  using  one  or  more  of  the  features  available  in  our  ecosystem.  We  are  already  in  positive  talks  with  many  of  such  organizations and institutions and have been successful in getting them onboard as our partners.  Stage 2: This stage actually runs in parallel to Stage 1 and relates to onboarding consumers on our  ecosystem.  Our  Rewards  Program  for  referral  of  new  Users  in  particular  will  serve  as  a  key  to rapid consumer adoption of our platform because of the network effect based on which the program has been designed.  Stage  3:Educating  masses  about  our  eco  system  and  our  solution  using  PR  agencies.  During  this stage we will highlight the key features and present the value proposition of our solution to a wider audience via advertisements, events, conferences, running campaigns and so on.  Stage 4:This stage starts once our platform has gained initial traction. Within this stage we will partner  with  public  and  government  organizations  for  offering  their  services  via  our  platform   or  using  our  API’s.  This  will  in  turn  help  with  a  broader  adoption  of  the  solution  by  even  more  consumers  and  open  up  avenues  for  continued  growth  and  creation  of  value  for  our  platform.   In  particular,  we  are  aiming  to  collaborate  with  government  agencies  and  provide  basic  government  services  on  our  platform  to  help  drive  the  mass  adoption  of  our  platform  at  a  rapid  pace.",False

We aim to onboard institutions, businesses etc. on  our  platform  to  provide  services  via  our  platform  for  real  life  use  cases  using  one  or  more  of  the  features  available  in  our  ecosystem.  We  are  already  in  positive  talks  with  many  of  such  organizations and institutions and have been successful in getting them onboard as our partners.   Stage 2: This stage actually runs in parallel to Stage 1 and relates to onboarding consumers on our  ecosystem.  Our  Rewards  Program  for  referral  of  new  Users  in  particular  will  serve  as  a  key  to rapid consumer adoption of our platform because of the network effect based on which the program has been designed.  Stage  3:Educating  masses  about  our  eco  system  and  our  solution  using  PR  agencies.  During  this stage we will highlight the key features and present the value proposition of our solution to a wider audience via advertisements, events, conferences, running campaigns and so on.  Stage 4:This stage starts once our platform has gained initial traction. Within this stage we will partner  with  public  and  government  organizations  for  offering  their  services  via  our  platform   or  using  our  API’s.  This  will  in  turn  help  with  a  broader  adoption  of  the  solution  by  even  more  consumers  and  open  up  avenues  for  continued  growth  and  creation  of  value  for  our  platform.  In  particular,  we  are  aiming  to  collaborate  with  government  agencies  and  provide  basic  government  services  on  our  platform  to  help  drive  the  mass  adoption  of  our  platform  at  a  rapid  pace.

Our Business Development and Marketing team has laid down a concrete marketing strategy to reach out to businesses and consumers:  Stage 1:Our focus during this stage is to be introduced and accepted by different organizations, institutions, businesses etc. through partnerships. We aim to onboard institutions, businesses etc. on  our  platform  to  provide  services  via  our  platform  for  real  life  use  cases  using  one  or  more  of  the  features  available  in  our  ecosystem. We are already in positive  talks  with  many  of  such  organizations and institutions and have been successful in getting them onboard as our partners.  Stage 2: This stage actually runs in parallel to Stage 1 and relates to onboarding consumers on our  ecosystem.  Our  Rewards  Program  for  referral  of  new  Users  in  particular  will  serve  as  a  key  to rapid consumer adoption of our platform because of the network effect based on which the program has been designed.  Stage 3:Educating  masses  about  our  eco  system  and  our  solution  using  PR  agencies.  During  this stage we will highlight the key features and present the value proposition of our solution to a wider audience via advertisements, events, conferences, running campaigns and so on.  Stage 4:This stage starts once our platform has gained initial traction. Within this stage we will partner  with  public  and  government  organizations  for  offering  their  services  via  our  platform  or  using  our  API’s.  This  will  in  turn  help  with  a  broader  adoption  of  the  solution  by  even  more  consumers  and  open  up  avenues  for  continued  growth  and  creation  of  value  for  our  platform.  In  particular,  we  are  aiming  to  collaborate  with  government  agencies  and  provide  basic  government  services  on  our  platform  to  help  drive  the  mass  adoption  of  our  platform  at  a  rapid  pace.",False

The  Lynked.World Job Portal has materialized  as  a  natural  outcome  of  and  complementing  our  other two products – “Digital   Identity and Background Verification Platform” and “Trusted Professional Network”. The portal will help employers post job openings without involving any third party in the process, thereby reducing  cost  and  increasing  efficiency  of  the recruitment   process Verification of profiles and screening  of suitable candidates can now be executed  in  a  much  simpler  and  faster  way,  relying  solely and wholly on the trust   embedded  in  and  enforced  by  the  ecosystem  on  all  individuals’  identities,  their shared  data being readily available on the platform. Viewed from the  candidates’  perspective,  they  would  now  get better opportunities  based  on  real competition  in the job market without having to trail  in the race because  of inflated  profile, that are so often found on current prevalent job portals. A perfectly balanced win-win situation for both employers and prospective employees is the desired accomplishment of our job portal platform.",False
