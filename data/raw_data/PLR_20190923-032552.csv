In fact, Malwina, Constance, and I are there right now looking at the facilities and planning the agenda. You’ll pay for your flight, hotel, and meals, and we’ll pay for the conference and the big Friday party event. You’ll also get a special Vilnius Pillar t-shirt.   This will be an unconference - we’ll be making it up as we go. It works far better than planning an agenda. If you want to contribute anything, come prepared. Our first goal is to get people signed up, so we have commitments and can make all our arrangements in Vilnius. Then we’ll work on how you can get involved as a speaker, workshop leader, staff, etc. There will be three main tracks: entrepreneurship, developing for our platform, and music.   👔 The entrepreneur track will have two parts: my business-agility lectures, which will take place each morning first thing, then we’ll be working with entrepreneurs to build their businesses on the Pillar wallet. This first year, the wallet will be similar to eBay, so we’ll be working with teams who want to put products and services onto the wallet. We are looking for our Pillar pioneers - people who are serious about building a business on top of our wallet. We’ll be talking about all the developments coming up and how you can participate in our new ecosystem.  💻 The developer track will be learning about our SDK and how to put products and services on the wallet. We will have workshops on our taxonomy, findability, formats, APIs, coding, and smart contracts. Whether you learn or teach, it should be a fun and fruitful week.  🎶 The music festival is for you to bring your instruments and your talent and make it even more fun. We want the Pillar summer event to be the Woodstock of the crypto world. So if you have a band, a show, or you can entertain people in any way, please jump into the Summer Event 2018 channel in our online community and help us plan an amazing event! We need people to help us make this work, so if you are on the production side, you are more than welcome to get involved. It’s an unconference. It’s also a music unfestival. Every one of our events is always a hiring event. If you want a job with Pillar, I encourage you to come to Vilnius and participate - we don’t interview!  For Families 👪 We will have a kids’ camp option as a separate package. We’re working on that now. The resort has a lot of things to do, and we’ll be organizing various bus tours to town and to surrounding sights. We’ll also have shuttle buses going into and out of town continuously.   Golf Packages 🏌 The resort offers a championship-level golf course. Since we’re taking over the event and since not that many of us play golf, our golfers should have good access. If you want to volunteer to help us set up golf, foursomes, etc., please contact me.   The Pillar Store 👕 We are working with volunteers to plan a Pillar products store for this event. If you want to help with that, please let us know.   Events with the Lithuanian Community 📍 We’ll be interacting heavily with the local tech/blockchain/crypto community. Pillar project has a small office in Vilnius. We are planning to do workshops with local entrepreneurs, educators, and government officials.  Excursion to St Petersburg 🛫 We will offer an additional one-week trip to St Petersburg, Russia, leaving Vilnius on Sunday the 22nd and allowing you to return home after 4-5 nights. St Petersburg is a must-see destination, and end of July is one of the best times of year to be there. I highly recommend this trip. And, because it’s not put together, I’m asking if any volunteers can help us arrange it. Russian-speakers and those who have connections to St Petersburg are encouraged to contact me.   💪 Want to help us with Unconference?

Our goal has always been to go to a Kanban system to run the office, and we’ve just been starting that lately. I take full responsibility for the fact that we don’t have a wallet ready by the end of Q1. On the other hand, we’ve added many features that other wallets don’t have, and if it takes a few months longer than I predicted last June, I’m not too worried. I don’t watch the price of our token. I don’t watch the calendar. I watch our ability to change the world with a new operating system. By summer, we should have a very strong platform, and those who come to our big event in Vilnius will learn that the Pillar wallet will be a place where you can put your data and trust it, where you can set up your business and serve customers, where you can have your equity token sale and know you’ll be fully compliant with all laws, and where future developers create new things that have never existed, all without advertising or large organizations having any control or influence. We’ve written over 20,000 lines of code, and as you’ll see below we’ll be going into testing fairly soon.  THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION has recently started to take large-scale action, stating that exchanges that trade securities must be regulated. The message, while stern and significant, is still unclear. Last week, Poloniex, in being acquired by Circle, said they intend to register as a fully regulated exchange. Bittrex has said they will continue to determine which tokens are utility tokens and allow them to trade. GDAX is probably too far out over their skis, saying they will continue to get around regulations by calling tokens utilities. The SEC has also published a guide for consumers, pointing out the risks but again failing to educate the public about the difference between risk and exposure. While we hope cool heads prevail, we may well be at the top of a very slippery regulatory slope.  I’ll break this down briefly: 1) SEC chairman Jay Clayton says that almost all tokens meet the definition for securities because they are fixed in number, allowing them to appreciate and attracting speculators. 2) Many so-called security tokens have already been sold, but very few can restrict their flow, so it’s fairly easy for an accredited investor to buy a token from an issuer and then sell that same token to a non-accredited student in Wichita. 3) Millions of tokens are already in the hands of Americans, so just regulating issuers and exchanges doesn’t put all the milk back in the bottle. In fact, clamping down on those extant tokens will surely cause millions of small American investors to lose money, which could be another possible pain point for the SEC. I can imagine the SEC is wondering how to strike a reasonable balance.  https://medium.com/@pullnews/updated-pillar-wallet-road-map-52293065dcae",False

They came from Russia, Holland, California, and Philadelphia. I had no idea how well a team of strangers would work together, but we did the whole thing family style - everyone stayed in one big flat in Brooklyn, and we jammed all day long, sharing meals and really getting into the work, from breakfast until late at night. We’re all aware that we’re designing an operating system that, for now, looks like a wallet. We will share a video update of the experience soon.   The ICO Wallet At last week’s awesome Pillar MeetUp in Haarlem, Mike Boutwell (or as YouTube knows him, Mike B.) sat down to discuss the ICO Wallet with Tomer Sofinzon, Pillar Project Co-Founder.

Yes, the rumors are true (plus I mentioned it in the road map), we’re working on an ICO for 20|30. Recall that the Pillar project was a 20|30 project but has now spun out to be its own nonprofit foundation. That leaves 20|30 with no money to create the projects that will go hand in hand with the Pillar wallet. 20|30 has re-launched a new website at www.2030.io and its mission is to create a broad portfolio of blockchain-based projects. In addition to owning ten percent of all Pillar tokens, we are working on creating a special exchange for accredited investors only, and we’re planning to launch several security tokens next year. Then we’ll work on helping startups launch equity-token crowd sales on our platform and help get hundreds of startups get properly funded. We’re breaking new ground, working with regulators, and ultimately changing markets by tokenizing investments and making them available to more people. You can help! We are looking for accredited/sophisticated investors. The definition of accredited varies in different countries, check here https://pillarproject.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0056162978ccced9e0e2e2939&id=a98fc8f7ea&e=e6ec2eae28. If you’re an accredited investor, or if you know one, please contact us to help get the word out about our upcoming ICO. We want a lot of people to participate in our equity offering, so we can hire more amazing people and keep building the products and services that will change the world. If you think you are accredited or you know an accredited investor, please contact accredited@2030.io to learn more about what we’re planning. If you know any journalists who cover fintech, please have them do the same. We will be sending out further communications regarding the process of accredited investment.

You had many questions after our previous newsletter - we probably answered most of them in two recent updates on YouTube. And there's even more!   Tomer Answers Questions Tomer is a founder of both the Pillar Project and 20|30. He took to YouTube last week to answer questions coming in about the upcoming 20|30 ICO.   Watch Tomer's Update https://pillarproject.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0056162978ccced9e0e2e2939&id=847fc0b545&e=e6ec2eae28  David Answers Questions I understand that people are confused about the difference between 20|30 and Pillar, so I want to keep communicating about that. 20|30 is a for-profit company that will build a portfolio of different blockchain projects. We started early in 2017 with the CryptX index, we got interrupted to do the Pillar Project, and now we’re building for-profit products and services on the Pillar platform. So 20|30 is the first of many companies that will use the Pillar ecosystem to make money. You can start one, too.  It’s important to understand that …  •   20|30 supported Pillar, but now 20|30 receives no money from Pillar. All ether raised during the Pillar ICO is dedicated to building the Pillar ecosystem. •   Pillar was always supposed to be a non-profit foundation, and we are executing that. Some people think this will make their tokens less valuable, but that’s not true. Ethereum is a foundation. DASH is a foundation. NEO is a foundation. Filecoin is a foundation. The vast majority of blockchain token projects are open source, which means they give their software away for free and hope everyone uses it, making the token more valuable to early buyers. •   We hope you will actually use the tokens in your Pillar wallet. If you have any extra tokens you don’t use, we hope they will become more valuable, they may incidentally give you a good return, but that is not our mission. It’s our job to make the Pillar ecosystem incredibly useful and become the next-generation operating system for all future devices. If we do that, many people will want to buy Pillar tokens to power their devices and get more from them. As the system becomes more useful, your tokens become more valuable as a byproduct. This has been clearly stated many times and is in the Gray Paper. •   20|30 will be the gatekeeper for the Pillar ICO wallet. If we open the Pillar ICO wallet to anyone, it would be full of scam ICOs, so 20|30 will put together a program to vet and onboard ICOs. Once that’s working, we are happy to give a license to other trusted companies to do the same thing. We don’t want to prevent legitimate ICOs from using our wallet. •   To eat our own dog food, 20|30 will be the very first ICO on the Pillar ICO wallet. I wouldn’t want anyone to use a wallet we haven’t tested enough to be confident to put our own fundraise on, so we’re going to do just that. •   The 20|30 ICO will be for equity tokens, which by law cannot be sold to the public. They can only be sold to accredited (wealthy) investors. This is not our choice, this is the law. We would violate securities laws if we sold equity tokens to the public (and some companies have done that - we’re not going to). •   Remember that with the money we get from the 20|30 fundraise, we will invest to increase the value of the Pillar platform by building services that charge Pillar tokens. You may not participate in the 20|30 fundraise, but if you’re a Pillar token holder, you’ll benefit from it. We appreciate your support.

The Pillar Wallet Designathon We had a fantastic time in New York, where we came together, bonded, and the team did amazing work. We had Drew and Franky from Los Angeles (design contest winners #1), Dmitry from St Petersburg on crutches (contest winner #2), and Eli (runner up) as well as Thais and Shashi from Amsterdam. Thais did a cool wrap video, we shot it from the roof of the place where everyone stayed.

Many people will be getting ready for Thanksgiving, but I hope you’ll take the time to watch. I’ll give a short update on the project, and then take questions from an early Pillar tokenholder, Vic Patane, who has been watching Pillar from his perspective in New Jersey. He’s asked me several questions by email, so I invited him to talk with me live on YouTube.  About Vic: Vic has over 35 years of financial industry experience.  A self-taught student of blockchain who participated in one of his first ICO’s at 3AM on a Sunday morning, when he managed to get some Pillar tokens. Vic’s goal is to learn a little more each day while working to empower those around him.

Design Competition Winners The contest had 19 submissions, and it really fulfilled the goal of people coming together, working on their designs, collaborating, thinking, and contributing to our group exploration of wallet design space. My goal in launching the contest was not to find a perfect design candidate and then “go forward” with it to become the Pillar wallet interface. My goal was to bring out talent and collaboration. Even though people may have felt like they were competing, I hope they will realize now that we’re all one big family and can draw on many inspirations, talents, and skills to create the ultimate Pillar user experience. I plan to take it forward with a design workshop in the next month or two.  There were many good efforts. I want to express my appreciation to all who participated. I hope they found the exercise fulfilling in itself. A few stood out. They deserve our community recognition. I have singled out seven entries to present to the community. One is a special “honorable mention” winner because it was a good new idea. Three were worthy of mention as a group and were rewarded with tokens. And there were a “top three” that earned prize money. No single design got the 50 ether “first place” award, but as you’ll see, the top three were well executed, had testing built in, and there was good thinking about scalability. Moreover, I felt they explored their corner of design space well. Please come watch the 20-minute video I made disclosing the winners.

If you have particular expertise in one of these areas, we would like to ask for your help. We’re willing to pay certain experts on retainer to help us connect to the developments and events in their world. Each of these groups has a channel in our online community. •   GDPR - we are actively looking for experts on GDPR, not only in Europe but also in North America. •   Identity - we have engaged Kaliya Hamlin (USA) and Alan Sherriff (UK) to help us be prepared with digital identity issues. Please come learn from and work with them in the identity channel. •   Data security - we’re looking for security experts. Are you interested in security? If so, come join our working group. We have a call coming up on October 12th. •   Exchange - I’d like to ask people interested in exchanges to read this excellent summary of decentralized exchange protocols by Fred Ehrsam. At Pillar, we want to help create a worldwide order book and some kind of smart matching capability, probably using the Ox protocol. Josh Fairhead will be heading up this grou. •   Messaging - we believe our first wallet will have a strong social aspect (this hasn’t been decided for sure, so consider it a rumor). We want to put together a messaging group to plan a messaging service. This will be a for-profit service, and we are happy to engage people who want to start this on the side. This group needs a leader or leaders. •   Chat bots - I expect that within 18 months our wallet will have an integrated chat bot. Michael Shea will head up this research and discussion group. •   Nigeria working group - we are planning our first big developer conference in Lagos, Nigeria, for next spring. We want to interact with and support the local community in “leaping forward” using blockchain technology and, we hope, the Pillar wallet. We want to engage with academics, entrepreneurs, business, and government people to create a lasting, meaningful, and productive relationship with the people of Nigeria (and Cameroun). Can you help?   Come to the London Meetups! We have two meetups coming soon: First, we have a high-energy meetup with the N.O.M.A.N. group in London, on October 10th, after work. Come meet the Pillaristas and learn about Etch, their token-based system for managing payroll.   Join us on October 10th! http://pillarproject.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0056162978ccced9e0e2e2939&id=51137d56cd&e=e6ec2eae28  Second, we are meeting with anyone interested in planning our Nigeria unconference and hackathon next spring. This is a planning meeting in London, to reach out to those who can help us work with people in academia, start-ups, the business community, and government to bring new levels of blockchain collaboration and innovation. Please join us on Wednesday, October 11th, from 5:30pm at All Bar One in Shoreditch! Sign up and tell your friends!  More soon, David Siegel and The Pillar Team info@pillarproject.io",False

(Communication is key and we are seeing plenty of it)  Join The Conversation on Twitter If you’re on Twitter, don’t forget to follow us: I’m @pullnews. The Pillar project is @pillarwallet. If you are in our twitter community, you might have seen this tweet last week:                  Replying to @PillarWallet @ThinkRiseLDN                 I heard Vitor (Steve Jobs of Crypto)                 left IBM and is now full time, true?                 11:12am . 3 Oct 2017 . Twitter for IPad   Yes, Vitor is winding down his time at IBM and joining us full time. Is Vitor the ""Steve Jobs of Crypto""? He's certainly brilliant, and luckily, much less volatile and much easier to work with!  Needless to say, Twitter is a rich source of both rumors and rich conversations. We do our best to clarify the rumors and, engage in generative conversations and respond to our followers. We encourage you to join us on twitter for some fresh content and daily updates. We are also on Facebook (much to some members of our team's chagrin).   Staff Highlight Vitor is our CTO and one of the geniuses on our development team. Vitor was bored at work and looking for something challenging to sink his teeth into. He had connected with me via LinkedIn a long time ago, and in 2016 Vitor accepted my invitation to the 20|30 Slack channel. He had already volunteered to help the EtheRisc team with their white paper, which I had read and admired. Vitor agreed to do some work on the CryptX index. After a few months of heavy lifting as a volunteer, and as Pillar got closer to its ICO, I asked Vitor to become a 2030 founder and lead Pillar's development efforts.  Vitor is a senior software developer with 10 years of experience in a wide variety of domains. He loves this profession and a while back became fascinated with Blockchain. Vitor, after being turned away by Google and Facebook deep into the interviewing process (a BIG loss for them!), has been a contractor for IBM, and will be wrapping up his contract with them in the coming weeks. Vitor lives in Rio, Brazil, and after some “convincing,” he has agreed to relocate to London. This is HUGE for us, because as you know I believe in the concept of decentralization but I also believe strongly that people developing new products do best to work in the same room together. Our entire team is looking forward to working side-by-side with Vitor in our new office. Most of us will arrive in the office by the end of this year, ending the remote collaboration that began back in January. We accomplished so much remotely and made many mistakes too. Working in the same space is going to greatly increase our efficiency. We look forward to helping all our new London arrivals like Vitor and their families get settled.   Next In Tech Last week I spoke at the ""Next in Tech"" conference in Wandsworth. It was a great event and an incredible opportunity to connect with other innovators in the blockchain community.

One way we want to give back is to help people plan and execute better ICOs. So I’ve decided to launch The ICO Show, to help people figure out their ICO strategy and to give planned ICOs a chance to answer the hard questions. If you’re thinking about launching an ICO, I’d love to discuss that with you. And if you have an interesting ICO coming up, please tell us about it. We already have a great group of volunteers (Ash, Will, Andy, Arick, Tony - anyone else want to join us?) and we’re setting up an exciting lineup of shows starting this Tuesday, October 17th.  THE ICO SHOW With David Siegel Live every Tuesday 5-6pm UK Time http://theicoshow.net  The show will get better and better each week. Let us know how we’re doing.

Trust me, I’m as eager to see the Pillar tokens listed on an exchange as you are. We are “in process” with the large exchanges. They are taking their time onboarding new tokens, and they are being very picky about which tokens they take. I can’t promise anything yet, but I will tell you about an exchange listing as soon as we have it.   The Pillar Wallet Road Map Today we announce our Pillar Wallet Road Map. It’s not set in stone, but it will tell you what we’re working on and why. The article lists four wallets. Our goal is to release the first two in the next six months and the other two as soon as they are ready. There’s plenty of information here. Please spend ten minutes reading our ...

Development skills in particular. We are thrilled about this influx of talent and want to harness the energy and support. So, on Monday at 3pm UTC, Vitor and Partha will be hosting an open meeting for potential new developers. In this meeting we will identify ways for volunteers to help develop the wallet and begin their journey, if interested, towards getting hired. Of course, any back-end and front-end coders interested in working with us should see our jobs page https://pillarproject.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0056162978ccced9e0e2e2939&id=568609e520&e=e6ec2eae28, but this is a chance to interact with two of our stars.

Our goal is to build the entire 1.0 wallet interface in three days! It will be fast and furious, with pizza thrown in to sustain us. There will be three people coming from Europe, three from the West Coast, and two from the East Coast. If you’re an experienced designer and want to join us, please contact me directly. We are doing everything we can do go quickly and start shipping wallets people can use.   One of the first Pillar ICOs Our friends at Etch are having an ICO to create payment systems for people doing hourly work. It’s one of the first systems that has declared their intention to work with the Pillar wallet. They came to Poprad, Slovakia, to be part of the Pillar family. I’m an advisor. As always, remember that all ICO tokens have the chance to go to zero. Portfolio exposure is more important than risk. See my webinar https://pillarproject.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0056162978ccced9e0e2e2939&id=7b75855fd2&e=e6ec2eae28 on postmodern portfolio theory for more.

If you read my previous post, I broke it down to what you're saying. That was the case/true when it sold 45/50 when Eth was just a tiny bit below the same fiat ratio (read my post), however, PLR sold way below fiat/ETH over time and many people panic sold and made losses to jump on other coins. So no, the wisest thing to do was to buy ETH low, hold and buy 17/50 PLR, understand? I was lucky, have the will power to stay up all night and know how to trade and made a profit, thank god. I don't expect a much larger pump, in fact, I think the price is gonna drop, especially when they inflated another 60m (12%) in to the market out coulance due to ""hacking"" without any proof. I've researched and followed over 150 hours in this project and team and trackrecord of ceo - how do you know if it was a hack. Saying is easy, but I want to see proof. It can also be injected from team to sell soon.  Like I said, watch interview with ceo on youtube with jsnip4 and you understand. Many people are so pissed off having participated. Government control over their wallet to immediately tax, rfid implants in wrists, etc. NO THANKS! This is the opposite of decentralization and freedom (to choose). Also, no final product for years.

And no, I'm not the only one. Maybe watch the Reddit threads as well and have a tab opened on ED and watched the plr price to drop with huge low ball offering sell walls... The numbers speak for themselves.  I've put significant money in to this ico, only based on Clif High's report on the last 10 minutes before your ico closed and had only time to do my DD/FA for 20 minutes, which looked promising and was cheering for you, also in this thread. Then when ico was finished, you've did a live stream which I anticipated and ceo wasn't happy about the low eth contribution and avg/person and other people in chat were shocked which spreaded all on Reddit, which I was silent on. Then the interview came with jsnip4 about the vision of implementation regarding government cooperation and rfid implants and this was reason for me to bail out during the pump.

The change you are talking about is Marketcap, not Marktet Volume. Do you understand what the term ""maketcap"" means? Roughly: value of 1 coin * total number of coins. Because PLR previously not listed on any exchange, and at some point was only listed on EtherDelta and HitBTC, only with a very low volume, any trade would have huge influence of the marketcap. If there are 0 trades on either exchange, and assume one person sells 1 PLR token for 2x or 3x its previous value, you would get that spike you talk about. For any token which is only at very low volume on the market, you get this behavior. Look at coinmarketcap, there has not been a major release op PLR into the markets   I've put significant money in to this ico, only based on Clif High's report on the last 10 minutes before your ico closed and had only time to do my DD/FA for 20 minutes  So, you are saying you didn't do your homework, and despite of that, still jumped, based on a comment of someone else, and are now disappointed with the results of your jump? That is completely your fault man. But have been looking into Pillar from early days, and for me there are now surprises and no disappointments. They have always been very clear and transparent on their actions and plans. Sure they learn along the way and may adjust accordingly. And sure they may have made some small mistakes along the way. But in general, they did a great job, stayed true to their vision and have been perfectly clear on every step.   Oot to even mention he didn't care about the price of PLR  This is not true. And you are missing maybe the most important point stressed by Pillar and David almost every day: Pillar will be designing the proposed Wallet after the ICO. So, this ICO, or Pillar in general is not for the traders, not for the short term people. Pillar is for the long run, for the investors / keepers. Do not mix investors with traders, because they could be quite the opposite. Everyone which was playing the short-term spike to make a quick profit from a token flip was bound to be disappointed. Ans Pillar and David stressed this point many time. Starting price (or early price) of the Pillar token is irrelevant, because the road ahead is not the short term road you may have been looking for. You jumped on the wrong train man, you jumped the investors train, not the traders train.   I don't spread bullshit around, I'm an objectivist and look from both sides to come up with my own conclusions. Something to learn from, maybe. Yes you do! Because of all of the above, you are spreading BS! You are not an objectivist, you mistake your own view of the world to be a fact instead of being subjective. Your conclusions are not a fact, they are the result of the way you see things. Your are downplaying a great project, because you did not do your homework, and because you don't get your facts straight. You were looking for a short term payout, but choose a long term project. That is reality, not BS.   opened up the market for US citizens while doing the live stream, because apparently, one was not happy about the raised money... They have been perfectly clear on this change, and for me personally, I don't have any problem with them opening up to US, I was more bothered with the fact they did not do this much more early (although I completely understand the reasons). You pick one event, and give your negative subjective spin on it, and this way you maybe can even pick more events and occurrences to give a negative remark about (and an ""I told you so"" answer), but they simply made a decision which might not be your decision, and all the dark reasons behind it which are in your head, could simply be not true and non-existing.   I'm totally shocked to hear a response from an official to imply to CENSOR anything that might hurt them, when those are LEGITIMATE questions and observations. Objectivism != emotions or your feelings.  I think they are totally right to put a stop to yours BS! ""Objectivism != emotions or your feelings"" is something that applies a lot more to you than to Pillar. Live by your ow rules!",False

The old thread was locked for Bounty rules violations. This thread is MODERATED so bounty posts can be deleted, so we can avoid having this thread locked too. You can view the original thread here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1986401.0   PILLAR PROJECT  For those who want the details, please read the Pillar Gray Paper. Here is a short version:  The European Commission’s Fire Study of Next Generation Internet recently concluded that ...      1. Internet should ensure citizens' sovereignty over their own data and protect privacy;      2. Internet should ensure diversity, pluralism and a right to choose; and      3. Internet should avoid the concentration of data in a few proprietary platforms.      4. Personal Data Spaces was seen as a very important technology area for all the above top ranked values.  These are the problems the Pillar project will address. We want to give people a better, safer dashboard to their digital world, starting with an open-source wallet. We have two main objectives:  Replace accounts with atomic ownership. We all have dozens of accounts. With accounts, you log in and all your valuable data is trapped inside the app or the service. This presents huge concentration risk. By switching from accounts to wallets, each person owns his/her own assets and can switch vendors freely.  Replace apps with services. Apps on our phones are miniature desktop apps. This harkens back to the days of paper-based processes, showing once again that humans always adopt the old ways of working to new technology. Now that we all have superconnected computers in our pockets, we believe the personal data locker will replace iOS and Android to become the operating system for all your devices.  The decentralization movement and technologies like blockchain will lead to a fundamental reversal of power, putting people in control of their digital lives.      The Pillar Wallet  Having waited patiently for 15 years, we believe the moment is here now. We will start by building the world’s best cryptocurrency and token wallet. We will focus on the user experience - to make it as easy as possible to set up and use a wallet. There are a few excellent wallets - we have our work cut out for us. But since our target is to build a dashboard for your digital life, our wallet will be different. Our wallet will be mobile first. It will include a browser, and we hope to include one or more exchanges. We want the experience to be as easy as possible. We’ll be targeting specific use cases and personas and working to make their experience as familiar and powerful as possible. Almost everyone is a beginner. Almost everyone finds managing private keys challenging. Almost everyone doesn’t appreciate the complexity behind wallets and exchanges and smart contracts. This is our mission - to simplify, build a strong foundation, and keep adding what our customers want next.   The Pillar Ecosystem  Pillar is far more than a wallet, a browser, and an exchange. Pillar brings to life the concepts in David Siegel’s book, Pull. As David explains, apps are a huge waste of resources and prevent innovation. Apps have to be maintained on half a dozen platforms - more than 50% of every app is just infrastructure related to presenting content and offers. What really matters are content, connections, and commerce, and being able to mix them as you like. The Pillar wallet will let you sort, filter, compare, mix, and match these things to suit your needs. This represents the convergence of the semantic web and the web of value.  As an example, think of attending a conference in a city far away. To do this on your phone you’ll need a dozen apps that don’t talk to each other, and you’ll sign contracts for air, rail, car, hotel, tours, shows, excursions, currency exchange, babysitting, restaurants, conference registration, scheduling, events, meetings, and more. At best, each of these has its own app, and probably its own reward point system. Now try to manage all the expenses and record keeping - more apps. Do the apps talk to each other? In general, they don’t.  The pillar ecosystem will create a new ecosystem of data, content, and commerce. We’re almost there - we have the standards, formats, and APIs to do much of what we want. It’s our job to bring these together to create a customer experience that is many times more compelling than using apps. In general, you’ll ask a question or say what you’re looking for, and the content, data, and transactions will come to you. We believe the wallet will be the center of your digital life, and it will pull everything you want when you want it, in a way that's more natural than apps.   The Personal Data Locker  The concept of the personal data locker comes from David's book, Pull. We have seen many such projects come and go. Much of it comes down to trust - people don’t trust institutions, advertisers, or third parties to manage their data. This is why Microsoft and Google projects have failed.  We understand that consumers don’t want to manage their own data. There’s a detailed section of the gray paper that goes into consumer reluctance and how to find our early adopters. Right now, we have a chance - to create the world’s best wallet, integrate it into many systems, and let it lead to the personal assistant that “magically” helps you manage your life. See this early video from 2010 that shows the use cases for the project:   The Pillar Token  While the wallet and platform are open-source and free, users will pay for the various PDL services with pillar tokens as they use them. The token will power (provide micropayments for) the entire ecosystem, giving an instant business model to many projects that can tie in. This is the beauty of the token: you may need a service exactly once and you won’t need to sign up for it, you’ll just pay for it with a Pillar token and you’re done.  Here’s an example: you go see your doctor, she does some tests and gives you a prescription for some pills. All the data from that visit, and the prescription, will be copied to your wallet. You can then manage the prescription any way you like, including asking for bids from pharmacies for the lowest price, or fastest delivery, etc. In this case, pharmacies compete for your order, and their software can be aware what the bid/ask is, and they may give you special offers to choose their service or even pay you to watch an ad for a particular drug. This is all under your control - you decide how you want it, and you pay a small number of pillars each time you use the system for storing your records and letting you manage your relationship with the health-care system. Your data can even go to a study being done - with your permission - and even though you’re anonymous in the study, if they want to send you a message, you’ll have a choice of receiving it or not.  The pillar is a meta-token. For example, Brave has a native token for seeing customized ads and monetizing your browsing experience. Augur has a token for betting. Akasha has one for messaging. You'll encounter dozens or hundreds of tokens as you go about your day. All these tokens will be native in our system one level below the Pillar token. Users may only ever see pillars, or they may see the various utility tokens for the services they use.    The Pillar token sale starts on July 15th at 08:00 Greenwich Mean Time and ends 60 hours later on July 17th at 20:00 GMT. Of the 800 million tokens issued, 560 million  will be for sale to the public. The price in ether will be the same throughout the sale and will be announced on July 14th.  Our Token sale smart contract is available on both Ropsten and Kovan testnets.

Execution Plan  We are market driven. We do experiments and look for opportunities. We pattern our company on Google (except for the interviewing part) - we plan to make a lot of small mistakes and let experiments take us into new markets. The wallet market is heating up. We need the resources to go after several different market segments:     * Crypto-enthusiasts     * Early-adopter tech enthusiasts     * Partners     * OEMs  We are already strong in business development and will get stronger. Eventually, we want our wallet not to be another app on your phone, but to be the software that runs your phone. We will need partners, industry veterans, strong marketers, excellent communications team, and more.  And we’ll need a great product. We are starting from scratch. We’re planning to hire in August and September, and we want you to be part of it. People who understand our mission and support us by buying our tokens, even if only a few, are the people we want to hire. We already have a strong team of technology people, but we’ll need many more. We expect to start in London and open a second office within six months.  We are very open. We know that people coming to our web site are excellent potential hires, consultants, and partners. Be sure to sign up for our newsletter - we'll soon set up our online community and invite you to join us. And please consider coming to our hiring event in Slovakia.  We have laid out our financial plans and forecasts in the Gray Paper. Everything we do will be agile and responsive to our markets as they change. We also will use some of our proceeds to support projects that will later become part of our system.   After the Token sale, we will have a grass-roots unconference at AquaCity in Poprad, Slovakia, to socialize, learn, teach, plan, and hire. Anyone who comes to Poprad in early August is probably a person we want to hire. Every morning, we will have blockchain learning and Pillar planning sessions.
