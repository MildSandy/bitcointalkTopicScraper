ProximaX is an advanced extension of the Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) with utility-rich services and protocols. With a NEM.io inspired blockchain layer at its core, a decentralized storage layer through IPFS, and a P2P multimedia streaming and messaging layer powered by PeerStream Protocol (PSP), ProximaX will enable a rich, all-in-one platform for broader cross-industry application and decentralized app development.   Important Links  Website White paper FAQ Team Telegram Intro video    Social Media  Twitter Facebook Reddit Medium Youtube    Features  BLOCKCHAIN    ProximaX leverages NEM technology to provide private and public blockchain, enabling anyone to join and participate in the network. An incentivization mechanism will be implemented to encourage more users to join and participate in the network.  STORAGE    ProximaX is a storage solution based on InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a Distributed File Management System (DFMS) protocol. Essentially, it is a decentralized storage network using a peer-to-peer distributed architecture that frees up users from the influence of any third-party storage provider.  STREAMING    ProximaX will utilize PeerStream Protocol (PSP) to be provided by PeerStream, Inc. The protocol will provide node privacy in P2P messaging, online presence, routing and real-time streaming protocol designed for secured off-chain communication channels between crypto identities.  CONSENSUS    ProximaX will use multi-layered consensus protocols for voting, governance, harvesting and to reward network nodes for contributing storage and bandwidth resources on the network. ProximaX nodes, DApp developers, and content creators will be rewarded in XPX tokens based on their various business models on the platform.  To maintain its integrity and value, ProximaX steps up the game from traditional blockchain and introduces concurrent advanced and complex consensus algorithms with a combination of 1) Proof of Importance (PoI), perfected by NEM; 2) Proof of Storage (PoSt),  for measuring allocation of distrbuted disk space, and; 3) Proof of Bandwidth (PoB), a costly and more precious commodity in delivery of data and streaming media â€“ in a side chain. Bandwidth measurement is rarely factored into mainstream blockchain projects as a reward metric to the node workforce. ProximaX is changing that.

I should say the appetite has not been that great for ICOs. Having said that, ICOs are beginning to be tough to launch in many jurisdictions. This project is among those exceptions in that we are offering a utility token. Another tough problem is that KYC is become even more stringent. This has dampened the landscape somewhat as well. So, it is a double whammy.  But we are confident that we should be able to raise a substantial amount as evident from our private sale. In any case, I am confident this is one project that will kick off. It also has an MVP as well. No vaporware here.     ",False

Plus the name.. not very catchy. I had a NEM stake and am grateful for the money I made but the environment has changed so much.. with 4 billion coins or 44% of the coins locked up for use in other areas, why should I invest in yet another money grab? If NEM's code was good it should stand on it's own and not require more funding.  All over the crypto space I see new coins, ICOs, lots of promises for a lot of the same features, but then the original coins are often forgotten and it seems like people just want to make a quick buck. I'm skeptical on this ICO as I am probably 99% of altcoins out there today. I'll give you credit for having names behind the development. All these coins make all these claims but almost none of them are actually being used for the features they have, except perhaps Ethereum and a few others.  I've turned very skeptical on this space in general and mostly invest to daytrade now. Blockchain is great tech but I don't believe most coins trading today will be around in 5-10 years... this whole space has become a big pyramid scheme.   Plus nothing that is open source has inherit value.. the value is in patenting the technology, keeping is closed source, and marketing it, and the few coins who claim to do this I'm convinced are scams (xtrabytes, unfortunately as I'm still invested in it). I admit I'm a bit out of the loop on new offerings though.  Oh and I can remove this deeponion signature... one bleeping week of not having a stupid post on their forums and being denied my onion was enough for me.",False
