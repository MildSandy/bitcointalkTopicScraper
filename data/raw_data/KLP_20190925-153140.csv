We intend to combine economic initiative with reputation into one by tokenizing reputation and assigning it a value. Thus, all parties, moderators included (if need be), have a common goal to act honestly since, since they all have a common interest — which is to exchange services and monies.  We will completely revolutionize the current digital marketplace by developing our Koilop model ecosystem with a full integration of the blockchain technology.
