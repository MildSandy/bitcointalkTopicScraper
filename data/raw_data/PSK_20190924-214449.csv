For this purpose, two tokens are used:     PSK – an ERC-20 based token that gives discounts and rewards withdrawal fees.     KEY – acknowledges the user’s initial investment. PSK is their utility token, its sold during the ICO, and it enables users to get discounts on withdrawal fees. These discounts are nothing to sneeze at, and will add up to tons of savings for anyone staking to a pool. PSK is traded freely in the markets and can be stored in any ERC-20 wallet. KEY tokens cannot be traded. They are simply a way of declaring initial PoS coin ownership. Users can buy their PoS coins such as Qtum, Stratis or Ether in their preferred exchanges. Then they transfer their PoS coins into the Pool of Stake full node and via a Smart Contract, they get back a KEY token. The total amount of PSK tokens on the market will be 70 Million, of which 42.8 will be sold during the ICO.  Distribution is as follows:     9% Taxes/ finances/ Legal     20% Security and tech development     42% Marketing/social media     30% Office and management If the hard cap is not reached during the ICO, the number of tokens (circulating and non-circulating) will be distributed accordingly. The idea is to achieve a fair relationship between the donors, the developers, the advisors and the three founders. As such, the total amount will be divided according to the current percentage.  Team Located in Lugano, Switzerland, Proof of Stake has three founders:     Dario Calderoni (Head of Operations): He has 15 years of experience in logistics managing.     Andrea Balzini (CTO): Network engineer since 2015 for a Sirti S.p.A, Italy’s leading technology company in the design and production of network infrastructures and telecoms system integration. It was founded in 1921.     Davide Luigi Borella (CEO): The current CIO of Maveric. He’s been a coordinator or consultant for numerous companies over the last 20 years including eight years with HQ Engineering. There are nine additional team members and advisors listed, including:     Barotsz Navara – A branding and marketing specialist. Founder & CEO at navarra.is GmbH/Co-Founder at VAUST Studio GmbH/Co-Founder & CEO at Codete GmbH/     Patrick Lowry (Advisor) Co-Founder of Node – a revolutionary high-tech start-up, which disrupts a market niche of wireless transmission devices for both private and commercial use.     Ciprian Filip (Advisor) – Spent eight years at IBM Former IBM. Currently CEO of Fundshing.com, a VC supporting blockchain company launch and manage ICO campaigns.  Verdict This is the most straightforward value proposition I’ve come across as a reviewer. The Pool Of Stake team is raising $8 million to develop and scale a giant decentralized PoS pool. In the future, the team will take a 10% fee from every stakers’ rewards, unless that staker possesses PSK tokens, in which case they will receive discounts on said fee. The team and advisors have set a realistic goal, and from what is seen so far and appear to be capable and hard-working enough to get it done. Participating in this ICO is for those who have lots of PoS tokens they wish to stake and earn passive income. The PSK token is strictly for discounts on fees and voting.  Risks     Regulations are always a risk with crypto pooling operations. -2     The PSK token is strictly for discounts on fees and voting. There will most likely be very little price speculation, which eliminates that cushion that keeps most cryptos from falling. -1     The voting system they are working on to decentralize the platform seems like it could get complicated. The crypto community is very impatient. If POS makes a few mistakes in the beginning, it could be a disaster. 1  Growth Potential     They already have an MVP that stakes QTUM. +2     Based on future projections, POS expects to reach the break-even point in Q3 of 2020. They expect to have a community growth of 40% every quarter. +2     They want to be set up by the time CAsper starts. Some of the other blockchains they are interested in are: Boscoin, Tezos, Cardano, Lisk, Universa, and EOS.+2     They put out informative blog articles on a regular basis. +1     They are partnered with Maveric, a company that provides startups with the tools and expertise to launch their token ICOs. +2     Then there’s this crtiical piece of information: “Based on future projections and current calculations, we expect to reach the break-even point (BEP) in 2020-Q3. Of course, this outcome may vary, depending on market fluctuations and other events outside our influence. To the best of our ability we have developed a realistic future projection, which is also in line with the future projections of other Swiss blockchain companies. In the initial phase, tech developments and security will be very important. The budget for tech development will decrease over time. Nonetheless, we are working with a team of the best developers in order to stay flexible for changes in the blockchain ecosystem. Marketing is an important step in our plan, with a community target growth of 40% every quarter” +2  Disposition Passive income in crypto is really cool. Genesis Mining is a PoW cloud mining service for the everyman to purchase BTC hashing power. They have over 2 million users. With PoS being the next PoW, and Pool Of Stake being the front-runner for PoS staking pools, this seems like a no-brainer. And there doesn’t seem to be any red flags with regards to the team or idea. 7/10  Investment Details     Symbol: PSK     Platform: Ethereum     Public Presale: 18 June – 20 July (35% token bonus)     Crowdsale: July 20 -Aug 19th (or until hard cap is reached)     Hardcap: 8,000,000 E (8 m euro)     Total Supply: 70,000,000 PSK (70m)     Amount  for sale: 42,780,142 PSK     Github: https://github.com/poolofstake/PSK     Website: https://www.poolofstake.io/     Whitepaper: https://www.poolofstake.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/PoolofStake-whitepaper_ENG_V10_01.pdf     Telegram: https://telegram.me/poolofstake",False

Dear community,  We are Pool of Stake- a decentralized pool for staking your favourite Proof of Stake coins. We are true believers of Proof of Stake and we are convinced that it is the future of blockchain. Since we are addressing you, a holder of PoS coins, we suppose you are aware of the benefits of PoS over PoW. Proof of Work is experiencing fundamental limits and Proof of Stake is solving most of them. Proof of Stake makes a great contribution in terms of security, reduced risk of centralization and energy efficiency. This is also the reason why great projects like PIVX, Stratis, Qtum, and many more, use a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm.  Have you ever experienced problems with staking? Have you ever tried staking several PoS coins at the same time? We have experienced the troubles of going offline for just one second and losing coin age, not getting enough rewards due to a small network weight, and many other issues. We realized that individual staking is quite time consuming, research intense, and not very profitable.  Pool of Stake is your solution! With Pool of Stake we pool together our stakes and create greater forging rewards for the entire community. For this, we have created an innovative two-token system, the IOU and the PSK token. Thanks to the IOU token you always remain the owner of your coin and do not need to trust anybody. How come? Because Pool of Stake runs on smart contracts and is therefore truly decentralized. We make your staking more profitable, more secure and easier! On our platform, the smart i.o. database gives you advice on how to optimize your investments and improve your returns. This does not replace doing your own research but it makes performance assessment so much easier.  Decentralization lies at the heart of our project. The team of Pool of Stake is not governing or directing the community. Instead we want to give small coin holders the possibility to have a voice in the native blockchains where we operate. Therefore, we need to collaborate with the core development teams so that we can adopt our pool to the governance mechanisms of the native blockchains. This way Pool of Stake can truly be community-driven.  Have you been looking for a pooling solution for your favourite PoS coin? If yes, then vote for it on our Coin Community Vote! The first vote will take place from 21 June, 12:00 CEST until 18 July 18:00 CEST. Your vote decides which coin is going to be the next to be part of Pool of Stake. If you do not find your favorite PoS coin on the list- contact us and we will make sure that it gets on the list for the second Coin Community Vote!",False

Several studies have put in doubt if blockchain based projects are as decentralized as they presume to be. The centralizing effect of big Bitcoin mining operations is one of the cases that reinforce the idea of a lack of decentralization in cryptocurrencies. Here at Pool of Stake, we believe that one of the main factors that causes this unwanted centralization is the use of PoW algorithms to reach consensus. In the following text, we compare the level of centralization of validators in PoW and PoS blockchains by analyzing their geographical location. The PoW projects we analyze are Bitcoin and Ethereum and for PoS it is Stratis and PIVX. We describe each project briefly, and then mention where the biggest mining actors are concentrated for BTC and ETH, and where the network clients are located for PIVX and STRAT.
