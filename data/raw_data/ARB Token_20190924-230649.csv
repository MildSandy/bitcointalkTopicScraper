In a week from now, the bank will reveal the ARB partnership it has to create a stablecoin and also debit gift cards that we can use like proper debit cards with the visa logo all around the world. Due to the fact you need to hold some arbs in the vault to get one of these cards, I think many arbs will be put in the vault and supply will shrink, meaning there will be fewer arbs around for the dumpers to finally dump as they will be scooped up organically from demand for those using the tradepro console and for those getting the debit card.

Today we got a nice tank extra of FREE GAS to run our abots, which was a cute surprise. I posted about this in my abot diaries video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyiOFysDOD0&t=39s Also, we just got a big announcement come in that they are working out the kinks and tradepro shadow features, among others are being tested,. I believe tradepro shadow trading will be a huge asset to the platform as utilities grow for the ARB TOKEN.  Hi ARBNation,  Firstly, I would like to apologize for the lack of communication, I have been working hard and attending important meetings. The team here understands that times are tough and have not stopped working, nor has anyone ran for the hills . We still have one goal in our sights, get everything functioning and complete the advancement of use cases.  I have given all aBot users half tank free gas to give all of you some time while a solution is put in place to help improve the current gas structure. (As stated in the last stream)  Trade Pro: The Shadow feature is currently being beta tested. The Bot features are currently being beta tested. Beta testing has been going great we anticipate getting shadow features rolled out first, this will give a great new use case for ARB.  Debit Cards: Yes this is still happening, we are working hard to get this rolled out as soon as possible.  Fees: We will be working on restructuring the fees, we were asked by many to raise the fees, however we will restructure them to be more user friendly.  I would like to close this announcement by saying that the meetings I have been attending have been to help the future of the platform, we are not going away, we will keep working to advance.  I know that things have been up and down, but we will not give up on you.  Thanks, David",False

We have not taken the aBOT offline for any updates since its release and it is now time to give the backend some very important upgrades. During this offline time, we'll have the perfect opportunity to perform full internal audits. This process is very important for us to make sure that everything is accurate with each individual account and to ensure platform stability. We will go over all user aBOT's 1 by 1 and adjust them for any manipulations or over-inflations. If your account is adjusted during this audit, there will be a log in your history tab with all relevant information. ***Please note there will be no payments while the Audit is being performed, since aBOT needs to be taken completely offline during this process to properly install the upgrades. This process may take approximately 5 days, but after the completion of this audit we will be able to offer you a stop aBOT option. aBOT gas will also be made live after the annual audit is complete. At least 72 hours before aBOT becomes live again, we will announce and release all the aBOT gas information, provide guides and several ""how to videos"". I kindly ask you all to please be patient while we complete this very important process. We will do everything in our power to ensure everything is back to normal as soon as possible.

Personally, I would love to see some indicators on the chart, like bollinger bands, rsi, some fib lines etc, but maybe, later on, they might add those. Price has stabilized at around 5.5 USD for the token price for now and the Bollingers are pretty tight so you can only day trade for now with a very tight margin. I have found a nice rhythm now and I day trade some tokens daily and use that money to rebuy what I want for future bag growth, today bought a few more xlm and xrp and what I do now the money I take out daily from the aBot I put in TUSD so that I know when I need to take money home it's already got a dollar value. If I see BTC going up again I will toggle between TUSD and BTC. I set my aBot to 0% compounding now to get more tokens while the price is low so I can also keep at least one token a day for refilling the aBot in the next price increase. If all goes well, with a bit of day trading and the aBot payouts, I can reach BEP in less than 2 months and have like still all the abot tokens plus my loose tokens to play with, fingers crossed.   Here is the latest news: Hello,  Just sending you an update/recap.  While the crypto market plummets, we continue to thrive!  Late last week we hit a HUGE milestone crossing 50,000 users, and as of right now our user base is at 50,590!  We are growing at a rapid rate.  I know you are all anticipating a live stream and I promise one is coming shortly.  We some substantial new features that you are going to love.  These features are significant changes to the platform that will be rolled out in the next two weeks.  Before releasing them live on the platform, I want to ensure they are rock solid in testing which has delayed the live stream unveiling the first of several new innovative features being implemented.  *IMPORTANT NOTE* -  As we becoming one of the top CMC coins this invites a lot of scammers.  THE ONLY official channels on telegram are @ARBofficial and @Arbitragingsupport be very careful of anything else.  Also remember our official admins YOU have to initiate the chat.  No admin will message you first.  No admin will ever ask for your passwords or keys.  Again - I want to thank you all for the suggestions you have been sending in,  please keep them coming.

Of course, before investing in ANY cryptocurrency you should do your own research and due diligence. CRYPTO is a high-risk sector and not for the faint-hearted that's for sure. Don't though come in here and post baseless information without backing it with some proof, that is a waste of your intelligence and ours. ",False

ARBITRAGING has so far done good for me, so for me personally, I am getting paid regularly and am always looking at ways to reduce my risk, especially in a bear market. The aBot gives decent daily returns but again invest only funds you have spare, although I went in with a higher risk factor. I was lucky I bought the tokens at half the price so my aBot cost me 3k USD instead of 6k so it will be easier for me to get my capital back faster, so then my aBot will run on profits.

The automatic aBOT profit trading BOT is live and producing profits during our ICO Sale: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WQtrDQrN28  WHAT IS ARBITRAGING (ARB)? Please watch this short animated video to learn all about Arbitraging https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRt0ZBhFXXs  THE CORE OF ARBITRAGING - Long Term Stable Profits: A platform using advanced Arbitrage BOT software to produce long term profits. The BOT is producing profits now - Complete Control: A Smart Contract supported fully decentralised platform ensuring complete access - Complete Transparency: Trading BOT operating on the Blockchain, all activity recorded on Etherscan for all investors to see - No Investment Lock In: Investor funds are never locked in on the platform, all funds remain in external storage - Token Growth: Limited to a total supply of just 10 million, ARB value and market cap will inevitably grow - Sustainability: ARB will only pay profits when the BOT generates a profit making this a long term platform - Experience: A team of experienced developers with expert knowledge on Arbitrage trading  Profits For Everyone Most trading software BOTs are  very complicated to use, this mean less experienced investors make huge trading losses. Arbitraging.co has been developed for Crypto Traders regardless of their experience to ensure all investors can earn long term profits from trading.  TRADING SOFTWARE (aBOT & mBOT) AND DAILY PROFITS   aBOT Automatic BOT The automatic aBOT is currently completing BETA test during our ICO. We wanted to show investors our trading BOT software does exist and functions to produce profits of approximately 1% a day. aBOT will only make low risk and low % trades, this means you will NEVER MAKE A LOSS! Remember aBOT will only make a trade if it will make a profit!  If you invested $1000 in ARB you could make up to $300 a month! If you buy the ARB token during the ICO and wait for it to go up in value 4X, then you would only have to invest $250 now to make $300 every month in the future! You can watch the review of a YouTuber who is receiving profits from the aBOT BETA test: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LLvFHWXNGE. All daily profits produced are paid directly in to your wallet; this means the platform NEVER holds your funds.  mBOT Manual BOT Arbitraging also has a manual BOT known as mBOT. In contrast to aBOT, mBOT is designed to give the investor complete control of the trades and produce profits of 5% and more from a single trade. You can watch mBOT making live trades on the Blockchain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbz9748gwR4  150% Monthly Profit With mBOT If you used the mBOT to its full potential, you could earn up to 150% a month! Many platforms always quote unrealistic figures, but by taking control of the trades you could select trades with more risk and more profits!  How Does It Work? Investors can use the sliding bar to select the profit % they would like to make on each trade. mBOT will then analyse different exchanges and identify arbitraging opportunities that will produce the desired profit % and display them to the investor. The investor can then decide which trades he/she would like to execute. Once confirmed, mBOT will then buy the selected coin and sell it in another exchange at a higher price to produce a profit. Just like aBOT, all profits are paid directly to your external so you are IN CONTROL all the time.  COIN VALUE GROWTH With a total supply of only 10 million coins and successful trading software, the ARB coin is likely to appreciate to over $5 with ease. This means an investment made today of only $500 will grow to over $3,000.  SECURITY AND ACCESS TO FUNDS Arbitraging is 100% decentralised so you never deposit your money on the ARB platform – your investment will ALWAYS stay in a external wallet. Unlike most investment platforms, your funds are never Locked In – so you can withdraw your funds whenever you decide. This is perfect for investors who want 100% flexibility with their investment.  THE ARB TEAM Arbitraging is proud to present the team behind the platform on its web site www.arbitraging.co. In contrast to other platforms that hide their teams, transparency has always been very important for ARB and as a result the team is visible alongside their Bio’s and LinkedIn profiles.  MEDIA IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES  Whitepaper The white paper  has been translated in to 9 different languages to ensure all investors can learn about the ARB platform https://arbitraging.co/whitepapers.php?lang=en  Promotional Posters Alongside this ARB have made an extra effort to produce promotional posters and information videos which have voice over’s in 9 different languages.
