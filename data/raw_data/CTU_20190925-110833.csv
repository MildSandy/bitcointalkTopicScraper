On behalf of Contractium Team, I would like to make an announcement today, on Saturday 7th July 2018, that:  */ Contractium is organizing the ICO (Initial Coin Offering) event officially, starting with Private Sales for ICO-Investors as well as Cryptocurrency-Investors. /*  As you may know that, there were many scammers with ICOs, so we kept pending and pending our ICO event for several months to develop the MVPs (Minimum Viable Products) as planned. Finally, we were launching them with one closed-alpha-testing- & one alpha-testing application.  The 02 MVPs are:  1.The Smart-Contract-App https://mvp.contractium.io/ [close-alpha-testing-version] Help end-users deploy (commercial) smart contracts easily, securely, trustless to work together (ex. in the freelance industry) without technical knowledge & skills.  2.The Tokenize-App https://tokenize.contractium.io/ [alpha-testing-version] Help business-users deploy smart contract, issue tokens on Ethereum as well as on the other blockchains...  With the tokenize-application, we help everyone (who want to do cryptocurrency-related-business) issue their own tokens without technical knowledge & skills.  We, Contractium, bring the equal opportunities to everyone in this era of blockchain & cryptocurrency industry.  We, Contractium, have mission and vision to open the new gate of “privatization of money” when blockchain will take over the world of tokenize-economics in the near future.  I, personally, believe that the “privatization of money” with blockchain & cryptocurrency, will re-establish, reset & reform the world economy in the next 10 years.  To keep developing what we are developing, the applications, that help everyone issue tokenize-money, we need to organize this ICO event to raise funding.  And we need you, the cryptocurrency-investors as well as the ICO-investors.  Please find our details of ICO event on, https://contractium.io/ & https://ico.contractium.io/   Thank you & Best regards!
