MOOZICORE - World's 1st music streaming service on blockchain!,"Moozicore Holding Company Launches MooziCoin Gold (MZG) Token Sale As They Introduce Groundbreaking Platform That Will Change The Way Background Music Is Played In Venues  https://bitcoingarden.org/moozicore-holding-company-launches-moozicoin-gold-mzg-token-sale...  Moozicore Holding Company made international headlines this week with the launch of the Public Sale for the MooziCoin Gold ICO. The launch of the MZG Public Token Sale comes on the heels of a successful Pre-Sale phase where expectations were exceeded.  The Moozicore business model uses the MooziCoin to transform the way music is played in venues, whether it is a restaurant, bar, club or the local gym. Using MooziCoin, patrons can control the music being played by voting, adding songs, picking songs and sharing them to the venue’s playlist.  Most establishments rely on streaming services such as Tidal or Spotify to deliver background music to their venue, even though it is a violation of the law. Streaming services such as those are for personal use only and could result in fines or worse should a business get caught using them. Moozicore aims to solve this problem with their new streaming platform that is easy for businesses to adapt via a downloadable Mobile App.  The Moozicore App will be soon available on iOS and Android devices. Participants in the MooziCoin Gold ICO stand to make a great ROI because as businesses sign up, the value of the Coin will rise.  During a recent press event, the company spokesperson for Moozicore was quoted as saying, “We are a strong proponent of creators’ rights. When businesses use Spotify or Tidal, the songwriter or singer doesn’t receive anything in return. Moozicore believes that artists and songwriters deserve rightful compensation for their efforts. For any businesses using our service, obtaining performance licenses from the U.S. Performing Rights Organizations like ASCAP, BMI & SESAC is necessary.” He went on to say, “John McAfee has signed onto our project as ICO Advisor, which shows us that we have something very special here with Moozicore. A chance to transform the entire background music industry.”....",False

MOOZICORE - World's 1st music streaming service on blockchain!,"I am convinced that with the right marketing Moozicore can become very successful, it's one of the few projects that have a use case, that will indeed be demanded. But I have a few questions from the investors perspective:  1. As I understood, users will be able to buy the token in the App and on regular exchanges. Most participants of the ICO will buy the token because they expect it to rise in value, but how will the in-App price be determinded? Is it fixed or related to the price on exchanges in real time?  2.What are your thoughts about volatility and how users will deal with it? I think it wouldn't be a good user experience if you buy a stake of tokens in advance to use them in the future and then experiencing a decrease of value for example. Will users therefore use a fiat-gateway in real time for each time they vote for a song or have to buy tokens in advance as mentioned before?  3. You also mentioned that artists and songwriters who are featured on Moozicore will be rewarded, so do businesses which use Moozicore will have to pay a fee for it from that the artist will be paid or will they have a share in the tokens that will be used for voting?    Thanks for your article, which press event was this?",False

MOOZICORE - World's 1st music streaming service on blockchain!,"  Yeah and we got some big News coming up very soon regarding our Project.  1. The in-app price or the discount which is stated in the Ico is illustrative and based upon the lowest value of any item users can purchase within the app. If anything, the $0.05 price is a floor/base price - a starting position. MZG price is free to move on exchanges in line with supply and demand, just like any other coin/token. Still MZG used in app or send in-app can't be traded anymore and are out of Supply.  2. Its difficult to answer right now, but will mostly be answered with our upcoming Major Announcement, which benefits alot every Investor . So there is a Fiat Gateway where People can buy, using a Creditcard for example. Crypto is still not common and to Force people to get a Wallet, Exchange Account and stuff to use the App itself would be Fatal at this Time. In this case, give it max 1 Week for announcement to happen and we can discuss it further.   3. Its covered with our licensing which we also worked on the last 9 Months, to cover legally 20m+ Songs. I can't say thats impossible in the future that we reward artists or songwriters with MZG regarding our connection to them but at this Moment, its only about licensing.",False

MOOZICORE - World's 1st music streaming service on blockchain!,"   You know, I asked this EXACT same question to ""Alex,"" and I got the most bizarre ""answers"" (which were actually just goofy questions that seemed really evasive) I've ever received to a query of this nature. Well, that's not quite right, I was told to read the FAQ, which I did beforehand and didn't feel satisfied afterwards.    I understand that I might not ""get it,"" and that's fine, but Moozicore should be able to provide answers to such a simply conceptualized question. If someone wants to fill me in where Moozicore couldn't, I'd really appreciate it. Finally, I was told if I didn't like these ""answers,"" then I should talk to the CFO. ""What would compel someone to purchase early on on an exchange later"" should be a really simple question to answer without giving someone the runaround.  Update: Finally, the answer I got was ""there are still a lot of people who want to trade token in anticipation of eventual price rise. Many people who invest aren't interested in using the tokens in the app. They simply want to buy, hold and then sell for higher price...so and again, if you want deeper information about future regarding mzi. Hubert (CFO) is in the channel too."" But what will provide this rise?  But this should be something that the company has the vision to explain to me now, I would think. Forming partners where MZI would serve as a discount payment, but the answer to this was ""total supply will be less with locked mzi in the app...our idea is the b2b side with Moozicore, with the app."" To which I replied that there would have to be something compelling MZI to have value associated with it.  And, finally, the part of the answer that was ""that is your thinking of it.. i cant change that...why coins like cappasity rise? but no one uses the store / we cant just say, buy them on exchange to use it in the app. that would kill it."" Ok, so there's ""supply"" but no ""demand."" So, in other words, ""Alex"" admitted that just having tokens on an exchange without creating actual value, but also admits that Moozicore has absolutely nothing in place to provide this sense of value... Well, maybe the CFO has these answers, but I'm going to have to do my own detective work in that area, it appears.  So, as far as I can tell, with what ""Alex"" told me, is that there will be MZI in the float and that their value will increase because of their scarcity and nothing more. Moozicore ""can't say"" why someone would exchange these tokens, but, if, indeed, no further utility was created for them, they're headed for a ""kill.""  I left him with this: ""But your company should actually provide those pathways for value creation.. people aren't just going to use MZI for the sake of using them.. They'll use Ethereum or something of that sort. Ok, Alex, I've had enough.. creating value for your stakeholders should be a priority for your company, but you don't have  anything like that in place.""  I can only hope that ""Alex"" is just crappy at his job and that there is a plan to create value, but I'll either have to have some of you help me with that or I'll have to keep going with this detective work, myself.

If the coins can be purchased at $0.05 (or whatever) through the app, why would the tokens bought now increase in price to one higher than that if (IF I got that right!) IF all they can be used for is transferring them to the app and actually use them? Why should anyone pay let's say $1 for them on an exchange when he can buy them for $0.05 through the app?

MOOZICORE - World's 1st music streaming service on blockchain!,"   This is why I queried about the value proposition of the tokens outside of the app! If there is revenue share etc, it is possible. Ideally there should be two classes of tokens, one is MZI, whose value can keep on growing, and another is internal MZI (let's say iMZI), which is fixed at $0.05. Then there should be a conversion factor so that for 1 MZI, you can get X amount of iMZI. Otherwise, if there is a 1:1 conversion when you send MZI into the app, no one will ever send it if value of externally trading MZI is > $0.05, as it will lose value immediately. Moreover, this will create utter confusion.  I do not think all these have been thought through well. It better be clarified. Overall project idea is very good, but I see lot of lack in execution. It would be a shame if this fails. Please, hire better people who can execute it properly. You should take me asking questions positively and improve.",False
