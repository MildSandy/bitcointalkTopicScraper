However, during the last month, the amount of tokens on Yobit has increased dramatically (over 3,5 times) which resulted in the price drop.  To guarantee the price stability and minimize price risks we decided to continue the invest box program with the lower interest rate (2% per day or 81% per month).  The further price increase is being expected since new investors are expected to come. In future invest box programs with higher interest rates are possible. Hope you'll accept and support our decision. Also please notice that the Android app is coming soon!

Quote from: endygwa on April 24, 2018, 09:57:16 AM Hi  Interesting project, but I don't think it makes sense to put ads in the app. If you need money, just keep some of your tokens (I'm sure you did already) and make sure your product is as attractive as possible (people don't want paying apps or apps full of ads). Then your tokens will naturally increase a lot in value. This way you will make more money than with the ads, your app will be more attractive, users and investors will be happy!  Hi, keep in mind that if you make inside-app purchase by buying gems for $0.99, ads are permanently removed from your account.

You can reach GUESS market on Yobit by following the link below:  https://yobit.net/en/trade/GUESS/BTC  We also would like to announce that GUESS token is listed on IDEX and Token.Store exchanges as well.

Bigger excahnge platforms will come eventually, but this won't happen immediately. It's a progress just like our app development. We can assure you that official team never stops working on token listing.  Now, it's time to focus a bit more on our app release on iOS platform. Our priority is now iOS release of peerguess application. Rather than ICOs selling only their raw ideas, we come up with a working platform which is under development for couple of months.  As of now, we released peerguess app on four different countries consists of Turkey, Denmark, Philippines and Thailand. Before a global release, we need some feedback and testimonials.  If you're interested in downloading peerguess app, you can change your app store region to one of those counted. This way, you'll be able to download and test it! If you're registered in one of those four countries, please download and use our application. We need your comments. We're receving feedbacks from the active users and we're now preparing for the global release of peerguess app on İOS platform.  For the questions about Android release of peerguess app, we can say that after our global release on iOS, we will work harder on Android development. Stay tuned with peerguess project and don't hesitate to ask your questions to us. We'll gladly help you!

We are providing all-in-one bitcoin/altcoin price ticker, portfolio mng, alert mng to all (not just ico) users. Therefore we will have a huge userbase. And in parallel (using gamification techniques) we will push our users to spend gems and make guesses.  In real life, election polls are gathered from less than 0.01% of the population; and individuals participating the survey are just declaring their intention, yet many of the election polls publishing the correct (or near correct) results weeks before the election. Thus, you are right for one individual or a small group of individuals, guessing is just a representation of intention or sentiment but if you closely look to our White Paper, you will see that when the group of guessers increases, the chance to reach a correct output highly increases.

Our main game plan is to be the number one cryptocurrency ticker in the world, and to do this we will be attacking on every group of user on IOS, Android, Tablets, Smartwatches. Second, if we can raise enough money on the ICO we will be providing FX tickers and ability to set guesses with cross worlds; for example you would be able to create a coupon guess of bitcoin will fall + usd/aud will raise with different parity.  Therefore in the mid term, we plan to attract the FX world users too and have a huge user base. As we also believe people will find addictive to play and win, both crypto and real-money world users will need to buy GUESS tokens to convert to gems or people will convert their winnings in gems to tokens. This is also the reason why we keep a liquidation reserve.  Also keep in mind that every Sunday morning, we will distribute 100 Gems to all holders of the GUESS tokens for each 10,000 GUESS tokens they kept for 7 days. For example, a token holder with 25,000 GUESS tokens will receive 250 free Gems on Sunday morning. This will also create demand for GUESS tokens on its own.",True
