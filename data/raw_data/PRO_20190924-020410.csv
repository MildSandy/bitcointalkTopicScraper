Quote from: yahman on November 15, 2017, 10:14:09 PM Hi, how exactly are you going to use smart contracts in your project?  The answer for you both: The reason why we are doing ICO is that blockchain crowd sale can bring a large community of investors who has an incentive to help our business succeed. Since we are a mass consumer good, our community of investors can bring an extremely large network of connections which can become clients of Pressco. Besides that, if we perform extremely good, value of the token goes up giving us a long term funding.",False
