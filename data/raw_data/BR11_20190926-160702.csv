BR11 is a Security Token legally backed by a portfolio of 11 high-growth revenue generating startups. Unlike most ICOs that are pre-operational projects, BR11 Token provides global investors with the opportunity to invest in 11 pre-selected high growth startups that are among the best performers in Latin American market.  The 11 pre-selected startups that represent the BR11 Token were chosen from a portfolio of over 400 startups, all of which have received investments from either Bossa Nova, Brazilâ€™s largest pre-seed investor by number of active investments, and/or ACE, Latin America's best performing startup accelerator.  The token is legally bond to the company in Cayman that holds the equity in each startup, therefore providing a much lower risk to Tokenholders if compared to conventional token sales that are not linked to any underlying assets.  Why invest in BR11 Token?  Growing companies: 90% of the BR11 investment portfolio have overcome the initial startup establishment cycle and are already in the growth phase and some already expanding internationally. Taking into account that only 2% of startups that launch an ICO have any revenue, the backing of such a high-profile portfolio makes the BR11 token one of the safest investment in today's security token market. Global access:It will open an investment opportunity to a much broader audience that otherwise would not be able to invest in a venture capital fund, specially in Latin American assets. Liquidity: BR11 is a tokenized venture capital fund without a lockdown period. Unlike traditional VC funds that demand investors to be locked for years, BR11 token-holders will be able to trade their tokens in the secondary market from the first days after token issuance. Listed:From the moment of issuance, the BR11 security token will have full liquidity in a Security Token Exchange (to be announced). Diversification:Probably one of the most beneficial BR11 characteristics for the investor is the fact that its value will be based on its high-profile startup portfolio performance and not in the state of the cryptocurrency markets. All this characteristics offers crypto investors an opportunity to diversify their investments in real high-growth potential assets with a legally reliability unseen in Utility Tokens and/or conventional ICOs.
