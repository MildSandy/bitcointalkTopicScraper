It is just enough to explained and clarify everything about the project. If the vedio is going to cut or reduce in some time what will happened to the allocated information consists if that time we will cut. If project is too good and people sense thatrhe project is worth to view I guess it will attract the audience and investors. Time js important but the thought and ideas of the project is more important than to have short vedio and less understanding.,False
