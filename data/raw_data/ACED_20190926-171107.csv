Pre-sale tokens will also be sent out within a week from the end of the pre-sale.  Tokens will be made transferable a week from the end of the token sale. We're looking to get a few exchange listings within two weeks from the end of the token sale.  We have two full working products that are currently on Ethereum Testnet Blockchain (Fake ETH) and both require a smart contract audit before we release them to Ethereum Mainnet Blockhain (Real ETH). The audit is to be payed for from Pre-ICO/ICO funds.  These first two products are the start of our Chance Game Suite and Decentralized Derivatives Market. The full development of these two sectors is expected for early Q1 2019. We are iteratively developing so we can release products and start generating profit without having the full platform done.  Checkout our working products! Also we've been upgrading our UI/UX for our first derivatives contract Over/Under. Check out the preview here: https://twitter.com/EtherAceTeam/status/1013870955754545152 , the latest version will be released in the next few days!

We will keep that in mind going forward and will conduct Q&A sessions and other media for the bounty to post. We're in pre-ICO stage and while the market is down we're focusing more on development then marketing. Once the market recovers a bit we will switch back most resources onto PR and spreading the word!  The platform first iteration has been successfully completed according to our Roadmap. We have two products built that with minor tweaks could be deployed to production and start generating profit now! We are currently implementing the latest tech (state channels) /adding functionality to further progress our existing products and give the end-user an instant/real-time user experience. This will help attract many customers and a community.  After the user experience on our already built products is improved, we are going to be developing our 1-1 derivatives contract for our derivatives market. We have the skeleton infrastructure in place for our full derivatives market, actual implementation of the many different features (leveraging, liquidation engine, underlying index price etc.) comes next.  We're looking to launch our first two products September 2018 to start generating profit. The main thing we need before they can be put into production is a code audit. This will be done from funds raised in Pre-ICO or ICO!  I hope this answered your question! Let me know if you have any others, and we welcome you to our community.

Great question, our platform never handles your funds unless they're being stored in our smart contract. There is no wallet to hack, because the user only uses their own personal wallet with their private key to interact with our platform.  If a transaction is rejected/fails maybe because the gas was ran out or was too low and was taking too long, the user funds get returned to their wallet (MetaMask etc.) automatically as the transaction is reverted.

These funds will be used for two main things.  1. Marketing our platform on official channels to raise awareness of our project. Currently we are just word-of-mouth through a two week bounty campaign, and the market is currently very red which is rendering this type of marketing less effective. We'll use most of the funds to promote our project.  2. Continuing development on par with our Roadmap. We'll use the remaining funds to continue developing the platform on the same timeline as we previously planned. We are doing further development right now!  For marketing about 90% of the Pre-ICO soft cap will be used. For continuing development about 10% will be used of the 75,000 USD. This is because promoting our project is more important once the market recovers a bit and people are ready to invest! Naturally now we continue to make our platform better and build on it to make the product stronger.  Your suggestion sounds great! We'd love to collaborate with our community members and come up with a solid video presentation on why our project is important! What do you have in mind?  Thanks and let us know what sort of community video you're thinking of!",False

Our platform is completely unique - we have very little competition. We’ve fused different functionality of different platforms with the power of the Ethereum Virtual Machine and Blockchain then added our own innovation and skill into it too create a new market instrument that anyone can use for gain, whether the market is going up or down.  The market proof is there, the crypto derivatives market being $35 Billion USD, the only centralized crypto derivatives platform having $4 Billion USD daily, you can imagine all that plus the benefits of the Blockchain and support for traditional assets (gold, oil etc.) creating a gateway to the largest financial market in the world, derivatives. The potential is clearly there.  Only question is, can the team perform? Well that's why we've proven this.

Both live on Ethereum Blockchain right now and created using smart contracts!  This is why our project will succeed.  Thanks, hope that answered your question.",False

We do not believe advertising the platform will be an issue at all. To run advertisements and marketing the team does not need to be known! All that is needed is the funding to do so, which will be provided by the ICO sale, and a great platform, provided by the funding + the team skill.  The team is not being advertised or marketed, the actual platform is. Many projects in this area creators remain anonymous due to reasons discussed earlier. At the point of marketing nobody will have concern for who the team is, just the product they offer!

Holders of our ACED token will receive 100% of the profit the platform earns through service fees from our derivatives market and what the house 'edge' earns and service fees in our chance game suite. This strategy was chosen because of the success exchanges like Binance (BNB) and Kucoin (KCS) had using it where users of the platform get rewarded for all the volume on it. It helps attract volume and liquidity, which in turn helps attract new users, and the cycle continues.  ACED tokens can also be used on our platform for different special features such as reduced fees. This is once again similar to what Binance does, cutting user fees by 50% if they use BNB on the platform. This also helps incentive to buy ACED token because there is a great use of it.  Holders of the ACED token will be able to vote on features, ideas, and strategy on what they wish the EtherAce Team to implement or change.  We are building our platform to run on all devices; desktop, mobile, tablet etc. Originally the platform is built for desktop and laptops screen sizes. We've built it with Bootstrap technology to make it responsive so it can still be used on mobile devices, just not optimized. Past Q1 2019 we plan to develop an app to use it on mobile devices as well!  Any other questions or clarification please ask!",False

This is relatively low compared to other projects you may have participated in the past. The EtherAce Team is solely focused on raising what is needed to build the platform, sustain it and nothing more. We believe when we complete building the platform as described we will be rewarded through dividends from our share of the total token supply (15%) rather then raising a higher sum of capital then necessary which may sabotage the project's ICO sale or waste our community supporters money.  The dividends payment will continue as long as the platform is used. This is because the dividends are formed from the service fees from the derivatives market and chance game suite which will exist as long as somebody uses the platform and what the 'house' earns in our chance game suite.  Let me know if you have any more questions ! Thanks.",False

Glad to hear your interest. Our dividends will initially be paid out at the end of each quarter. This means they would be paid out four times a year. The dividends are carried out by our smart contract so the process is autonomous.  As noted above, they will be paid out quarterly initially, while we only have our Over/Under speculation contract and Flip, the gambling chance game out on main-net. In Q1 2019 when our decentralized derivatives market will be complete and deployed onto main-net (as well as a peer-to-peer chance game) and marketing is started, we expect the volume on our platform to soar. Once the dividends pool is high enough (it grows linearly with volume) we are looking to issue dividends monthly. If/when the dividends pool reaches a high enough level that the issuance period of dividends can be further increased a community token holder vote will be held to choose at what increment dividends are to be paid out at.  Hope this answered your question ! If you have any other questions please ask!",False

You are correct, once we release our first products onto main-net (September 2018) dividends through our ACED tokens will be activated.

There will be a dividend claiming period at the end of each period, first quarterly (every 3 months) then monthly, and then possibly an even shorter time frame. During the dividend claiming period holders of our ACED token will be able to accept the dividends generated by the EtherAce Platform from our dividends smart contract !

With the 100% bonus $1000 USD will get you 19,231 ACED tokens.  We won't make an actual estimate/guess of how much our platform will return, but we can point out the market potential. If you take our decentralized derivatives market alone, a similar but centralized derivatives market that only supports cryptocurrency speculation has daily volume of $3 to $4 billion USD (source: https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/bitmex/ ) . Right now we are looking at a fee rate of 0.025 - 0.075 depending if you make or take the market (more on that in our Whitepaper: https://etherace.io/whitepaper/EtherAce_Whitepaper_v1.0.1.pdf ). This amount of volume with cryptocurrency derivatives alone, not including the much larger world derivatives market for traditional assets such as gold as we mentioned before.  It is worth noting we don't expect to reach that volume on our derivatives market until end of Q1 2019. This is because by then the full functioning derivatives market will be available. September 2018 we will only have one speculation contract done with no leveraging functionality or liquidations etc. Also our marketing starts Q1 2019.  Further down the road, the EtherAce team expects to surpass $3-4 Billion USD in volume daily because we are also targeting the traditional derivatives market which is roughly 34285 times bigger then the cryptocurrency derivatives market (Traditional: $1.2 Quadrillion USD, Cryptocurrency: $35 Billion USD). The volume from the traditional assets we support will grow as the blockchain becomes more mainstream and traditional investors participate in decentralized over centralized financial platforms.  These numbers are from our decentralized derivatives market alone, not including gambling sector revenue. However it is worth noting our project focuses more on our derivatives market then our chance game suite.  Hopefully this helped answer your question ! Any more questions please ask.  Thanks!",False

Our platform is built very modular so it is extremely easy to scale it up to more coins etc. We explained how it is built in this way in our Whitepaper, or if you want more detail on how it is modular please ask!  So for your question, yes users can bet or speculate on any coin and any traditional asset, like gold or oil, this is extremely important for when blockchain becomes mainstream. Crypto derivatives market is $35 Billion which is huge, but traditional derivatives, like gold or oil market is $1.2 Quadrillion, about 35,000x larger. This is why we support traditional assets as well.  If you're asking can users in example have a coin like Litecoin in a wallet, and bet using Litecoin, then no, currently our platform does not support that. Users bet in ETH on our platform. In the future development, we could use the functionality of a project such as Kyber to support this however and let users bet in any coin or token they personally hold on any coin or token (or traditional asset) they wish.

Yes we are currently using the Ropsten testnet from Ethereum to test our first speculation contract beta product, Over/Under here: https://ou-contract.etherace.io . Our other product, Flip the gambling dApp, https://flip.etherace.io , is on Kovan testnet, which is a more stable testnet then Ropsten. The reason we went with Ropsten testnet for Over/Under is explained below.  In terms of security, Ropsten is as safe as the Ethereum blockchain is. It is a testnet, which means Ether used is not real, and it is easy to get ETH from different faucets to use to test our product. The Ropsten experience is worse for third-party services we use such as Infura or Oraclize and is more unstable then other testnets such as Kovan or Rinkeby. Because Ropsten is not real value and a testnet, support from these providers architecture is not as highly maintained and uptime is not 100% as it would be on the Mainnet (Main and real Ethereum blockchain with real value). We chose Ropsten testnet over others such as Kovan or Rinkeby because it is much easier for potential investors or people wishing to check out our product to get Ropsten ETH then the other testnets. Kovan/Rinkeby ETH faucets are controlled to make sure there are no spam attacks, however this means getting the ETH is much harder and you get a lot less.  If you're using our dApp you may experience a bug where the source is Infura or Oraclize. We experienced a bug when Oraclize was down (only on Ropsten) on the day of our release. We've also experienced some bugs with Infura once in awhile which cause the dApp to not function properly. While these issues will go away once migrated to Mainnet or a more stable testnet it has also opened the EtherAce Team's eyes that some product workflow is to dependent on third-party services. Fallbacks are being developed now in the case of a third-party failure, the EtherAce dApp can still fully function!  Let us know if you have any other questions !",False

Yes our platform supports cryptocurrency price speculation. As you will see in our first speculation contract Over/Under, we will be starting by supporting BTC, ETH, and LTC.  However as you noted, we are not only supporting cryptocurrency speculation. We have a broader vision for our platform and that is to be used for traditional financial markets such as oil, gold, precious commodities etc. Users will be able to speculate on the prices of these the same way done in traditional centralized derivative markets today.  Why have we chosen this path? While the cryptocurrency speculation market is quite large at $35 Billion our platform has much more potential to also unlock the biggest financial market in the world; traditional derivatives at $1.2 Quadrillion! Traditional and 'regular' investors (people who invest in traditional commodities such as gold) will be able to take advantage of our platform as well! They'd use the EtherAce Platform over current platforms they're using now because the blockchain technology we use enable greater qualities that current existing platforms.  We are building/built our platform in a modular, lightweight way which is how we are able to support not only cryptocurrency's but also traditional assets. Our platform is a speculation platform, users speculate on prices of the underlying assets we support. They do not actually trade the assets as they would on an exchange. Currently they will only be exchanging Ether on our platform. This makes our platform cheaper, faster, secure, more accessible and convenient. Users do not need to worry about security of assets purchased on our platform because they do not purchase anything. There are no withdrawal fees, no multiple assets to manage in several wallets, only Ether is required to use our platform on any asset we support.

Thanks, I'm glad you find it an interesting project ! As kotwica666 accurately and kindly responded we addressed the anonymity of the team in our Whitepaper. We will be posting a more in-depth article on why we are anonymous and why it should not affect our project negatively on our Medium account in the near future.  We currently have one beta out for our first gambling dApp, Flip, on the Kovan test-net that you can test out here: https://flip.etherace.io/ or from the 'BETA FLIP DAPP' button on our homepage of our website! As you noticed our first speculation contract Over/Under beta will be released today, June 13th ! We will be making the release publicly today !  As for how will you know this project is real, from our products, and the team delivering on par with the Roadmap laid out. You can also check our Github progress here: https://github.com/etherace . We will make announcements on all our communication channels when we release the beta O/U today, and you can test it out and this will hopefully help prove this is a real project !  Thanks for your interest in our project and platform ! Any other questions please do not hesitate to ask.",False

Those are something called arbitrage platforms. Basically they monitor different exchanges for different markets. Say one exchange is selling BTC at $8,000 USD and another is selling BTC at $7,998. These type of platforms let you buy from the $7,998 platform and sell on the $8,000 USD platform, and you make profit through the price spread.  Our platform is not an arbitrage platform. The part of our platform I believe you are unclear about is our decentralized derivatives market. Our market operates in a similar way that an exchange works. Users can execute actions similar to 'buy' and 'sell' on an exchange. On our platform they are called 'Over' and 'Under' (for our first speculation contract O/U) or 'long' and 'short'.  Users directly trade, speculate and bet on the prices of different underlying assets (like BTC etc.) against each other. An example of how this would work on our first speculation contract and the general concept is:  The price of BTC is at $8,000 USD. Dave believes in 5 minutes the price will be below $8,000. He creates an O/U contract on our platform and sets the price at $8,000, chooses the option to bet 'Under' and sets the price contention period for 5 minutes. Alexa has a contrasting price view or goal to Dave. She believes the price will be above $8,000 USD. So she joins the contract Dave created and chooses to bet on the 'Over' option. Now when the 5 minute contract duration is up our smart contracts retrieve the current price of BTC and either Dave or Alexa will make profit, depending if they chose the correct option.  This is different from an exchange in many ways. The main difference is users do not actually buy or sell the assets our platform supports. They only bet on the price of the underlying assets. This makes our platform lightweight, cheaper, faster, more convenient, secure and scalable. Functionality this supports includes shorting (betting the price will go down), hedging (protecting your portfolio from possible losses, if you hold any coin ex. BTC, believe it is going down in price, and don't wish to sell because you believe in the project or future or because its cheaper to hedge on our platform then sell on an exchange, you can short it on our platform, making profit to cover possible loss from your actual portfolio), longing (betting the price will go up).  We are releasing our O/U contract later today as well as a video on how it works, so you can more easily try it out or watch if this explanation was not clear. If you have further questions on how it works please do ask!",False
