In this message we want to inform everyone, that our project is going to move ICO to 2018. There are several reasons to do this: First of all, we are not a project, which raises funds to develop the idea. We collect funds to make the idea worth it. Our goal is to provide the very best service to our users. Second, we realized, that the vision we had before wasn't as straightforward, as we thought. We've got experienced in the field, we work with. Our current vision is more precise, because we've got feedback from people, who work in trading sphere since NASDAQ appeared. Third reason is, that our mission is to bring trust to the cryptocurrency world of trading. Meantime we developing our application, the amount of frauds around trading grew exponentially. We can't stand watching people, who came into the world of cryptocurrencies recently, get broke, because of unprofessional traders making profit out of their trust. Due to lack of juridical regulation it is now impossible to get funds back and this problem grows with each day. We want to stop it and we are about to do it really soon. With publishing our Cryptopus API we are going to spread the information to public and force traders, who want to manage assets of others, to prove their abilities. The so called proof-of-success, which we develop, is going to be part of everybody's life. These reasons unfortunately brought us to the point we are now on. We definitely aren't breaking our smart-contract, but we now limit our crowd-sale to 4 million of CPP tokens. This amount of ETH is the necessary sum, which we will put into our research & marketing. It is now your turn to decide if the project we create is capable to bring trust to the world. P.S. we also please you to mention, that we aren't going to stop the development process and the schedule of releases is not going to change. We just rearrange the way we bring funds into the project.",False

High volatility rate (it even goes up to 30% in 24hr.) creates perfect possibilities to earn and raise money, but sometimes its opposite side shows up and people ""loose"" all their investments.     There are tonns of ways to raise money, funds and exchange platforms offer their services, but when people avtually want to earn something it is not enough to be lucky, it is neccessary to have financial skills and analytic mind. Even though some ""traders"" raise lots of money using their ""sixth feeling"", but it should be mentioned that cryptocurrency world is controlled by ""feeling and thoughts"" of the mob.  Project's goal  First of, we want to create a place, where people would be able to let professionals earn money using their investments.  Our top advantages      • We created a synchronization mechanism, which wokrs with 4 biggest exchange platforms already. (Kraken, Bitmex, Bitfinex, Poloniex).     • Our platform generates new wallets for brokerage traders every time whey get new investments. Using a smart-contract we create a safe way to let other people ""use"" money of the investors for purpose.     • Dobule-step storage system lets us syncronize all data in real-time.     • Build on top of IPFS storage system offers a great opportuninty of raising money for those, who let us store data on their computers.     • Two-step storage lets people receive information at any time using P2P systme of IPFS (the most important information is always online).     • Our own tokens are used for transaction safety and keep traders ""in platform"", what makes it more reliable than any fund today.  Why mankind needs such project?      The raising popularity of cryptocurrencies made a huge effort on conneting people, using one network for their exchanges. Lots of people are ready to receive payments and invest money in cryptocurrecies, but ""popular investment way"" is a bad practice for mobs, because of the lack of financial education. Even though there are lots of traders, who know how to controll rates and invest their funds. For those traders it is easier to use bigger summs of money to have a better opportunities to invest and controll the situation. There still is no ""place"", where people coult find professional traders and lend them their money in order to owe more later, so the traders would be able to have more possibilities to raise funds.  Few most important timespots of cryptopus  1. The begging of the development process (13.07.2017) 2. Centralized storage system implementation (25.07.2017) 3. Exchange platform sync. scripts are ready to work (06.08.2017) 4. Replacing centralized storage system with decentralized one (07.08.2017-23.08.2017) 5. pre-ICO preparation process and development of first alpha release (25.08.2017-04.09.2017) 6. Pre-ICO start. Collecting funds to successfully finish the development (10.10.2017) 7. Hard working process before ICO (24.10.2017-24.11.2017) 8. ICO start. Collecting money for marketing and localization (26.11.2017) 9. Further work. Developing ""features"" of the projects, such as own exchange platform (10.12.2017-...)  !IMPORTANT: today, 15.10.2017 we experienced a new type of fraud. People copy our web-page.
