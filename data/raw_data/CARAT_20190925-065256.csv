Here are 8 reasons we think you should join in on this low -risk, high-return venture.  Carats.io is one of the most exciting ICOs currently on the market, having developed a completely new and revolutionary model of cryptocurrency - a token that is based in real, solid-stone diamonds.  But is an investment in blockchain-based diamond assets right for you? Check out these 8 great reasons and decide for yourself:  An investment in CARATs is an investment in actual diamonds - this isnâ€™t simply betting your money on a coin conjured out of thin air, but in actual, rock-hard, sparkling diamonds. Which brings us to reason number two... When it comes to investments, diamonds shine above the rest - they are officially and scientifically proven to be the most concentrated stores of wealth that exists on the planet. These concentrated balls of dollars are an extremely rare natural resource (over a thousand times rarer than gold) with a finite limit. Itâ€™s wise to get your hands on some of these early. While diamonds may be rare, the demand for them remains high. Investments, luxury jewellery, industrial cutters and drills, semiconductors and even treatments for cancer - the list of uses for diamonds keeps on growing, ensuring that they will continue to retain (if not increase in) value for the years to come. Such a prediction follows the historic trend: since 1959, diamond prices have risen by an average of 15% annually. For the first time, diamond investments will be open to everyone. Until now, buying diamonds was expensive AF and required the help of specialists. Carats.io is completely changing that, making the investment market accessible to everyone with a crypto wallet.  PLUS - investing with Carats.io isnâ€™t just about â€˜getting in onâ€™ the diamond market, itâ€™s a whole new level of cryptocurrency.  CARAT tokens are guaranteed to be stable and safe from the crazy roller coaster of crypto prices. When you buy CARATs, you are buying actual, tangible diamonds. Each token represents a shiny piece of ex-coal stored, locked and tracked in a vault at the Israel Diamond Exchange - the worldâ€™s largest such exchange. The CARAT price wonâ€™t be vulnerable to extreme fluctuations based on the whims and madness of the consumer market. CARAT tokens have real-world value. Donâ€™t get stuck shuffling your crypto investments between the endless list of alt-coins - CARAT tokens are real diamonds and as such can be redeemed and recognized at face-value around the world. The Carats.io team canâ€™t stop winning. Itâ€™s that simple - â€˜Best Techâ€™, â€˜Best Teamâ€™, â€˜Best Market Potentialâ€™, â€˜Best Credibility & Achievementsâ€™ - Carats continue to sweep these awards at competitions and summits around the world. Clearly, theyâ€™re on to something.   JOIN THE DISCUSSION > https://t.me/caratsio",False
