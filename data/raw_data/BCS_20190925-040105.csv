The campaign will consist of several different activities and reward pools.  Token Holders Promotion  This promotion is dedicated to our early token holders who obtained BCS tokens before actual mainnet release thus helping to make BCShop.io platform into reality. We will make ALL token holders snapshot at 15th of May 2018 and 200k tokens will be reserved for distribution between those token holders in the snapshot. Tokens will be rewarded proportionally to token holdings so 200k tokens will lead to ~60% reward given the current circulating supply of 332k tokens.  Note:  It is obligatory for you to qualify for the reward. We ask you to write your feedback about BCShop.io platform (after mainnet release) in a free form at telegra.ph and send it to bounty@bcshop.io, don’t forget to specify your wallet address with BCS tokens.

Airdrop Campaign  10k tokens will be distributed for 1000 members randomly chosen from those who qualified. To qualify, follow instructions in bounty campaign channel: https://t.me/bcshop_bounty. We will determine 1000 people to receive 10 BCS tokens each with the help of random.org website.

Basically, each user of the platform will have two different ways of interacting with the platform: Offer and Explore. Both of them are described below.  Offer This option allows to create an offer of good or service backed by smart-contract on Ethereum blockchain. The process is built the way that all technical details stay behind the scene and user may not even know that he is using blockchain while still getting all the benefits.  Offer created by user will be accessible all around the world and can be easily paid in a few minutes. Additional features are available:  - Limited time offers: allows to set exact date and time when the offer is active. - Limited quantity offers: allows to limits the amount of goods or services that is being offered. - Wholesale purchases: allows of purchasing several goods at once.  Making an offer on BCShop.io platform allows you to have fundamental features of online shops extended by blockchain benefits and setup costs close to zero.  Explore This option allows to explore different approved offers available on the platform. This will allow our partners to stay visible and attract additional traffic to their business while providing customers with easy, secure and reliable way to pay.  While all partners’ offers in “explore” section will be categorized and carefully monitored by the team to comply with the law and regulations, P2P offers will not be monitored but following terms and conditions is still required.  Short Links All offers on the platform will be accessible via short links which looks like this: bcshop.io/<ID> where <ID> is unique identifier of product or service. Sharing an offer is as simple as sharing a short link, no more third-party websites, payment gateways and other middlemen involved.  No more long unreadable addresses! No more black holes on the recipient’s end! Pay fast and easy and know what you pay for! Furthermore, now you can bookmark your favorite deals and get back to them in one click!  Additional Features There are more things planned to be included in commercial release. Here are the biggest ones:  - Price lists. Offer different goods and services included in one price lists if you wish so. - Reports. Available both for merchants and customers. Now you can check all your transactions made on the platform and export the history to your device. - Edit your offers. Correct! You will be able edit prices, quantities, dates, etc. Smart-contracts allow for this. - Different payment options. We are starting with ETH and BCS and others will be added gradually. - Cross-device.

There are a few reasons: 1. As we use blockchain, we do not need our own data centers, we do not have to cover the costs of maintaining data integrity and protecting data from hackers. 2. Cost of making a transaction and creating a product/service offer in Ethereum cryptocurrency is just a few cents. 3. BCShop.io business model does not involve gaining profits by the company itself. All gathered fees are aggregated to a specially created smart contract and are weekly distributed between token holders. This approach allows the company organizational activity costs to remain as low as possible. 4. Use of smart contracts makes it possible to achieve maximum formalization of a seller`s product/service offer, automate delivery processes in general and money back function in particular, with no extra fees.",False

All gathered fees are aggregated to a specially created smart contract and are weekly distributed between token holders. This approach allows the company organizational activity costs to remain as low as possible. 4. Use of smart contracts makes it possible to achieve maximum formalization of a seller`s product/service offer, automate delivery processes in general and money back function in particular, with no extra fees.",False

First of all, it is much easier to create a product or service offer through BCShop: you do not need your own website, you do not need to register in payment gates, and you do not need a server for storing shop activity data. All the data related to a service or product sale terms, as well as related to completed transactions  is  stored  on  blockchain. In  comparison  to  the  classical  approach,  your shop  is  much  more  protected  against  any  hacking  or  data  loss,  as blockchain guarantees a more efficient means of protection for your data. When  working  with  payments  gateways  you  should  resolve  all  issues  with  the product  delivery  yourself  and  you  should  control  the  process.

All the data related to a service or product sale terms, as well as related to completed transactions is stored on blockchain. In comparison to the classical approach, your shop is much more protected against any hacking or data loss, as blockchain guarantees a more efficient means of protection for your data. When working with payments gateways you should resolve all issues with the product delivery yourself and you should control the process. If you are using our service, you can download a standard BCShopApp and set it up (yourself or with our help), this will immediately resolve the issue of your customers receiving products automatically.

In comparison to the classical approach, your shop is much more protected against any hacking or data loss, as blockchain guarantees a more efficient means of protection for your data.

We announced PreSale hard cap of 2000 ETH (~600 000$).  2. Alfa release is going to happen in less than a week. Screenshots are available in the report.  3. Partnership announcement with Bancor is scheduled for mid November.  4. Pre-agreement on using our platform is reached with Law&Trust International, leading ICO legal service provider in Russia and some other countries.  5. BCShop.io is sponsoring Moscow ICO conference at 7th of November. The project will be introduced to broader public and potential contributors.  [INTRODUCTION]   BCShop.io is a platform for selling digital products and services, based on smart-contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.  Explainer video (click the image):    BCShop.io allows vendors to publish information about digital products and services, and customers – to purchase these products and services for Ethereum cryptocurrency. At that, all the data concerning products is stored as a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.  Use of smart contracts allows for automatization of payment processing and account of products. In the simplest cases, creating a digital product offer is done with only a few clicks and does not require vendors to install any software.    Purchasing digital products is a simple process too. Buyers make all payments in the Ethereum blockchain`s native currency – ETH.  Creating sale offers, as well as buying products is done with the use of software, based on MyEtherWallet – one of the most popular Ethereum online wallets. That allows the service to be used on both desktops and mobile devices.  BCShop.io is marketed as a solution for C2C (client to client), and for B2C (business to client). BCShop.io offers its business clients free development of integration solutions.  Our main competitive advantages:  •   low fees •   no required conversion of funds during transactions •   fast transactions •   decentralized data storage •   free integration with operating businesses •   user friendly and convenient service for customers and for vendors. •   Products rating system   [PRETGE]   Dates: 09.10.2017 – 15.12.2017 Minimum contribution: 20 ETH Contribution currency: ETH Maximum investors: 100 Contribution bonus: 50%   [TGE]   Dates: 16.01.2018 – 13.02.2018 Minimum contribution: no restriction Contribution currency: ETH Maximum investors: no restriction Contribution bonus: 0% - 10% Hard cap: ~60 000 ETH (exact number set in tokens)   [TOKEN BCS]      [BOUNTY]   If you are an author of an interesting and popular channel or blog in social networks, twitter, instagram, telegram or other social media, and are interested in advertising cooperation, we would like to discuss this possibility with you on an individual basis. For placing quality content in popular channels, we are ready to offer up to 1000 BCS tokens (in exceptional cases, more). Leave an application for participation here, or in a private message.  The application must include a link to the channel and your payment request. We do not consider advertising options in spam channels. Only channels with quality content, please.   [FREE AIRDROPs]  YOU SHOULD CLAIM YOUR BONUS TOKENS YOURSELF.  To participate in airdrop all you need is to follow our social media and tweet / like it. Time to time we will publish contract addresses so you can claim your bonus tokens. Read post below for more info.  In order to introduce users to BCShop.io platform we will be conducting several token AIRDROPS (giveaways) during next weeks.  Who can participate: anyone who has Ethereum wallet with ERC20 tokens support (for example, MyEtherWallet).  What you will get: BCS Promo tokens. Those tokens can be exchanged for real BCS tokens during Token Generating Event (TGE) which will start 10.01.2018. Exchange rate is 1:1.  What is BCS token: it is a token which is given to supporters of BCShop.io platform during TGE stage. Base price of 1 BCS token is 0.01 ETH.  How to participate:  1.   Join our telegram chat: https://t.me/joinchat/FxGXTULeqJEx0BlrVb4bsQ 2.   Follow our medium blog: https://medium.com/@bcshop.io 3.   Follow our twitter: https://twitter.com/BCShop_io  The first AIRDROP will be held between 02.10.2017 and 09.10.2017. In each channel we will publish different BCShop.io trade links. Example (demo): https://goo.gl/q45FhA. All you need is to follow the link and claim your promo tokens (don’t forget to make a wish ).  You are advised to use new Ethereum wallet, just in case. You will need to pay for the gas (~0.0004 ETH).  In each channel (telegram, medium and twitter) there will be different link. So you can receive promo tokens up to 3 times. There will be several airdrops so you can accumulate as much promo tokens as you can, all of them will be exchanged for BCS tokens during TGE stage.  Number of participants who can receive promo tokens is limited each AIRDROP. The limit of first round is 750, 250 for each channel.  We are adding little game twist to it: every participant gets 4 promo tokens, every 10th participant gets 8 promo tokens and every 50th participant gets 16 promo tokens.  If you have any questions, the fastest way to get an answer is in our telegram channel. Please be kind and try to help people, some of them don’t know what is Ethereum, tokens and so on. Let’s grow blockchain and Ethereum community bigger and speed up the economy and society revolution!   WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER | TELEGRAM | TWITTER | MEDIUM",False
