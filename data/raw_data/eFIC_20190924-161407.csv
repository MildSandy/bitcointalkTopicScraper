Financial freedom is much more than having money. It‚Äôs the freedom to do whatever you want whenever you want without having to listen to anybody. It‚Äôs the freedom to not have to go to school to study something you aren‚Äôt really into or to work at a job you don‚Äôt like.  Being wealthy ultimately has the end goal of financial freedom in mind. It means you‚Äôre not living paycheck to paycheck. It means you‚Äôve either saved enough that you don‚Äôt need to work every day to sustain your lifestyle or you‚Äôve built up enough residual, passive income sources that you‚Äôre getting paid while you sleep. Did you hear that? Passive income means getting paid while you sleep or lie on the beach.  With the growing adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology has paved several avenues of innovation that span across industries. Early adopters in this new space have had the opportunity to realize life-changing gains and amass fortunes both small and large. However, as double-digit volatility is at the heart of every cryptocurrency trader due to the speculative nature of the emerging asset class, it is difficult to sustain a consistent, predictable level of return without actively portfolio management.  We‚Äôre ‚Äúhodling‚Äù our cryptocurrencies, so why not get paid? With the recent boom and bust cycle of cryptocurrencies, a common sentiment among crypto traders is to ‚ÄúHODL‚Äù onto their crypto holdings through all ups and downs. Some people ‚Äúhodl‚Äù for days, weeks, and months, while some others will even ‚Äúhodl‚Äù for years.  In the news, we have all heard of the equity markets and how stocks go through their own boom and bust cycles. The global stock market is currently valued at $64 trillion; however, what many do not realize is that the global bond market is even bigger with a valuation at $100 trillion with an even higher daily trading volume ($700 billion vs. $200 billion). The bond market allows for the exchange of fixed income instruments that delivery coupon payments at regular intervals. With these predictable series of payments, many traditional investors use this approach to generate passive income streams and accumulate wealth. What is extraordinarily remarkable is that one project, FIC Network, has created a medium for exchanging fixed income instruments on the blockchain, providing an opportunity to generate consistent, predictable rates of return in the cryptocurrency space.  So what is FIC Network? FIC network is the first project to create a decentralized, trustless network to exchange fixed income instruments with a consistent, predictable return schedule akin to government bonds, corporate bonds, and dividend stocks. The most salient innovation in this project is the consolidation of both crypto and fiat fixed income instruments into one network with transactions that settle within seconds.  As the Blockchain utilizes pseudoanonymous transactions on a public ledger, this approach essentially eliminates the middlemen and with it, a wide range of logistical efficiencies (transaction fees/long settlement times) that come with exchanging in a traditional market. It is with this model that investors can choose to receive payments in either fiat or cryptocurrencies. While other crypto projects have the option of masternodes or dividend-paying tokens, such options generally provide a low rate of return, limited liquidity, and high levels of volatility.

Existing crypto tokens are operating as currencies or utilities without a fixed-income offering. A crypto and fiat fixed income market can sustainably drive the crypto market into mainstream usage better than the conventionally fixed income market. FIC‚Äôs blockchain-based platform will allow users to list, buy and sell any type of crypto or fiat fixed financial instruments avoiding the drawbacks of conventionally fixed income markets such as friction, lack of liquidity, lack of interoperability, asymmetry of information and operational risks. A multi-currency asset agnostic system with a built-in exchange allows users to operate in currencies of their preference, thus eliminating exposure to exchange rate risk and simplifies accounting. Risks     The FIC Network and app aren‚Äôt scheduled to be launched until Q4 2018. While Q4 isn‚Äôt too far in the future, many ICOs have over-promised and under-delivered when it comes to their roadmap progress after ICO completion. -1     As with many ICOs, the majority of the team has outside obligations which result in time being spent elsewhere and not 100% focused on the success of the project. -1     Regulations for cryptocurrencies are still undetermined and the outcome on how they will affect ICOs‚Äô dealing with securities, such as FIC Network, is unknown. ‚Äì1 Growth Potential     FIC Network has an MVP ‚Äì distributed app (dApp) eDepository, which has already been developed and deployed on their Test Network. It allows publishing and managing assets on the blockchain network. +3     The team has the right mixture of talent and experience to bring this project to fruition as well as multiple advisers and venture capital backing. +3     Token metrics are an extremely important aspect that investors research to determine if an ICO is worthy of investment. A fairly low hard cap of $16 million USD, 50% of tokens being sold during the token sale, and a fixed supply are considered positives. +3 Disposition With the uncertainty of this market, some investors may choose to remain on the sidelines. However, with the profit potential in this incredibly large market, those that take the plunge could end up with excellent returns if all goes according to plan. FIC Network receives a rating of 6 out of 10. Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-fic-network/",False
