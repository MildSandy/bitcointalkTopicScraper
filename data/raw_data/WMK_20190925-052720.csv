Just before releasing the final numbers we have learned about a legal requirement that might affect a small number of our private sale contributions. As unsold tokens will be burned, we have to report the final and exact data. We are close to fully sort this issue and I believe that we'll post the wrap-up by Wednesday next week, if not before.  As we said before, we will release the tokens and enable transactions on the marketplace regardless of the market conditions, and it's closer than ever. There is plenty of work behind the scenes to make sure we're prepared to get users and make an impact on the industry right from the first year, and most of this work will become public over the next couple of months.  As I briefly mentioned before, a lot of work is being done on the content review side as well. Starting very soon, selected photographers (professionals only, for now) will get an FTP access and after their portfolio is reviewed, they will be able to submit images to the marketplace directly. Those images will be reviewed differently than the rest of the submitted content. This will allow trusted photographers to onboard their content without waiting like everyone else. At the same time, we're also checking the option of outsourcing some part of the review process to external content review teams to accelerate and improve this important part of our platform.  I hope this helps to shed some light over what's going on. Needless to say we all work extremely hard to complete these big plans and make them public.  Happy to answer any questions, even if I'm a little slow in response I'm always here and very interested in what you guys have to say.

Here's a quick status update along with an important announcement on the tokens release.  Over the next few months, we'll continue our work to further develop the product, increase awareness and get the right strategy regarding exchanges and liquidity providers. Due to the market sentiment, we decided to preserve the lockup a while longer and wait with their release.  We believe that in the long-run, releasing the tokens when the market sentiment recovers, will prove itself as the right strategy for the entire community. In case it will take longer than expected, we will release the token anyway, but with a much stronger position to support its liquidity.

I hope I will be able to make things clearer. only the crowdsale has been canceled.  Here is a detailed explanation of why the team decided to cancel the crowdsale.   To protect our economy from large token holders with the wrong intentions, we allocated roughly 85% of the hard cap for private sale contributors. This allows us to communicate with each of them, gather information, run a thorough screening process and be as selective as possible.We wouldn’t have been able to do the same for our public sale contributions. Taking into account the number of whitelisted users and how quickly it continues to grow, our resources are just not sufficient enough to process KYC requests, proof of address documents and other essential details with the time and attention needed to comply with the global regulations for selling our tokens to the public. With such a high volume of whitelist registrations, the room for mistakes is just too big.  https://medium.com/wemark-stories/breaking-news-wemark-cancels-public-sale-deposits-take-its-place-693e555d6347  That is why the team only accept to receive contributions through a private sale and early deposits. The early deposits event has ended, and now the team is reviewing the deposits. During the reviewing of the deposits, there's still a chance to purchase WMK through the late deposits round which will be the last and the final round.

Please refer to the official announcement for accurate details: ----------  We're cancelling our public sale - deposits will take its place  We've made many announcements in this community before, but none of them was significant as this one.  When we launched our alpha and started accepting early deposits, we weren't prepared for what would soon follow.  Four days into the second round of deposits, we raised enough funding to reach our main goals - turning our alpha into a much more extensive product, getting a significant amount of adoption to prove the use-case and setting up other essential parts of our upcoming decentralized economy.  After a couple of sleepless nights, we made the hard decision to cancel Wemark's public sale and finish the token sale right after the current (and last) stage of deposit ends.  We'll double check each deposit before we accept it (without the risks of an open public sale), and make sure all approved contributors who want to participate in the sale will be able to do so.  You can find all the details on the following announcement:  https://medium.com/wemark-stories/breaking-news-wemark-cancels-public-sale-deposits-take-its-place-693e555d6347  And feel free to ask us any questions you have in mind!

It only makes sense that anyone that provides or consumes value on the network, will be rewarded when the network is growing. Take Uber and Airbnb for example - 30 billion and an 80 billion dollar companies today. The first drivers and first hosts contributed a lot to the current value, but they got nothing. Instead of asking our community to hold Ether or Bitcoin, which their value isn't related to them in any way, we ask them to hold Wemark Tokens, which their value is connected directly to their participation in the community.

As all the transactions on Wemark.com will be done through the Wemark protocol, licensing photos on the marketplace will require the use of Wemark Tokens. The tokens will enable direct transactions between photographers and customers, while using Wemark’s protocol to reward Wemark for distributing the photo and other parties that helped to promote the content (referrals) if applicable.  Our vision is a dedicated token to enable creators to get paid directly from customers and pay for all the services related to creating, protecting and distributing their content. For example, photographers will be able to hire models, buy equipment, and even pay for legal services (if and when needed) using WMK.  Another step in the economy’s evolution is to enable fractional (or partial) ownership of content. This means that creators will be able to “tokenize” their content and share its ownership with other parties. Creators will be able to give a fraction of the ownership over their content (includ- ing future revenue) for those who helped creating it (models, actors, editors, etc.) or for inves- tors and early supporters in the form of crowdfunding.  Wemark will work continuously to develop new ways for the tokens to be used - within and outside the limits of the protocol and Wemark’s products. More use cases are likely to be announced (and added to this White Paper) before the TGE, and frequently after it ends.",False
