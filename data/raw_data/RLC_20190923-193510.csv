These smart contracts are heavy and challenging, which is why iExec has already started their implementation. While there is still work to tackle on the theoretical side, kickstarting implemented as of now and in parallel ensures PoCo is ready on time for V2.

I literally held 30k RLC for fucking months now, totally missing out on pretty much everything. Even with a x5-x6 in marketcap and literally all other alts this has done absolutely nothing. Same marketcap, lower price in satoshi, lower rank in CMC. About +/-0 on my investment. There are pretty much no other investments that increased by nothing after 6 months.  No matter how promising, but there is seemingly just zero reason to hold this, because a hold at least has some progress after 6 months. I'm sorry but if a team doesn't grasp the importance of actually doing ANY MARKETING or PR at all after 6 months, then the future outlook is very grim as well. You can be the best coin on the market, yet nobody will care because nobody knows. Why would anybody even hold or buy this with all other things going on. Just a big waste of fucking opportunity in my opinion. The worst thing that can happen is that nobody cares, talks, makes profit or losses. You can hold another three years being 50m market cap while others are x1000.  Also my impression is that many people just want to get rid of their bags.

Journal du Net is one of the biggest players in the French tech media scene. 9 mln readers visit the website monthly, looking the latest trends and developments. JDN’s newsletter of the 27th of October featured an interesting article on a future marketplace of cloud resources.  The article raised the following question: can a cloud computing marketplace one day appear? While this vision can first be discarded as science-fiction, the truth is companies such as iExec are already taking the lead in making it a reality, by leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as blockchain.  Blockchain allows iExec to orchestrate and secure transactions on the Internet without the need for a trusted third party. The technology is paramount for the commercialization of underutilized or unused cloud resources, in a secure and transparent way. Against the current centralized cloud model, the adoption of the disruptive decentralized model is not an easy matter.  With iExec, the threshold of quality of execution will be held by comparing the results of different providers. If one’s results diverge from the others, its reputation will be diminished, therefore creating a strong incentive towards quality of delivery. In the long run, the marketplace will regulate itself to avoid redundancy of testing between providers with a high level of trust.  The last part of JDN’s article focused on the potential of compute becoming a new financial asset. Global companies with huge IT fleets that are not fully harnessed can put their hardware to work, for example during idle hours or holidays.  This model would also attract cloud providers themselves. With Spot, Amazon already offers a service allowing users to acquire its data centers’ unused resources (at a variable cost relative to supply and demand). Other cloud providers could lean towards the same solution too. This trend could lead to the creation of a whole new market for cloud resource, on which speculators could trade IT power.  https://iex.ec/news/towards-decentralized-marketplace-cloud-resource/",False

The goal of the event was to stay up-to-date with blockchain’s most recent trends in finance.  At the opening, Noelle Acheson, Editorial Producer at Coindesk, recalls that last year’s talks about blockchain were limited to presenting the potential of the technology. Today, the debate on blockchain moved to practical solutions and deployment strategies. iExec is well aware of this shift, and the roadmap of the project is attuned to this need.  Afterwards, Vinay Gupta, Founder at hexayurt.capital, delivered the first talk with a sound-titled presentation: “Let’s Save the World and Make a Lot of Money”. He underlined the impact of combining legal work and blockchain to power innovation and deep change.  David Harris, from the London Stock exchange, echoed the opening of the summit. From his point of view, blockchain is moving fast from experimentation to enterprise-grade projects.  Evgeny Xata, CEO of Cybertrust, focused his talk on blockchain being the 6th wave of the economic development, right after microchips. From his projection, the expected value created from blockchain and artificial intelligence could be worth four times the value created by the microchip revolution.  During the conference, three main topics were discussed. For each one of them, six speakers shared either novel concepts or case studies. - Digital Identity - Transfer and Trading - Smart Contracts  The last panel discussion and questions of the summit were managed by Nikola Tchouparov — CEO & Co-Founder at Moneyfold Ltd, Arnaud Le Hors — Technical Lead at Hyperledger, Mark Simpson — Innovation Engineering at Royal Bank of Scotland and Anthony Macey — ead of Blockchain R&D at Barclays.  In short, they all predicted that standardisation will come from projects backed by great vision, but also from regulatory initiatives originating from centralized structures. iExec is also following this path by being at the forefront of the ICO movement in France, all while meeting with regulators and media to develop best practices for crypto funding.  The rest of the day was perfect to spend time with crypto fans and large corporate companies involved in international development, industrial projects, standardization, and international marketing.

He was ranked among the top 100 innovators by FastCompany China.  5.jpeg  6.jpeg Haiwu He and Gilles Fedak presenting iexec to professionals in France and China 4 — a franco-chinese project The binational aspect of the company opens market opportunity both in the West (notably the biggest market in the world: the EU) and in the East (mainly China, the #1 economy of Asia), Gilles Fedak and Haiwu He have already attempted a lot of events in academic and business circles during the last months to explain their project and build a network and it’s only the beginning, the rhythm should accelerate after their first release  7.jpeg  5 — low market cap Right now the market cap is around 40 millions $ and below ICO price BTC wise. 8.jpeg  6 — blowing the competition out of the water: Golem and SONM are the main competitors but none of them have the expertise or the recognition of the iexec team, the struggle of Golem to deliver the brass compared to the undelayed release of the V1 proves that there is a sharp competence gap between them. The team knows the tech better than everyone else.  9.jpeg #7 — the Enterprise Ethereal alliance Iexec is one of the few EEA member among Ethereum projects.  10.jpeg  8 — decentralized cloud computing is the future There are a lot of new ideas for blockchain applications right now, some have already proved their utility but the vast majority is yet to demonstrate not only that they have a tangible application but that there is a market for them too. iexec doesn’t have this problem, the cloud computing is a booming market and fueled by a growing thirst for processing powering in various domains ranging from scientific research to game servers. Cloud computing is anticipated to represent a 162 billions $ market by 2020 (x2.5 in 5 years!).  11.png  9 — a new marketing force by November Biggest issue with iexec until now was the lack of real marketing, the team has done a lot to communicate on the technical aspect and create relationships in the business and academic world, however the public awareness is still quite low compared to its competitors, this should change after the release of the V1 with a new website and a high profile marketer (if it doesn’t work there are still the /biz/ memes anyway).",False

The award is presented for outstanding new technology innovation. This comes just months after the company closed the fifth largest ICO (Initial Coin Offering) of $12 million (USD) in a record six hours in April, 2017.  According to iExec co-founders, Gilles Fedak and Haiwu He, the company's goal is to expand markets by creating an internet without borders. iExec technology decentralizes transmissions in a blockchain, offering greater accessibility and decentralized applications-based cloud computing. Founded in October 2016, iExec's value proposition is to create a system where anyone in the world can connect with anyone else to employ unused computing power of Internet-connected devices, and according to The Merkle, this could create an entirely new and more accessible internet.  Blockchain is literally a chain of blocks, which digitally transmits and stores computer data in a secure, transparent manner, without a centralized control body, while today the Internet is an interconnected network of private servers. The iExec revolution is to decentralize this process and democratizes usage worldwide, multiplying computing capability.  The origination of the iExec system embodies a new generation of startup, a generation without borders, building an accessible, affordable, mature and innovative new cloud-computing technology. With more than 15 years experience cloud development and related fields, iExec co-founders have significant affinities to seize the opportunity of the blockchain.  Since 2008, the exponential development of crypto-currencies illustrates that the digital revolution is highly dynamic and new technologies, such as those being presented by iExec will significantly enhance how we do business. Blockchain pushes the boundaries of the digital world, allowing new actors to acquire previously inaccessible access.  Source: BW CIO",False

I'd prefer not to weather many (any) storms. But, this asset and this team are about as legit as it gets. So if i must, so be it. Might even buy extra to sell on pumps along the way.

How much research does it take to find something legit?  Did any of you guys read about a couple of RLC team members that were these bad ass coders who've won some hackathon event 2 years in a row? Names Hamid and Mehdi.  Well it turns out their main role was ""Marketing"" and they've left the project already. Btw, the quote was from one of the remaining RLC guys, not sure who. It was on another forum and he was responding to someone that was calling them out about 2 of their lead developers leaving. Apparently attempting, quite poorly, to smooth things over by replying...""If you're refering to Hamid and Mehdi, yes they are great coders, but it's fine with us that they left. We only really knew them a short time, and while they were here they made valuable contributions in marketing, as well as some other crap.... Bla Bla Bla. Marketing tho.  It didn't take long for me to lose $5,000 on RLC, but for some odd reason I still smiled when he referred to fraudulently adding a couple of big names for the sole purpose of deceiving people into believing they'd assembled this awesome team, and therefore make a shit load of money on their ICO, as ""Marketing.""  Which brings me to the bit of bull sh*t i found out. You know how you always see these ICO's where these dev's get paid major bank for a product that doesn't even exist, but at least they lock it up in a smart contract for a year to give them a reason to work hard, and I don't know maybe stay with the team after the ICO!. Well RLC decided not to go that route, and to just go ahead and take the money right after the ICO, and even part ways with 2 of their developers already. Unreal!  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm assuming all of this is fact since the poster in the other forum said all of this, and the RLC member that responded did not dispute any of it.  p.s. The part where I said....""fraudulently adding a couple of big names for the sole purpose of deceiving people into believing they'd assembled this awesome team, and therefore make a shit load of money on their ICO.

As you have seen, the team has evolved between the pre-ICO and post-ICO period. After the ICO, our first priority was to make sure we have a good core devel team to release our first version for Devcon3. And I think that we have an excellent one, with very skilled and experienced coders and devops. Since the ICO, we open-sourced most of our developments  and we  periodically release incremental versions. During the next months, we'll focus on providing developers all the tools, documentation, tutorials, examples they need to port their applications to Ethereum/iExec. Our focus is also on improving our own infrastructures so that developers can rely on a stable, reliable, secure infrastructure to run their distributed applications. So, from the devel point of view we're ready for v1. Concerning the marketing, we're now interviewing people and building the team. At the moment, marketing is basically community management, participation to conferences, content writing and distribution with a focus on the crypto world, discussions with investors and exchange places. From September to 4-6 months after Devcon3, the marketing will focus on evangelizing our solution for off-chain computation. We'll also target developers/companies outside of the crypto world but which are looking at the blockchain tech. At the moment we have many contacts with several companies (some of them are big players). It doesn't  translate yet in partnerships, but things will evolve a lot after we release v1. An important point is that we are now starting to build the team to develop v2. v2 is more challenging from a technical point of view. It requires more research and more innovative/agressive solutions. We're also establishing partnerships with the best academic teams in France and China. That's important to prepare now what is going to be released in 18/24 months from now.  Most probably we'll have PhD students working on reseach topics strongly related to iexec.  I know that it sounds like an eternity  but we are now shaping the team, the partnerships and the strategies for the next four/five years.  From the marketing point of view, after v2 is released, we'll have the ability to expend greatly our market. In particular we'll  have sales people doing B2B business. So  as a company, we'll start to have sources of revenue. This is very important for us to keep this objective as we want to provide products that allow to make real business and not just open source software. So in summary, we're making sure that very short term objectives, but also medium and ""long"" term objectives can be reached successfuly. Of course, we would also like to have good news every day :wink:  C'est la vie ! But some very nice announcements are coming very soon.""",False

Again a stupid newbie that thought it would turn billionaire in 3 days by investing in cryptocurrencies. Are you a developer? Do you have a Ph.D.? Well, if you were educated enough, maybe you would know that you cannot have a Ph.D. in 3 days nor you cannot create an Operating System in 3 days. Things take time, so either you trust the project or either you want a quick profit. If you want quick profits then go for Twitter announcement of others cryptocurrencies about whitepaper release, partnerships, TV announcement or whatsoever. You will surely get profits very short-term.  The team is Top Notch, the communication is maybe not that well and the site, even though it is correct doesn't inspire and is maybe too ""academic"" but I really trust the project (And yet I don't have coins because I want to make quick profits on others crypto before investing in this kind of projects).

I've gotten into Crypto around a year ago and have intensified my research beginning of this year and skim bitcointalk almost every day in search of good projects and hadn't even heard of RLC until today so maybe there needs to be a little more marketing.

The market will be huge. iEx.ec will generate profit if they follow the road map. And the price will increase.  Some big investors are moving their money from one ICO to the next one, but that is not affecting the true value of the project.

Quote Why I sold all my Golem tokens for iEx.ec My confidence in iEx.ec continues to rise. As a result I have sold 100% of my Golem tokens to buy iEx.ec and below in this post I will explain some of my reasoning behind my decision.  IEx.ec so far in my opinion is doing everything right. They have a dream team of developers who are top researchers with doctorate degrees in the specific areas of research necessary for distributed cloud computing. They have an excellent middleware with code already written called XtremWeb-Hep. This middleware is well made and in my estimation will reduce development time to 3 months minus any time spent testing. So from this we know they have the expertise, the code, but of course business is more than just having the code.",False

Platform  Quote Golem are creating their own platform for computations, in our opinion this is similar to reinventing the wheel and has no obvious merit. There’s no clear understanding of what basis for the technology are they using (GRID or Cloud), no logical justification for using Python as their main programming language (Python is web-oriented, creating a platform requires more appropriate language, like C++ or Java).  Seriously, ""(Python is web-oriented, creating a platform requires more appropriate language, like C++ or Java)"". Python being web-oriented and Java is a appropiate language? I would be interested in the reasoning for such statements.  Quote 3. Container  The isolation system used as a core for computing by SONM, iEx and Golem is Docker. All development teams agree that this is the most up-to-date and useful solution. Who are all those developing teams? What is this isolation system? How is it build? What are the advantages over an already existing and throughly tested solution like docker(not to mention it has security failures but what had not?)?  Cheers MM",False

Price is dumping because bounties are being distributed. Bounty people don't trade. They want their money fast. The project is not yet hot it needs time to provide the first real results. Big investors waits and they rather invest in more advanced projects (GNT, STROJ,...).  But the potential of iexec is huge. Let's compare with GNT. ICO --> GNT = $8.5M / RLC = $12.5M (that means RLC team has 50% more cash at start). Market cap today --> GNT = $223M / RLC = $35M  I believe RLC has more potential than GNT even if it started 1 year later. The technical solution is more complete. They have one foot in China.  If we think reasonable that RLC market cap reaches in about one year $150k we can expect the price of RLC up to $1.85 (more than 4 times the actual price). And it is a low estimation I personally expect more.  The point here is to be patient, to believe in the project and to accept to take some long term risks. Too many people wants to make money fast and are doing panic selling after one week.  It is my personal analyze. It is why I continue buying RLC. Let's speak about it in one year  ",False

In term of vision, iEx.ec aims at building a blockchain-based distributed Cloud, while Golem aims at building a worldwide supercomputer.  In term of technology, we benefit from our background in distributed computing. We developed several software on top of which iEx.ec is being built and those software have already being used to build distributed computing infrastructures.  In term of products, we're not addressing the same markets at the same time. iEx.ec is targeting at the first place blockchain-based applications that require extra data, extra applications and extra compute capacities. As we understand Golem, they first target HPC (or let's say HTC, High Throughput Computing) using GND as a mean of payment.  The distributed Cloud provided by iEx.ec will enable a larger range of applications, as the iEx.ec network will enable the applications for which the centralized Cloud is a limiting factor. This includes: blockchain-based applications, IoT +Big Data, distributed machine learning, ambient AI, VR, Edge/Fog computing, smart cities/buildings, etc...  We think that Golem and iEx.ec are somehow both competing against centralized Cloud providers. So I hope that in the future, there will be enough synergy between the two projects to pool our strengths.",False

However I believe this kind of investment scheme is harmful to a project, as it limits the community, and also creates means to manipulate the price, which is unhealthy for any real project.  To prevent this situation, provide more people with fair chance to invest, and so create a wider distribution, would developers consider taking some measures? I mean particularly the following (as an example): a) setting a daily cap on investments (for example 1K BTC per 24 hours) b) limit the number of tokens accepted per single ETH address (for example to something like 50-100K RLC). Sure bigger whaoes can do multiple investments per address, but this limit will slow them down, and allow more people to squeeze in.

The security of your funds is our first priority. To date, we have open sourced the contract, described the security architecture of the crowdsale platform and the code has gone through several internal and external security audits and tests. Open Zeppelin has also openly published the security review of the smart contract, in which no critical errors or vulnerabilities were found, and we have thoroughly applied all their recommendations.  However, we want to go deeper into the process by launching a bug bounty program.  You may be aware that a bug was discovered last week associated with Ethereum that affected the way that tokens are handled by exchanges. In order to ensure the highest levels of security we have decided to push the crowdsale launch back one week to allow time to undertake a more thorough auditing process.  We are committed to our project supporters and to delivering a great product to them — ensuring there is zero risk to crowdsale participants is part of that commitment. So we ask you to bear with us until Wed 19th April.  If you have some programming skills you are invited to participate in our bug bounty program by joining our slack. We reward 50.000 RLC (10BTC) for anyone finding critical vulnerabilities that would prevent the crowdsale to execute correctly. In the meantime, we will continue to strengthen our presence across the community during this additional week. This includes an interview that we have been looking forward to with Epicenter Bitcoin.

The security of your funds is our first priority. To date, we have open sourced the contract, described the security architecture of the crowdsale platform and the code has gone through several internal and external security audits and tests. Open Zeppelin has also openly published the security review of the smart contract, in which no critical errors or vulnerabilities were found, and we have thoroughly applied all their recommendations.  However, we want to go deeper into the process by launching a bug bounty program.  You may be aware that a bug was discovered last week associated with Ethereum that affected the way that tokens are handled by exchanges. In order to ensure the highest levels of security we have decided to push the crowdsale launch back one week to allow time to undertake a more thorough auditing process.  We are committed to our project supporters and to delivering a great product to them — ensuring there is zero risk to crowdsale participants is part of that commitment. So we ask you to bear with us until Wed 19th April.  If you have some programming skills you are invited to participate in our bug bounty program by joining our slack. We reward 50.000 RLC (10BTC) for anyone finding critical vulnerabilities that would prevent the crowdsale to execute correctly. In the meantime, we will continue to strengthen our presence across the community during this additional week. This includes an interview that we have been looking forward to with Epicenter Bitcoin.  Join our crowdsale on 19th April and help launch the future of cloud computing!  Read on iEx.ec's blog",False

Some random remarks :   1) Don't send any BTC or ETH from an exchange. If you don't control your ETH address :: YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE YOUR TOKENS.  So please, if you plan to participate directly, -- e.g. without going through ICO365 or Gatecoin for instance -- use a WALLET .  Same for BTC, f you use an exchange,  it will make the refund process much more complex, so I definitely don't recommend it.  2) all the crowdsale is managed using an Ethereum smart contract that offers full security, transparency and same chance for everyone to participate. It'll start at the same time for everyone. Remember that ETH transaction are always faster than BTC transaction. Favor ETH if you hesitate between the two, it makes the whole process a lot simpler.  3) in case the min cap is not reached, we still generate the tokens and offer anyone a chance to be refund if you wish. It means that bounties will be paid whatever the outcome is.  Thanks for your support,  Gilles",False

A cloud-based network environment connects users to one another, whether server providers, application providers, data providers or end users. All manner of business can be executed on the iExec cloud. Having a decentralized and globally accessible marketplace to trade computing resources will be an invaluable step forward for the cloud computing industry as a whole.  This is taken from Smith and Crown's analysis of Golem: 'The market for Golem is limited to supercomputing which is relatively small. Where CGI rendering is computationally hungry and its scale and frequency is set to grow the market is limited to animators, designers, and architects who might need low-cost rendering options.'",False

In terms of technology, we benefit from our background in distributed computing. We developed several software on top of which iEx.ec is being built and those software have already being used to build distributed computing infrastructures.  In terms of products, we're not addressing the same markets at the same time. iEx.ec is targeting at the first place blockchain-based applications that require extra data, extra applications and extra compute capacities.  As we understand Golem, they first target HPC (or let's say HTC, High Throughput Computing) using GND as a mean of payment. The distributed Cloud provided by iEx.ec will enable a larger range of applications, as the iEx.ec network will enable the applications for which the centralized Cloud is a limiting factor. This includes: blockchain-based applications, IoT +Big Data, distributed machine learning, ambient AI, VR, Edge/Fog computing, smart cities/buildings, etc...  We think that Golem and iEx.ec are somehow both competing against centralized Cloud providers. So we hope that in the future, there will be enough synergy between the two projects to pool our strengths together.",False

It's actually closer to GridCoin, CureCoin than iEx.ec.  Their goal is to rely on the Boinc middleware which has been designed for Volunteer Computing. There are pro and cons with respect to Boinc. The good thing is that there's a large community and it's a well established software. The cons -- IMO it's a very common misunderstanding about Boinc-- is that BOINC has been designed for  one particular kind of applications which are the SETI@home like. That is one almost infinite stream of tasks to execute, and Boinc has a unique ability to execute this kind of workload. No doubt about it. The point is that this kind of applications are very specific and quite rare even in the scientific world and certainly inexistent in the business world. Most of the time people have ""peak"" demand of extra computing capacity and they usually want rapid turn-around for there application. The misunderstanding is that Boinc is inefficient at treating those kind of workloads, which are in fact very common. Let's say you're designing a drug, you want the result of your simulation in couple of hours/days not weeks/months like with Boinc. In contrast XtremWeb-HEP has many features that are needed to implement the distributed Cloud and that are missing in Boinc. Because Boinc has not been designed for that purpose.  Also, another thing is that Boinc is really associated with altruistic behavior. Hard to build business use cases in this context.  But I like their white paper, it was well done. There are a couple of errors, but much less than in the Golem WP. I think that they are more experienced than Golem and they might release something truely useful before Golem.  Now if you look at the previous Oleg's posts, you'll see that we do have an edge (security, VM management, virtual networking), and later Oleg will continue to publish about data management, application management, etc...

The current transaction performance on Ethereum networks is insufficient, putting a barrier up DApps to implement real, complex functionalities.  To enrich the DApps with functionalities and consequently with more computing power, they need to be capable of going outside their underlying blockchain to get those resources. This is what we call “off-chain” computation.  From this perspective, iEx.ec provides the DApps with a mandatory (and missing) capability to access off-chain computation resources.   ... read more about how the iEx.ec technology powers up DApps at https://medium.com/iex-ec/iex-ec-a-blockchain-revolution-of-the-cloud-computing-business-2427f76c64f0#.ude8vw98f",False

Wallet meaning that we would handle the private keys of participants. the solution we're implementing do not require us to do that. participants will be given BTC and ETH address to send their token to. We'll generate the token on the ETH blockchain using a smart contract. We're aiming at full transparency.  2) during the next two weeks, we're going to put more emphasis on the PoC, so that people can learn about the tech and early developers get a hand on the platform. that's very timely because EDCON approaches and we hope to have some feedback from the Ethereum developers.

It's  true that in the case of minimum funding 50% of the supply is sold. But it's not correct to say that 50% of the coin is for the devs.  Project like iEx.ec has the goal of building a network. Without the network, the coin has little value for the token holders. Right ?  We took the decision of having a fixed supply of coins, and this is an advantage for the token holders.  On the other hand, there must have some incentives to grow the network. With iEx.ec there's no mechanism such as mining reward, such as with Bitcoin and Ethereum.  And this is a very important point. In the case of minimum funding, a part of the coins that are not sold during the crowdsale can be used to grow the network (developper bounties, grants to support access to servers, iEx.ec summer of code etc..).  In the case of maximum funding, this is less necessary, because we provide more advanced features that will help bring more actors in the network. Like enterprises for instance.  There is a balance to find between token holders, the iEx.ec team, the iEx.ec resource providers so that the network grows and while the token keeps its value.  iEx.ec is definitely not a ""paper project"". We're a team with a true experience in building distributed infrastructures. And we know what we want to achieve and how we can do this.",False

I really like Gridcoin. It's a very inspiring project. It's too bad this project is mainly known in the crypto world. It would deserve to have a much broader audience in Grid, Cloud, HPC communities.  Nevertheless, there are differences.  Gridcoin monitors the activity that happened on a Boinc server. It's called Proof-of-Research, if IIRC. So, somehow the consensus for an off-chain computation is realized when the task executed by a volunteer has been validated by Boinc.  With PoCo (Proof-of-Contribution), we want go one step further, and generalize this to a broader range of applications. Not only the one provided by BOINC servers.  The goal is to allow blockchain developers  to put their own applications to the iEx.ec distributed cloud. Think it as a sort of oraclize meets Golem somehow.  PS: Next answer in 6 minutes  ",False

Developers can rent computing power, servers and data centers and make their unused resources available through a unique marketplace on the Ethereum blockchain.  Who uses iEx.ec and why?  There is a growing demand for computing power from industries and scientific communities to run large applications and process huge volumes of data. All sorts of applications can be hosted on the iEx.ec cloud and for different reasons.  Dapps (blockchain-based applications) that need off-chain computation. High Performance Computing, Big Data, machine learning for product design (shorter time-to-market, better product testing, reduced design cost). This is typical for “traditional” industries, like aeronautics,  health and biomedical, oil & gaz, finance, etc…   Future distributed applications that will require new form of decentralized infrastructure see Edge/Fog computing, ambient AI, IoT + Big Data, distributed deep learning, parallel stream processing etc...  What is the legal structure of iEx.ec?  iEx.ec is a company incorporated in France under the name IEXEC BLOCKCHAIN TECH (SIRET 82307092500016).  Where is iEx.ec at the moment?  Headquarters and research center are located in the city of Lyon, France. iEx.ec is a spin-off company from the INRIA research institute. iEx.ec China is located in Beijing, accelerated  by the SEM X-elerator from the prestigious Tsinghua University.  What about the team experience?  For the past decade, we have been key contributors in the area of Distributed Computing, proposing many algorithms, developing software, but also establishing real computing infrastructures that are used by many scientific worldwide. As a team we published more than 80 scientific papers, some of them in the most selective conferences, won two best paper awards, raised more than 1.2 M€ of EU grants.  Since September the team has grown to include blockchain developers, PR and marketing specialists, and business developers.  Why is your technology worth $2 million?  For the last 10 years, we have developed a large portfolio of technologies to establish the distributed Cloud.   XtremWeb-HEP is a mature, solid, and open-source software that allows to use any kind of computing resources for executing compute-intensive or data-intensive applications.  XtremWeb-HEP provides many advanced features such as: fault-tolerance, multi-applications, multi-users, hybrid public/private infrastructure, deployment of virtual images, data management, security and accountability, overlay network, VM management, sandboxing, support for HPC standards, and many more.  What is the role of RLC tokens on the iEx.ec cloud?  RLC is the native token of the iEx.ec cloud platform. In exchange of RLC tokens, users will be able to use the network for example, rent servers, data and applications to execute their distributed applications.  Why a crowdfund and not traditional funding?  We must distribute the RLC tokens for our distributed project to have a ‘market network’. We want it to be a project for the public so it is important that we start building it with you, since you will be the users and also the benefactors.  Why do you have such a high target to raise?  The technology is expensive to deploy at large scale. We know how much it has cost to commission these types of networks because we have done so in the past (see EDGI). We have to support the users, provides documentation, train the developers, convince providers etc... We also must be sure that the market network is there - by that we mean the number of tokens in circulation is enough to warrant the title ‘distributed’.  What currencies do you accept?  The crowdsale platform is designed to accept both ETH and BTC.  How can I do if I don’t have any BTC or ETH?  If you have any other crypto-currency, you can use Shapeshift (https://shapeshift.io) to switch to BTC or ETH. If don’t have any crypto-currency, we recommend to use an exchange platforms like Kraken, Bitfinex or BTC-e.  Will RLC token be tradeable?  Once you received your tokens, you own them and can do whatever you like with them. If by ‘tradeable’ you mean ‘listed on any exchange platform’, then you can directly ask them.  Here’s a list of all major exchanges: https://www.cryptocoincharts.info/markets/info  Can I join the crowdsale without an Ethereum address?  No because you need it to receive your tokens. If you don’t have one, you can create one using MyEtherWallet or any other secured. It is important to make sure your account is properly backed up.  What will you do with the money?  It will cover the costs of developing and launching the iEx.ec Cloud. As indicated on our roadmap, we’ll release the Community Edition (production version) 6 months after the end of the crowdsale (M6).  What kind of escrow service do you use?  We use a set of Ethereum smart contracts which code will go public before the crowdsale.
