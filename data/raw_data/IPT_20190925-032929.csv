Even though that many analysts promised that the rates will be back up by the end of 2018. As a result, everyone made a mistake with the forecasts -  experienced traders, digital asset market experts, and trusted financial leaders.  Co-founder of Fundstrat Global Investors and trusted financial analyst, Tom Lee predicted that at the end of 2018, Bitcoin would meet a mark of $25,000. Later, at the end of November, he lowered the mark down to $15,000. With all due respect to Tom now we can state the fact that this steep turn is unlikely to happen. In an interview for CNBC, Tom Lee commented on his unsuccessful predictions, saying that lowering the price of bitcoin lower than a psychological mark of 6,000 ""was the cause of a new wave of pessimism."" In his opinion, the fair price of digital gold should be 2.5 times more, than the cost of mining it. And that it’s necessary to build on self-sufficiency ""- the level at which the cost of mining Bitcoin corresponds to its trading rate. Back im the yewar of 2017 Roni Moas, Head of investment company Standpoint Research promised that by the end of 2018 the rate of Bitcoin will be at $ 50,000. Many other analysts of the cryptocurrency market also made their predictions, and all of them where looking good, and the Bitcoin price was supposed  to go up.  So, what to do during a prolonged downtrend - buy, sell or just wait for better times? There are several options that are out there, one of the best ones for example, is to invest in promising Crypt-ON platform being developed as a solution to many problems of modern financial markets.

We have already told you how the idea of creating a Crypt-ON platform was born. Today we will share with you our thoughts about what's common among Crypt-ON and other projects, and, most importantly, what are its significant differences and advantages.  Paul doesn't try to compare the Crypt-ON with any other projects, as, in his opinion, the platform has no competitors at the moment.  Paul doesn't deny that some startups are looks similar to Crypt-ON, but their goals are easier. Crypt-ON focused on the global level of solving the problems of financial markets. Yes, many projects aimed at these markets, and Crypt-ON would be lost among them, if not set a goal to offer something new to the market. The primary vector of development of the project is its gradual evolution into an ecosystem of many services combined on a single platform. Thus, it is planned to cover all the layers of the needs of financial market participants, giving them the opportunity to effectively optimize most business processes by saving time and additional costs for intermediaries in the face of financial and legal institutions.  For those of you not familiar with the roadmap of the project and the nuances of the operation mechanics of the platform, we recommend you to visit our website and look at the sections of the WhitePaper and Roadmap.  In the next publication, we will talk about how the crypto community reacted to the idea of creating a Crypt-ON platform.",False

One of these speakers was Roger Ver — acting CEO of Bitcoin.com, whom Paul Andreev meet not the first time during a visit to essential blockchain events.   During the conference, the prospects of the crypto-currency market, ways of earning, problems of legal regulation and many other issues of concern to the audience discussed. However, there were also frankly empty speeches, the content of which would have been relevant a year ago, but not now at the end of 2018. Also striking was the fact that the companies represented at the forum were mostly either exchanges or ICO-startups, and all would be nothing, but there was catastrophically not enough of investors. Besides, unfortunately, there were no startups that would really challenge the world by offering something revolutionary. Nevertheless, the very organization of the forum was great.  The rest of the forum was mostly similar to other events that held in the Russian Federation and other countries.

This series of articles will cover topics such as the future of the project, the situation in the cryptocurrency market, how is work on the creation of the platform going and many others.  It is no secret that all projects come from the world of ideas and then come to life, the same way from concept to reality developing our platform. Paul Andreev told how the idea of the Crypt-ON project was born.  “Initially, a few years ago, there was an idea of creating an escrow service for entrepreneurs to ensure the security of transactions. For several years, this idea was transformed and refined. The spread of blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies has left its mark: Paul decided to combine the escrow service with the job exchange for hiring employees and the service of loans, all this supposed to be provided by the internal i-Point currency. These basics reflected in the platform, which now each of you can see on our website and test through our MVP.  Thus, Crypt-ON is a product, the detailed planning of which took several years; it is a flexible system that has absorbed the latest technologies and is a synthesis of traditional services and modern achievements in the field of information technology”.  Here was our first question, and in the following article, you will know that became a marker of the need to create a multiservice platform.",False

Many analysts and experts believe that primarily we need any specialists related to the blockchain industry. This fact is confirmed by the indeed.com, according to which reports the demand for blockchain specialists in the only US increased by 25%. In his turn, Tom Lee, co-founder and financial analyst at Fundstrat Global Advisors, in an interview with CNBC stated that he believes the Bitcoin will rise in price to $15,000 by the end of 2018. He justifies his forecasts by the fact that the fair value of the cryptocurrency should be at least 2.5 times higher than the cost of its mining. Building on the point of self-sustainability Tom Lee is confident in his forecasts, despite the negative situation in the cryptocurrency market and the bitcoin price slide to $4582. Not so long ago, another crypto guru and programmer John McAfee made a similar assumption based on his many years of experience.  We support the views of analysts since their previous forecasts were true or close to the truth, and agree with them that there is a need to involve new personnel in the crypto industry, blockchain specialists, experienced developers who will be able to bring cryptocurrencies to an entirely new level, the one they deserve.

CEO of the Crypt-ON Paul Andreev, visiting this prestigious event, appreciated the level of its organization. He stressed that this event is significantly different from many of its kind in that it was attended exclusively by people involved in the industry, crypto-enthusiasts, trendsetters, eminent speakers, project managers and leaders of the crypto community. All of them came for the exchange of experience, networking, presentation of ideas and projects, and, of course, communication.  The atmosphere was inviting to communication, and our CEO found a common language with several investors who expressed their interest in the future of the Crypt-ON platform. Negotiations with them continue, and now, so we will inform you about developments.  Paul also had a short informal conversation with the Creator Of McAfee antivirus and a living legend of the crypto world John McAfee. John spoke positively about the Crypt-ON project and wished Paul success in further work on the project.  During working hours the conference discussed the prospects of replacing ICO with STO. In addition to a large number of different startups, a significant part of the participants represented by Maltese companies interested in attracting capital to Malta. Since all the participants literally “cheered” for the future of blockchain technology, the discussions were sometimes very large-scale and lively, not without polemic.  The entertainment program organized so perfectly that the course of time wasn’t noticed: the week passed as an instant.  Summarizing, we can say with confidence that the conference was successful: both in general and for the Crypt-ON project. The agreements reached should allow us to attract new investors shortly, and networking with other projects, reliable and reputable partners. And most importantly, thanks to such events, it becomes evident that the blockchain it is serious and for a long time. It is a future.",False

By the end of stage 1, our project raised $1.166.370, and we sincerely thank everyone for their support!  We remind you that the Crypt-ON is a p2p platform, built with the use of blockchain technologies for secure trades in cryptocurrency, is useful for entrepreneurs, startups, project managers, headhunters, freelancers, crypto-investors and everyone who carries out operations with cryptocurrencies.  Today, November 16 the second stage of TGE starts, which will last until November 30. The planned maximum volume of IPT tokens for sale is up to $4,000,000. The discount on tokens is 10%, and the cost of one IPT token in dollar equivalent is $0.09. It is still an excellent opportunity to become a token holder at a reasonable price.  The minimum volume of token purchase in dollar equivalent shouldn’t be less than 50 USD. FIAT, BTC, ETH, LTC, DASH, BCH, BTG are accepted.  What is needed? * Register on the website https://ico.crypt-on.io/ * Pass verification in your Personal Account by providing documents confirming your identity. * Pay for I-Point tokens by making a transfer to the specified address.  If you need help in purchasing tokens — join the project telegram chat, and we definitely will help you.  Many people ask if TGE could end ahead of time. The answer is Yes, maybe, subject to the raising of the maximum amount of $16,000,000.  The received funds will be evenly distributed for product development and promotion according to the financial plan.  So, TGE must go on! Are you in? Crypt-ON team",False

Our social media presence doesn’t go unnoticed. The crypto community has already begun to realize that by cooperating with us you can receive a generous reward. What is only the recent launch turbo-bounty worth? In just a few actions and a little activity, you can get a decent reward from $50 to $120 (in BTC equivalent). The first three lucky ones have already received an honestly earned cryptocurrency.  Attention! We remind you that the Turbo-bounty will be held weekly. Detailed information about terms of participation can be found here: https://medium.com/@Crypt__ON/turbo-bounty-from-crypt-on-round-1-deec3737173b!  By the way, about the rewards. Already today, ten lucky winners will become owners of $10 to $100, just by taking a poll in our Telegram chat. You can also take part in the poll, but hurry up; the results will be announced on November 15 at 12.00 (UTC+3)  Our airdrop suspended recently. The reason is trivial, there are a lot of participants, and we need to check all the results before tokens charging. Next week we will announce the date when the tokens will be credited to your wallet. Today, a little more than 18,000 people took part in the airdrop from Crypt-ON. Thank you all for your activity!  In parallel, work on the product is underway. Crypt-ON in its MVP combined quite an extended functionality of the future services of the platform; we do not stand still and continue to improve our product. The most significant changes that have been made recently can be called: the dashboard of arbitrators added, in which the administrator can find out how many transactions the arbitrator has made, and most importantly — in what status they are (arbitration, completed, unsuccessful), also in this dashboard you can see reviews about the arbitrator. The mechanism of the transaction changed. If the arbitrator in the trade is chosen to be Crypt-ON, then only signatures from the buyer and the seller are required in this transaction.  We invite everyone to take part in testing MVP of Crypt-ON platform. It will not only help us to identify existing shortcomings/bugs of the product and take into account all the needs of users, but also bring you a nice bonus in the form of IPT tokens.  October, like September, was filled with bright events, meetings, negotiations, conferences, which helped us to understand that the team is moving in the right direction. So, for the past two weeks, Crypt-ON CEO Paul Andreev visited two important events: international forum Blockchain Life in St. Petersburg in company with our head of SMM Department Andrey Maxunov and Malta Blockchain Week, where he managed to establish contact with significant investors who are interested in the Crypt-ON project. They have expressed their intention to invest in it (for privacy reasons to comply with the formalities, we do not disclose the names of our future business partners). Did not stay away from the events of October IR-project Manager Paul Almazov who visited the World Crypto Con in Las Vegas, where he held some important meetings with American investors and potential partners. Results of the negotiations will be announced later.  Stay in touch;) Crypt-ON team",False

At the same time, the customer’s account must have enough i-Point tokens to pay for the contractor’s services; otherwise, he will not be able to publish the task. 3. Performers submit applications. 4. Customers consider candidates and confirm their choice. The contractor and the customer specify in advance the terms of a deal recorded in the smart-contract. 5. The task goes to work. After its execution, the contractor sends the results of the work for verification. 6. Payment for the finished service/work is carried out in i-Point tokens. 7. If the work had been violated the conditions fixed in the smart contract, an arbitrator includes in the dispute resolution. The arbitrator acts as a third party in the multi-signature of the smart-contract. 8.

Do you still doubt the growth of the main cryptocurrency? However, the head of Galaxy Digital Mike Novogratz, as the legendary John McAfee, confident that the price of BTC will soar to $20 000  in 2019. And that all because institutional investors are interested in cryptocurrencies. Opinion leaders of the crypto community are sure that the development of blockchain technology and the launch of new platforms using innovative tools, such as Crypt-ON, will attract the new capital flows into the crypto industry.  Mike, as a successful crypto investor, has already made statements about the price increase. In last November, when bitcoin literally soared in price, he said that by the end of 2018 one should not be surprised at the rate of $40 000 for one bitcoin.  Why can we expect the growth of cryptocurrencies? According to Novogratz, the development of the regulatory framework for the cryptoindustry can become a reason for growth; it wipes out regulatory uncertainty that will deter fraudsters and will attract large investors.  Not all large investment companies share the view of Mike Novogratz; only a few agreed to create a legal framework for their projects. Lawyers of the Crypt-ON project have been working on the creation of a stable, reliable and legitimate legal basis for several months. We are in favor your funds invested in the project to be protected and work for its development.  You still can manage to purchase IPT tokens with a 15% discount valid for two days remaining until the end of stage 1 of TGE.  Crypt-ON team",False

Deployed detailed road-map, carefully structured white-paper with a beautiful corporate design, an exorbitant number of advisors and mentors. Above all, most of them have nothing to offer potential investors except promises and beautiful slogans about decentralization and the new digital economy. However, other startups come to tokensale having working MVP (minimum viable product). One of them is the Crypt-ON, which is due to its final MVP compares favorably with startups that draw magical prospects only on paper. In confirmation, we can cite data from the ICORating portal: 46.6% of the total ICO projects for the first quarter of 2018 did not have an MVP at all, 15.5% created an alpha version of the product, 11.2%-a beta version, 0.5% of projects had a primary code. Thus, only 26.2% of projects had final MVP.  Crypt-ON in its MVP combined quite an extended functionality of future platform services. At the moment, we have implemented the functionality of transactions creating and tracking, which allows users to exchange goods and services with each other freely. Transactions in the test (demo) mode can store various information relating to the participants, including their correspondence.  As we have previously stated, it is possible to appeal to third parties to resolve disputes arising in the course of the transaction between the parties. Now users have the opportunity to choose a qualified expert from the catalog, which gradually swells with new names.  For further successful evolving we plan to implement a program of close interaction with users. The main task of this program will be to get feedback for the generating and testing of hypotheses for the further development of the product. We currently implemented a form to contact the resource manager to infill the catalog of the arbitrators’ skills and determination of their areas of expertise. Nevertheless, this is not enough. Obviously, it is necessary to implement a more detailed scheme of interaction, that minimizes the total time spent on the iteration.  We invite everyone to take part in Crypt-ON platform MVP testing. It will not only help us to identify the current shortcomings of the product and take into account all the needs of users, but also bring you a nice bonus in the form of IPT tokens.  To participate in testing follow this link: https://main.crypt-on.io/.  Let’s make our platform better together!

He had an excellent opportunity to hear to the speeches of the Bitcoin Fund Chairman Brock Pierce and its founder Charlie Shrem, Litecoin founder Charlie Lee and others. Why did such a large-scale conference start on October 31? All because this day Bitcoin was celebrating its 10th anniversary, and skipping this a was disrespectful to the digital currency at least.  The active position of some speakers was interesting not only to a narrow circle of traders but also to the entire crypto-community. So programmer and Creator of Litecoin cryptocurrency Charlie Lee in last December sold all his digital money. In an interview with CNBC, he noted that today the value of cryptocurrencies is more speculative, but in the long term, everything can change dramatically. According to his forecasts, Bitcoin will return to the maximum in just six months. Why does Charlie not plan to buy cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin? He said that he had sold all his assets because of conflicting interests, and will not buy them, but advises to take a closer look to cryptocurrencies for those who plan to invest.  Charlie Lee once again drew attention to the necessity to scale the cryptocurrency, and it uses more as a means of payment than accumulation.  By these words, he unobtrusively supported the Crypt-ON platform, the main task of which is to create a business environment where everyone can conduct secure transactions in cryptocurrency, use p2p exchanger, hire people to work and pay for their work, borrow, and all these using cryptocurrency.  Only through joint efforts, using digital assets as a means of payment, we will be able to give the green light to digital money.  It was digital assets that all the topics of the speakers of the blockchain conference in San Francisco were focused.",False

In the course of pre-TGE Crypt-ON, that took place from October 1 to October 30, 884,750 USD was collected. Hundreds of crypto enthusiasts from more than 40 countries in the world have participated in the pre-TGE stage of our project. We went through an important part of the journey, which showed how much crypto-enthusiast community believes in our project. And, despite the fact that we have not collected exactly 1 million, we believe that with the current state of the cryptocurrency market, in conditions of a protracted downtrend, we showed excellent results.  Our developers, working tirelessly, continued to work on MVP, because we as a team understand that there is a gap between the beautifully laid out idea and product that you can test and evaluate. During pre-TGE Crypt-ON launch, large cryptomedia resources like Bitcoinist, FX Empire, The CoinShark, Coinspeaker had written about our project.  Communities of our followers in social networks demonstrated impressive growth:  ★ Our Twitter community has grown to 8,700 followers!  ★ Reddit is also slowly growing, there are already almost 2000 of us!  ★ The Facebook community has over 10,000 members!  ★ Today’s Crypt-ON Telegram Community has 17,000 active users!  ★ On bitcointalk.com there are already over 5500 views of our topic!  And yet, over the month, more than 13,000 people took part in the Airdrop from Crypt-ON. And theu will receive their IPT tokens very soon. Starting tomorrow, we will launch a new mini campaign: turbo-bounty, participation in which will allow not only to earn IPT tokens, but also to participate in weekly draws for 250 USD!  A number of big and trustworthy rating platforms had a look at our project, and many experts have left positive feedback.         Now let’s talk about our events.  We had a number of conferences with cryptocurrency exchange parties, and we have reached with some of them positive preliminary agreement. For obvious reasons, we cannot disclose details. We can only declare that active negotiations with various trading platforms continue in November.  Paul Andreev, the CEO of Crypt-ON have visited a number of major blockchain-events in October, where he interacted with many potential partners and investors, as well as industry leaders such as Changpeng Zhao and Roger Ver. New events and new photo stories are waiting for you in November.   We remind you that on October 31st, the first stage of the TGE started, and it will last until November 15th. The maximum amount of IPT tokens for sale: up to threshold of $ 2 000 000. Discount on tokens will be 15%, and the cost of one token IPT in dollar equivalent — $ 0.085. The minimum purchase amount of tokens in dollar equivalent should not be less than 50 USD.  We really appreciate feedback from our community, so We ask you to answer 5 simple questions that will help us to improve our work  Please complete the straw poll: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkRT7avR7qk6aCNvnTQr3V2TFseVe3Iqo_r1UhE3XlFSN02w/viewform  _____________________________  Thank you all for your support!

Our team has a rule - there is no limit to perfection. Of course, this doesn't mean that we are crazy perfectionists (perhaps some of us ) But, it means that we are continuously working on improvements in any possible cases and aspects. And this doesn't only reflect on the product itself, but it also affects all of the promotions within the project, as well as working with the community.  We are open to everything new. We do not rely on traditional strategies / formats and try to be at the forefront of all trends not only in our product, but also in our marketing.  And we thought, what could be more awesome than bounty campaigns? That's right, only turbo bounty!  And here is how it's going to be: 10 percent of the total bounty pool will be distributed over the next 10 weeks - 1% for each week. Starting this week, every Friday in the bounty chat we will post a task that will need to be completed in the next seven days. After that, all of the participants who have completed the task in compliance with the conditions described in the current stage of the turbo-bounty, will receive their stacks.  But that's only one part of the picture! We have prepared a special surprise, for you! In addition to the stacks received for completing a task at the end of each stage, we will randomly play 250 real dollars between three lucky ones: 120, 80 and 50 USD for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd places respectively!

So how you feel about the fact that shortly Visa payment system can start working with bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? It would be the best news for the crypto industry and perhaps it will happen soon.  By the way, in October this year, Visa has already announced the integration of Hyperledger Fabric blockchain technology in their cross-border payments service B2B Connect. It is an excellent affirmation that cryptocurrencies slowly but surely displace fiat money from the sphere of finance. By the way, this is said not only by crypto-gurus, whose opinion is notable just for people involved in the crypto industry but also by people who not directly connected with cryptocurrencies, as Al Kelly — CEO of Visa.  In an interview with CNBC, he expressed the opinion that if digital assets are recognized, the payment giant is ready to start working with cryptocurrencies. He noted that at the moment, cryptocurrencies needs to “move from being a commodity to really being a payment instrument.”  Simultaneously, he said, if crypto “goes in [the] direction [of fiat]” Visa will also “move in that direction. We want to be in the middle of every payment flow in the world.” The Crypt-ON team is also sure that sooner or later cryptocurrencies will be able to displace Fiat money thanks to blockchain technology, and we are doing everything to become one of the largest and most successful financial blockchain projects of this year.  By the way, today you have the last chance to buy IPT tokens at the most favorable price with a 20% discount.  Keep for updates. Thank you all for your support!  Crypt-ON team",False

Deployed detailed road-map, carefully structured white-paper with a beautiful corporate design, an exorbitant number of advisors and mentors. Above all, most of them have nothing to offer potential investors except promises and beautiful slogans about decentralization and the new digital economy. However, other startups come to tokensale having working MVP (minimum viable product). One of them is the Crypt-ON, which is due to its final MVP compares favorably with startups that draw magical prospects only on paper. In confirmation, we can cite data from the ICORating portal: 46.6% of the total ICO projects for the first quarter of 2018 did not have an MVP at all, 15.5% created an alpha version of the product, 11.2%-a beta version, 0.5% of projects had a primary code. Thus, only 26.2% of projects had final MVP.  Crypt-ON in its MVP combined quite an extended functionality of future platform services. At the moment, we have implemented the functionality of transactions creating and tracking, which allows users to exchange goods and services with each other freely. Transactions in the test (demo) mode can store various information relating to the participants, including their correspondence.  As we have previously stated, it is possible to appeal to third parties to resolve disputes arising in the course of the transaction between the parties. Now users have the opportunity to choose a qualified expert from the catalog, which gradually swells with new names.  For further successful evolving we plan to implement a program of close interaction with users. The main task of this program will be to get feedback for the generating and testing of hypotheses for the further development of the product. We currently implemented a form to contact the resource manager to infill the catalog of the arbitrators’ skills and determination of their areas of expertise. Nevertheless, this is not enough. Obviously, it is necessary to implement a more detailed scheme of interaction, that minimizes the total time spent on the iteration.  We invite everyone to take part in Crypt-ON platform MVP testing. It will not only help us to identify the current shortcomings of the product and take into account all the needs of users, but also bring you a nice bonus in the form of IPT tokens.

The main idea reflected in the name “P2P” — it also means “person-to-person.” Such an online service is usually a site where potential lenders and borrowers find each other, stipulate the essential terms of the loan — terms, interest rate and others, and then conclude a deal with each other. All interaction based on competition for the lowest interest rate. P2P lending looks more profitable than traditional regarding saving time and additional costs for intermediaries fees. Because of this, it has become quite widespread with the development of the Internet.  Our platform also does not stand aside: one of the Crypt-ON services will help borrowers and lenders in finding each other. The process will be as follows. Firstly, the user places an announcement of willing to lend or borrow a certain amount and under certain conditions. The system automatically selects contractors, if the user is not satisfied with the proposed options, it is possible to choose the appropriate counterparty manually. After the parties agree on the terms of the lend and repayment, the system reserves the agreed amount on the lender’s account and forms a smart contract, which fixes all the terms of the transaction. Then both parties sign a smart-contract, and the funds credited to the borrower’s account.  The loan repaid automatically: at the end of the payment term, the funds debited from the borrower’s account. However, it is possible that the funds for repayment are not enough, then the conditions are considered unfulfilled, and the refund procedure started, which occurs in three stages. At the first stage, the system offers the parties to cancel the previous contract and conclude a new one on new terms. If at least one party does not agree, the system at the next stage offers the borrower to replenish the account within three days, and could, by consent of the borrower, automatically generate and place an ad on the search for a new loan to repay the current one. If these two stages do not solve the problem of repayment, the platform, by the consent of the lender, transfers this to external independent organizations for settlement of the dispute in the legal field of the relevant jurisdiction.  Today, P2P platforms firmly held among the fastest growing segments. The volume of p2p transactions is overgrowing with the development of mobile applications, it already exceeds $1 billion per year, and in the last few years shows a steady growth of 50–80%. According to economic forecasts, the total volume of p2p lending will grow from $60 billion in 2015 to $1 trillion in 2024. With the development of blockchain technology, such platforms as Crypt-ON can seriously compete with traditional financial institutions, as they offer an algorithm for direct interaction of participants and a rating system that will help to form an objective and transparent register of borrowers.",False

The “DAO” abbreviation means Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Based on the name, it can be understood that such organizations differ from the usual in autonomy and lack of centralized management. In such a system there is no vertical of power, there are no such institutions as the Board of Directors or the company owner. The power divided between all participants of the platform; in fact, there is a horizontal distribution of influence. This distribution becomes possible thanks to the development of blockchain technologies, which makes it possible to record all participants in a single open register, which is a guarantee of transparency of the processes taking place.  Autonomy achieved through the creation of a certain set of rules binding for all participants, an approved plan for the development of the platform and automatic execution of daily operations based on the program code. Decisions on the future development of the system made by Consensus, but decisions not formed randomly, but strictly per the development plan, where laid the foundations and vector of development of the organization. The” weight “ of a user’s vote usually determined by the number of platform tokens owned by the user. Than more he holds, the more weighty is his opinion. However, there may be other options for the distribution of effect on the organization development. So, by consensus, the most authoritative users can be elected who will be allowed to submit to the General discussion of the future stages of development. Thus, the system minimizes spam in the sphere of proposed solutions by itself.  Replacement fiat currency to cryptocurrency eliminates the reference to the traditional financial and political institutions, but does not exclude the cooperation with these institutions if it is needed.  It is also important to use smart contracts in the process of user interaction. In such contracts are fixed as rules and conditions of use of the system that are mandatory for execution by all participants, and personally customizable terms that are chosen by the participants of transactions. Automation of interaction between users eliminates unnecessary costs for legal support of operations.  Greater control over investments achieved through an equal share of each user’s participation in the organization. And this development of systems is promising, at least because such a structure is more reliable than the traditional one, by eliminating the influence of the human factor, as mistakes of managers or their dishonesty. Such errors are impossible if all users make decisions.  The use of DAO structure is also suitable for traditional corporations, where it is possible to replace the vertical structure of any Department. For example, the replacement of the financial Department will avoid fraud with the company’s budget and disputes with the remuneration of employees.  The possibility of joint development management, transparency of decision — making, minimizing the risks associated with the sole management of the system or the concentration of power in the hands of a narrow group of people — these are the reasons why our project includes such a crucial stage of evolution as the creation of DAO.",False

So Bitcoin.com CEO plans to acquire an existing platform or find a partner to create a new product. It is reported at www.bloomberg.com, with referring to Roger Ver’ Executive Director and statement of Ver himself in Malta, where he became the most anticipated speaker.  Roger Ver is well known to crypto-enthusiasts as an early bitcoin investor and the most ardent supporter of Bitcoin Cash, which currently ranks fourth in the CoinMarketCap rating in capitalization.  Ver plans to launch his own platform at bitcoin.com and make Bitcoin Cash the primary currency. Perhaps not all the crypto community is thrilled about such an active promotion of Bitcoin Cash, but Crypt-ON CEO Paul Andreev and the whole project team supports the initiative of creating another crypto-exchange. This is another decisive step towards de-monopolization of the cryptocurrency market. At the last September summit (Futurama Blockchain Innovators Summit) in Ibiza, Paul listened to Roger Ver speech about decentralized exchanges, and their role in the crypto-industry. The development of Crypt-ON as a project presupposes the creation of DAO in the future, so the topic raised by Roger Ver was significant for the project CEO. Subsequently, Paul and Roger personally talked about decentralization.  Just to remind you:  Crypt-ON is a multi-service p2p platform built on smart contracts and an individual rating system.  We are confident that at the stage of the pre-TGE completion, such news will be a powerful impetus for the development of the platform, as we go in the right direction, driven by a common goal — to be helpful to the global crypto community.",False

(Local crypto) P2P-exchange is one of them. The development of this service was prompted by a potential opportunity to make the process of cryptocurrency exchange faster and more cost-effective by creating the conditions for the exchange of funds within one platform. Our service will act as a tool for exchange, and a guarantor of compliance with the terms of the transaction. This process will look like this: first, the seller or buyer must place an advertisement on the site to sell or buy cryptocurrency. At the time of placing the ad, the system will check the sellers account for the necessary funds. When the parties find each other on such an ad, and the system will determine the location of both counterparties based on geolocation data in the mobile application, which will allow the parties to choose the closest counterparty with the best rating and verify their reality. Then parties discuss and approve the terms of the transaction, such as time and place, after which they fixed in the smart contract, and when this stage passed the system will “freeze” the specified amount of cryptocurrency on the seller’s account. Exactly one hour before the meeting, the mobile application will notify the parties about the place and time of the deal. If any of the parties did not going stop the transaction or change the place and time, after confirmation by the seller in the application of receiving money from the buyer, the cryptocurrency would be credited to the buyer’s account. Exchanged money can be transferred both in cash and by electronic transfer. In case of cancellation of the transaction — the reserved funds will be returned to the seller’s account, and if the parties want to postpone the meeting to another time or place, it can be done in a predetermined time. All actions of parties in the process of the transaction will be recorded in the blockchain and rating system will be formed on these data: the more responsible and decent the parties will act in the trade, the higher will be their rating and the more other users will want to deal with them.",False

What is it and what is it for? KYC (Know your Client, sometimes — Know your Customer) — is the policy followed by banks and financial institutions to verify the identity of their customers. It is mandatory for financial transactions. For the first time, the procedure introduced at the beginning of 2000-es and now this measure is used to identify the individual who conducts an online transaction to prevent the money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud. Why is Crypt-ON platform required KYC? The verification procedure allows holding a tokensale as transparently as possible. We make it clear to partners and registered users that they are dealing with a platform for legal transactions only, and this why it is necessary to pass verification. All personal information protected by encryption, besides, the user has the right to choose the ID document for account verification. The platform receives reliable information and does not allow users to register multiple profiles at the same time. After verification, you confirm your intentions and agree to process your personal data. For the platform, it is a signal that you become a part of it and ready to use the services, participate in the development of the platform and increase your trust-rating. At the same time, the KYC procedure is not always needed. For example, if you participate in a Crypt-ON bounty campaign or airdrop, you do not need to pass the verification. You just need to follow the instructions governing participation in the relevant event to get IPT tokens to your wallet.  Are you not with us? KYC it’s easily! Join! ) Crypt-ON team",False

Large investors and crypto funds. 2. Crypto-enthusiasts and cryptoanarchists. Many users are interested in the development of the project and are waiting for the opening of the service to work as crypto-freelancers, exchange the crypto currency, lend it or borrow. For many of them, it is important that the project will be presented to the world, will become a full DAO. Institutional investors can be assured in profit, which will be justified by the fact that the token will grow along with another cryptocurrency, and the market in whole. It ia possible due to the special fund for tokens buyback to prevent the token from falling in price. We will do this because we will become DAO. It will not be a commercial project, the main purpose of which is to maximize profits, it will be aimed at increasing the cost of the token and the number of users. The platform will be owned by all crypto community, which will keep tokens on their accounts  Thank you ",False

Starbucks has refuted the surmises of cryptocurrency holders about the possibility to pay for coffee with cryptocurrency. The essence of cooperation between the three companies is not in the introduction of bitcoin acceptance in coffee shops, but in the creation of service for the BTC exchange to fiat money, for example, US dollars, which visitors can spend for their lattes.  “It is important to clarify that we are not accepting digital assets at Starbucks. Rather the exchange will convert digital assets like Bitcoin into US dollars, which can be used at Starbucks,” a Starbucks spokesperson wrote.  “Customers will not be able to pay for Frappuccinos with bitcoin,” the company representative added.  For most of the progressive humankind, the need for the widespread introduction of services for the exchange of digital currency for fiat has become apparent. It remains only to guess which company will be able to become a reliable partner for each cryptocurrency holder.  The Crypt-ON team accepts this challenge, in turn, we are open to constructive dialogue and cooperation to create more comfortable conditions for all owners of digital assets.  One of the four services of our platform - p2p local exchange, which helps people from any of the continents, or any country of the world, to exchange fiat money for cryptocurrency and Vice versa. Using our application and the geolocation function, you can find the nearest partner able to participate in the exchange. All actions of the transaction parties are stored in the blockchain, as they affect the rating displayed through the trust token.

At the same time, the customer’s account must have enough i-Point tokens to pay for the contractor’s services; otherwise, he will not be able to publish the task. 3. Performers submit applications. 4. Customers consider candidates and confirm their choice. The contractor and the customer specify in advance the terms of a deal recorded in the smart-contract. 5. The task goes to work. After its execution, the contractor sends the results of the work for verification. 6. Payment for the finished service/work is carried out in i-Point tokens. 7. If the work had been violated the conditions fixed in the smart contract, an arbitrator includes in the dispute resolution. The arbitrator acts as a third party in the multi-signature of the smart-contract. 8. All actions of the parties are stored in the smart-contract and affect the reputation of both the customer and the contractor, changing their rating.

An escrow agent can be a bank, law firm, or specialized company. Usually, when carrying out such operations, the Bank opens an account which is fixed and blocked a certain amount of money, documents or other values that will be available only after certain conditions that are agreed in advance.  Thus, the parties make their actions as safe and honest as possible. In case of disputes-their solution will not be difficult, as there is a third party that does not represent the interests of the beneficiary or the depositor.  Analyzing the need and prospects for the introduction of escrow technology into the market, we rely on the long-term practice of such operations around the world. In the US and EU countries, such transactions are common when buying real estate, they are common in the East — in China and even in Mongolia. For example, there are three parties to an escrow transaction: the seller, the buyer and the escrow agent. The latter will monitor the implementation of the terms of the transaction, and in our example — the signing of documents. When the seller signs all the documents, the agent will unlock the funds on the escrow account and issue them.  Speaking about the escrow in the blockchain, you need to understand that the issue of security during online transactions is updated as the moment of funds transfer approaches. Just as in everyday life, there is a demand for a third party, which will monitor the process of fulfilling the terms of the transaction and act as an arbitrator, in case of disputes. In accordance with this, a special software module was created on the Crypt-ON platform, through which transactions arbitration and dispute resolution will be carried out.  At the first stage, this will be done exclusively by the project team members, but over time we will transfer these functions to those users who wish to participate in the system. The selection of a candidate for delegation of authority will be based on verification and rating system. Users with the highest rating will be admitted to the insurance of transactions, but in addition we provide a system of accreditation to identify their relevant skills/competencies required to perform the functions of an arbitrator.  In the final stage of the platform development, users will choose delegates on the basis of voting, to whom they are ready to entrust the insurance of transactions and dispute resolution.  Summing up, the following should be noted: blockchain is now becoming a system, and the prospects for the development of this FinTech-field will depend on what we lay in its Foundation. Our team believes that through such transformations the blockchain community will achieve success and universal recognition.",False

Is it possible to conduct such the deal, with the protection of your interests and preventing possible risks? Five years ago, such transaction seemed almost impossible, but not today. The advent of distributed ledger technology in 2008 catalyzed web development. The Ethereum blockchain launched in July 2015, gave the world smart-contracts that allow exchanging assets without any intermediaries. Smart-contract is a computer protocol that ensures the conclusion and performance of commercial contracts on blockchain technology. With its help, it became possible to conduct transactions remotely without worrying about the reliability of counterparties. Many prominent analysts predict that smart-contracts in the future can leave lawyers, bank clerks, and realtors without the work, because thanks to smart-contracts, the intermediaries would then be unnecessary. Besides, it became possible to enter into economic relations with any contractors, regardless place of residence.  How can a smart-contract ensure the credibility of trades? The program code of the smart-contract contains all information about the transaction, which allows full automation and reliability of the execution of contractual obligations. Thus, the participation of the parties at the stage of performance is not required. After fulfilling the commitments set out in the smart-contract, the buyer receives an apartment in New York, and you as a seller - a predetermined amount of the trade.  Is it so simple? Yes, seemingly, but we must take into account some necessary conditions: A decentralized execution environment required for the execution of the contract. The Crypt-ON platform is ideal for this. Convenient Personal Account, fast operations, support of different cryptocurrencies - what is not the whole list of advantages offered by the platform. Soon, on crypt-on.io all users optionally will be able to issue smart contracts using the platform and Metamask independently. Also, automatic bases for quick transactions and specialized tools for the execution of contracts needed. Be sure to keep in mind that smart-contracts implemented not in all cryptocurrencies. You can use Crypt-ON platform if you make the deals in the I-Point, Stablecoin, Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC) or Ethereum (ETH). Moreover, in the calculation in the I-Point, the fee is reduced by half.   With the Crypt-ON platform, the mission of transactions safety is possible!

Roger Ver also remembered how he bought the first bitcoin in 2011. As then, and now he believes that it is the cryptocurrency that gives economic freedom, reduces corruption. As an example, he cited countries that demonstrate rapid progress in the economy thanks to the comprehensive support of the cryptocurrency market: Singapore, Hong Kong, Switzerland, New Zealand. Roger accompanied his report with vivid photographs of Hong Kong’s urban planning, comparing it to Havana, where nothing has changed due to the lack of economic freedom. At the end of his speech, he examined the technical capabilities of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. He said a few words about decentralization and its vast potential that was particularly inspired by Alexander Vat and Pavel Almazov, Crypt-ON sales consultant. At the summit, Roger Ver spoke about decentralized exchanges and their role in the crypto-industry. This topic was of particular interest to Pavel Andreev, the Crypt-ON founder, who attended the summit to get the latest news of the cryptocurrency world first-hand and present the project of a multi-service p2p platform built on smart contracts and an individual rating system to a crypto-community.

Although in 2011 the company was renamed Intel Security, after the purchase by Intel, the software still retains the McAfee brand. Well, John secured a reputation as a person who can analyze the world situation and make the right conclusions.  John McAfee is confident that the adoption of Bitcoin by governments around the world will help in the fight against corruption. He had spoken about it even before the Blockchain Mediterranean Cruise and confirmed its intentions with concrete actions, founding the McAfee Alliance. During the cruise, John McAfee officially announced the signing of a partnership agreement between the Singapore exchange CoinBene and the Alliance led by him. The primary purpose of this accord — the fight against corruption and money laundering on some exchanges. Such as on HitBTC, which the McAfee Alliance often spoke out against on Twitter and will continue to do this, as it appears, with drawing new supporters.  CoinBene has already made a loud statement, offering cryptocurrencies placed on HitBTC to leave the exchange under the terms of free listing on CoinBene. By the way, John McAfee and his Alliance, according to the agreement, will bear this costs.  The fact that the agreement was signed at such a global event as Blockchain Cruise Mediterranean indicates that both parties intend to continue to “exert pressure” on HitBTC, so other exchanges need to think twice before use corruption schemes.  These are the first steps to mass “artificial selection” in the world of cryptocurrencies, indicating that the main thing that large platforms should strive for is decentralization.

The task goes to work. After its execution, the contractor sends the results of the work for verification.  6. Payment for the finished service/work is carried out in i-Point tokens.  7.

Charlie Lee, the Litecoin founder and the seventh largest cryptocurrency owner (by capitalization), sold all his LTC assets in December 2017, when the coin price reached record values. What for? “Litecoin must be truly decentralized,” the computer scientist admitted on his blog before made a decision. He did this to avoid sole influence the rate of this cryptocurrency alone. “For a currency to really be … a worldwide decentralized currency, you can’t have … a real leader who’s trying to control things, so to make it more decentralized, eventually I would step away.” said Charlie Lee. By the way, in early July 2018, Lee supported a new bitcoin mining protocol that strengthens the decentralization of the bitcoin network.  Lee’s position is very close to the Crypt-ON project team. That’s why the roadmap provides for developing mechanisms for decentralized management of the platform, voting and the first elections of delegates. Mobile applications will be devised to support the functionality of the DAO voting system and mechanisms. This allows the project to grow and improve under the plan. Over time, the number of users who will appreciate the convenience of the platform services, simplicity and security of operations will increase. And, most importantly, users as co-owners of the platform, will independently influence its further development.  Crypt-ON. We are for decentralization!",False

That’s why the question of reliability of partners and verification of their business reputation remains thorny and pressing.  Blockchain technology, among other things, gave the world smart-contracts. Thanks to that it became possible to carry out secure trades with anonymity and without the participation of external intermediaries. The value of such transactions is in their openness and availability, as well as the fact that it is easy to track their history, but it is impossible to cancel their execution.  The use of innovative tools, such as smart contracts, can translate into reality ideas that seemed utopian a few years ago and effectively solve problems that traditional systems do not cope well.  The architecture of the Crypt-on platform is based on smart-contracts issued in the Ethereum blockchain. The reception and the refund will be made at the coincidence of two of the three signatures in the smart-contract. Crypt-on is a third party and connects only in cases of need to resolve the dispute between the parties in the person of the arbitrator.  When using such a contract, the parties do not need to trust each other. They merely describe the conditions of its execution, certifying them with a signature and ”freeze” the agreed amount on the blockchain. A significant term is that more than half of the signatures of the contract participants are required for the transfer of funds.  Users of the Crypt-ON platform will have access to the following types of smart contracts:  1. Smart-contracts for an individual transaction between the parties.  Will be used for essential transactions in large amounts. However, if you specify in the settings that the trade is “important”, a smart-contract will be automatically released to conduct an individual transaction regardless of the amount.  2. Smart-contracts for platform partners.  Partners will be able to open such a smart contract once and carry out all transactions with customers in it, as in the Ledger. Under different areas of business, separate groups of products can open different smart contracts.  3. Smart-contracts for small transactions.  Crypt-ON open such a smart-contract opened once, and all users of the platform will be able to use it. The main advantage is that at the conclusion of such contracts users will not be charged a Commission for their release, which is especially beneficial for small transactions.  The transfer of funds will be carried out to the smart-contract directly, payments through Metamask will be used for the simplicity of operations.  Thanks to smart contracts, you can directly, without intermediaries, enter into transactions, take loans, hire performers and exchange cryptocurrency for money.  You no longer need to rely on someone’s opinion or trust someone’s word. Take advantage of innovative technologies.  Crypt-ON",False

Despite the growing awareness of people about cryptocurrencies, the level of their practical application is still not very high.  The reasons are some problems and risks inherent in digital assets (poorly developed legal regulation, high volatility) and the lack of solutions that combine different activities in the crypto industry.    We, the team of the Crypt-ON project bringing together professionals from different countries, see the solution to these problems in the creation of the p2p platform, offering users a variety of services that use cryptocurrency for payments.  Platform Crypt-ON includes 4 of the service - Escrow trades, p2p lending, crypto freelance job exchange and p2p geo-exchange (exchange of cryptocurrencies for fiat with a search by geolocation).    In p2p systems, people interact directly, on the basis of the consent of all parties. Crypt-ON implements this model of interaction by smart-contracts, containing the terms of transactions. Thanks to smart-contracts, you can straight, without intermediaries, enter into transactions, take loans, hire performers and exchange cryptocurrency for fiat.  Also, we plan to create a single rating of borrowers, sellers and performers – honest, transparent and objective. To do this, the mechanics of the platform will use a trust-token - a particular token that contains records of all operations of the platform user and displayed in the form of a rating.  In case of disputes arising during the execution of transactions, a system of arbitration is provided for the resolution of contradictions. Its mechanism will evolve and improve as the project develops, striving for maximum decentralization.

First, it will be platform with centralized management, and it will be debugged and optimized. The next step is partially decentralized management.
