In the next few years Rhea will become much more than just a cryptotrading platform. Turning the index into a globally followed tool for investing in cryptocurrencies is one of our three main goals. Expanding options trading to a multitude of indices and offering the most flexibility is the second one. Finally, we want to turn the Cryptofund into the easiest way for retail investors to obtain a slice of a balanced cryptocurrency portfolio. In the ICO pre-sale we are offering maximum of 10% of the total supply of Rhea tokens (5 million), at a price of 0.0007737809 ETH (5% discount from the first ICO day). If you are interested, do not hesitate to contact us privately.  Quote from: satria33 on September 05, 2017, 04:45:03 PM Soft cap and hard cap for this ico The 12.5% milestone is the most important one because it will provide the minimum capital required to set up and maintain a fully operational platform. This milestone will be reached when 12.5% of the 42.5 million tokens offered are sold. The hard cap of 42.5 million Rhea tokens sold will give us enough to develop a much more advanced platform, as well as extra capital for the quick launch of the Cryptofund.",False

I think it's easy to draw on a graphics editor. It's not about the content, but about the essence of the project. And the essence of the project is not yet fully understood. The idea of transparency of crypto currency flashed here. And than it is good and to whom it is necessary. For the time being, I have not seen any valuable information for myself.

I would like to say that you are correct in the statement that the transparency concept needs further clarification and can be misunderstood.

We strongly believe in regulation in the cryptoworld and that it needs to be more transparent and accountable to investors. But before these laws and regulations are in place, we will operate our platform by choosing to abide by the rules financial companies are subject to.
