We are establishing a WAX Community Trust reserve of 1,000,000 WAX Tokens to fund this effort.

Details of how WAX contributors can be considered for participation in the WAX Community Trust WAX Token airdrop will be published in January 2018.  Second, this incident has demonstrated to all of us how problematic the spread of counterfeit token sites has become. WAX wants to help solve this growing industry problem. To that end, WAX will be investing $100,000 in a new program called Stamp Out Counterfeit Token Sites (SOCTS, or “sockets”). Funds will be used to create an awareness campaign educating on the existence of these counterfeit tokens sites and the steps our industry can take to ensure they don’t continue to spread confusion.",False

NO ONE is calling the investment in ICO a bad investment, in fact, because of their misleading Huobi trade, investing in this ICO has to be the best investment ever.

That went on a few hours/days, until the market realized the price was all wrong and finally the price hit $0.40 and the bounced to $1s as you mentioned.

I think your website should make at least some analysis before posting some random score. Promoting companies without even stating any of their advanteges will not bring you trust in the future.  And here are a few points that you ""forgot"" to use in your analysis, confirming why WAX is different in a number of very important ways:   1) It is from the team at OPSkins, the #1 marketplace in the world for buying and selling skins. 2) WAX will process a multi-billion dollar revenue stream already existing at OPSKins. 3) The creators of WAX are the creators of 2 multi-billion dollar centralized game item exchanges (Jonathan Yantis and John Brechisci, Jr.) and now aiming to build a massive decentralized exchange through WAX. 4) The creators of WAX have extensive crypto experience (Co-founder Tether, backers of first ICO Mastercoin, largest backers of Ethereum pre-ICO, early bitcoin miners, backers of numerous other crypto companies and funds). 5) WAX is designed to work with any game that has tradable items and does NOT rely upon publisher integration (integration which can take years to come to fruition). 6) DMarket are not significant players in the skins trading market at all and they don't have extensive crypto expertise. Their coin in useless and simplistic ERC-20 tokens without any intelligence backed into it. And the WAX platform is a SMART CONTRACT based decentralized marketplace.

No other company is doing this. The WAX Platform unites everyone and provides instant payments, security, and trust services that will bring millions of new participants into a growing ecosystem. Based on blockchain technologies, WAX Tokens will enable 1.8 billion gamers worldwide to quickly and easily harness the power of a fully developed, highly complex virtual goods exchange that provides escrow, liquidity through access to a large number of buyers and sellers, and other complex parts of a well functioning marketplaces. By decentralizing these exchanges, vastly more trading in the already sizeable $50 billion video game virtual goods trading market is possible.  2) They completely rely on Steam, and if Valve changes its mind on third-party platforms, WAX will collapse at once  Answer: WAX is not requiring publisher integration. And keep in mind, WAX can facilitate the trading of any digital item, whether it be web based or mobile. WAX is designed to serve the entire video gaming and digital asset trading ecosystem. And regarding the ""third-party platform"": OPSkins is the #1 digital marketplace in the world which is 10 times bigger than the closest competitor!  3) Strange and shady changes of terms with no proper explication  Answer: WAX team did not make the decision to move this deadline lightly and we're really sorry for any inconveniences it caused. When it was decided,  the announcements was made as quickly as possible. Nevertheless many video gamers - the core audience we are aiming for - as part of the token sale. Since many of these individuals are first time crypto currency adopters, it has understandably taken more time for them to get educated about WAX. In our judgement, it was better to give this core community more time to participate.  Read detail in the blog post: https://medium.com/waxtoken/the-pre-sale-and-gamer-sale-dates-have-been-extended-d2f13689c856 More answers in reddit AMA with William Quigley (CEO) and Malcolm CasSelle (President): https://www.reddit.com/r/WAXtoken/comments/7a4gzg/the_wax_ama_with_william_quigley_ceo_and_malcolm/  The updated information is provided in White Paper as well.  4) Skins are stocked on Valve servers. They own them both physically and legally. Let's imagine, I bought a skin on your platform, and you suddenly have been cut from Valve servers for some reason. How would I take away the skin in your opinion? Valve is just gonna say me 'sorry bro, you should have used our marketplace'.  Answer: Please read 2. Please also keep in mind that WAX platform is a marketplace and not the owner of the skins (like Amazon is not the owner of all the items that are traded there). Transfer agents are responsible for the transfer of values between users in the games. I'd like to state it once again, any game from any platform or publisher that allows trading will be tradeable on WAX.  5) How do you expect in-game items to be tradable within your platform? Again, let's imagine a situation. I'm a game developer who wants items from my game be tradable for your coin. What should I do?  Answer: The game should be interesting to the audience. Anyone can submit a proposal for a guild spot, and WAX Token holders will vote for them based on what they see in their proposals. Token holders can only vote for so many, and since the WAX token holders make a cut off guild fees, it's in their best interest to vote for the most trusted ones. Guilds receive a percentage of the fees on lists, transfers, and Contracts and as a WAX Token holder you can pledge these guilds - in turn earning a percentage of the earned guild fees (see the sections Guilds in white paper for more details).",False

You're absolutely correct with your example, and no-one would like to see such a loses. WAX  team has pegged asset contracts that manage volatility in a way that no other token does. The concept of WAX pegged asset contracts is similar to how CS:GO skins are sometimes priced based on the value of their items in relation to the price of CS:GO keys. A WAX pegged asset contract could be USD, EUR, BTC, ETH, CS:GO Keys, or many other things.  Price fluctuations of any amount will exist whenever an item that’s worth a fixed amount is transacted with a market-driven currency. If you list an item for sale for .5 BTC when the price of BTC is $6,000 USD, and BTC drops 10% before someone buys your item, you just sold a $3k item for $2,700. Well that sucks. You can take the chance that it's going to go up that 10%, but then who would want to buy a $3k item for $3300? Your item won't sell or the buyer will get ripped off. WAX pegged asset contracts are temporary smart-contracts that exist only during the life of a particular transaction, so using the above example it would be the time from when the item is listed for sale and when it’s purchased.",False

BTW It'd be very interesting if someone from WAX answered those few points that you mentioned in your review:  Quote It is unclear how the guild selects and monitors a transfer agent, although this is supposedly part of the proposal of the guild.  While poorly rated agents are in risk of removal of their duty, it is unclear how the removal process is executed and by whom, the users or the guilds, or both. It is also not clear if the rating system is voluntary, or what is the incentivization of such rating system (other than being good samaritan in the network). We would also be interested to know whether rating capability is proportional to the volume of settlements from the user, or is also affected by the number of tokens held by the user.  Quote The verification of code quality and the responsibility in such incidents is a serious low-level issue, and we wish to know more about how WAX plans to tackle them.  Quote Another curious case would be to see how a 51% attack is avoided in such a system. To achieve 51% of the set of guilds, an entity have to get 33 (>64⁄2) guilds elected. Since selecting guilds is proportional to the cumulative tokens of the users, the entity needs to have around 33% of the WAX tokens, less than, say the amount WAX founders and advisors possess. The implications of a 51% attack in the network is dependent on the implementation details, which is yet to be seen.  Quote The whitepaper does not do justice to the technical details, nor did they release any technical paper at this point.  I think an additional ""yellow paper"" would be interesting at this stage of affairs...",False

The WAX team is full of industry veterans, and WAX knows it will not be seamless. That said WAX will do an incredible job and have proven so with OPSkins. No other team in the world knows more about or has more experience with virtual trading items than the WAX team. The WAX founders and the team also have been heavily involved in blockchain development and funding since the beginning. The customer experience, once launched, will be smooth and exceptional as is expected of the market leaders.    In the internet you could find the comparison with a few other coins, so I'd like to tell you also some basic differences of that coins with WAX tokens:  How is WAX different from Enjin? Enjin is a tool set for game publishers to create and manage virtual goods. WAX is decentralized marketplaces to buy and sell virtual goods. WAX powers the secondary marketplace of game items, not game publishers creating items.  How is WAX Different from Unikorn? Unikorn is a reward system for legal, licensed betting on esports, and events surrounding video gaming. WAX is not involved in betting or gambling.  How is WAX Token different from DMarket? DMarket relies on direct API integration with game publishers. WAX will not require this. WAX will be designed to provide the power of OPSkins to the broadest possible audience of gamers through decentralized marketplaces.  How is WAX Different from Gameflip?

The team sees a huge potential in this market, but severe hinderances in it due to centralization. Notably, WAX will allow the in-game item trading market to enjoy increased liquidity and will bring out many disjointed sellers out of silos. WAX will spell the end of a whole host of worries and inconveniences, giving fans of virtual items more freedom to trade with anyone anywhere in the world along with the promise of blockchain level safety when buying or selling. These never before possible WAX capabilities will usher in huge group of video gamers who have heretofore limited their item trading to the relatively small community of people they know and trust. More people trading using superior settlement and payment options means a deeper, more transparent and better functioning global market. Making buyers and sellers both economically better off.

It deals with issues of increased liquidity, simpler microtransactions and better understanding the market in more detail than I can provide here.",False

For a start, it's built by the team who practically created the whole in-game item trading industry. The WAX team is the same team behind OPSkins Marketplace, which is the #1 digital marketplace in the world. WAX will be the third global marketplace built by the OPSkins team. OPSkins has been accepting bitcoin for more than two years, and after they built their own bitcoin payment processing platform, OPSkins became one of the top five largest e-commerce sites globally for accepting bitcoin. Their millions of customers already like and use cryptocurrency, and will naturally adopt WAX since it will serve as a lower cost and easier settlement method than what they’re accustomed to using on OPSkins. Furthermore, WAX is supported by gaming industry leaders. Notably, Dave Anthony, The Founder of Call of Duty, has publicly voiced his support for WAX.
