For once this is a project that's not all hype about decentralizing everything, but is realistic. Most people/businesses don't know and care about crypto and decentralization, but they do care about costs. If restaurants can save on staff by using the terminal that's a win, if they can save on transaction/banking costs that's a win, if they can earn through marketing on the terminal that's a win. Those savings can be passed on to customers, which is a win.
