The digital currency was launched in 2009 by its anonymous Founder by the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Since the launch, Satoshi has never revealed his identity and little is known about him. To ensure that there was no inflation in Bitcoin Satoshi creation a system (Blockchain Technology) which ensured that the maximum number of Bitcoin that can ever be mined which is 21 million Bitcoins was developed.  Unlike national currencies which are controlled by central banks, Bitcoin was created to be fully centralized and not to have a regulatory authority. The generation of Bitcoin is done through Blockchain technology.  How can I own Bitcoin?  Owning Bitcoin can be done in two ways. The first method is by mining digital currencies. Miners are very influential in the Bitcoin market since they help in the generation of new coins. After successfully generating the new Bitcoins they are rewarded for their work through Bitcoin. The other method is by buying Bitcoin from Exchanges. There are many popular Exchanges from which you can easily buy your Bitcoin. Some of the best exchanges at the moment include EXCOINCIAL.com, Coinbase, Gemini, Binance, Kraken, Huobi, etc.  Buying Bitcoin through Exchanges is simple and the transaction can be completed within minutes. However, unlike in the early days of crypto where anonymous transactions were allowed at the moment, these Exchanges conduct what is called KYC (Know Your Customer) which is a compulsory process because Exchanges have been regularly targeted by hackers. Currently the crypto market is the most targeted market by hackers and some Exchanges such as Mt.Gox have become bankrupt because of hacking. You can also buy Bitcoin directly via peer-to-peer from LocalBitcoins.com.  Storing Bitcoin  Buying Bitcoin is not a problem, the problem is how to store them safely. Bitcoin is stored in digital wallets. Bitcoin wallets are popular but you must be careful because there are many fraudulent wallets. You must know that once Bitcoin is lost it cannot be recovered and therefore proper storage is very important. Before looking at the most popular wallets, note that leaving your coins in Exchanges can be harmful, therefore in case of a cyber-attack you could end up losing all your investment.  Storing Bitcoin can be done either online or offline. Offline storage is the safest because it cannot be subjected to online attacks. However in cases of offline storage when your hardware or paper wallet is lost you lose all your coins. Online wallets are of different types, the most popular wallets at the moment are:  AFCASH Wallet, Trezor, Electrum, Coinbase, Exodus, Freewallet, Coinomi, Mycelium and a few others. The two most secure wallets to use for the storage of your Bitcoin are AFRICUNIA BANK wallet (AFCASH) and Trezor. However, in all wallets, you must ensure that the private keys are well kept. Once you lose your private keys there is no way to recover them and therefore you lose everything you owned.  Where can I use Bitcoin?  At the moment the hype around Bitcoin has gone down because of the price drop. However, the digital currency is still popular and some of the world’s largest businesses accept it as an option of payment. Some of the popular companies that accept Bitcoin as an option of payment include Overstock.com, BitPlaza, Microsoft, and CheapAir.com among many others. There are many other upcoming online platforms such Vendasity.com where you can use AFCASH and Bitcoin to make purchases. The main reason why people are preferring Bitcoin and other digital currencies is because of its decentralization nature. With Bitcoin, you have direct control over your funds unlike in banks which make decisions on your behalf while limiting the amount you can withdraw at a particular time.  The future of Bitcoin  Predicting the future of Bitcoin or any other decentralized currency is hard because of their volatility nature. Despite the fact that Bitcoin has lost more than 80% of its value when compared to its all-time high in December 2017 when it almost hit the $20,000 mark, its popularity is still rising. Being the most popular digital currency Bitcoin has a great future especially because more business is adopting the digital currency. Bitcoin is moving in the right direction towards mainstream adoption which is a positive move for the crypto market.

London, United Kingdom – March 12, 2019 – The global banking industry has utilized existing methodologies for decades. Along comes Bitcoin and other crypto currencies based on Blockchain Technologies, and it was only a matter of time before an organization would step-up and disrupt the entire Global Banking Industry. This would affect not only typical banking, but also investing and commerce. Every sector of the Global Marketplace would be affected, including: Healthcare Providers, Insurance Companies, Manufacturing, eCommerce, Custom, Land Registry, Identity Management, Governments, and others.  A forward thinking group, led by Don Chancellor, Founder & President, has announced the formation of “AFRICUNIA BANK“, destined to forever change the global banking system. During a recent interview, Don Chancellor explains that “AFRICUNIA is introducing an innovative banking model that allows the use of digital currency without hurdles, risks and technical barriers linked with owning, transferring, and trading in crypto currencies and tokens. Open exclusively for investment, AFRICUNIA is a third generation closed-end fund that uses the AFRICUNIA Blockchain Technology to create a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency called AFCASH.”  He further says that ‘’AFRICUNIA Bank will be 100% fully Digital Crowdfunded Open Bank based on the Blockchain Technology 4.0 and that this Blockchain Digital Bank will be a new and unique Financial Institution that will offer not only traditional banking services related to opening of savings & current accounts, issuing of debit & credit cards, loans and forex exchange services but also will provide innovative banking services such as bank-to-bank transactions, interconnecting the world of traditional finance and cryptocurrency startups.‘’    AFRICUNIA Blockchain will be the very first Blockchain Technology that will be Afro-centric, aims to bank the unbanked and commits its revenue to humanitarian causes for the welfare of the less privileged ones in Africa and around the World. This new banking platform will lead the way for the Global Banking System to bridge the gap between fiat and cryptocurrencies. AFRICUNIA is a virtual bank that will be issuing AFCASH using AFRICUNIA Blockchain 4.0 Technologies. It is well positioned to become an industry standard for seamless funds tokenization and management by leveraging its own Blockchain Technology. AFRICUNIA is registered in the UK as AFRICUNIA LIMITED with offices in Austria, Malta, Switzerland, Ukraine, the Philippines and Nigeria to provide banking and financial services.  At the heart of AFRICUNIA’s mission is to bring about investment globalization, transparency and decentralization to the next level by leveraging Blockchain Technology. Here are their primary value propositions:  Offering The Best of Both Fiat and The Cryptocurrency World:The majority of tokenized investment platforms are either fully crypto-oriented or are pegged to some tradable assets such as gold or fiat currency. AFRICUNIA intends to create a platform that allows users to gain from both. Promoting Sustainable Investment of Funds:All the tokenized funds will be reviewed and approved by their legal advisors to make sure they are fully compliant with the existing laws and regulations. Developing a Standardized Platform:AFRICUNIA believes that this is the right time to launch industry standards for setting up the tokenized investment platforms. Enhanced Transparency:The tokenization of interests in funds, or shares in profits, provides accountability and transparency to the investment process. Scalable Fund Development:By using the AFRICUNIA platform, any approved investment manager can setup and run a tokenized investment fund without going through the pain and effort of developing the necessary IT and legal infrastructure.

AND THE REAL QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD BE ASKING  This has been rumbling around the crypto market for about the past month as the market took a substantial dip. While HODLers keep HODLing some crypto newbies seem like they are about ready to cut their losses and jump ship.  There are a couple aspects of this question that I find inherently irksome. So instead of answering it, I would like to instead pose the 2 questions that people should actually be asking. Take a look below.  WHY ARE WE ONLY LOOKING AT BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY AS A SHORT TERM CASH OUT INVESTMENT?  Of course you can invest in technology but in doing so you are supporting its expansion, growth and adoption. Because blockchain is so intertwined with crypto, a literal currency, the vast possibilities for application have been overshadowed.  For crypto newbies out there, blockchain technology is the standardized ledger system that was created so that Bitcoin could be anonymous, transparent, and decentralized.  That being said the possible applications for the technology go far beyond a currency. For example a blockchain platform can be used to create trust and transparency between businesses through the use of smart contracts. Or as a ledger system it can be used to store data or hold proof of ownership of a virtual asset like AFCASH.  So even when the market is down for Bitcoin and Ethereum does that mean blockchain technology or blockchain projects lose their value as well? No, of course not.  WHY DO YOU NOT WANT TO INVEST WHEN THE MARKET IS DOWN?  This is a simple investment principle. Ideally, when you set out to invest you would like to buy at a low point. If you wish to turn a profit on your investment you would then try to sell at a high point. However, human beings do not always work in a simple logical way. We are often quick to be caught up with trends, hype or panic. Which is not a very wise way to handle investments like fiat, crypto or otherwise.  So of course the true believers do not support crypto currencies but support the adoption of this new technology called BLOCKCHAIN.  If you are crypto newbie click on some of our posts on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit and BitcoinTalk. For example, click here https://www.africunia.com/afcashwallet to find out what a crypto wallet is.  We hope you enjoyed our input.

Believe it or not it's going to be predominantly how we move cash from one point to another, how we share our experiences, how we consume our entertainment, how we stay in touch with our loved ones and how we do our daily businesses and activities.  Take a look at how we used to study, to travel, to make phone calls, shoot movies, send faxes and mail our correspondences in the past.  Here comes AFRICUNIA BANK ...to change all of that...  AFRICUNIA is the First 100% Fully Digital Crowdfunded African Open Bank- a Digital Bank based on the Blockchain Technology. AFRICUNIA as a new and unique Financial Institution is going to offer not only traditional banking services such as opening of savings & current accounts, issuing of debit & credit cards, loans and forex exchange services but also will provide innovative services such as bank-to-bank transactions, interconnecting the world of traditional finance and cryptocurrency startups.  AFRICUNIA  BANK will become a fully digital bank that is accessible everywhere, 24/7.

Why? Because the payment infrastructure was built decades before the invention of internet with fewer or no updates. Mankind invented softwares and technologies, breaking every distance, order, difficulties and pulling the world instantly closer together. But what about banking? Think about the unbankables. Billions of people in the universe have no access to financial services and own no bank accounts. Orders and systems create barriers. We have seen big banks collapse time and time again. They take thousands of billions of fees per annum from us.  And now AFRICUNIA BANK has come to solve the problems of financial transaction's ACCESS, SPEED, CERTAINTY and COST using the BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY.  AFRCUNIA BANK, the First African Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency is introducing AFCASH digital currency. Our cryptocurrency, AFCASH, doesn't care where or when you were born, or the colour of your skin or your geographical location in the universe. It's an open and decentralized network and it's maintained equally by people all over the universe. Anyone can verify the transactions and it happens instantly. For just a few cents you can send any amount of money to anyone in the world. AFCASH is a global community of inclusion, an open invitation to participate in an open world.  With AFCASH you can independently end unemployment in your life in minutes. Join our community today and become part of our shareholders and regain your financial freedom.

Ladies and Gentlemen, we believe your day was great. Permit us to use this medium to announce series of structural and tactical changes in AFRICUNIA project. After several advice from professionals who have travelled this road before us in the last couple of months, we have come to implement some needed changes in our programme and offers.  1. Effective from the 1st of February 2018 we are reducing the number AFCASH Tokens issued from 1 billion Tokens to 500 million Tokens and which shall be sold at the price of $0.10 cent per AFCASH. This will be reflected on our Whitepaper and Business Prospectus and in every other known platforms where our token distribution and price is listed.  2. As a result of considerable delays in the take-off of our ICO we are extending the duration of it therefore to the 31st of March 2018 in order to accommodate potential public investors.  3. We understand one of the very first questions gushing through your mind rightnow is what happens to those of us who had invested earlier? Well, do not panic...we have your interest at heart and thus we have taken steps to ensure you are accommodated in this new price scheme. What does that mean? Please, kindly login to your wallets and you will notice that your number of AFCASH Tokens have increased to reflect the new price of $0.10/AFCASH. And by the way, we are generous enough to leave you with the bonuses even though we are not offering bonuses under this new $0.10 price. Please don't forget to thank us  3. In the light of the above, we are moving with the speed of light to amend several things on our website and exchange platform and in various other social media platform where applicable.  Remember our ICO is still on course. Please signup for your free AFCASH Wallet here: www.africunia.com and be part of AFRICUNIA Digital Bank building block.  At this juncture, we once again ask for your support and active participation in this journey to the top.  Thank you all.  AFRICUNIA TEAM! www.africunia.com",False

First of all we acknowledge the risks in cryptocurrencies as well as in every other currency, i.e. pound sterling, euros, dollars or any other currency. Secondly, we also recognise the scams in some crytocurrencies, but that does not take away the fact that there are hundreds of well performing cryptocurrencies out there. As a matter of fact, there are some major differencies between AFCASH and other cryptocurrencies.  AFRICUNIA project is far from Multi Level Marketing model and has nothing to with such business. If you understand MLM business ideology well, you will know that they believe in the system of sharing wealth among its members, that is taking from individuals and given to the top leaders at the head of the ladder. That is pyramidal on the one side and it is economically wrong on the other side. Please read our company's blue print called whitepaper and business prospectus.  Any investment in the project AFRICUNIA is assured by MAINSAIL of Dubai and IBB Holdings of Malaysia (Private Banking Group) also called AssuredInvest. What does this mean? It means that irrespective of whatever happens, your principal investment is secured by the aforementioned entities and you will get your return on investment. Note, this in the event AFRICUNIA failed to perform. So, AssuredInvest assures your principal investment weather the investment fails or succeedes. And even when AFRICUNIA succeedes, every investor will still have his principal investment paid back by Mainsail over a period of 5 years.  Consequently, your investment in AFRICUNIA ICO is the first secured investment in a cryptocurrency.  We look forward to welcoming you in our project.  https://africunia.com/user/v2/index.php?r=DQZRBE2",False
