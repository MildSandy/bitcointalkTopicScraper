The team members have successfully launched and operated traditional centralized freelancing platforms in the past, which indicates that they understand the industry with its inherent risks and opportunities. As mentioned above, the main question mark is the team’s lack of experience in Blockchain technology specifically. It is therefore hoped that the team can manage to attract qualified people with relevant experience who can drive the project forward from a technical perspective.  Risks     One question is whether the project will be able to attract the critical mass of users necessary to break-even with their running operating costs, given the low-revenue “freemium” business model that has been chosen for the platform. With that said, it is known that Talao’s predecessor, eMindHub, already has demonstrated an ability to attract users. However, whether this will be enough to cover the operating costs of the new platform remains to be seen  -0.5     The team appears very strong from a traditional business development and management point of view, but may be somewhat lacking from a technical point of view, in particular when it comes to experience with Blockchain technology. -2  Growth Potential     With both freelancers and employers dissatisfied with the service offered by current platforms, the freelancing marketplace industry appears ripe for disruption by blockchain technology. +2     The management team already has a strong background in the industry which is definitely an advantage. +2     Highly transparent company and team with all important details made publicly available, including the Articles of Association of the France-registered company behind the project. +3     The project appears thoroughly thought-out and well-explained both on the website and in the white paper. +3  Disposition The Talao project appears very well researched and though-out, with a strong team that has demonstrated their ability to carry out projects in the same industry in the past. A high degree of transparency from the team’s side adds to the legitimacy of this projects, and makes it stand out positively among the many low-quality ICOs that have been launched recently. We also like that the team has made the company’s Articles of Association public along with an explanation that rules out any potential conflict of interest between company shareholders and token holders. Overall, the case for Talao appears to be strong and we believe it deserves a score of 7.5 out of 10. Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-talao/  This is very good result!",False

You take money on the value, not the intermediaries positions. - We are organized as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, with freelancers having a huge role in the governance of the platform - We are building a protocol enabling each talent in the world to decide who access his certifications, past experiences, etc.. and if/how to monetize. Like Dock.io but with Talao the talent is making money, not the platforms. This protocol is fully independent from Talao marketplace, it can be used on any platforms.

There are no middlemen and 0% fees taken by the platform.  The marketplace business model is a Freemium model with feature prices set by Talent communities.   The Talao Token, fuel of the platform  The TALAO token is a utility token and ERC20 compliant. It is needed to access marketplace services, DAO functionalities and to manage a personal Reputation Vault. It has 2 types of usage. Tokens are either stacked as deposits (protocol stacking function written in the token smart contract) or transferred from client wallets to talents’ or community wallets (protocol transactional function).   Transparent and fair governance  Although it is incorporated as a company, Talao is not structured to distribute profits to its shareholders. If anything, profits are to be reinvested in the company to finance its future development. Company articles of association are public and a copy is uploaded to IPFS. The DAO voting process is a public smart contract too. As provided by Talao’s articles of association, the Board is composed of members who are appointed by the founders and DAO communities.   An escrow system with tribunal for conflict settlement  When fixed price contracts are paid with tokens and signed between Talent and clients, funds are escrowed.  In case of conflict, a reputation based tribunal will settle the issue.   Multiple means of payment  Payments can be made in fiat or with crypto-currencies. This makes the platform adoption quick and easy and functionalities closer to the needs of client and talent.",False
