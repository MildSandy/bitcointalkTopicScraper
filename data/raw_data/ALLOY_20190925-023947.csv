But I think there is a big problem. The brands shop and vendors do make their offers in such way that they have restrictions. These restrictions at least partly are made to make customers buy more merchandise in order to use reward points thus i dont believe that big companies will be interested on participating. Because 360bn which are not redeemed is money which is not lost by companies.  Also PayPal backing caught my eye. This is a red flag for me in block chain community.

Banks & credit card comapnies spend a lot of money in maintaining and running a catalog for redemptions to make their customers happy and this becomes an ease of access for the. APPs and game give you virtual tokens and even they are exploring real world rewards to make the users engaged more, but sine it is not their core business to run a eco-system for redemption, ALLOY is an interesting space for them to partner.  Larger companies have known to participate in Coalition program (Airmiles - Canada, OK Cashbag - Korea, Nectar - UK, Plenti - USA), the main reason for it is when the reward points are issued it is an liability on their books and it need to taken off from onetime customers (This forms 75% of the total reward points issued) and Coalition has a upto 80% market penetration in all the geographies mentioned above and the reason for that is points flow and don't stay idle resulting in win-win driving business and satisfaction. The idea for any reward program is to make the users see value either within the store or external so the customer keeps coming back.  PayPal has incubated our startup since 2016 when we were offering Loyalty, CRM, gamification, Referral, systems for retail vendors, they also have plan for reward programs for their merchants but the distributed nature of their 17mn merchants makes it impossible to run a large scalehandshake, here is where they found the platform pretty interesting to explore only on the reward point redemption and listing of their Merchants on the platform for visibility .

Incase of GATCOIN the merchant is expected to issue a TOKEN (Cryptocurrency again) which when the consumer decides to encash the Merchant tokens they need to go to the GatExchange only and again in the GATEXCHANGE they can be bought only by users with GATCOINS. This method might be good for merchants offering new programs.  Our way of solving it: let the Merchant be comfortable in what they have been doing/using already i.e. their own reward points, we will create an Global Rewards Catalog where the users can redeem their already existing Reward points for Products and Services of their choice.  Hope I was able to shed more insights on your statement.  Best, Vijay Team ALLOY",False

Second: Codemojo the company powering ALLOY has experience in this field, and wasn't started just for raising funds through ICO, we are running a successful company for the past two years in the same customer engagement, rewards, loyalty & Gamification space. Also we are backed by credible investors, who has validated our Technology capability a year back.  Third: By investing you own ALLOY Tokens, which are like a premium membership for the Global Reward Catalog, that entitles you for benefits such as additional discounts cashbacks when you transact in the catalog, which is a tangible benefit, compared to a perceived benefit.  Fourth: During phase II of the Global Rewards Catalog, ALLOYs can be directly used for purchase of Merchandises and Goods, which reduces the risk of your investment today, as beyond tradable in the exchanges, ALLOYs have a practical use in your day to day life.

Having these many token in circulation is essential to provide transactional bandwidth for the global market. We look forward to all your support in making this happen.  Regards ALLOY Team,False

The User downloads the ALLOY app ----> Signs in ----> Links different membership accounts ----> Sees the total combined worth of Rewards points in Local Fiat Equivalent ----> Accesses the Rewards section ----> Checks out with a product of choice.   ALLOY in Phase I of the Rewards catalogue will be considered as the value of exchange in the backend to facilitate cross border transaction via smart contracts, between Brands & Consumers.  Hence the value of exchange will be equal regardless of geographic location, enabling seamless transactions.  Note: Users will also get a minimum of 0.5% ALLOY token as cashback during transactions based on the net value.  Hope I was able to answer your query.",False

Pre ICO: October 15th 2017, 13:00 UTC  Pre ICO Bonus - (20% Bonus)  Total ALLOYs allocated for Pre ICO - 10,000,000  ICO Opens: November 25th 2017, 13:00 UTC  ICO Closes: December 25th 2017, 13:00 UTC   Website: https://alloy.rewards.network  Download Whitepaper    Overview  Globally, 48 trillion Reward Points from Brands that are worth close to $360 billion go unredeemed each year. When users sign up for memberships with different Brands, they collect these points for every action taken, be it signing up, or making a purchase among others. But, they usually end up in a situation where the points can neither be consolidated nor redeemed against a preferred reward (the reward they want) due to restrictions. These restrictions include limited avenues, limited products inside a catalogue etc. In short, users are left with limited choice and a cumbersome reward programme that they often end up discarding.  In fact, unredeemed points in the USA alone amount to USD 16bn while that of UK is 6bn pounds, in total.  ALLOY Token & Rewards Network, our Proposed Solution is a Blockchain-based Global Rewards Catalog connecting Brands, Publishers and Consumers on one Platform. The Global Rewards Network will allow the Users of partnered Brands and Publishers to link, combine and convert all their Reward points to a local Fiat Equivalent ($/Â¥/â‚¬/? etc..), which in turn can be redeemed against listed Products and services from other partnering Brands.  For Consumers, this platform will be a mobile app that will show the fiat equivalent of their combined Reward points with an extensive Rewards catalogue to redeem from.  The core components of the proposed solution will be Codemojo's time- and scale- tested Customer Engagement kit and Rewards Network, currently engaging 25mn users across 2,000+ Apps, Websites, and Wi-Fi hotspots. Codemojo will upgrade its existing Rewards Network using Blockchain & introduce ALLOY Token to make the Redemption experience truly Instant, Secure, and Global.    Youtube : https://youtu.be/AlIMUcX3S6s    Global Rewards Network  The Global Rewards Network will be a Rewards catalog that will consist of products/services subscriptions listed by partnering Brands who are on the lookout for driving transactions or acquiring new users. This will be accessible for users through a consumer facing Mobile App & Website.  The User downloads the ALLOY app ; Signs in ; Links different membership accounts ; Sees the total combined worth of Rewards points in Local Fiat Equivalent ; Accesses the Rewards section & Checks out with a product of his/her choice.                The Opportunity  The total unredeemed points sleeping in consumer accounts stand at $360B. Considering only USA and UK, we see an opportunity of $24bn worth points that go unredeemed. These points go unredeemed due to no visibility of points, not knowing the value of such points, not able to find suitable rewards during redemption, and no process to combine points across program operators to receive meaningful rewards. The USA is first, with $16bn, with the UK following at $7.7bn (Â£5.7bn). These stagnant unredeemed points that are not driving sales pose huge liabilities for these companies. A universal solution that enables frictionless, secure, traceable way for mobilizing these points can have a huge positive impact for both Brand and Consumers.   Token Sale Overview       The Team  We are a passionate and experienced team working together since 2015 and created the world's first Machine Learning powered Rewards Network.
