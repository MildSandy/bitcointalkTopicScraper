Memority is a blockchain platform offers secure space for the sensitive data which integrates with a technology named as blockchain. Therefore, the system helps to store 10 copies of files on separate storages at every time all over the world. Thus, to encrypt all the files they use a private key, and they designed Memority in such a way that they can receive only by their owner at the time of account is created. As the data is in the encrypted format it is not possible to access the data. To access the data we need to decrypt the data with the help of the private key. Memority main aim is to create an independent ecosystem that involves many applications that can be helpful not only for business but also for Government authorities and can store all types of data in an ultra-secure storage. Memority platform gives an opportunity to secure sensitive data and this can be done by applying four features they are  1) Private key encryption 2) Forgery protection 3) Accidental deletion safeguards 4) Self-containment and independence  Thus, this platform will allow participating in third-party sellers to develop data storage applications on the platform.

It has a very huge potential, it can distrupt & revolutionalize the cloud storage market, with the advantage of storage on the blockchain, which will be more secure than centralized storage systems.  But I think there is something missing in this project. I have read the info on the website and the WhitePaper, I did not find features about data storage from mobile devices.   Note that more than 80% of data owners worldwide now use mobile devices, i e, smart phones, tablets, etc. People store data on their smart devices such as: photos, videos, etc. And they'll also like to store them online so as to prevent loss of their precious files which can happen due to accidental data loss or phone theft.   I will expect this project to create mobile apps for storing data on the memority blockchain, using android app, ios app, windows app, etc. Most centralized storage systems such as: microsoft onedrive, google drive, yandex disc, amazon cloud drive, etc, all have mobile apps.   A decentralized system will always be better & more secure than centralized storage sites, and connecting mobile devices to the blockchain will also be an added advantage.   It's never too late, project development is a long precedure, the devs can still add this feature to the project development roadmap.  ",False

And each has a different coin price (based on bonus amount for that term). Generally speaking, they go like this: June 10 EMT = 0.87 USD, July 10 EMT = 0.91 USD, August 10 EMT = 0.95 USD and September 10 EMT = 1 USD.   Quote from: melomanskiy on June 03, 2018, 06:51:45 PM Tell me, please, on the audience of which part of the planet you are aimed in the first place and why?  First world countries. There are more businesses there and they are more technologically developed so they are more likely to require ultra-secure storages. Pretty much the same with governmental institutions, they are more digitized and thus require secure storage more. And people should be more conscience about their personal data protection.

Your accusations seem to lack actual arguments. Did you actually come to these conclusions by analyzing something (if yes, then what?) or you just emotionally decided to blame the first thing that came to your mind? Also, very weird that you accuse all ICOs yet have a signature promoting one of them    Quote from: Somz1 on June 14, 2018, 11:55:14 AM In simple terms explain me how data storage can works on Blockchain, also is there a method to access this cloud storage with the use of internet? If it can't, how is it better than existing cloud storage platforms like Google Drive, 1Drive etc?  Files are uploaded to hosts (be it hosting providers or just other people with spare hard drive space), they are encrypted and their hash is calculated and written into a distributed blockchain ledger. Those hash codes are later used to check files integrity and authenticity. Afterwards, basically, our monitoring systems continuously check stored files and if anything is amiss - they independently reupload files to new hosts, kicking ""bad"" ones. By accessing via Internet you mean like Web interface? How is our storage better than Google Drive and others? Well, 3 points: 1. You can not lose your data or access to it. 2. Nobody can see you data, delete of modify it, and so on. 3. No single corporation holds you data and profits from you, Memority is completely decentralized and after release will belong only to its users.",False
