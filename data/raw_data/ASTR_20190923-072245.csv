This will then allow the ASTR used to purchase your claims, this will mean demand for ASTR will increase and the eco-system will grow.  We will launch ASTRcoins at a $10 USD value after ICO.

A good use-case for the BlockClaim is ICANN.  If you’re not familiar with ICANN they are responsible for the registration of DNS Servers to URL Address Claimed on the internet.

Its resources are for the benefit of all mankind but there stills needs to be an order to how we access this value.

Exactly what we are striving to be.  The purpose of ASTRCoin and Asteroid Ltd. beyond the ICO and its quirkiness is to build a platform using the Blockchain that creates an indisputable record of the claim, when it was made and by whom. From this it would lead to setup legal defense, government lobbying, and legislation suggestions across multiple countries, much the same way ICANN now functions. Of course this is not without its challenges.  Part of our Blockchain model has a domicile royalty. This provides a mechanism for local governments to be rewarded, based on the claimants locality when a company does actually select and start the mining process. Although there are reports of China mining asteroids for more resources, or China dragging an asteroid around the moon to mine it, we believe that its most likely going to be private well funded companies that get their first rather than any specific country. And as more and more companies realize this potential, the space race to the asteroid will only accelerate the technology that makes it all possible.  In due course it is our intention to work with all companies and nation states that are planing future mining activities and for Asteroid Ltd. to build a platform that is indeed fair for all humankind rather than those with the biggest wallets.

The difficulty we had was how to peg a BTC = ASTR value when we already associated it to ETH as well.  Since there is such fluctuation in the day to day values of BTC and ETH how could we properly and fairly assign the exchange for you the contributor?   Well we went back through our figures from earlier in the year when we first started to lay out the ICO plans.  What we realized is that we had pegged a 1 ETH = 120 ASTR value back when ETH was only $90 USD (May 2017).  That got us thinking; why should an ETH holder get the same amount of ASTR when the value of ETH has grown so much in that time?  Surely any other market in the world affords the holder more buying power when the value of their currency goes up.  Why is it the opposite in ICOs?   The solution became clear!  We flip the traditional ICO model and ensure that the buying power is put back in the hands of the ICO Contributor, not the ICO Offeror.  We at Astrcoin.io proud to offer a new calculation on the Pre-Sale and ICO.   What it offers:  - Every 24hrs at 01:00 UTC +8 we will update the ETH = ASTR calculation to reflect the market value changes in ETH.  - A Smart Contract for ETH Purchases will now issue ASTR automatically after the ETH Transfer is received.  - A new model which properly reflects the buying power of ETH and how much it has increased since our prices were pegged in May 2017.

This is not a name a star for yourself project, these are real assets that humankind is on the brink of accessing as early as the next 3 years (https://gizmodo.com/this-mining-company-plans-to-land-on-an-asteroid-in-thr-1785112235).  Currently https://www.whois.com shows you who has claimed URLs for themselves by paying a registration fee to ICANN in order to register their claim to a URL.  One cannot say that ICANN or Netsol owns the right to any TLD or URL they are merely a registrar, in the same way we are offering to establish a similar registration system for the vast resources found in Outer Space.  The world's space agencies have already identified and valued these resources and made that information public.  By current valuations NASA states that there is $100,000,000,000 USD of value for every person living today.  We are simply offering a Blockchain Ledger which has categorized these resources and provides the ability for anyone to register their claim on them.  The 1967 Outer Space Treaty clearly states that rights to these resources belong to all of Humankind.  However, as with all things there will need to be an established order to ensure that everyone can participate.  Space should be a do over for Humanity.  Instead of allowing for the elite 1% to capture these resources first and make claims that are solely for their benefit, we can democratize space here and now by creating a formal system for everyone to make a claim.  A simple review of recent laws in both the United States and Luxembourg, written by the wealthy for the wealthy, brought us to the conclusion that space should and must be democratized in the same way that the Internet is a world resource belonging to all humankind, in fact no one owns it.  We all know that if we had made a claim to the early dot coms we would be wealthy today.  Interestingly, no one can really say they own their dot com in fact it is just registered to them for a given length of time, and renewed on a regular basis.  We believe that if Blockchain technology were envisioned at the advent of the internet we would be using a Blockchain Registrar to establish a claim to a URL through a smart contract today.  From a legal perspective the concept of Terra Nulius covers that which is considered ""no mans land"" and as such there is legal precedent in international law for a BlockClaim.  A BlockClaim is both disruptive and enchanting.  It will allow anyone the ability to lay claim on what clearly belongs to all humankind.  It is the perfect use case for one the largest undertakings humankind has ever attempted.

Hence, those individuals, companies and nation states that avail themselves of this inevitability will enjoy the significant projected financial rewards.  ""I'm sure the world’s first Trillionaire is the person who learns how to mine asteroids"" - Neil deGrasse Tyson Wired Magazine, April 2017   THE MISSION ""The Democratization of Space"" Asteroid, Ltd. is building a decentralized database whereby private individuals, corporations and nation states can register claims on mining rights to over 600,000 identified asteroids in our near celestial orbit using a smart contract and proprietary BlockClaim® mechanisms.  The BlockClaim® mechanism is modelled after ICANN, a system familiar to us all, whereby individuals who desire to ""claim” a website address apply for a specific website and register their domain. Asteroid, Ltd. will provide services that allow claimants to secure a claim to specific asteroids within the database and act as the registrar for the claimant using Asteroid’s proprietary BlockClaim® mechanism. Each individual will lay a BlockClaim® to a specific asteroid and both a public and private ledger will be created on the Ethereum platform. This will be achieved through smart contracts, protocol tokens, called ASTR®, and a significant dataset identifying over 600,000 asteroids and approximately $700 Quintillion dollars of minerals . Each BlockClaim® will consist of a registration using ASTR® Tokens and provide an immutable record of the mining claim.  A BlockClaim® may ONLY be registered using ASTRCOINS®!  BLOCKCLAIM® Empowering People Worldwide  ASTR® TOKEN IS A DEFINING MOMENT IN THE CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT OF SPACE EXPLORATION  WHAT IS A BLOCKCLAIM®?   BLOCKCLAIM® = A Fractional Mathematical Representation of an Asteroid Expressed as a Percentage of the Total Claim Value (""TCV"")   TOKEN CROWDSALE PROJECT DETAILS Asteroid Coin - ASTR® | Based on: ETH - ETHER  ASTR® TOKENS AVAILABLE: 100,000,000 Token Crowdsale 50% (of supply) TOTAL ASTR® TOKEN SUPPLY: 200,000,000  All 100,000,000 ASTR® tokens will be issued following the close of the Token Sale. If any remaining ASTR® Tokens are available they will be allocated back to the company to be used in the BlockClaim® Ecosystem.  RESERVED: 9,800,000 ASTR® for Management & Employees 200,000 ASTR® to maintain the BlockClaims® held by Asteroid Ltd. in support of the ASTR® Token value  Upon completion of the Token Generation Event, ASTRCOIN® will immediately be used as a currency to register a BlockClaim® creating liquidity in the token with a stable continued growth and purchasing power on into the future.  For more information, please read our White Paper.  Tokens Distribution  50% goes to the public (100,000,000 tokens) 45% goes to the company (90,000,000 tokens) 4.9% goes to the management and employees (9,800,000 tokens) 0.1% goes to the maintenance of the 200,000 blockclaims (200,000 tokens)    Reservations  The Asteroid Coins will be reserved as follows:  9.8 million for management and employees 200,000 for the maintenance of the Blockclaims held by Asteroid Ltd 200,000 to be registered not later than 6 months after the ICO. The essence is to make the value of the coins appreciate to $1,000.
