The game is running on its own blockchain. It was written from scratch in the past two years and is not fork of an existing software. It aims to create the frst Massive Multiplayer Online Economic Strategy game with no need for a central administrator or central server, where players are rewarded for their achievements.  The distinguishing characteristic of ChainRepublik, which is absent in any 99.9% of existing online games, will be the possibility of monetizing the time spent in the game. In other words, players will be able to not only enjoy the game but also to earn from it, as well. It is and will always be open source.  ChainRepublik can be accessed through web nodes (ex www.chainrepublik.com). A web node is a website that allows you to access all ChainRepublik features like sending transactions or securing addresses. A web node is the easiest method of using the network. Running a web node is a great way for players to spread the word about ChainRepublik and make money in the same time.  It's also important to realize the difference between the ChainRepublik Coin and the regular ‘coins’ being launched via initial offerings. 99% of ICO coins or tokens these days are Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens or similar. All these startups are still centralized businesses. They normally have an address, an advisory board, a team, CEOs and if the startup goes bankrupt, the value of the 'token' will tend to zero in no time.  ChainRepublik is a decentralized p2p network of nodes with no company behind and no central server. This makes it impervious to regulation on a global scale. ChainRepublik Coin (CRC) is not a 'token' but a real decentralized cryptocurrency, powering a virtual world impossible to stop. ChainRepublik has its own blockchain and has nothing to do with Ethereum tokens.

Signing up is free and we need new citizens. Also all testers will be rewarded at launch depending on their ChainRepublik Coin (CRC) balance.",False

Also the rate of inflation is very high because the production is low. Companies need raw materials made by another companies, production tools, workforce and so on. The economy will slowly get bigger and more products will be available for sale. I think in 1-2 months we will have at least 400 companies.  The rewards are paid by the network. It's a hard coded function.  Every day 2500 coins are distributed to miners and players. Each reward category has its own pool.  All fees are going back to network and not miners. For example yesterday, the network paid 1500 CRC to players and miners and 260 CRC went back to network from company open fees and so on. Sooner or later, the network will distribute the same number of coins it receives and the net inflation CRC will become zero.  It's a complex game running on it's own blockchain but for end users it looks like a regular game..",False
