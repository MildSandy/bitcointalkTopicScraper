Last month we successfully opened up this opportunity to our community, giving select members the opportunity to interact with the Havven payment network.  Before this, nUSD had only been issued by the Havven Foundation, as part of a staged roll-out. Opening this to individuals outside the Foundation provided helpful user feedback.  Through early issuance, nUSD successfully passed $1M in circulating supply. This was a significant milestone for the network, just one month on from the release of nUSD.  For this reason, we’ve decided to open up a second round of early nUSD issuance before wider issuance takes place by the public.  Through this additional round, we aim to provide a thoroughly tested and seamless user experience when we do open public issuance.  When wider issuance is launched, nUSD will be issued onto a DEX, which we’ll announce further details about closer to the date.

We want to thank everyone who has supported the project and we look forward to the launch of the network in the next few weeks.

Together with Nomin, a Stablecoin, the Havven network is trying to solve one of the biggest challenges in crypto: stability.  The Havven ICO proposes a decentralised payment network built on a stablecoin to capture all the benefits of a permissionless system, while also eliminating volatility. Havven plans to achieve price stability by pegging the value of the token to fiat, while simultaneously introducing a decentralized collateral system to provide confidence in the value of the tokens.  Those who use the stablecoin pay fees to those who collateralize the network, compensating them for the risks of providing collateral and stability. Collateral providers in turn control the money supply, and fees are distributed in proportion with each individual’s contribution to stabilisation. Havven rewards suppliers of stability and charges those who demand it.",False
