Analysis of the meaning, georeference, tags, in addition, would connect the news in a chain of events, helped to track the development of events.  It would be useful to see news (or rather, events) on the map of the planet: the importance, the number of readings, the relationship with other events, ratings, the ability to chat / blog under the events, coverage of the same events by different sources (which can be taken not only from the media, but from any private sources, including live broadcasts of eyewitnesses), automatic grouping of reports pertaining to one event. The ability to scroll through the history of events in the past, see upcoming events in the future, filter events by topic.  Also, applications to browsers and / or social networks that would allow determining the parameters of the distributed news in the posts: the date of creation of the original and a link to it, the level of truthfulness, related news, including refutations, would also be useful.

Ico.TheWorldNews.net  The first decentralized autonomic news platform, built on blockchain technology with use of a neural network.      The problems that our project is dealing with:    1. The problem with fake news being published by the media all over the world (the developed neural network is in the training stage) .  2. The problem with reliable sources of media (available in the Alpha-version) .  3. The widespread problem of all media in getting exclusive content (photos, video and live broadcast) .  4. The problem of the falsification of mankind's history. In 5-10-20-30-100 years, any user of the network will be able to know with certainty what exactly was published regarding particular events in any media, and how trustworthy the source is.  5. Politicians and unscrupulous businesspeople won't be able to clean-up their sins in the media worldwide.  6. The project will satisfy the queries of all media services' editors of the world providing already published content in any requested language.  Right now, the project gathers, monitors and publishes sixty thousand (60,000) news stories per day. Within month, the number would reach a quarter of a million (250,000) news stories per day. This way, developed on block chain technology, in a short period of time, TheWorldNews.net will be the biggest repository of informational content in mankind’s history.
