David Cao, Founder, and Aly Kassam, Director of Product, represented our team.   This AMA was flooded by a ton of questions from the community relating to technology, marketing, and future initiatives. This is by far the busiest AMA we’ve ever had. Great job in making David and Aly not even get a few seconds of breathing space during the intense 60 minute AMA period.     Thank you to everyone who showed up during this AMA and contributed to learning more about OneLedger.     Here are some questions and answers from the AMA:     1. On Chronos testnet, is JavaScript smart contracts only going to be tested and no other machine language?  Aly: Yes OLVM supports Javascript smart contracts currently. We can try and come up with other languages in future based on the need.     2. The DApps to be developed on the testnet and mainnet, are they going to be only business prelate DApps? Aly: Dapps can be developed by any developer. We will be releasing the necessary documentation soon.     3. Is Ubuntu 16.04 the only O.S to be used for the testnet. If yes, is the 7.5GB if RAM not too low?  Aly: For testnet, 7.5 GB Ram is good enough.     4. How is the wallet development going along?  Aly: The OneWallet development is ongoing.  The next iteration will include HD Wallet support, we will move to support Ethereum and ERC20 shortly after that.  Once Lynx Engine is ready for supporting interoperability into BTC, then we will also include Bitcoin.     5. Why we need to wait for staking more than six months after mainnet ?  David : Because there is interoperability, this is the first time someone is performing staking cross-blockchain. There are some challenges with staking that we have to figure out and validate. So we are just making sure that we deliver the best experience.     6. What other companies are you talking to about working together with? Aly: Currently, we cannot discuss exactly which companies.  We are facilitating conversations in the Real Estate, Supply Chain and Automotive sectors.  There are also technology partnerships we are evaluating to get to market with enterprises quicker.     7. How long before the mainnet? Aly: Kainos is scheduled for Dec 2019, and Kratos is scheduled for Q2 2020.     8. @akassam any new product services that we can expect to see in the coming years? Aly: We are working on a Token Migration Utility for ERC20 Tokens and still looking at building an application in the OTC space.     9. Can you confirm the Google Partnership and give us some details on the shape of this partnership?  Aly: With regards to the Google partnership, we are currently partnered with Google Cloud Platform and as a result we are able to be present on their marketplace, the partnership also allows us to utilize accounting and billing services with Google Cloud so that enterprise customers can utilize Google Cloud as their service provider and manage all OneLedger Billing through them.     10. What sets OLT apart from other DLT blockchains? Aly: Well for one, OLT is attempting to build interoperability between multiple different types of Blockchains.  A lot of competitors will talk about interoperability for Ethereum or Smart Contract based chains, where as we are also going after Bitcoin and using BTC Scripting to build Smart Contract like functionality. In addition, we are moving towards having interoperability as a central piece of our protocol, whereas others try and accommodate it only through Atomic Swaps in Smart Contracts.     11. When everybody can try the OneLedger wallet ?  Aly: We will be opening up the wallet in Q4, but if you would like, message a CM and we can add you to our Beta.      12. Can you tell what is difference between Cosmos and OneLedger from technical point?  Aly: Cosmos provides interoperability between two cosmos based chains currently. It has not promised interopability with chains like Bitcoin. OneLedger provides, in addition to its own chains, interoperability to other big chains that matter. OLVM supports smart contracts in JS, where as Cosmos doesn't provide any smart contract support.   13. Is there any plan for OneLedger team to build an exchange on the OneLedger blockchain? Aly: Although building a DEX would be optimal on the OneLedger Blockchain, we are not building one. That doesn't stop anyone from utilizing OneLedger tech to do so if they wish.     14. If I will setup a validator node for staking or if i will start staking with my OLT tokens, and if there will be not traffic in blockchain who will give me OLT as a fee ? Does the team have any reserve for this? Some staking projects are paying it from their reserves for first and second and third year.  David : We will be giving Block rewards from our pool for the first few years. This is already mentioned in our Tokenomics paper. In addition, Dapps on our chain can help achieve more Tx's and thus more fees. Our Cross-chain Naming service is one example of that.     15. So after the mainnet and before the staking can we run nodes and collect transaction fees?  Aly: That's correct.  Right now we are on the verge of completing the Fees component for the Protocol, so that during Kainos, Validators will earn OLT as fees.  That's why we will be migrating our Token in that time period as well, to bring utility to the Token quicker.     16. So we can run nodes without having tokens? Aly: We have a few options we are exploring for this. The 3M Tokens will still be required to be a validator, the way we will do it will be outside of Staking for the time being. We will provide more info closer to Kainos Launch.     17. Does the the project have enough funds to last the next couple of years and is OLT earning income right now? Aly: We've answered this a few times.  Yes definitely the project has funds for a few years, but we are pursuing revenue opportunities.  David : The fund is enough to build the network, for enterprise market, we are working on few industry with partners, few of them are on final phase to generate revenue.   https://www.oneledger.io/blog/recap-of-the-telegram-ama1  ",False

As the Mainnet launch date moves closer, it is important for us to build a strong team and get everyone to speed as the months pass by.     Freddy Li will be taking on the role of Software Developer at OneLedger. Freddy is a blockchain enthusiast with a passion for learning new technologies. He holds a Master’s in Software Engineering degree from one of Canada’s most prestigious universities, University of Waterloo. Through his early days in university, he has been experimenting with blockchain technologies. He has over seven years of experience of collaborating in the software engineering space. In the past, Freddy has worked for Blackberry within their security systems development team. He also worked as a Blockchain Developer at SkyQuark Ltd. where he designed the Crowdsourcing Blockchain Modular backend system for implementing the advantages of fintech which enabled every participant to get rid of the traditional paper contracts. These blockchain experiences have convinced Freddy to pay attention to blockchain technologies because he believes that the traditional software industry will be overturned by it eventually. This is the reason Freddy decided to join OneLedger, as he believes that OneLedger is the future of cross-chain tech leader in this industry.     “As a blockchain developer, I’m aware that there are limitations for every main-chain at present, especially because the transactions can only take place on one particular chain. One of the solutions to push blockchain tech to the next level is the cross-chain capability, which OneLedger has been working on achieving. Personally, I’m interested in blockchain and I also want to contribute to the OneLedger cross-chain protocol and that is the main reason I joined.” Said Freddy.     Freddy will be running operations on the OneLedger protocol. He will be focussing on the latest blockchain technologies and contributing towards OneLedger’s suite of products.     When asked about interoperability, Freddy responded, “Interoperability is the future and in fact, it’s already everywhere in software. Different software components focus on different aspects, but they also need to share data in order to build a better ecosystem or operating environment. It is not only important for sharing the data, but also connecting functionalities to make even smaller components or modules which are easy to maintain and scale. Using this technology, OneLedger could even be used as the core of many application-level products such as education, communication, supply-chain and anti-theft.”     We are excited to have Freddy onboard and are confident that his passion for blockchain will help take OneLedger to the next level.   https://www.oneledger.io/blog/oneledger_freddyli",False

The Alliance has quickly grown into the largest commercial blockchain alliance in the world, with nearly 500 members in over 25 countries that collectively generate over $1 trillion in revenue annually.  But what does blockchain provide to the commercial transportation industry? If a company already uses it, blockchain’s ability to adapt to consumers’ needs, increase efficiency, lower costs and eliminate loss and fraud are well-known. These challenges don’t exist within blockchain; the entire network can contribute and validate data, and it is no longer a matter of inefficiency or tampering.  BiTA’s members have recognized that the key to a successful implementation of blockchain in the freight industry is the creation of universal standards, and the team at OneLedger will contribute to the universal standards created and adopted by BiTA members, and which will then be available to the industry through open source. OneLedger  will also bring a wealth of digital experts and innovative technologies to help develop blockchain-based solutions for the industry.  “Blockchain technology can transform the supply chain by introducing greater transparency, innovation and efficiency,” said Patrick Duffy, BiTA president. “Members like OneLedger will be the key to BiTA’s success. The collective knowledge, insight and experience of Alliance members will help enable the best uses of blockchain in the transportation industry. OneLedger can help BiTA ensure the development of blockchain-based systems, and these systems will help create meaningful value for a diverse set of organizations leveraging blockchain for transportation and freight logistics.”  OneLedger’s Founder, David Cao said, “We’re excited about OneLedger’s new partnership with BiTA.

We aim to be the first truly interoperable blockchain, with a focus on scalability and fault tolerance. We use Tendermint2 as our consensus engine. Tendermint provides us with a Byzantine Fault Tolerant State Machine that can withstand failure of 1/3rd of the machines in the network. Our unique approach helps us to easily facilitate both public permissionless and private permissioned blockchains.  We recently conducted Load Testing as part of the ongoing effort to test the effectiveness of our public blockchain. This paper aims to discuss the Load Testing methodology and metrics in detail for our public blockchain.     AIM  Discuss the Load Testing methodology  Explain the Load Testing results  NEED FOR LOAD TESTING  OneLedger is built on top of the Tendermint consensus layer which uses a PBFT consensus model. OneLedger protocol benefits from it to build Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) model. Validators stake OLT in order to gain a chance to be a block proposer. This model is much faster than PoW3 model, where the participating nodes compete to solve a complex mathematical puzzle to become the block proposer. Tendermint goes through 4 stages4 (Propose, Pre-Vote, Pre-Commit and Commit) before each block is committed. There are many messages being exchanged among all the Validators in each of these stages. OneLedger is committed to providing the best possible experience for the community. In this regard, it is highly important for us to figure out how the network behaves under different load conditions. This helps us to be adequately prepared for future milestones such as the Mainnet.   LOAD TESTING METHODOLOGY  This load test is performed on the Google Cloud Platform. All the VM’s we used have 8 CPUs and 16 Gb RAM for the purpose of this load test. We have experimented with varying Number of Validators and the Mempool5.  The block size is set to 21 Mb, our transaction size is roughly 186 bytes for each transaction, which means a block could hold more than 110,000 transactions. As discussed above, Tendermint goes through 4 stages for each block, as part of its commit process. The time interval for each stage is set to the following values:    Figure 1: 4 stages of Tendermint (per block), as per OneLedger's configuration      Propose - 3 seconds (Each Validator waits for 3 seconds maximum for a new block to be proposed)  Pre-Vote - 1 second (Each Validator waits for 1 second maximum for votes from other Validators)  Pre-Commit - 1 second (Each Validator waits for 1 second maximum for receiving all  the Pre-Commits)  Commit - 1 second (Each Validator waits for 1 second after committing a block, which means the block time interval is minimum 1 second)  We started with 2 Validators and tested for Mempool with a number of transactions in the Mempool varying from 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000 and 100000. We repeated the same test with 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 Validators.  For each test, we have bombarded each Validator with 1000-4000 transactions per second simultaneously across all the Validators.   RESULTS  The number of validators is plotted on the X-axis and the Transactions per second (TPS) is plotted on the Y-axis. Each line represents Mempool configuration with a different value.        Inference  We have consistently hit TPS of more than 4000. The great thing here though is that this TPS is just with our main chain. With our side chain in place, we can have a TPS of 4000 for each and every side chain. Therefore, we have the capability of adding side chains to balance our load and thus our TPS would have no boundaries.  If we keep Mempool constant and increase the number of Validators, the TPS increases/stays roughly similar until the number of Validators is 16 and decreases post that. The reason for this behaviour is obvious. With more Validators, it takes more time for message exchange and to reach a consensus.  If we keep the number of Validators same and increase the mempool, TPS increases till the mempool is 50000 and decreases post that.  The reason for this behavior is because, the bigger the mempool, the higher the number of transactions in a block. The higher the transactions in a block, the more time each Validator takes to verify them. Thus the Validators start timing out waiting for Votes from other Validators, and a new block gets proposed after the timeout.     During the whole load test, the CPU and memory usage was always under 40-50% in each of the nodes, meaning testing with smaller VMs should achieve similar results.

The ups and downs of the market do not define the progress of our company. OneLedger is continuously growing and every day we are just getting better and better. Let us introduce you to a new team member who will help escalate our marketing initiatives.      Meet Tonya Montague, who is now the Marketing Manager at OneLedger. Before starting with OneLedger, Tonya spent over 5 years building her career through traditional and digital marketing, helping businesses to build productive relationships, customer loyalty and increase their paying customers. She’s worked closely with a broad range of clients and coordinated with many teams, and international cargo organizations.  One of her favourite quotes is “What you focus on is what you get”, and that comes as no surprise that she is a very results oriented professional.    Tonya’s role at OneLedger will involve promoting the brand and our products. Her main focus would be to bridge the gap between the blockchain community, the non-crypto community and the business clients. She said, “The traditional marketing model tends to talk at people and what we’re hoping to do at OneLedger is to create content that speaks with our target audience because this will be key in bringing blockchain technology from the background to the forefront with OneLedger leading the way.”   The OneLedger team is proud to bring Tonya Montague on-board.

The goal of this was to test the developer-friendliness and the enterprise-readiness of the OneLedger protocol. Our team decided to implement a Domain Name Space functionality on top of the OneLedger protocol. This functionality will serve as an added feature in the OneWallet. Beta testers of OneWallet are sure to utilize this feature (its coming soon...).  Pick-a-Domain is OneLedger's Domain Naming Service where the community can buy and sell domains utilizing OLT as the currency. Each of these domains could be mapped to a public address. These domains will make it easier for the users to facilitate transactions by sending to actual usernames instead of remembering the long 0x03Hg4... hash addresses. Yes, our main intention is to build world-class technology, but at the same time, make it very easy for the users to adopt this technology.     Building a cool feature was just one of the purposes of this Hack-Week. Something else which we wanted to accomplish was to: 1. Test the robustness of our protocol. Since this application touches our protocol at a lot of different levels (from the Tx layer to the Database and from the SDK to the Vault) and adds a UI layer on top of it, this is a perfect application to validate our robustness. 2. Test the developer-friendliness of our platform. With this application, we are aiming to provide tutorials for the developers to be on-boarded on the OneLedger platform and develop their own distributed applications on top of our protocol.  3. Test the OneLedger platform as a source for building many feature-rich applications.   https://youtu.be/gncqWbGVYh8   Watch the OneLedger Full Stack Developer, Oleksandr Kovalov talk about the OneLedger Hack-Week   https://youtu.be/gncqWbGVYh8",False

We featured in a couple of interviews; we released the load testing results; the OneLedger Hack-Week took place, etc. Now, we would like to give you a final update for this month. As we move closer towards our mainnet launch, we would like to present our plan for rolling out the OneLedger Mainnet.  OneLedger Mainnet Rollout  Through this article, we would like to update you with some crucial future Development milestones.  Introducing 'Kainos'    Hailing from the Greek origins, Kainos means 'new' or 'fresh.' Kainos, as the name implies, will mark a significant transition for OneLedger's technical development. It will redefine why our project had started initially, and provide businesses with the first step to bridge the centralized and the decentralized systems.     Kainos will contain new features on our platform. During this phase, the following implementations will take place: ⁃ OneWallet - Extending OneVault for interoperability - Extending SDK for interoperability - Lynx Engine: Module that facilitates interoperability - Transaction Fees Management - Multi-Signature  - Blockchain State Snapshot - OneExplorer Revamp - Kainos Release  Once Kainos has launched, we will begin the token migration process from ERC20 to our native token. The OneLedger protocol is expected to have an elastic TPS, meaning each side-chain can host up to 4000 TPS (based on our Load Testing Results, https://www.oneledger.io/blog/load-testing-results  ), allowing the OneLedger Blockchain to scale with adoption.  We are enterprise-ready now, and this will help us push our product towards businesses. We can develop custom solutions to meet the needs of businesses via this approach and start minimizing the gap between the centralized and the decentralized world.  After conducting extensive R&D, we have decided to launch Kainos in Q4 2019. Kainos will be followed by another phase, as described below.      ---------------------------------------------     Introducing 'Kratos'     Kratos will take the OneLedger technical development to the next level. Kratos means 'strength' in Greek.  With the launch of Kratos, we will be establishing ourselves as a significant player in the blockchain world. Developers can build Dapps; the community can stake; interoperability will be a norm; these are just a few features we intend to implement.  Leading up to Kratos will include the following implementations: - Token Migration - Event Triggers - Staking - Governance  - More Dapps - Kratos Release  The development of Kratos will take place in Q1/Q2 of 2020.  As always, we will keep publishing biweekly development updates as we continue our journey towards building a truly interoperable blockchain.    https://www.oneledger.io/blog/oneledger-mainnet-rollout",False

This is so that we can run more tests on Chronos and ensure it’s stability.  New Release Management Structure OneLedger has a new release process. We will continue to update our Master Branch on GitHub on a bi-weekly basis. However, on a Quarterly basis, we will mark a build as a Release Candidate and work with our partners to ensure they update their nodes to the Protocol version for the most recent Release Candidate. This means Chronos will be updated on a quarterly basis.  We are doing this to streamline our release process and structure it for our partners and community. We are starting this process with version 0.9.0.

The journey hasn’t been easy, but it’s only going to get better from now onwards. Today, we mark a new beginning!    We understand the frustration of the community. It is never easy to stay patient and watch a software product being built from scratch. It’s a long and tedious process, and sometimes a frustrating one. Throughout this phase, many new people join this journey and some people end up leaving. The community goes through a change. The product goes through a change. But eventually, the tech keeps evolving, and there comes a tipping point in a company’s journey when you say, “Aha — this is it!” This is what we always wanted to do. Our vision is becoming a reality. Interoperability has always been the core mission of our project, and it’s getting closer and closer.    It’s definitely not easy to build an interoperable blockchain. It’s definitely not easy to create a huge community of members who believe in your product (Kudos to the companies who have managed to do that!). But the journey does definitely get a bit easier when you have enough firepower to get you through different levels of marketing, development, exchanges and popularity amongst the crypto community. The OneLedger team has always maintained a lean and steady approach to conquer our vision. We want to see interoperability become an important stepping stone in the blockchain world, and we want to be the ones to solve it. There will be many roadblocks along the way, but this hunger and desire to succeed is not fading away anytime sooner.    We are well aware that we are the underdogs in this space. We do not mind having that tag associated with us. Because we know what we are doing is capable of transforming the entire blockchain industry. Our tech has advanced considerably since our inception. Our software team is in good shape, and now our next target is to be the first true interoperable blockchain in this space, and we are close to solving it.    During the month of July, we will share lots of updates with you regarding our tech. We have done some reprioritizing regarding the OneWallet. We will start onboarding BETA testers starting in July. We will also present a Mainnet rollout plan with an updated roadmap which will illustrate our approach towards enterprises. Before that, we have some major announcements to make regarding load testing, partnerships, staking etc. The next few weeks are going to be intense. Watch out for our updates!!    — OneLedger Team    **Spoiler Alert: Do check out oneledger.io on July 2 at 5 pm ET***",False

Yes, you heard me right! We have been adding different talents to our team month after month, and the feeling in this camp has been phenomenal. New ideas every day, new implementations, platform getting better day by day. We have just one mission i.e. to be the best interoperable blockchain in this space. It’s a tough ask, but we know we will get there. Nothing is going to stop us. It’s just a matter of time.  Throughout the next couple of weeks, we will introduce you to the newest members who joined the OneLedger family.  The latest one to join the team is Oleksandr Kovalov.    With over 10 years of experience in the software industry, Oleksandr is a Fullstack Developer any team would be proud to have. A javascript fanatic, a blockchain enthusiast, a software development nerd and a web believer — these are just a few words used to describe who he really is. Oleksandr has a keen eye for the future and is a strong believer that the distributed network approach of securing data could have immense potential.  Oleksandr will be contributing on both sides of the OneLedger product (backend and frontend) and creating tools and applications, which could potentially be used by thousands of individuals.  Oleksandr is not a newcomer to the blockchain scene. Prior to joining OneLedger, he was working on building his own network of blockchain nodes using Javascript. He believes that enterprises are slowly transitioning towards the blockchain technology, and as time passes by and the benefits of blockchain become clearer, there will be many enterprises who would want to jump on this bandwagon and reap its benefits.  “Blockchain is a data structure. Any continuously updating data could be stored in that data structure. More data means more data exchange and a need of data ‘conversion’. This is where OneLedger becomes handy. It provides a transformation of data between various blockchain platforms.” Said Oleksandr.  In his spare time, Oleksandr enjoys following his other passion, which is martial arts. We are confident that he will increase the fighting spirit here at OneLedger as well.  Our team at OneLedger would like to welcome Oleksandr Kovalov.  https://www.oneledger.io/blog/meet-the-oneledger-team-oleksandr-kovalov",False

OneLedger held its first Developer Meet-Up on February 13, 2019. Check out the highlights of our event. Blog:  https://medium.com/oneledger/oneledger-developer-meet-up-highlights-b9cfff494309  Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjNREW0I3zs    Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjNREW0I3zs     https://medium.com/oneledger/newsletter-14-roadmap-dev-meet-up-highlights-and-much-more-97fbc410917b     OneLedger statement regarding Crypto Briefing’s Code Review  https://medium.com/oneledger/oneledger-statement-regarding-crypto-briefings-code-review-95642c83d240    Hello Community,   We would like to thank Andre and the Crypto Briefing team for their honest and unbiased review. It is very important for OneLedger and the Blockchain industry to have third parties review their code and we appreciate the time and effort you have given our project.   However, such unbiased reviews sometimes miss the active work projects are doing, which OneLedger feels may have happened in this case. Since our initial MVP, we have reprioritized our roadmap to focus on fundamental blockchain functionality, ensuring that our transaction management, account management, validator creation and Smart Contracts are in place prior to working on our cross-chain use cases. This has also allowed us to spend more time to work on two of our core pieces of functionality, the Chain Driver Engine and the Side Chains. The Chain Driver Engine and Side Chains together will extend our Atomic Swap capabilities and allow for easy adoption of new Blockchains into the OneLedger ecosystem, making our goal for supporting 10 Blockchains, by the end of 2019, a reality. To be clear, our current implementation for the Atomic Swap is still based on our MVP code, because we plan to extend it in 2019.   For the 6 months between our MVP release and the launch of our testnet, we primarily focused on core blockchain functions and our JavaScript Smart Contracts. It would have been trivial to support an Ethermint implementation with Solidity as our Smart Contract language. However, to ensure that we are true to our community, we embarked on the path less travelled, by implementing our own protocol and working considerably on our OneLedger Virtual Machine (OLVM). OLVM supports JavaScript as it’s Smart Contract language, to appeal to a larger developer community for building Dapps. One of the most exciting features on the OLVM is the ability to support off-chain JavaScript Libraries. This will decrease the size of the OneLedger Smart Contracts substantially. For OneLedger Smart Contracts, developers will not have to copy all the code from other libraries into their Smart Contracts, inflating the size and requiring more gas, which is still a requirement for Ethereum but rather can just reference libraries available to our validators. The code for the OLVM can be found here. https://github.com/Oneledger/protocol/tree/master/node/olvm   For our Testnet, we also built an interim staking capability for launching Validator Nodes based on a Validator Token, keeping in mind that we will be building the full staking functionality in the second half of 2019. Based on our experience with other blockchain Testnet releases, we also built in the capability to stake and un-stake, that way our testnet doesn’t crash when validators go offline. Along with the validator feature we built in fees for executing transactions and deploying Smart Contracts, which validators can collect.   One of the other projects we started during this six month period is our OneExplorer. The OneExplorer required supporting infrastructure to retrieve data from the blockchain. We built an Application Blockchain Interface (ABI) and Remote Procedure Call (RPC), that work together to feed data to the OneExplorer. We released our OneExplorer Beta in the first week of February. Our repo for the OneExplorer is still private as we are in Beta and are still optimizing some features, but you can view it at https://oneledger.network   Although we agree with several parts of Crypto Briefing’s article, such as keeping our GitHub Repo up-to-date, and that our current Atomic Swap functionality is still based on our MVP code, this doesn’t negate all the work the OneLedger team has completed over the six month period after our MVP launch.   Feel free to reach out to us on our official Telegram channel https://t.me/oneledger  Sincerely,  Alex Lan Co-Founder & Blockchain R&D  https://medium.com/oneledger/oneledger-statement-regarding-crypto-briefings-code-review-95642c83d240   OneLedger v0.9.0 Update   https://medium.com/oneledger/oneledger-v0-9-0-update-2da3c9813403      In our last sprint, we enhanced the OneExplorer further by adding a relational database to house Accounts, Blocks and Transactions, to make our data requests faster and not burden the blockchain node with these requests. In addition, we are continuing our work on the Chain Driver Engine and we have also started building components for our OneWallet and are still working on our OneClick Deployer.   The list of changes includes:  --OneExplorer -Features  -Explorer Database Setup and Configuration -Stream Data now leverages new DB -Blockchain Data is persisting in OneExplorer DB  --OneExplorer Bug Fixes  Explorer Block Height KPI was behind by 1 block   --Protocol -Features  -Upgraded Tendermint version to 0.30.1 -Chain Driver Engine: Create Contracts on Bitcoin and Ethereum networks -OneClick Deployer: Build Process Automation   --OneWallet -Features  -Created Micro Service framework -Developed Micro Service for Balance Query    In the next sprint, we will concentrate more on Protocol features that will help optimize our P2P Connection and clean up some tech-debt incurred since Chronos Launched. We will also continue to work on the Chain Driver Engine.  NOTE: After the release for 0.9.0, we will be resetting the Chronos network and purging the current data. This is so that we can run more tests on Chronos and ensure it’s stability.   --New Release Management Structure   OneLedger has a new release process. We will continue to update our Master Branch on GitHub on a bi-weekly basis. However, on a Quarterly basis, we will mark a build as a Release Candidate and work with our partners to ensure they update their nodes to the Protocol version for the most recent Release Candidate. This means Chronos will be updated on a quarterly basis.   We are doing this to streamline our release process and structure it for our partners and community. We are starting this process with version 0.9.0.  For example, after v0.9.0, our next Chronos update will take place on v0.10.0, while we keep pushing the biweekly updates i.e. v0.9.1, v0.9.2 and so on.   https://medium.com/oneledger/oneledger-v0-9-0-update-2da3c9813403   Hello Community,  If you would like to see OLT available on the PolisPay Debit Card, then please follow the instructions listed in the Tweet below, and comment with * #BringToPolisPay $OLT *  Let's win this  https://twitter.com/polispayapp/status/1105559400406634496    OneLedger forms a strategic partnership with ContractLand  https://medium.com/oneledger/oneledger-forms-a-strategic-partnership-with-contractland-d504afb7a167  OneLedger is proud to announce a partnership with ContractLand.

Pavan will provide architectural leadership for the OneLedger product(s) as well as oversee the operations on the Dev side to ensure that the correct measures are being taken to reach our end goal. OneLedger has a big promise to deliver on and it is critical to ensure that the development is headed in the right direction. Our team realizes the importance of matching the expectations with reality and ensuring a smooth and reliable execution.   According to Pavan, “Blockchain isn’t a solution to everything, but it can serve as a catalyst for that next stage of evolvement. In the future, I can clearly envision many Blockchain protocols evolving and solving the problem of decentralized technology coexisting with the centralized world. And as far as interoperability goes, this can open a whole new world of possibilities, which was not even envisioned before. Interoperability, which is one of the key features of OneLedger, can be used in many enterprise applications. For example, using OneLedger to connect enterprises to track the flow of assets between them.”   Pavan’s favourite quote is “Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the mouth — Mike Tyson”. It is these punches that our team has to be vigilant about and keep moving towards our target no matter how many ups and downs we have.  The OneLedger team is very excited to have Pavan on board and take us closer to our vision.   https://medium.com/oneledger/meet-the-oneledger-team-12-pavan-kappara-aad19d24249   OneLedger v0.9.2 Update  https://medium.com/oneledger/oneledger-v0-9-2-update-44518d63a971    In our last sprint, we focused on the Wallet, Chain Driver, Build Automation and some technical debt.  The list of changes includes:  --Protocol  -Features  Chain Driver Engine: Implement RPC call for Ethereum Optimized P2P connection for Validator Nodes Setup Ansible for Devnet Setup Terraform for Devnet on GCP Re-evaluate Serialization methodology for Golang  -Bugs  data.Coin.String() was printing 0 when the currency was set to OLT   --Wallet  -Features  On-Boarding Flow: Generate mnemonic words from JS Library In the next sprint, we will still be working on some tech debt, specifically on our serialization methodology and we will begin preparations for load testing our network.  NOTE: After the release for 0.9.0, we have reset the Chronos network and purging the current data. This is so that we can run more tests on Chronos and ensure it’s stability.  --New Release Management Structure   OneLedger has a new release process. We will continue to update our Master Branch on GitHub on a bi-weekly basis. However, on a Quarterly basis, we will mark a build as a Release Candidate and work with our partners to ensure they update their nodes to the Protocol version for the most recent Release Candidate. This means Chronos will be updated on a quarterly basis.  We are doing this to streamline our release process and structure it for our partners and community. We are starting this process with version 0.9.0. For example, after v0.9.0, our next Chronos update will take place on v0.10.0, while we keep pushing the biweekly updates i.e. v0.9.1, v0.9.2 and so on.  https://medium.com/oneledger/oneledger-v0-9-2-update-44518d63a971",False

In about a year, our Dev team has almost increased three times in size. It is critical for our team to maintain momentum during the ups and downs of the blockchain market.      To speed up our protocol development, we have added another Protocol Developer, Harshad Patil, to our team. Harshad recently moved to Toronto, Canada, in search of opportunities in the tech space. Harshad is originally from Mumbai, India, where he has acquired tons of experience as a software developer. He finished his Master’s of Technology back in 2012 from one of the most prestigious universities in India, IIT Bombay. Since then, he has worked in the software sector for reputed companies such as Olacabs, Goibibo and Pocket52. Harshad has over 8 years of experience in development environments such as Golang, RubyOnRails, Python and NodeJS. He is extremely committed towards his profession and is keen to make a mark in the blockchain world.   Harshad has been involved in the blockchain space for a couple of years now and has made contributions towards some open source Golang projects. “I have studied the blockchain space for some time now as a hobby, but I believe now is the time to transform that hobby into a full-time job and fully focus on it,” said Harshad. Harshad’s experience in Golang is beneficial to OneLedger as the OneLedger protocol is based on the same language.   Harshad’s main focus at OneLedger will be to work on the protocol and enhance the functioning of our platform. He will also collaborate on the development of some critical components to establish high-level security and improve the network. His top priority right now is to ensure the stability of the Testnet, and later focus on the functionalities associated with the mainnet.   We are proud to welcome Harshad Patil to our team.

As we move closer towards this important milestone, it is essential for us to balance both the business and the technical aspects. To strengthen our business team, we have recruited Kerry Husbands. Kerry will be working as the President and Director at OneLedger.        Kerry is a KPI-driven business development professional with an entrepreneurial spirit, tenacious attitude, and extensive experience in strategizing and executing a broad range of partnership initiatives. He also has experience leading sales operations for companies like Rentokil Initial, Ozone Wireless Inc. and Bitt. Kerry’s sales experience and leadership qualities will be instrumental for OneLedger in developing business strategies and onboarding clients looking to adopt blockchain technology.    Kerry has been involved in the blockchain arena since 2015 and is well aware of the applications of this technology in the future. “I honestly believe that blockchain is the next step in the evolutionary timeline of technology. I also believe that technology should improve the livelihood of mankind, and that is what OneLedger will achieve. So being a part of this organization would be an honour.” Said Kerry.    Kerry’s role at OneLedger involves providing strong leadership to successfully achieve short and long term goals and also to manage all resources effectively to enable the team to become the benchmark for interoperability through blockchain. He said, “The reason why social media is so successful is literally due to the ‘social’ aspect. As humans, we inherently desire to connect with each other in some way. It is only logical that the technology in which we create does the same. Because of this, interoperability is a natural progression. The more we create the more we wish to connect.”    Kerry strongly believes that OneLedger as a technology can be utilized in every industry. It is only a matter of time before the enterprises start adopting our technology.    In his spare time, Kerry enjoys working out and listening to music. He loves playing sports and is a big fan of Warriors (basketball) and Manchester United (soccer).    We are proud to welcome Kerry Husbands to the OneLedger team and look forward to working with him.     https://medium.com/oneledger/meet-the-oneledger-team-14-kerry-husbands-3d1b8370e9a8      We’re still working on the Staking  methodology, so atm this has not been decided.    ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------    Hello Community,  We would like to bring to your attention, that as of April 1, 2019, Paul W. Homer will no longer be operating in the role of the CTO at OneLedger. Since January 1, 2019, Paul’s duties were being transitioned to our team members, and now we are ready to take this journey forward without him. During the past 3 months, we have hired several developers who will help us execute on our vision. Paul has decided to pursue other opportunities, and we fully respect that. We would like to thank him for all his services, and wish him success for his future endeavours.    ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------        The OneLedger protocol bridges the gap for enterprise applications by providing native connectivity to any centralized or decentralized system, allowing for seamless communication.

The OneLedger community actively participated in the AMA. It was an hour filled with lots of interesting questions and discussions relating to the development, vision, marketing and yes, when exchanges? We would like to sincerely thank everyone who participated in this AMA and our entire community for continuously supporting us during these stages of development and company growth.      We have listed some questions and answers below for those who missed the AMA. If you have more questions regarding this or any other topic, feel free to message  us on our Telegram channels (https://t.me/oneledger) and our team will be happy to help you.     ----------------   ----------------   ----------------   ----------------     DEVELOPMENT →   Why interoperability is important for blockchain projects?  David: The interoperability would make blockchains work together instead of working as isolated islands.  Aly: In addition to David’s response, imagine the internet when it was first founded. It was scattered intranet’s hosted by the governments and universities, with little to no communication between each other. We see this as a problem that the Blockchain world is facing at present. In the next tier of Blockchains, this will change and will require  blockchains to speak with one another, to exchange information and/or trigger actions on one blockchain based on data in another. That's why it’s super important to have interoperability.     I have a question about the supported blockchains in Q4 with mainnet. Once you mentioned in your meetup in Toronto that your mainnet will support 10 blockchains,  then when you did the interview with Brad you mentioned that the mainnet will support 5 blockchains, what I want to know which one is true when you release it by Q4?  Aly: I appreciate you watching my interview with Brad. Our goal is to have 10 Blockchains by the end of the year. We are working on a design where if we could  launch 2–3 blockchains, other blockchains would be a cake walk. Our Chain Driver support is completely extendable and capable of doing this. Keep in mind Ethereum and  Bitcoin are the most complex, after which most other Blockchains are based on their architecture.     Can someone explain what it means to have 10 Blockchains?  Aly: OneLedger is an interoperable blockchain, which means that we have the capability of bridging the different blockchains together. We built an MVP in June of last year demonstrating the capability of connecting ETH to BTC through an Atomic Swap. We are now extending that capability and scaling it to support more blockchains.     What governance do you plan to implement that is the Crux of the network?  Aly: We will have 3 categories of governance  1. Software upgrades 2. Parameter upgrades 3. General Community opinions on various concerns     When will you announce the minimum amount of staking? Please specify a minimum amount. This will allow people to buy more tokens. If you say that anyone can even be staking with 1 OLT, it won’t impact on the price.  David: You are right, staking is a very important part of the token economy, we would design it professionally and release it soon.     How much will they pay to validators? They will pay the stakers too? How much? Are you sure, that they will be ready to pay enough amount since first-day mainnet launch?  Aly: We are working on the Token Economics model and how much each validator will stake in the coming months. We will release this info by the end of Q2.     Is it possible to have Mainnet ready before the scheduled date?  Aly: Our Development team is working hard to release mainnet as soon as they can. We are also entertaining multiple different feature sets for mainnet to be launched on time. If any pan out to having OneLedger launch mainnet earlier than expected, we would definitely consider it. For me, I obviously would love to be early to market.     OLT is currently erc20 token. When do we have to swap tokens?  Aly: The token swap will happen after mainnet.     How long can OneLedger run with the funds from the ICO?  David: We do have enough funds to support the sustainable development of the product.     Will you renew the website? I think OneLedger deserves a better website.  Aly: LOL Deng you are of the same mindset as me, Sahir, and Edwin. We are working on it, and it’s currently in the design phase. Hopefully, you will see it soon.     How are you related to PChain and how do you benefit from each other?  Aly: PChain is a partner that we are collaborating with on multiple levels. As mentioned, they will help us in hosting nodes as well we have some technical collaborations with regards to interoperability, in 2019.     MARKET →  Do you have a plan to increase the price of the token?  David: The price of the token isn’t under our control. It depends on the supply and demand, and market conditions. However, we are confident in the long term strength of our company, and we do believe our token price will gradually increase over time.     Will you announce a new high volume exchange like Binance? Can’t you see that this is necessary?  David: Binance is one of the best exchanges in the world at the moment. We could not comment on exchanges at this point. We have several strategies in place leading up to the mainnet launch, and you guys won’t be disappointed.     You mentioned that exchanges are your priorities, what happened to that? We do need a tier 1 exchange, not a small one.  David: Yes Fares, the exchanges will happen. We have to hit those exchanges at the correct time in order to sustain our token price.     How do you interpret that the market cap falls from $15m to $1m?  David: The overall crypto market cap has decreased from $800 billion to $180 billion over the course of 1 year. A lot of tokens have lost value. The important thing here is to ensure that our company has funds for a long time and survives through this bear market. We are fully focused on building a stable product with real-world use cases.     I think you’re right about that so if the value of OLT token is connected to the product, when will you start to announce partnerships with big companies?  David: We are in talks with several companies. Our main focus is the supply chain industry at the moment. We are also targetting industries where our cross-chain capabilities will be highly utilized. The product is still under development, and we cannot disclose any names until the deals are finalized due to legal issues.     Do you have a market maker for creating volume on exchanges?  David: We cannot comment on using a market maker. We are doing what we can to make the OLT market more efficient and create more organic volume. However, we are not creating fake volume as many other projects do.     ----------------   ----------------   ----------------   ----------------     We hope you enjoyed reading the Q&A. The entire session went on for a little over an hour. Our team thoroughly enjoyed this AMA and looks forward to the next one.     On a side note, the OneLedger team is co-hosting an event with Polymath and CryptoChicks on April 22, 2019. If you are in the Toronto area, feel free to drop by.

The mainnet will also be DPoS + PBFT but instead of having masternodes, OLT has introduced a similar concept called validators but their selection is dynamic so as to maximize their number across all the chains for better participation, security, stability etc.  OneLedger consensus in the early phase allows everyone to run a node. Later on, staking amounts of tokens will be required to assume quality and commitment.     -----------------   -----------------   -----------------   -----------------     The OneLedger blockchain is dPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake).

This means Chronos will be updated on a quarterly basis.  We are doing this to streamline our release process and structure it for our partners and community. We are starting this process with version 0.9.0. For example, after v0.9.0, our next Chronos update will take place on v0.10.0, while we keep pushing the biweekly updates i.e. v0.9.1, v0.9.2 and so on.",False

It natively supports cross-chain transactions and has business modules that can drive sophisticated processing like atomic swaps between other chains. OneLedger is a truly universal protocol that provides a one-stop solution for enterprise blockchain applications in the form of modules. The smart contract built on OneLedger Protocol is a true cross-chain smart contract.  The primary use case of OneLedger is to allow centralized enterprises to extend their markets via decentralized technologies. A primary pain-point that they face is the setup and integration of different chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other great public/private chains in the future. Instead of having to install lots of different chains to access their capabilities, enterprises only need to install the OneLedger gateway. OneLedger will manage their identities and accounts, and provide easy connectivity to their existing systems. As well, they can pick trusted business modules from the marketplace and use them to simplify their interactions  As the name OneLedger literally implies, the project is not a single blockchain, but rather an ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. It is possible to deploy a customizable private/public sidechains with their own consensus algorithms, which will communicate with each other being interoperable with the main chain.  Since OLT design takes care of different configurable algorithm, the tps is described as elastic because realistically, it is a range starting from around Tendermint’s performance on the low end, going up to maybe just a pure P2P fault tolerance on the high end.  Consensus: Currently, the MVP is PoS. The testnet is live and it's dPoS + PBFT based. The mainnet will also be DPoS + PBFT but instead of having masternodes, OLT has introduced a similar concept called validators but their selection is dynamic so as to maximize their number across all the chains for better participation, security, stability etc.  OneLedger consensus in the early phase allows everyone to run a node. Later on, staking amounts of tokens will be required to assume quality and commitment.  Token: OLT is a utility token which is used to perform transactions on the OneLedger platform. The token is currently an ERC-20 token but will be migrated over to the OneLedger protocol when mainnet launches in 2019. Some of the use cases of OLT include: - Users use OLT for payment of network fee to use any service on the platform. - Network supporters (nodes) receive OLT as network fee. - Developers need OLT to deploy their application on the OneLedger platform.      -------------   -------------   -------------   -------------   -------------     Newsletter 18 — Biweekly updates   https://medium.com/oneledger/newsletter-18-biweekly-updates-5712e06d5c84   Hello OneLedger Community,  Through this newsletter, we would like to provide you with an update regarding the following departments: Development, and Marketing and Community.        1.

About TPS : The testnet hasn't been stressed yet, the the number of transactions has been fairly low so far. We'll schedule an upcoing test soon, that will really push its limits... About Sharding : We haven't looked at or considered sharding. Our intent is to distribute different workloads across multiple sub-chains, but that is a slightly different philosophy than sharding (which is really just a partitioning of the underlying main chain).

Despite the cold and stormy weather, we had a good turnout for the event. Our event was attended by 18 people who were curious to know more about the OneLedger technology.      Sahir Parmar (Community Director), Shaleen Ladha (Marketing Associate) and David Cao (Founder & CEO) welcoming guests    The event started out with a great presentation by Aly Kassam, the Product Manager at OneLedger. He spoke about our vision and discussed several stages of product development.       Aly Kassam (Product Manager) presenting the Product Development    “OneLedger has interoperability and enterprise connectivity embedded in the network. We would like to bring AI and IoT back”, said Aly. “We are aiming to create something that can be adapted into any blockchain with easily accessible tools”, Aly added.     Aly Kassam displaying the OneLedger Product Stack    OneLedger aims to release its Mainnet by the end of Q4 2019. Our team is putting in a lot of work around the clock to push hard to meet the deadlines and execute all the milestones on the roadmap.     OneLedger Roadmap for 2019     Next, was Alex Lan, the Co-Founder and Blockchain R&D at OneLedger. Alex discussed the architecture behind OneLedger and did a quick demonstration of our smart contracts.        Alex Lan presenting the OneLedger architecture    The smart contracts are based on JavaScript. OneLedger will look to add multiple language support in the future to make it easier for developers to build Dapps in the language of their choice and allow seamless integration within the OneLedger protocol.        “We don't think there will only be one Blockchain that dominates in the future. We definitely think there will be numerous bounded blockchain networks, and OneLedger will connect/exchange the value they provide”, said Alex. He added, “What makes OneLedger so unique is it’s very deeply rooted consensus, and this is going to play an integral role in the future blockchain networks.”     The third and final speaker of our event was Chinmay Patel. Chinmay is the CEO and Founder of BlockX Labs. He mentioned the role of Developers in this new era of technology.       Chinmay Patel (CEO & Founder of BlockX Labs) talking about “Building Developer Tools on Web 3.0”    “When you make the process easier for developers to implement the technology into their solutions, the clients will come. You just need to win the vote of one Senior Developer from the client’s team”, said Chinmay.     With this, our event came to an end. The OneLedger team would like to thank everyone who was present at the event, as well the community who has constantly supported us throughout our journey. We hope to see you all at the next event.     “We may be a small team, but we have big dreams.”    Highlights from the event:  Click the link for our video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjNREW0I3zs    Click the link for our video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjNREW0I3zs        OneLedger v0.8.4 Update  Please see the most recent update from the OneLedger Development Team  https://medium.com/oneledger/oneledger-v0-8-4-update-52a8587add5    In our last sprint, the team focused on OneExplorer bug fixes and enhancing the data stream for the OneExplorer.

I think the ability to adapt to a change is a very important attribute to have for engineers and developers in order to succeed in the fast-paced ever-changing technology sector. The reason I joined OneLedger is that I want to challenge myself. I want to help this company succeed in whatever capacity I am able to contribute. I have been a crypto fan for quite some time, and I strongly believe that blockchain as a technology, will have major implications at a global level in the future — Steven Yan.  Steven will be working on the OneLedger infrastructure. He will play a key role in bridging the gap between development, operations, network and security.  His main tasks at OneLedger are to make:  -the deployments at the protocol (full node) and application (explorer, wallet) layer automated, i.e One-click deployment -the infrastructure at the application layer such as the explorer scalable for internet traffic -the security enhanced: DDoS mitigation, Organizational access control & credential management, audit trail etc.  Today, it is very critical to exchange information securely between different parties where everything is connected through the internet. Through OneLedger, digital assets will be able to transfer through multiple layers in a safe and secure way. I believe OneLedger will be a game-changer for enterprises looking to integrate blockchain within their ecosystem as it provides flexibility with using the blockchain of their choice — Steven Yan.  The OneLedger team is proud to welcome Steven Yan and is confident that his skills and relevant experience will help speed up the technical developments.  https://medium.com/oneledger/meet-the-oneledger-team-11-steven-yan-224bb57fff8f",False

Context and Mission   The primary use case of OneLedger is to allow centralized enterprises to extend their markets via decentralized technologies. A primary pain-point that they face is the setup and integration of different chains like Bitcoin, Ethereum and other great public/private chains in the future. Instead of having to install lots of different chains to access their capabilities, enterprises only need to install the OneLedger gateway. OneLedger will manage their identities and accounts, and provide easy connectivity to their existing systems. As well, they can pick trusted business modules from the marketplace and use them to simplify their interactions.  As the name OneLedger literally implies, the project is not a single blockchain, but rather an ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. It is possible to deploy multiple customizable private/public sidechains with their own consensus algorithms, which will communicate with each other to provide interoperability with the main chain.

Chinese people are working in all around the world and you can find a good Chinese developer/software engineer in any place on Earth, it's the truth.  OneLedger Technology Inc. is a legitimate company registered in Barbados, you can search for the information here. Our team is working in Barbados, Canada, and China with a focus on improving the technology and establishing key business relationships, you can also find all the team members on LinkedIn. We are working in many places, as decentralizing as blockchain is.  When you look at a project with hatred, you will see everything shady. But our information is public and you can easily check for it.  Thanks for your attention. OneLedger team.   A glimpse of the OneLedger Daily Scrum Meeting     Telegram AMA with David Cao!!  A Telegram AMA was conducted on November 5, 2018, with David Cao, the Founder & CEO at OneLedger. The community discussed many topics with the CEO. Here is a brief summary of the AMA.    1. Why is the mainnet scheduled so far out? Any chance of scheduling sooner?  Response: To ensure the quality of the platform, we will work as per the current schedule. However, we will try our best to launch it as soon as possible.  2. Any specific date for the mainnet launch?  Response: No specific date. Our plan is to launch in Q4 2019.  3. Are there any concerns that the market share might be affected by such a distant mainnet target date?  Response: We are working on big projects, and compared to some other public chain projects, our target has already been very aggressive. We want to ensure the security and quality to get a better and bigger market share.  4. How many developers are working full-time on OneLedger?  Response: We currently have 7 full-time developers  5. Can you shed some light on the marketing activities to increase awareness of the project?  Response: Regarding general marketing, we are looking to target more enterprises and build partnerships as we move closer to the Testnet launch. For marketing to the blockchain community, we are looking to organize various events within Toronto and also worldwide. Once, we have the Testnet platform running, we will be organizing Hackathons to increase awareness amongst the developers as well.  We want to build our marketing efforts gradually during such market conditions, as we always prefer in staying lean and moving swiftly. We have also hired a team of Community Moderators in China who will focus on blockchain learning activities for the Chinese community. We are aggressively looking to expand in China and spread to other Asian countries as we believe there is a big market there.  6. Do you guys have any other plans of increasing the value of the OLT token besides the lockup program?  Response: We always focus on community build-up and try to bring more organic volume to help OLT in the market.  7. What makes OLT better than competitors, for example, Aion?  Response: One of our advantages is that we are more focused on enterprises as customers than most other teams. There are many blockchain companies who are building the tech, but they’ll have to adapt it to interface with centralized systems at a later date. We also started with their needs in mind, and have designed them directly into the architecture.  8. Do u have some real word partners or people interested in the project?  Response: We have partners interested in our tech and we are building the cooperation in game, supply-chain and financial industry. We will release the PR, as we progress.  9. Do you have plans to list on more exchanges?  Response: We are in talks with several exchanges, and are looking to list in an efficient manner, while also keeping our long-term goals in mind.  10. Are there any third parties that are auditing the testnet or the code?  Response: For auditing the testnet, yes, we will engage both the community and several third-parties to actively stress-test the testnet. We need to ensure that it is reliable.  11. What are you gonna do to give hope to the people that invested in ICO and now they are at -90%, am not one of them but it is nice to say something to them.  Response: Yes, we cannot control the price. However, what we can control is the communication and ways on improving the project in the long-run. You may have noticed that our community engagement has greatly increased since a couple of months. We are also looking to build enterprise partnerships, and increase the OneLedger awareness across the globe.  12. Where do u see yourself after 1 year Mr. David?  Response: I would see myself working at a more enterprise level on OneLedger and make OneLedger a better brand globally.  13. Partnership announcements are cool but doesn’t say much, imo, until there is an actual production through that partnership. It does shows good initiative that the team is looking ahead.  Response: Each partner is not just announcement, we have actual direction to work together and build some useful utility together.
