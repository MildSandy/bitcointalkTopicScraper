We respect Steemit's success so far but we believe our platform is fundamentally different from Steemit in several aspects. First, Steemit is not truly decentralized. The problem lies with the distribution of Steem Power which, from the very start, was designed to concentrate among Steemit Inc. employees and developers. In 2017, it was estimated that the top 247 accounts on Steemit (most of which are probably owned by the developer and his ‚Äòfriends‚Äô through duplicate accounts) owned ~87.50% of total stake, without including the main Steemit account which is also controlled by the dev. (https://decentralize.today/the-ugly-truth-behind-steemit-1a525f5e156). In 2017, Oxfam calculated that just 8 people controlled the same wealth as 50% of the rest of the world. (https://steemit.com/steemit/@eroche/distribution-of-steem-and-steem-power). This means that a few people control the content on the Steemit platform. Imagine Warren Buffett's vote for a presidential nominee counts thousands more times than that of an average Joe. REOS, on the other hand, is truly democratic. Its unique ""Voting with Stakes"" mechanism ensures a democratic process of voting by community members. Each member puts in the same amount of REOS as stakes to vote for a piece of content, which means each vote counts the same.  The role of the Promoter is to initiate the voting (content validation) process and set the rules for the content validation (such as how long the voting process takes). We require that each Promoter has a minimum number of stakes (currently set at 100K REOS) because we want them to act responsibly. During the content validation period, the result is hidden from the community until the completion of the process. This ensures that we dig out the true worthiness of the content for the REOS community. On Steemit, users upvote or downvote for a piece of content and the voting power is based on the stakes a user owns. However, the users don't really lose stakes if they vote irresponsibly. On REOS, one can lose tokens if he or she votes irresponsibly. Our ""Voting with Stakes"" has some similarities to futures prediction markets, which have proven to be more accurate than polls.",False

REOSchain, the main blockchain for the REOS community, does ensure accurate attribution of ownership of digital assets. However, our platform goes way beyond that: we're building a decentralized user-generated content exchange with a content validation mechanism which not only allows for content creators to better monetize their content, but it also ensures the truthfulness of the content consumed by all members of the community. It's a platform for social UGC DApps where members of the community have complete control.

REOS is a blockchain-based ecosystem for user generated content (UGC) that empowers content creators and consumers. The platform enables content creators to monetize their UGC, such as short videos, in a variety of ways, without a middleman, while making sure that the content is validated by the REOS community. All digital content contributed by content creators are also registered on the REOSchain, the main blockchain for the REOS community, to ensure accurate attribution of ownership of the digital assets. Content creators can be securely paid by various stakeholders, bypassing any intermediaries, by using REOS, a utility crypto-token issued by REOS Foundation.
