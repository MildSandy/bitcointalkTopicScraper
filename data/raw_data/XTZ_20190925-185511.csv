A self-amending blockchain is something huge, never tried before. It has the potential to take every improvement of any other blockchains and implement it, without centralized hard forks. I don't see overhype here, the project really has a lot of potential. Let's hope to see it live soon.    Some points from the website:  Decentralized, automated upgrades: Virtually every example of of modern software provides for automated updates, but blockchains remain a notable exception because update procedures are typically centralized. Tezos achieves decentralized upgrades of its blockchain protocol, something no other system offers.  Upgrades without hard forks: Upgrades are decided by stakeholder consensus in accordance to clearly laid out governance rules that are programmatically enforced. This avoids political deadlock and stagnation without entrusting or empowering a single core development team or de factor group with disproportionate sway over the process.  Funding innovation: While blockchain innovation is moving at a breathtaking pace, there is often little incentive to improve existing systems. As a result, application developers have been shoehorning tokens into applications where they do not naturally fit. These “appcoins” dilute the value of the underlying platform more than they contribute to its network effect.",False

See it's my guess that by 20th January no later if you haven't employed at least 10 coders by that date you are a waste of space and you should be sacked on the spot..  Now almost everyone wants you gone BUT i will give you 1 chance and it will be your last chance because your record is piss poor to say the least ..  1 last chance Mr gevers to redeem yourself and your pride . 10 new coders out of the charity foundation monies that people donated to .. They donated to a cause and the cause was not to line your own pockets Mr Gevers ..  Have you read Swiss foundation law?.. I have and if your not doing a good job or allocating funds in the direction they are suppose to go to another cause that's very like TEZOS and the donations that you received they get chosen by the people who donated the funds to which cause they go to ..  Because the foundation will be found to be incompetent to do the job they was suppose to do I.E build a tezos network so humanity can use it and the technology will help mankind for the good..  By 20th January if just the same and no new members then your gone FIRED.. Go and check swiss foundation law you need to show your competent because if your not competent then the TEZOS COMMUNITY can fire your ass..  OH YES THEY CAN ..They sent the donations to be used on building a tezos blockchain and you must show your TRYING..And at the moment it's plain to see YOU Gevers are not trying..   Now i will say this I want to see coders hired and not your friends  ..   SYSCOIN got ripped off as you will know..  LAWYERS  ..POLICE STATION <<<Fraud squad they will investigate way more and for 1 billion what a result for the police..  No deployment of donations to coders by 20th January then the funds must be taken away by the LAW..POLICE LAW..  And then i will ask the community to ask the police to use their donations to save the whales and the fishees  in the sea from plastic..  Employ 100 scientist for 30 years to study plastic pollution and how to stop it from getting into the OCEAN ..  Remember i said clock is ticking   well your time just got shorter from getting the SACK..  You can and will be removed or the SWISS will look bad at BUSINESS the new crypto business world will be destroyed in SWITZERLAND forever..  Why you say?..Because your not sticking by what a foundation is suppose to do with the donations people donated to..  You cannot say donate to cats and give it to dogs ..  So MR Gevers show your face and explain what the plans are and your employing no less than 10 coders to help with the TEZOS BLOCKCHAIN in order to carry out your foundations mission to make sure TEZOS is a winner..  Remember under swiss foundation law the monies are to be treated like your doing the best for the Tezos community and the funds cannot be spent on yourself..   Arthur Breitman  You need to launch a stable network for 3 months for your wages BUT gevers you are suppose to get all the help he needs and more..  The monies are to be used to help him launch a stable network..  SO by 20th January i EXPECT to see new coders and what they plan to code ..  OR YOUR FIRED..Mr GEVERS..  1 last chance to prove yourself MR GEVERS..Don't let the ZULUS down JOKE The TEZOS COMMUNITY DOWN ..  SYSCOIN LOST ALL THEIR MONIES ..And still they carried on like soldiers ..  The TEZOS monies is sitting doing nothing now do something with it or i will ..  I would love to get hold of that money for plastic waste research and i am sure many politicians would too ...  So hurry up and spend some on devs or i go for the monies for a proper charity like it's says in the swiss foundation law ..  People who donated can opt to use the funds for another cause similar to the one they donated to or the government can step in and take it away and give it to a cause that helps humanity and not the people who asked for the donation they go to JAIL for CHARITY FRAUD ..  1 billion dollars worth of jail time..  So gevers you hire and Arthur Breitman you release the tezos blockchain ..  If you don't Arthur Breitman no jail time for you because your working and doing the job with no funding that gevers is suppose to give to more coders..  Then after 3 months of a stable network Arthur Breitman you get your % of the monies ..  How simple is that to accomplish ?..  See all the brains but fall foul of your end goal NOT GOOD.. your mindset needs to be i will never ever quit because i am not a quitter ..  Now Gevers this is your mindset?..Well do something to prove people wrong..  20TH JANUARY  if nothing getting done with the tezos funds then your FIRED.. For being piss poor and a danger to the TEZOS FOUNDATION..  Believe me MR GEVERS try and steal any monies in anyway shape or form and you will be hunted down as a thief by the law..

The judge is quoted as saying the management structure overseeing the Swiss-based foundation is in turmoil, but he is apparently unwilling to approve a request by   When can I get my money back.  Your not getting it back  ..It's going to research plastic pollution in the sea and oceans to save our planet from plastic pollution ..  You cannot get it back it's a DONATION to help humanity ..  Don't worry if anyone takes any monies without it going on what it suppose to be getting used for they will get done for fraud CHARITY FRAUD ..  But kiss your donation good bye and hope it gets used on the cause you donated too OR they get done for fraud  ..  And by foundation law and by the way swiss foundation laws are all most the same as any foundation set up in the west ..  They have to use the funds on what they said the donations were for or they get done for fraud.. Also they cannot use the funds to benefit themselves or they get done for fraud..  And believe me many many peoples are watching to see what happens the SHARKS are out to kill ..Get you in court and eat you alive..  If i walked in the court they would be in jail   IF and that's if they use the funds correctly they will be all good because they done CHARITY WORK..  Not the case if funds go missing or they spend it on themselves OR even spend them unwisely they can be done and sued ..  And if the SWISS government don't take no action they can be sued ..  And everyone who as donations sitting in the TEZOS swiss foundation will file for compensation of the SWISS GOVERNMENT for lack of progress in helping humanity by not using the donations people give..  Under SWISS LAW you as a foundation need to show your COMPETENT as a foundation and if your showing lack of progress can lead the government to step in and take those funds away and ask the people who donated which charity they want the funds to go too..  So sorry your monies have gone for now but you will be able to donate to a similar cause of your choice.. I.E another one like TEZOS or plastic pollution and that's why i will be going after the MONIES ..To save the OCEAN  ..  And i know i have a very good chance at getting the MONIES if these TEZOS foundation messes up ..  I know i will get that money .. 20TH JANUARY no coders hired you Gevers are FIRED and someone else will be hired in your place ..

To all who hold an ICO you need to hear this ..  When people go to work they earn money .. Now some people work very very hard for their monies and what some people done was work very very hard and then DONATED so the next peoples could work very very hard  ..  So my point is when people donated they had to work hard to get that money so the people that DONATED they give you their hard labour in return you keep to your part of the deal in the DONATION and then you work hard and then everything all fits together..  So 1 hard work which got you the TEZOS funds = Your hard work to make TEZOS a winner.. Now if people from the start never worked hard the TEZOS wouldn't have any funds ..  So 20th January more coders coding things that will go on the platform partnerships things of that calibre.. Many things that can be done while others code the main net tezos platform ..  people who donated their hard work = You got all the hard work money so you do your hard work..  And then the 2 fit like a glove and everyone is HAPPY..  Remember Tezos is about government.. So who payes for the government?..  Yes so remember foundation you work for the community not yourselves.. Just like a politician ..  20TH January 2018 some devs employed or you go MR GEVERS.. Why because your a danger to the Tezos foundation        bad leader so fired ..  Where is some research ?..Employ some scientist plastic pollution in the OCEAN  ..  Employ 2 scientist buy them a bucket each and a rubber dinghy and let them paddle around the ocean picking up plastic and studying it  ..  And don't forget to put the Tezos logo on the rubber dinghy..  Then Tezos is helping the environment plus gets loads of advertisement because we will need a search and rescue team to find the 2 scientist lost in the ocean BUT it will make the main news and win win for TEZOS.. ..

I from the UK so i am confused he said your monies btc eth are safe but you cannot get your monies back so does safe mean gone in Switzerland  ..  Now the fact you cannot get your monies btc eth back because it was a non refund donation.. The fact they never used that donation on the right charity because a donation falls under charity you can opt to give your monies btc eth to another charity of your choice ..  So i say everyone should opt for another charity and the charity is  SAVE THE OCEAN FROM PLASTIC FUNDS..  Everyone should opt to give charities who will look after our oceans and sea and protect it from PLASTIC POLLUTION ..  RECYCLE OR DIE  So if you think about it the money whales have save the fishy whales ..  GREAT IDEA..  So i will be watching every move TEZOS makes because i say use that tezos donation to save the oceans from plastic..  This GEVERS guy is in some real shit JAIL TIME many many years.. CHARITY FRAUD..  1 BILLION DOLLARS..  I want that to save the oceans from plastic if no refunds to the people who donated to the tezos charity..  OH yes it is CHARITY if a donation ..So here we come 1 billion dollars to save the the ocean from plastic..  The WHALES save the WHALES  ..  MAJOR CHARITY FRAUD ..Nothing on the charity box is getting done ..  Just think many many eyes are watching that monies and if BTC drops and that CHARITY monies drops i think the bailiffs will be stripping anyone who had anything to do with setting up the charity and the foundation members..

As we made clear in our Community Petition, we repeat our request for the resignation or dismissal of Mr. Gevers, regardless of the results of audits, either internal or external, because of Mr. Gevers’ enumerated failures that are beyond the scope of an audit, such as issues of trust, poor communication and his fraught relationship with the Tezos Community and DLS.

Investigating oneself and coming to a conclusion is the very essence of self-dealing.  Any board member who has so significantly lost the trust of the Community would long have resigned for the good repair of the community and for moving Tezos from scandal to successful launch.

Those who contributed without really knowing what Tezos is or how it plans to improve the cryptocurrency world. If you are one of those I can see why you are panicking but understand that Ethereum went through tougher challenges early on and it is where it is now. Be patient.  2. Those who did not contribute and do not like Tezos for any reason. If you are one of them please be quiet. All you do is freak out the people at #1 and we are tired of babysitting them. If your plan is to keep the Tezzies price lower so that you can buy it cheaper then I may keep quiet so that I add more Tezzies at lower price myself 😂  3. Those who were surprised by this conflict between founders and foundation board members. This is business and it is always difficult to govern people. Tezos is not unique. Look at the number of Bitcoin hard forks lately. Every stakeholder have their own interest and unless we have evidence that the founders squandered the Dev money or abandoned the project we should keep the faith.  (Thanks to Tebarek),False

Well not to worry popcorn1 is here to put your minds at ease .. it's all over the shop saying biggest ever ICO in danger..  Arthur & Kathleen Breitman i done some research and it seems you love each other?..  Well get ready to be sending each other love letters from JAIL  .. You thought you was smart by saying tezos is a DONATION to cover your asses ..  Now maybe you are legit but one thing i would do is think what was the donation for ..  I mean if i donated to the poppy foundation guess what it should go to the poppy foundation and what is the poppy foundation for?  Well not to line someones pockets for their own benefits it goes to the soldiers ..  Now when some people walked past your donation box it said it was for a new blockchain called OCAML and that people who donated would get well your WHITE PAPER..  Now many didn't donate to the RSPCA they donated to tezos because if some people knew the donation was for the RSPCA then many wouldn't of donated ..  So who was involved with asking for donations to the tezos foundation need to produce whats in the white paper or it's fraud ..  Do you know by shaking your donation box with false information on the box and also emptying it in your own pockets means CHARITY FRAUD .. ..  So make sure the charity everyone donated to gets released and the promises are met..  6.2 DEVELOPMENT GOALS The development goals of Tezos follow five axes:security, scaling, privacy,usability, and features. The development team will pursue all five goals somewhat in parallel but not with the same priority  DID YOU donate to the POPPY foundation or the RSPCA or the TEZOS foundation..  The donation was for the white paper to be finished so the whole world could us it.. Now whether it was a flop or not that as yet to be seen ..  BUT if the money goes missing and no tezos white paper then you can safely say it's FRAUD ..CHARITY FRAUD ..Much worse jail term ..  Your promises below.. So if i was anyone who had anything to do with the set up of TEZOS you are involved in a crime..   Tezos can instantiate any blockchain based protocol. Its seed protocol specifies a procedure for stakeholders to approve amendments to the protocol, including amendments to the amendment procedure itself. Upgrades to Tezos are staged through a testing environment to allow stakeholders to recall potentially problematic amendments. The philosophy of Tezos is inspired by Peter Suber’s Nomic[1], a game built around a fully introspective set of rules. In this paper, we hope to elucidate the potential benefits of Tezos, our choice to implement as a proof-of-stake system, and our choice to write it..   I hate scams i love to bust them .. Why do i hate them because just maybe your trying to rob me ..  Not on this one though ..  So make sure that tezos gets released or some people will be in jail 400 MILLION DOLLARS worth of jail time..  You thought you was smart by saying donation ..  The point is what did people donate to if it's not the cause on the donation advert or box then that is fraud ..  I could say help the WHALES with a nice picture of a whale on a box and then walk around the corner and then throw all the money in my pocket and say i changed my mind it's for the popcorn foundation YES charity for me and my family to have a good life THANKS..   I am afraid it don't work that way it's fraud ..  SO BRING THE TECH OUT .. And your asses are covered don't bring it out then refunds to the people you got the money off or JAIL..",False

I feel like everyone has this backwards. If this were stock in a company, the price of the stock is directly related to the value of the company (how much it has in assets).  Tezos is the opposite of the majority of these ICO's, the money isn't just handed out to the team who created the whitepaper, it is managed as funds for the network by a non-profit organization. You can think of the tokens as being directly backed by these funds in a way.  For most ICO's particularly all the ERC-20 garbage as of late, it's not that. They take your money, put it in their bank accounts and give you something useless in return.  And don't forget these area all micro-cap investments anyway.

Ethereum, CryptoNote, and Zerocash all represent unique contributions to the crypto-currency space. Although most alt currencies harbor their own source of innovation, they have no means of adopting the innovations of other currencies which may succeed them. We aim to remedy the po- tential for atrophied evolution in the crypto-currency space by presenting Tezos, a generic and self-amending crypto-ledger. Tezos can instanciate any blockchain based protocol. Its seed protocol speci es a procedure for stakeholders to approve amendments to the proto- col, including amendments to the amendment procedure itself. Upgrades to Tezos are staged through a testing environment to allow stakeholders to recall potentially problematic amendments. The philosophy of Tezos is inspired by Peter Suber's Nomic[1], a game built around a fully introspective set of rules. In this paper, we hope to elucidate the potential bene ts of Tezos, our choice to implement as a proof-of-stake system, and our choice to write it in OCaml.",False
