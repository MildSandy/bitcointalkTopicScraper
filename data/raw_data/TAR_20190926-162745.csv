Robotar is a telepresence robot with remote control by the Internet using a VR helmet and sensory gloves. Robotar repeats the movement of the person-operator and transmits the picture with stereoview and sound to the helmet of virtual reality, achieving the effect of operator presence at the location of the robot. It is also possible to control the robot from a PC or laptop, using or without using motion capture tools. Robotar also can be universal humanoid robot platform for developing software and science research.  We will create an online store of robots and their components with payment of TAR tokens, and an ecosystem for software developers for robots.  http://robotar.tech/images/6.jpg   Problem & Solution  We are developing Robotar for a solution of main issues of telepresence and humanoid robots.  1. Too expensive robots. At the moment price of robots is much higher than can afford ordinary people or small business. Existing robotic solutions are based on high-cost, small-circulation components, which require precision machining centers for production. Due to the high price of robotic solutions, they do not find application in the real sector of the economy.  2. Narrow specialization of service robots. Now most household and commercial robots are not universal and can solve only one task set by developers. Currently, advanced humanoid robots do not go beyond the research laboratories in which they are created, and the functionality of human-like robots is limited to the customer's requirements and answers only his narrow business case.  OUR SOLUTION that will change robots market Robotar is a universal human-friendly robot capable of working safely in the human environment as a telepresence robot or autonomously. Our technology will reduce the cost of the robot by an order of magnitude without reducing the level of power, speed and accuracy of movement. Due to a large number of software, anthropomorphy and intuitive operation control, Robotar could perform a wide range of tasks that people face every day.    https://robotar.cc/images/model.jpg   We have created a Proof-of-Concept to test motion drive technology of robot   https://robotar.cc/images/poc.png    ICO key terms  Robotar token (TAR) will be released on the basis of the  Ethereum blockchain and complies with the ERC20 standard. All purchased tokens will be moved to the wallets of users in the Ethereum blockchain by a smart contract.   https://robotar.cc/images/table.png   https://robotar.cc/images/diag.png   Use of TAR tokens after ICO  TAR tokens is a utility tokens, also acting as discount coupons (providing up to 100% discount) in the Robotar Store, which will be created in early 2019. TAR tokens after ICO can be used for the following purposes: •   Trading on stock exchanges. TAR tokens after the end of ICO will be added to several crypto exchanges so that ICO participants and customers can freely sell and buy them. •   Purchase of robots and their components in the online Robotar Store. Robots and their components can be paid with fiat money, as well as with crypto-currency and  TAR tokens. By TAR tokens, the purchase can be paid in part or in full, while the products in the Robotar Store will be nominated in TAR tokens at a discount to its market rate in relation to other types of means of payment. •   Purchase of software and applications for robots in the application store. The cost of applications will also be denominated in TAR tokens at a discount to its market rate relative to other types of payment instruments. •   Crowdfunding  software for robots. Owners of TAR tokens through a smart contract will be able to carry out crowdfunding of the process of creating the necessary software for them in the Robotar Community. •   Voting for in-demand software for robots. Owners of TAR tokens through a smart contract will be able to vote for the claimed software for robots in the Robotar Community. •   Rent of robots and computer time. With the help of TAR tokens, it will be possible to rent remote Robotar robots to perform any tasks. Also, operators of telepresence robots can receive payment by TAR tokens during their work. In the future, it will be possible to pay server time for servers with TAR tokens for image and voice recognition, neural networks, etc. tasks that robots may need to perform assigned to them.   Why will the price of the TAR token grow?  TAR tokens will not be issued after the ICO ends - their number will remain unchanged forever. The Robotar fund will be frozen until the opening of the online store. Funds of the team fund will also be frozen until the prototype of the Robotar One model is ready. Robotar products in the Robotar Store will be sold at a discount when buying for TAR tokens, so it will be more profitable for the buyer to pay for tokens. We are counting on the fact that the demand for Robotar products, which can be paid with TAR tokens, will grow. Thus, the cost of tokens will also grow. We pledge to inform the community of TAR token holders about all the news of the company. Also, at the end of the ICO, part of the collected funds will go to the reserve fund, funds of which will also be used to maintain the TAR token rate. Tokens can be bought back after they are released on the exchange.
