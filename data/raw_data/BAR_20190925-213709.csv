I do have a few concerns that I don't think anyone here has expressed. DO NOT take this personally but this is just coming from someone that has worked in infrastructure for a decade with my most recent role involving VMWare VM administration, AWS/Azure migrations, and workload analysis.  1.  Establishing a CLOUD provider compute environment IS A HUGE undertaking!  After reading the white paper, I do not see any technical specifics of how you plan to accomplish this.  While the White paper is complete, it's more of a project plan than a technical white paper.   I'm not saying you can't do it, but for someone like myself who knows what's involved - it would be nice to see how TBIS plans to accomplish this - at least in small detail.  You can't just pull Enterprise class services out of thin air.    2. 99.999999% uptime is the most ""sales pitchy"" cliche one can throw out in this industry.  If you plan to run this on the ETH network - what will your plan be to address the fact that an app as simple as CryptoKitties was able to ""crash"" the Ethereum blockchain?  Has anyone else here given this some thought?  3. I'm a little weary that the address on your DUNS number is registered to your apt. TITANIUM BLOCKCHAIN INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES INC. 15027 DICKENS ST APT 4 SHERMAN OAKS, CA 91403  HOWEVER, it's not uncommon to start a business from home so I wont knock this too hard.  All that said - I think TBIS has a pretty lofty goal here and I hope that your team can deliver.  ",False

Maybe you don’t know what a ponzi is, but this is simply an incentive for people to perform a referral to TBIS and invite someone else.  People can gain a $1 token for inviting their friend.  There’s no pyramid in this... and no multiple levels of paying.  There are even strict controls put in place to make sure no one benefits from faking out the system, sending in fake profiles or using bots.  The idea is to introduce as many people as possible to TBIS and to provide a small incentive to those willing to invite their friends and acquaintances.  Everything about this project is legit.  So, I recommend looking a bit further.  Join the Telegram chat and ask all the questions you want.  After Christmas the CEO himself will be there everyday and answers questions.

Having worked in IT Infrastructure myself I know how painful it is to setup things yourself. With such concept things are definitely going to be smooth for a company as most of the things will be handled by the vendor. I would love to setup things on the fly and have a proactive monitoring set for my servers and other network devices. This is indeed the path which is still unexplored and I am happy that blockchain and project like this have bought the bits and pieces together and presented it in the most efficient and effective manner.  Good luck to the team and I will be following your project for sure.,False

I went through and did some due dilligence and the company and team all checks out.  But one thing that concerns me from an investment standpoint is this:  This definitely looks like it would be a long term hold investment. A prototype will be released Q1 2018 but it won't go to market until 2019. It seems that the potential of the coin itself lies in how many companies subscribe to Titanium's services, which is a long ways away.  I have nothing against long term investing, but how will this outperform BTC's current crazy inflation rate? BTC is looking to smash past 20k and even 30k in 2018.  How will BAR tokens be able to outperform btc's growth if next year there is just prototype testing and auditing? Wouldn't it be better to just leave our btc in btc instead of buying BARS?  With all of this in mind $1 = 1 BAR seems a little expensive from an investment standpoint.  Maybe I will sit the ico out and invest in sometime during Q2 of 2018.",False
