Hydrogen Coin with already signed Orders in worth of 175,000,000 $ 2. Kruger Coin = 100% Gold backed Stable Coin from the BDT Ecosystem 3. AI Marketplace with a already existing Blockchain)  Future Listings:  In my Opinion is on the Market a huge Problem available because to much fake Volumes on the most new Exchanges and thats the reason why we have chosen and submitted our requests to older Exchanges with a real Volume and real Users like Yobit, Bittrex, Coinexchange, Liquid and Bitfinex!  From Bittrex and Yobit should we get next week a answer!  Volume: How all can see is our Volume not so bad! The most time on Hotbit we have had a volume from more than 50k $ daily and thats on a rather small Exchange!  The new Exchange p2pb2b.com is available on CMC with more than 60 million $ daily volume but i think the real volume is not more than 500k on this Exchange and the rest are only Bot transactions! ""MY OPINION""  The Time is over with sold out ICO's and therefore you have to reach your buyers with good Exchange listings like Yobit, Bittrex, Coinexchange, Liquid and Bitfinex and good Products!  More than 1k Person have bought the BDT Token on the Hotbit Exchange in one month and in my opinion is it a good way forward!  We do what we have promised also in this bear market and the Project will be a success at the end for all Holders!  We finish in the next two month 90% from our Products!  Coin Usage: BDT Ecosystem backed by precious metals - Kruger Coin (LAUNCH FEBRUARY 2019)  Our Coin serves as a reward for users who decide to invest early on a project before acceptance into the community. These pre-investments can only be made with our BDT Coin. Therefore BDT Coins are necessary to later get 25% more Coin on the pre investments of ICOs made via our marketplace. If the project goes live, the user can invest using other Coins outside the BDT Coin - BDT Investment Platform integration LAUNCH END JANUARY START FEBRUARY 2019)  Use the BDT payment solutions with the BDT Coin - BDT Credit Card (LAUNCH IN THE RUNNING YEAR 2019)  Zero Trading Fee Exchange with the BDT Trading Pair - (LAUNCH IN THE Q1 2019)  BDT Coin Staking PoS - ALREADY AVAILABLE  If you have any questions please ask here.

The new blockchain will move away from Ethereum in an effort to accelerate the introduction of its solutions.     Bitdepositary will officially launch the Bitdepositary Blockchain Solution in a few weeks. With fast and consistent work, Bitdepositary has built its own hybrid blockchain to serve its customers' needs: some clients require a private chain solution, while others prefer a public blockchain. In this sense, Bitdepositary hybrid blockchain will meet requirements on a case by case basis.      The decision to switch to its own blockchain was taken in view of the changes taking place in Ethereum, which could potentially impact the evolution of the BDT token.     ‚ÄúWe would like to thank to each and every one of you for your contributions, which helped us close the token sale faster and secure funding for our roadmap milestones. We expect to go online with our BDT Blockchain in the next two to three weeks,‚Äù said Tobias Graf, CEO and Founder, Bitdepositary.     On the new blockchain, the BDT tokens will be converted to BDT coins at a ratio of 6:1. So 6 BDT tokens will be equal to 1 BDT coin. The token swap or conversion will take place over the next 6 months, and there will be an official announcement. Investors will thus get sufficient time to make the transition. The existing wallet will be updated in the coming two weeks into a completely decentralized wallet for the BDT coins. The circulating supply of approximately 600 million BDT tokens will also follow the same conversion ratio, and will become 100 million.     On the staking front, BDT will be a PoS (proof of stake) combined with X13 algorithm. PoS rewards for stake holders: 1 year (12%), 2-4 years (10%), and from the 8th year onwards, 6% per year. The platform will also feature a BDT tumbler for extra confidentiality.     BDT tokens are still available for purchase on Hotbit, and will soon be listed on IDEX and other exchanges. Investors can therefore benefit from the new conversion to the coin. The BDT exchange is on schedule for launch next year (whitelisting is currently on).     Bitdepositary is heralding a new future for crypto banking with a zero trading fee exchange and an Investors and Voting process for token generation events. With business vetting by legal and financial experts, and votes given by the community, investors will get to know which blockchain projects are trustworthy so as to stay protected from scams. Investors will also get a voice in crypto-projects. Bitdepositary offers 25% more tokens on pre-investment in token generation events made with BDT. Other features include an integrated payment solution with credit card, a secure and lightweight multi-coin wallet, and an easier way to invest in ongoing, upcoming and concluded coin offerings with up to 25 different currencies",False

I used that exchange in one of my tokens. Didn't know that price manipulation is happening in that exchange. Anyway, they can always look for a better market. If this project will stick to their plans, this will be valuable in the next few months. Most of the projects forgot their actual objectives once they focus in getting listed in exchanges. IMO, get listed in one exchange like this IDEX and fast track the development of the items listed in their roadmap. Don't rush in big ones without doing something for their project. That's where most projects failed.",False

It stands out in that it offers three key features on one platform:   ¬∑     A protection Algorithm ‚Äì The first blockchain platform to use Salesforce. This gives our community and the blockchain enthusiasts a secure environment to invest and grow their knowledge in the ICO market with confidence. This will ensure that users can transact without the fear of malicious attacks and hacking. ¬∑     e-Payment Feature ‚Äì Bitdepositary has sought a Finance License to offer e-payment services to the platform users. The brighter part is the option to manage both crypto and Fiat money from the same account. This will enable users to make payments and exchange and store their money in different currencies from the Bitdepositary app or platform. The users can also use or store BDT, an ERC20 Standard token to invest in projects or exchange with other currencies. ¬∑     Smart Contracts (Crowdfunding Feature) ‚Äì The platform will bring together and build a strong [Suspicious link removed]munity that will help identify the best projects to invest in based on their experience and ICO investment portfolio. Community members and users of the platform will benefit from the wisdom of the community by following some of the experienced users to obtain investment insights. Community users have to decide whether a project should be published on the platform through a voting system implemented through an intelligent contract.  The ICO issuer also benefits from access to a large network of serious blockchain investors and only needs to convince them to invest in their project by clearly communicating the idea. Empowering the users to vote on which projects should be published as an additional guard against scam projects and token loss/theft.    ‚ÑπÔ∏èTechnical Details in the BDT Blockchain: - [ ] PoS - [ ] X13 Algorithm - [ ] PoS Rewards       1 year = 12% per year       2 - 4 years = 10% per year       5 - 7 years = 8% per year       8th year onwards = 6% per Year - [ ] BDT Coin Tumbler  BDT Coin Wallets: https://github.com/BDT-Bitdepositary/BDT-Coin-Wallets   BDT Blockchain Explorer (Layout will be updated the next few days): https://bdtscan.io   BDT Staking: https://medium.com/@Bitdepositary/bdt-coin-staking-staking-rewards-40da4713984c   BDT Wallet Backup & Restore: https://medium.com/@Bitdepositary/bdt-coin-wallet-backup-wallet-restore-47b02f8d3b0a   BDT Chain Source Code: https://github.com/BDT-Bitdepositary/bdtcoinmaster            Bitdepositary Logical Flow ICO creators or companies will be allowed to submit their project ideas to a panel of project managers within the Bitdepositary platform. Each project will pass through a series of vetting to check for feasibility and many other project viability tests. These testing will involve analysis and evaluation of legal teams and tax consultants among other experts. After the evaluation, the project will be published to the users for voting. The project that will pass the 55% positive minimum will be launched and users can invest in it. Users who participate in voting will receive Project tokens in their Bitdepositary multi-wallet after reaching the softcap of the project.    The Bitdepositary Coin (BDT)      The Future of Bitdepositary Though in its initial stages, the dream for the Bitdepositary platform is big. It is expected to provide the users with all their financial needs from a fully secure and trusted blockchain system. The management is looking forward to a future where: ¬∑     Bitdepositary will establish a large and reputable network of specialists such as large tax and legal firms from different regions of the world. This will help in accessing compliance across the globe thus increasing the chances of project success. ¬∑     Create a rich pool of own fund. ¬∑     A way to access other financial services from the platform.    Precious Metal Ecosystem!  Hi BDT Community,  all are waiting here for good news and now we have finished our Gold Coin Concept and the final Calculation! The challenge was to create a profitable project for all and giving the BDT Coin even more value!  How all here knows, we start in the Q1 - 2019 with our 100% Gold backed Coin with the name KRUGER COIN in our precious metals Ecosystem!  1 Kruger Coin = 1 gram Gold  The Kruger Coin will be available for the purchase on our BDT Investment Platform and you can buy the Kruger Coin with the BDT Coin (25% Bonus), Bitcoin (5% Bonus) and Ethereum (5% Bonus) only in the Private Sale Stage!  Roadmap Kruger Coin: Q1 2019 - Start Kruger Coin Private Sale  Q2 - Q3 2019 - Purchase the own Gold Mine - Exchange 50% from your bought Kruger Coins into real Gold if you like  Q4 2019 - End Kruger Coin Private Sale  Q1 - Q2 2020 - Start Open Sale on the BDT Exchange and on several other Exchanges as Stablecoin - Exchange 100% from your bought Kruger Coins into real Gold if you like - Bonus Distribution - 1 Kruger Coin = 1 Gram Gold  Private Sale Funds Allocation:  50% - Direct gold purchase from the company Auvesta in Germany (every purchase will be certified)  50% - Purchase the own Gold Mine  Open Sale: The open sale will be executed directly at the Exchange without any Bonus and only in the amount we have gained from our gold mine! 100% backed with Gold!  Coin Allocation: 100% for Sale  How can we pay the Bonus on a 100% backed Stablecoin? - from the BDT Funds - from the purchase difference, because the bigger gold purchases - from the own Gold Mine  As everyone can see, we will not use any funds or coins for the team, we invest 100% completely in the project and the coin!  I repeat, you can buy gold with BDT coins!  100% for an 100% Gold backed Kruger Coin!
