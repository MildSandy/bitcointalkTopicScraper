Jokers like these need to learn....  A B Chain is cryptocurrency related. Google and Facebook now have fingers in pies (facebook = coinbase). Who would have ab chain added to their website when they can use adsense, or any of the other 'agencies' you speak of direct? Without messing around in a volatile world of crypto? Business owners have enough to worry about.* Why would an advertiser choose an obscure ad company that have literally 'killed their own mother' when Facebook and Google are far more superior in this ad space. I use this term because small sites, faucets and other respected companies/websites have spread the word about you as being different, invested their hard earned money into your wages and you repay these members by removing them from the network and taking back any coins earned. It's like killing the entity that gave birth to you.  There's only 1 company going places in the publisher crypto market and I have brought them 21 million opt ins since we partnered in December. And they have just over 200 million opt in visitors to date. Opt in advert viewers? Now there's a project to be interested in.  I hope you change your ways for your investors sake. If you don't... karma can be a b!tch..   *so much I had to continue here. Bitcoin ad networks are accepting websites that you are rejecting, you are not well known enough to be on sites with the popularity of coinmarketcap and suchlike. Also websites like mellow ads and coined. If j want to advertise a crypto related offer on my websites I advertise there and I get more sales as a result. I even saw your website on a site familybtc.com, it was in the center of the page in between content and liked the look of it so i joined. What is wrong with the ad placement there? After you got on your high horse in June I havent seen your ad since... What does that tell you?

I believe there are two possible answers for this. One, the price of advertisement solely depends on the hands of the team - if they want to gain more clients then they will lower their advertisment price or offer a sale. And if they see that the demand is greater than the supply (workforce) then I guess the price will be raised. Two, advertisement cost depends on the current value of AB-CHAIN coin.

We have changed the AB-CHAIN token name to — RTB, which stands for “Real Time Bidding.” Soon we will update the name on the website and in the whitepaper. RTB is going to be the official code of AB-CHAIN token from now onwards.  2. We have published RTB token smart contract in Ethereum blockchain. The token smart-contract contains the combustion functionality. We also provided the possibility of simple migration to another contract to allow easy update of the token once the majority of the supply has been burned.  3. We successfully purchased advertising with RTB tokens as well as applied 50% commission burning mechanism on our test network. We plan to introduce these features in the live version of the network next week. Despite AB-CHAIN being in an early stage, the network is already becoming fully-featured!

This is a model that AB-CHAIN uses. CPL means Cost Per Lead, it defines how much revenue a publisher receives when he creates a lead for an advertiser. CPC is a Cost Per Click, which means that a publisher receives money each time a user clicks on the banner. CPO means Cost Per Order - so a publisher receives money only if a lead he or she generated performs some targeted actions of the advertiser’s website or platform.",False

Thanks for the question.  Let me explain how we differ from other projects using as example AdEx ICO.  (1) First of all we are focused on business and customers, so we do the product for advertisers first of all (because they are the paying customers), then for publishers and ad networks (helping them to adopt new technology). (2) AB-CHAIN is solving different problem than AdEx. AdEx (and several other ICOs) are addressing ""Lack of consumer consent"" and ""Privacy concerns and data misuse"". We solve the problem of accessing big volume of ad space being natively paid in cryptocurrency. (3) Technologically AB-CHAIN will not write ad stats to blockchain to prevent ""Ad fraud"" and avoid ""Central regulation"". We think that this is an unnecessary load on infrastructure that will not help to prevent fraud nor solve any regulatory problem, but will cost a lot for advertisers. (4) AB-CHAIN focuses on business development and we plan to spread our solution to b2b market (existing ad networks), allowing other players to earn, thus helping them to start accepting ""magic"" cryptocurrency. (5) Finally we are building ad network on basis of AB-CHAIN ERC20 coin used as a utility token inside of the platform. We also will be contributing to our clients (advertisers and publishers) and community. 5% from each transaction will be burned.",False

This is a marvelous concept we liked from the first glance!  AB-CHAIN on the other hand is different from BAT as far as AB-CHAIN is serving mostly ICO companies.  (1) First of all we are focused on business and customers, so we do the product for advertisers first of all (because they are the paying customers), then for publishers and ad networks (helping them to adopt new technology). (2) AB-CHAIN is solving different problem than BAT. BAT are addressing ""Fraud and Malvertising"", ""Privacy concerns"" and tiredness of customers of annoying ads. We solve the problem of accessing big volume of ad space being natively paid in cryptocurrency. (3) AB-CHAIN focuses on business development and we plan to spread our solution to b2b market (existing ad networks), allowing other players to earn, thus helping them to start accepting ""magic"" cryptocurrency. (4) Finally we are building profitable coin that will guarantee that paying for advertising services in advance, an advertiser will be able to get more than actually paid - due to coin price growth. Especially for this we build mechanism that will press the price of the ABC coin. Our goal is to give them access to huge market of traditional advertising that is now already holding attention of existing customers today.",False

Here is the analysis of the difference of AB-CHAIN and AdEx product: (1) First of all we are focused on business and customers, so we do the product for advertisers first of all (because they are the paying customers), then for publishers and ad networks (helping them to adopt new technology). (2) AB-CHAIN is solving different problem than AdEx. AdEx are addressing ""Lack of consumer consent"" and ""Privacy concerns and data misuse"". We solve the problem of accessing big volume of ad space being natively paid in cryptocurrency. (3) Technologically AB-CHAIN will not write ad stats to blockchain to prevent ""Ad fraud"" and avoid ""Central regulation"". We think that this is an unnecessary load on infrastructure that will not help to prevent fraud nor solve any regulatory problem, but will cost a lot for advertisers. Also it is necessary to mention that the fraud problem already has solutions and they work good, so there is nothing to do with blockchain here, we think it is unnecessary synthetic use of blockchain. (4) AB-CHAIN focuses on business development and we plan to spread our solution to b2b market (existing ad networks), allowing other players to earn, thus helping them to start accepting ""magic"" cryptocurrency. (5) Finally we are building profitable coin that will guarantee that paying for advertising services in advance, an advertiser will be able to get more than actually paid - due to coin price growth. Especially for this we build mechanism that will press the price of the ABC coin.  And one more, but this could be not the last. We have not raised millions of USD yet but have already started the first version of our product.",False

Thanks a lot for reaching out and pointing at BAT. This is a marvelous concept we liked from the first glance!  AB-CHAIN on the other hand is different from BAT as far at AB-CHAIN is serving mostly ICO companies.  (1) First of all we are focused on business and customers, so we do the product for advertisers first of all (because they are the paying customers), then for publishers and ad networks (helping them to adopt new technology). (2) AB-CHAIN is solving different problem than BAT. BAT are addressing ""Fraud and Malvertising"", ""Privacy concerns"" and tiredness of customers of annoying ads. We solve the problem of accessing big volume of ad space being natively paid in cryptocurrency. (3) AB-CHAIN focuses on business development and we plan to spread our solution to b2b market (existing ad networks), allowing other players to earn, thus helping them to start accepting ""magic"" cryptocurrency. (4) Finally we are building profitable coin that will guarantee that paying for advertising services in advance, an advertiser will be able to get more than actually paid - due to coin price growth. Especially for this we build mechanism that will press the price of the ABC coin. Our goal is to give them access to huge market of traditional advertising that is now already holding attention of existing customers today. Also AB-CHAIN",False

Good questions indeed!  Quote Will the business mainly be an advertising agency that accepts crytocurrency compared to the traditional agency?  This is a very felicitous remark, that this business in fact is both - platform and agency. Why platform: 1) after some customer development we know that traditional publishers do not understand cryptocurrency AT ALL - nor technology or mechanics, neither advantages; for the publisher it's just one more e-money like webmoney or paypal; 2) to fetch publisher's needs we have to provide full service - but first of all payment so that it will significantly lower the barrier that will allow one to start accepting cryptocurrency; 3) AND - that is even more important - the ability flawlessly to convert to fiat (yes, most - maybe 70 to 90% will convert to fiat right after receiving the crypto- earnings).  On the other hand correct tactics to go into agency's customer development is a bad strategy. Our vision is that ""agency role"" will be kept until we finish customer development with the first 10 to 20 clients-publishers. After that this will be given up to our ad networks partners as a b2b service to which we will provide payment service.  Quote What is the inventory size and uniques that you have access to?  We have some experience working with traffic of huge corporations (at the moment I own https://bonus.qiwi.com service and also work with other traffic of this company). And some connections besides QIWI that we will definitely use. But I think that our main goal is different - to build the product and value proposition that will drive to us more publishers to make much wider spread.  Quote What will be the advantage for companies to go through your channel rather than to convert cryto to fiat and then go through standard marketing channel?  1) Ease of use Why would you need to make additional step (conversion) if the same publisher will accept both cryptocurrency and fiat? 2) Cheaper price in cryptocurrency: + no conversion commission; + no slip in conversion (especially a problem if you convert $1m+); 3) Even cheaper price using ABC coin - 10% more advertising for the same money paid (we give up half of our commission); 4) If you decide to use ABC coin then you can buy it in advance and then get more advertising due to coin's price growth (reduction of money supply by burning the coin - we burn half our our commission received if paid in ABC); 5) Later on we will provide automatic conversion to those publishers that still do not accept cryptocurrency. In fact this is again the ease of use because in economic aspect this will not give additional cost effectiveness, but just one step less to do. I believe that easy and good products win the market just like iPhone.",False

We've been waiting for that question. Definitely we have a good team and experience, and it is exactly relevant to the project, yes, and brilliant advisors, we think that we could be one of the best teams at the market for such a solution.  The product: (1) First of all we are focused on business and customers, so we do the product for advertisers first of all (because they are the paying customers), then for publishers and ad networks (helping them to adopt new technology). (2) AB-CHAIN is solving different problem than AdEx. AdEx are addressing ""Lack of consumer consent"" and ""Privacy concerns and data misuse"". We solve the problem of accessing big volume of ad space being natively paid in cryptocurrency. (3) Technologically AB-CHAIN will not write ad stats to blockchain to prevent ""Ad fraud"" and avoid ""Central regulation"". We think that this is an unnecessary load on infrastructure that will not help to prevent fraud nor solve any regulatory problem, but will cost a lot for advertisers. (4) AB-CHAIN focuses on business development and we plan to spread our solution to b2b market (existing ad networks), allowing other players to earn, thus helping them to start accepting ""magic"" cryptocurrency. (5) Finally we are building profitable coin that will guarantee that paying for advertising services in advance, an advertiser will be able to get more than actually paid - due to coin price growth. Especially for this we build mechanism that will press the price of the ABC coin.",False

But it so incredible that two coins based on advertising, one of them is called ATMchain, and the other AB-chain.  ATMChain is a Chinese coin, not many people have heard about it, but it raised $135 million in its ICO last August. Though with the new Chinese regulations, they have to refund the Chinese participants.  I do know that it raised $12 million in eth in the United States.  So much money, yet nobody has ever heard of it.",False

If these are the questions to AB-CHAIN, then let me answer. I am sure that we are not unique and also I think that there will be more projects like AB-CHAIN.  First of all there are ad networks that accept cryptocurrency like cointraffic. Second, I know at least one more ICO in ad market - AdEx; and now even one more - ATMChain.  But still we think that we are unique. And here are the reasons: 1) I (Vlad, the CEO and Founder of AB-CHAIN) have build from scratch 2 successful projects in this market, one of them has been sold, another is alive and kicking 2) we have an outstanding team and expertise - and brilliant advisors 3) we have precise vision what is the real market: who is the customer, what needs to be done and what should be avoided 4) we are creating profitable coin for our investors and then our advertisers and publishers.  You can also see before in this thread how we see the difference between us and AdEx.",False
