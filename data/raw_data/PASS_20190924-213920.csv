Blockpass is set to be the first fully-compliant self-sovereign identity application on the market giving users control over their data.   Current online identity solutions use centralised third-party databases to store sensitive user data, these solutions are inaccurate, vulnerable and frequently compromised. Users also have to repeatedly submit KYC data when on-boarding to new services, creating significant delays and increasing administrative costs for merchants. With the Web 3.0 fast approaching, blockchain services will need to be compliant. The first level of compliance is identity verification or know-your-customer (KYC).   Blockpass is designed to meet KYC, AML and GDPR compliance, making it possible to verify users without risking personal information. Identities generated and verified with Blockpass are data secure. Blockpass does not retain any user data, nor is the user data stored on any blockchain. The Blockpass KYC process eliminates having to repeatedly submit KYC data when on-boarding to new services A Blockpass online identity belongs to and is controlled entirely by the user, not a third party ●   Users choose what credentials they want to have verified and signed ●   Users choose where the data is stored (device or cloud) ●   Users manage their information from a secure place easily accessible by only them ●   Users are free to authenticate themselves with regulated services, Dapps, and autonomous Web 3.0 devices seamlessly and immediately   Increasing regulation across the banking, finance, and crypto industries is driving new and innovative requirements such as digital identity solutions. Blockpass is positioned at the intersection of regulatory technology (regtech) and blockchain markets.    As blockchain investment and development has proliferated, the ICO market has greatly increased to $6 billion USD (4.8 billion euros) in 2017. To spearhead the development of digital identity across blockchain technology, the first stepping stone for Blockpass will be providing KYC solutions in the ICO and token securities markets.    Fintech market insider Medici estimates that the regtech industry will reach $118.7 billion USD (96 billion euros) by 2020, and KYC is at the centre of this growth.",False

The sale of PASS has already started! https://www.blockpass.org/token      We have built a user-centric, self-sovereign identity solution for regulated industries and the Internet of Everything. Our KYC product is already available for iPhone and Android phones.  We are starting the initial distribution of the Blockpass token (PASS) from 31st May to 30th November via Official Distributors. The purpose of the token is to expand the network of users of Blockpass. When a user receives the token they will need to download the product and conduct KYC with the Blockpass Foundation before they are able to transfer the token on; we refer to this as ‘Sender KYC’). The utility of the token is to obtain discount on verification services provided by Blockpass as well as “identity mining” which rewards users and enterprises providing services for identity verification. We have just released the Blockpass v1.1 to Google Play and the App Store.  Project name: Blockpass  Token name: PASS  Token Distribution Event: The token distribution event will take place from 31st May to 30th November 2018.

Blockpass is nearly considered as the most promising ICO actually running with an active app for IOS and Android, and a clear vision over the roadmap milestones; it's also described as the first KYC token but i want to remind team and community as well about IcoPass ICO which also developped an app for KYC verifications to be used for ICOs, the app is also available in different platforms but the ICO failed to reach the softcap. Am not trying to make a direct comparaison here because every app has its own features but they are both built for the same purposes so may be wise to discuss IcoPass failure reasons and conditions.

Glad you enjoyed the event zolotokrylin.   coupable - a good point. I think the 'first KYC token' aspect refers to the fact that Blockpass' PASS token is a utility token rather than a cryptocurrency designed to raise money, which ICOPass' seems to be.",False

IcoPass was also a utility token but didn't succeed to choose the best promotion strategies as few managers from the team are active for community comments and their bounty program has been stopped before the start of the tokensale (think advisors are testing new strategies).  I was intended to read more opinions about this from your community here but as i see BlockPass, even a well-managed project/ICO is not getting a lot of attention, and this is may be considered as another commun point with IcoPass.",False

Is the utility described in one of its blog posts?  If you'd like to join the Blockpass Telegram channel (https://t.me/blockpass) you can see a lot more of what we're doing.  Blockpass has put a lot of effort over the past 6 months into going to events and talking to businesses and as such has generated a huge amount of interest from many different companies in Blockpass' solution. We have launched with a few select partners and are in the process of signing MoUs etc with many others. Over the next few months many more should be announced.
