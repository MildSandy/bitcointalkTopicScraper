We had over dozens and dozens of people download our mobile wallets immediately following the MotaCup, which was only possible through having paper wallets, mobile wallets and the ability to seamlessly transfer coins to and from paper wallets using QR code scanners. Our superior tech has turbo charged our push for adoption. We were caught off guard by TradeSatoshi suspending United States trading, which unfortunately happened right after the MotaCup, so we're adding another exchange very soon, perhaps this week, which will allow all the new users from the MotaCup to enter the market. Something we are very excited about is the number of people who are learning crypto through MotaCoin, by far the majority of our new users are using MotaCoin as their very first cryptocurrency, which is spot on target for us. Having seasoned cryptocurrency users adopt MotaCoin is nice, but our goal is push adoption, so this means we're definitely on track with our vision.",False

Now obviously, there are vast differences between MotaCoin and Bitcoin in terms of staking, mining, coin supply, etc, but in terms of the legal status, owning and using MotaCoin doesn't involve cannabis. You can spend Bitcoin at dispensaries, but that doesn't (and shouldn't) make bitcoin illegal.  Cannabis is fully legal (recreational) in a number of states, including California, which is where we are based.

MotaCoin is definitely used in the cannabis market, but each MotaCoin is not the equivalent of a specified, static amount of cannabis. For example, CannabisCoin (CANN) is backed by 1 gram of cannabis per coin. Maryjanecoin is supposed to be backed by 1 gram of hash per coin. So in those cases, each coin is an amount of cannabis regardless of the price. MotaCoin does not do that. MotaCoin is used to purchase cannabis, but the amount purchased depends on the prices of that dispensary. If you took 5 CANN to a dispensary, they are supposed to give you 5 grams of the CannabisCoin strain. CANN and MARYJ are pegged to 1 gram of cannabis and hash respectively. MOTA is accepted at several retailers, not just dispensaries, so you can use it on cannabis, or you can even buy a drone with it on http://market.mobilepaycoin.com",False

Sidenote: the iOS wallet is actually fully developed and no longer in beta, but due to apples policy against cannabis related apps, they're blocking the full release. Thus, we are distributing through the testflight program, in which you will receive a link in your email that will take you to our iOS wallet (which still will be downloaded through their app store).   Quote from: cryptodrunk on September 06, 2018, 01:07:53 AM Hello! How is the recruitment of dispensaries going? Do you have any business in the cannabis sector that accepts your currency? Greetings.  Hello, it's going very well!  As you may or may not know, MotaCoin was launched March 18th, 2018. When we launched, we solely had a linux wallet, and a vision of whats to come.  In the period of time since then, we: -Released 32bit & 64bit  Windows wallets late into March, 2018 -Released Mac Wallet alongside the Windows wallets -Released our Block Explorer early April -Got listed on our first exchange, TradeSatoshi on May 8th, 2018 -Opened up Beta for our Android wallet on June 6th, 2018 -Were added to BlockFolio on June 24th, 2018 -Had a flurry of articles written about us at the end of June     ~https://www.stayi.net/coins  (Altcoin of the Month)     ~Feature on CryptoAcceptedHere.org (Very valuable connection made) -First Business to accept MOTA as payment on June 26th 2018     ~https://HeadyTreasures.com     ~https://HeadyTreasures.com/MotaCoin -Got listed on our second exchange MapleChange.com on June 26th -First Dispensary to accept MOTA as payment. They did not have a brick & mortar location then, they did farmer market meets in LA. They are transitioning to a brick and mortar location currently!     ~ @Asmedicinals on Instagram -Announced our first Partnership with Growers International (GRWI) on June 28th     ~ https://grwi.io/partnerships/51778-growers-international-grwi-motacoin-mota-partnership/ -Got listed on our 3rd exchange Kyobit (A smaller, humble exchange, but still an exchange!) on June 29th     ~ https://kyobit.com/market/BTC-MOTA -Second Business to accept MOTA as payment on July 25th, 2018 -Released our iOS Wallet on August 6th, 2018 -Released our Paper Wallet Generator on August 19th, 2018 -Released an update to our mobile wallets that allow for importing paper wallets, as well as send/receive by QR Code Scanning -Were added to Delta on August 20th, 2018  Which brings us to the original question, how is the dispensary recruitment? Adding dispensaries without mobile wallets, was virtually not possible. If I can't demonstrate the wallet on an Android & iOS phone, no one would take us seriously. We did manage to get one dispensary in before the iOS release though.  We now have the platform to support some serious scaling and expansion. While we don't have an announcement to make regarding another dispensary being added, we just recently have been fully equipped to dazzle and awe with our cool features and elegant design.  So, I imagine things will continue to unfold in pace with our prior 4 months.  We take pride in our pace of development, and deliver fully what others have only promised.  Also, big announcement coming soon.  ICO?    Quote from: thorRJ on September 06, 2018, 02:56:48 AM And the countries in which marijuana is not regularized, how does the project intend to sell tokens and develop the project in these countries? Or does the project only aim to be more of a currency crypto?  In areas which cannabis is illegal, we forego operations and do not direct resources toward expanding there. That's not to say it won't organically spread, but we have enough locations where it's fully legal to focus on instead. MotaCoin is not limited to cannabis related products, indeed it's being accepted on https://ClockworkCrypto.com for crypto merchandise. We will undoubtedly be used for much much more than a settlement currency for cannabis products. One example, a good one, being our 12% stake rate. MotaCoin is an excellent vehicle to hold value because its head and shoulder above all the other competing coins which according to my direct knowledge, offer no more than 5% stake rate. Not to mention, MotaCoin's software is far superior all the other coins we're competing with. See for yourself, compare any of our wallets with any competitors, and decide for yourself.",False

The HELP token team continues to work on the project, and, as planned, begins to present the tools. The first product begins the formation of the project's ecosystem, which will be strengthened by subsequent products. The HELP token project has rather ambitious plans for the future, the team is working, everything is going according to plan, and in accordance with the roadmap. Today we present ICO tracker for beginner projects and startups - HELPONOMICA (http://helponomica.net/). Of course, the starter product must have very good initial conditions. Therefore, at the stage of formation - listing of projects on the tracker will be free, according to the terms of advertising - we will write a little later, all information will be available on request. Since we receive a lot of questions about plans, we can tell you about the next product that we are working on at the moment - this is a multi-crypto currency online wallet with advanced features and serious protection against attacks and theft of funds. Which again will be one of the ""bricks"" of the ecosystem. In addition, there are other positive news on cooperation with the funds, on listings and negotiations. We do not want to run ahead, so as not to misinform you, even hypothetically. Sincerely your, team of HELP token  Not interested in the shill, thanks.",False

Everyone that's finding out is interested in it. Especially our instagram, its blowing up and getting tons of DM's.   Quote from: Mi chael on April 18, 2018, 07:44:13 PM Read the whitepaper, awesome project. I like that you guys already have a working project. Much anticipated!  Thank you!   I'm going to be attending a crypto investment summit in LA on April30th - May 2nd.  More information here:  www.cryptoinvestsummit.io  I'll be representing Motacoin, we'll see what happens.  We are still open to new talent, if you think you have something to offer, DM me.   Problems Staking?  Consider this scenario:  Someone is mining with a pool and getting a 1 Motacoin payout every 30 minutes, they do this for 50 hours straight. The wallet balance will read 100 coins, but its split up into 100 1 coin blocks. Each of these 1 coin blocks is independently competing for the next pos block, and will be accumulating stakeweight in the same manner. Blocks can be combined to increase the likelyhood of getting rewarded the next pos block. Blocks may be tailored through the Coin Control settings on the wallet. You may combine coins into blocks by processing them together in a transaction. To increase your chances of staking a block, combined all the inputs of your coins into a single block and then let that one loose and it will likely solve your problem. Keep in mind that the total number of coins be staked at any given time determines how much stake weight is likely to be required to consistently stake blocks. It can be confusing, but it's worth knowing.  Edit:  ""Well why wouldn't everyone just put all their coins in one block always?""  For two good reasons,  1. Disrupting a block by spending from it will trigger a cooldown preventing you from staking OR SPENDING the coins again for the next 5 blocks. 2. Simply put, when you split your blocks into smaller amounts they compound more quickly.",False

We're going to be re-designing our wallets pretty soon, so be prepared for some awesome new UI's   Quote from: NateDogg187 on March 21, 2018, 01:16:20 AM so the block rewards will increase after the ICO on 3/23 right?, not on 4/10 after launch? The block rewards increase after block 10,000 is reached.  Quote from: NateDogg187 on March 21, 2018, 03:15:36 AM yeah I read another post that said ""The mining reward is going to be very small until the end of the ICO. The reward until the ICO ends is going to be 0.42 MotaCoin per block.""   then I saw it changes reward at block 10k in PoW table. so I guess ico will be over around the time we hit block 10k. You are correct, they're going to coincide around the same time.  Quote from: bones261 on March 21, 2018, 03:22:42 AM I think the Dev is expecting to wrap up to ICO about April the 10th. However, the price he is going to be asking per coin is rather inexpensive. I think the ICO has a good chance of selling out way before then. Could be wrong. That was the original plan, however due to increased interest in the project, we're moving the ICO up a little bit. This will allow us to release the android wallet before the ICO ends.  Quote from: ghosong on March 21, 2018, 03:47:23 AM I think this is a good project I will participate in this ICO until ICO is over. I'm glad to hear that! Thank you for your support!

Check out our newly designed Website!  BTC~~https://www.MotaCoin.net~~BTC  What makes MotaCoin different?  MotaCoin has adopted the approach of the Ripple and Stellar, when it comes to recruiting new businesses to their platform. Ripple and Stellar both had pre-mined an amount of coins that is being given to relevant businesses in their target industries. For Ripple and Stellar, that means banks.  We liked that idea so much, we decided to apply that novel approach to MotaCoin!  We've set ourselves apart from our competitors, due to the fact that there will be a 10 million coin premine with the sole purpose of industry adoption. No other marijuana coin has any amount of coins with the expressed intent of giving them away to the target industry: Marijuana Dispensaries. If you have been watching the marijuana altcoin market for years, as I have, you undoubtedly noticed that the entire sector seemingly froze. Very little progress toward mainstream adoption. You rarely, if ever, hear about dispensaries accepting these coins as payment. And in my opinion, the reason for that is this: Dispensary owners are going to want a stake in it. If they are going to train their staff on how to use crypto, in terms of point-of-sale commerce, then they are definitely going to want to make sure they have enough of that coin to make the trouble worthwhile. I haven't seen any other marijuana coin that sets aside pre-mined coins with the sole purpose of giving away to dispensaries in order to give them incentive to join the network. MotaCoin is the only one in our sector doing this.  How is that going to work exactly? Each dispensary will be offered tiered packages The terms of each package will be put together in a contract. The terms are listed below.  Tier 1 Package: 100,000 MotaCoin Acceptance of MotaCoin as payment Place our MotaCoin banner on business's homepage Allow a MotaCoin poster to be hung within view of the main area of business Allow a brochure box to placed next to their Point of Sale terminal Must agree to give 5% of their principal coin holdings to their customers (in the form of give away's and promotion's) Note: Each time a dispensary signs on, there will be a public announcement.     Tier 2 Package: 75,000 MotaCoin Acceptance of MotaCoin as payment Place our MotaCoin banner on business's homepage Allow a brochure box to placed next to their Point of Sale terminal Must agree to give 5% of their principal coin holdings to their customers   Tier 3 Package: 50,000 MotaCoin Acceptance of MotaCoin as payment Place our MotaCoin banner on business's homepage Must agree to give 5% of their principal coin holdings to their customers   Tier 4 Package: 25,000 MotaCoin Acceptance of MotaCoin as payment   Discord Instagram Twitter Telegram Reddit Github    Algorithm: X-13  Proof of Stake: 8% - 12% (Variance depending on Coin Control settings, and stake weight management)  POW: 46,900,000 MotaCoins over ~10+ Years [/size]  Coin Supply: 100 million + PoS Inflation  Launch Date: We are live as of March 18th 2018!   Windows Mac       We're launching this project from the belly of the beast. Los Angeles, California.    Launching from Los Angeles provides the MotaCoin project with a decisive advantage. That advantage is a blend of culture, diversity, and most of all...tons of marijuana dispensaries. To give you an idea of what we're looking at, take a peek through the lens of weedmaps.com:    This is just a small fraction of the playing field available for the MotaCoin team. With this magnitude of dispensaries available, there are countless opportunities to be grasped and limitless possibilities to be explored. Take the sheer numbers of weed retailers combine it with the cultural phenomena that is cryptocurrency, and it will deliver in creating an opportunity most people couldn't dream up.  Think about it, of all the industries that blockchain technology is affecting, which among them has a greater need for decentralized payment systems than the emerging recreational marijuana market. The Los Angeles marijuana market is being taken by storm given the recent legalization approved by US citizens. This legalization doesn't solve all of the marijuana markets problems though. The banking aspect of these businesses has typically not looked very bright. However, with the introduction of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, the entire payment infrastructure is being innovated. The need for decentralized payment systems with these marijuana retailers is becoming increasingly apparent as time moves forward.  We have a unique approach toward recruiting dispensaries to join the MotaCoin network. Unique in a sense that no other marijuana coins have tried, but not unique in the sense that it's been tried and tested by both Stellar and Ripple. Both of those coins premined amounts of coin with the sole purpose of giving it away to industry leaders and players. That's what we're doing. We're premining a large portion of coins to be given to dispensaries at no cost, as incentive for them to join the network and experiment with our new payment tech. Not only are we giving away coins to dispensaries, we also have a sizable portion of coin that is destined for air drops and give aways.  As an incentive for people to park value in MotaCoin, there is a max 12% annual inflation rate due to the POS(Proof of Stake) feature called ""staking"". This breaks down to 1% growth on your principal amount every month. In order to reap the full 1% each month, your wallet must be powered and online for the entire time period. The optimal 12% stake rate is intended to compete with wall street investments, which typically return 6-9%. With an annual 12% principal growth rate possible, it's definitely worth looking into.      Coin Distribution 46.9% 46,900,000  for Mining (Proof of Work) 10% 10,000,000  for Dispensary Recruitment Fund 11.5% 11,500,000  for Development Fund 30% 30,000,000 Initial Coin Offering @ $0.25 each 1.6% 1,600,000 Bounties / Give Away Plus a 12% Annual Staking/Interest Rate!

There have been several warnings in discord and on the mining pool Luckyaltcoin.com, that this was Beta and the coins are not going to be kept. We are launching for real, tomorrow, and the mining reward of 75 blocks per coin does not kick in until after the ICO. In the meantime, the coin will still be available to be mined and THIS TIME, you may keep whatever coins mined. The mining reward is going to be very small until the end of the ICO. The reward until the ICO ends is going to be 0.42 MotaCoin per block. This is 10x higher than the past two weeks in beta. So any coins lost via mining over the past week will easily be recooperated.   Quote from: vinayak2628 on March 18, 2018, 04:13:38 AM Do you have any bounty campaigns?
