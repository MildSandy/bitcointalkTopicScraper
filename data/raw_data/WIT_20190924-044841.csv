The way internet and online communication works made us understand that any bit of knowledge may be worth to be shared as the inspiration that drives to a great idea can be very tiny.

The success of this project together with the advent of virtual currencies such as Ethereum and Blockchain technologies represents a relaunch of wits and the possibility of creating a virtual currency managed through the NIR-VANA platform which allows users to create and register knowledge and share it making some profit of it.

No doubt we are entering in the era of the Knowledge Economy along with so many technological and societal excitement. ‚ÄòNo difference‚Äô from past eras of human history, where people lived the industrial revolution, or the Internet revolution, when knowledge made a difference as it is making now at the dawn in the Knowledge Economy as an extension of the Information Society in the Information Age led by innovation.   We think of knowledge as the currency that enables everybody to get the best of the new global economy. This new kind of currency enables anyone and everyone to participate or contribute with knowledge as an asset or capital.  There is growing awareness that a sort of Knowledge-Based Capital (KBC) is driving economic growth and is gaining prevalence in today‚Äôs global marketplace. KBC includes a broad range of intangible assets, such as research, data, software, and design skills, which express human ingenuity. Unlike labour, natural resources, and physical capital, KBC is the only factor of production that will not suffer from scarcity. The message remains clear: to promote long-term growth and the jobs of tomorrow, public and private bodies, or self-organizing communities, must ensure a policy framework that helps businesses invest in KBC, companies to adopt KBC-friendly policies, and individuals to become accustomed to making a living with their knowledge.   KBC requires multiparty collaboration to yield fruits. This is, involving other parties (AKA peers) when developing new products, services, and technologies. These peers are knowledge providers and also consumers.  Therefore, the Witcoin platform is a proposal of acknowledgement and reward of peers doing Knowledge Appraisal and Transfer. The reward is with Witcoins (WIT), a token based cryptocurrency backed by knowledge.   A Wit is by definition ‚Äústuff that makes sense (to someone else).‚Äù Knowledge is considered to make sense when it proves useful to the peer community, and acknowledged by citing and referring it. These acts of acknowledgement will be confirmed by the Witcoin platform, backed by Blockchain technology, and therefore the author(s) will be rewarded in WIT currency.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   HOW WITCOIN WORKS?  Wits are knowledge that makes sense. Knowledge definitely makes sense when someone else cites or reuses it. There is a potential risk on this, because once knowledge is disclosed, it can be copied an infinite number of times, and with such abundance, its value tends to zero. Witcoin solves the problem of converting knowledge into currency because there is an effort to absorb this knowledge. This effort becomes an indirect measure of knowledge, as the more knowledge there is, the more there is to absorb. Thus, Witcoin is related to the effort of digesting knowledge that makes sense to someone as a measure of the absorption of knowledge because it has made a difference to somebody. Therefore, the more some disclosed knowledge makes a difference to someone else, the greater its acknowledgment in WIT, which are created specifically to reward the usefulness of knowledge.    In this context, Witcoins are designed to promote and reward individuals for the validation of their ideas, creations, and activity with IP assets. Whenever a user cites someone else‚Äôs Wits, the owner(s) will be rewarded to recognize their contribution and their knowledge usefulness.   Witcoin will resolve the value of Wits by the following mechanism: Witcoin make possible to register Wits (knowledge) on the Blockchain. Then, it will be recognized that a wit WA created by X is useful to Y when the latter registers a new wit WB explicitly citing WA. WB might be: 1) a post in a collaboration space; 2) any content ideated or created thanks to the exposure of WA to Y; 3) a partnership agreement among different partners where WA is mentioned; or 4) a scientific publication where WA is cited.
