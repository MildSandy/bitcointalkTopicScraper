Price dropped during that time from $0.05 to $0.007 .Very low volume and no real progress at all.  I told Robin that 2 months passed and he failed during these 2 months to make a quick 5 minute announcement about taking the max gold cap away. As i thought just poor excuses saying the bet is still on and it needs the right timing to announce it.I guess the fact that the coin lost ofer the last 2 months over 86% of its value and is just a small fraction of the ico price is still not a good timing for him. LOL I contacted him 3 weeks ago already telling i'm waiting for the announcement.  So he sweared everyone 2 months ago to make that announcement and bet with me for 1 BTC and refuses to pay the 1 BTC claiming the bet is still on. He is never going to make that announcement.I know it for a fact and thats why the coin has no value at all. Of course his paid shillers instantly joined to attack me like good old quentin or anonoz . It's actually funny cause 2 months ago they claimed we will see soon new ATH LOL . Yeah so if you want my honest opinion this project has no future and is dead. After so long time there was no increase in app usage They have 10k active users/customers who just own $150k of gold.Thats just 3,5 kg of gold lol. They got a total of arround 10kg of gold stored in their vault.Not much at all. But the funny part is how they evaluated the value of the existing company hellogold. My counting on that is if there is $150k worth of goldx tokens and lets even say they make a killing 10% of it per year thats $15k revenue How much can such a company be worth ? Oh yeah i know it will explode soon.Competition is sleeping and people just waiting to flood them with their money for no real revanue based on their token model  I also didn't thought Robin has no backbone to stay to his word on the bet and refuses to pay after 2 months to an animal shelter but i guess all the mess they created makes him panic. The OKex voting was the biggest joke.He had no clue that you need to pay an extortion to the OKex token holders for their votes and claiming at the end he decided to not focus on exchanges but on development makes me laugh since i told him 2 months before he has no chance at OKex without spending a high amount of money which he is not willing to do and where he said he has everything under control.  So open your eyes and make a clear reasearch since in my opinion this coin will 99% fail and if it won't fail the earnings possibility are extremly low because of the max gold cap for hgt tokens.   Somebody asked where did i read about the max gold cap.Its officaly and you can read it on their website  https://www.hellogold.org/en/faqs.html  On ""What is the return on HGT""  Quote What is the return on HGT? There is no guaranteed return on HGT. The disbursement of reward GOLDX to HGT holders is discretionary by HGF. However, as the lifetime total allocation of GOLDX is capped at 3,800,000 GOLDX (i.e. 3.8 metric tonnes of gold) to the 1,000,000,000 HGT created, each HGT will receive a maximum of 0.0038 GOLDX (i.e. 0.0038 g of gold). Really ?  It also seems like they deleted this fact on many places to make it more difficult to see it as it effects their coin heavily but still deny to take the gold cap away",False

That of course is bullshit claiming that the $0.15 max gold cap is set so low to not being called a security LOL     Having said that, we've also structured the HGT Token Sale across 3 rounds unlike the vast majority of ICOs. This way potential supporters for Rounds 2 and 3 will be able to evaluate us accordingly based on performance instead of simply promises. Should we not distribute rewards to supporters at any time, the market will value us accordingly. What it also allows us to do is to provide more utility/potential rewards based on the feedback we receive from supporters prior to the next rounds of the Token Sale. The cap amount could be increased or possibly removed (should regulation allow for it - for which I'm personally expecting there to be much happening over the next couple of years) prior to further rounds of token sale.  Looks like it already happened and supporters valued your tokens real price based on perfomance and not promises. 2 more ICO rounds to come Also the claim max gold cap amount could be increased or removed in the next couple of years.Clearly showing they do not want to take the max cap away and Robin's claim back in may was a joke when reading that.I guess in may there was no more problem to take the max gold cap away according to Robin even there was no changes on crypto regulations. Yeah each time creating a new lie for not willing to remove the max gold cap leads to a total mess.       Almost all of crypto are high risk high reward plays as everybody in this space are essentially startups (with many not being past proof of concept stage). With the GOLDX, we introduce a low risk low reward token to provide a diversification option for the crypto investor. As HGT is linked to GOLDX and based on the performance of HelloGold, a company that has already been running with close to 13,000 KYC'd users, it was designed to be a medium risk medium reward option for those in crypto. It remains to be seen how the market will actually treat HGT. LOL medium risk because a company has 13000 KYC where 10.000 is activ and which all together have gold with a value of $150k LOL. Yeah that volume makes Hellogold really medium risk. Bunch of nonsense.  If you invested in that ICO i recommend sueing to at least get your initial investment back",False

I checked their whitepaper and businessplan and was shocked what i saw there.  Based on their whitepaper and website each HGT token is limited to a lifetime benefit of 0.0038g of gold !!!!!! which is based on current gold price arround $0.16 . So the max benefit you will get per hgt token is $0.16 .  So somebody may explain to me why should people by this token for anything near or higher than $0.16 . Check the ICO price and now have a look at the max benefit their hgt token can get on current gold price   Next important information. They said people will just receive 10% of revenue from just the management fee which is 2% of stored gold value per year. Transaction fee's and all other fee's including 90% of management fee goes directly to the company.   If you check their businessplan their final goal for 2024 is to have 40 billion USD worth of gold stored in their vault. Thats an extremly high number but lets even assume they will succeed what does it mean for hgt holders.   2% management fee from $40.000.000.000 gold value stored in vault is $800.000.000 management fee per year.HGT holders get from these $800.000.000 10% which is $80.000.000 revenue share. This money will be shared to one billion token which is $0.08 per hgt token.  So if they succeed and grow really that big you as hgt holder will get in 2024 (in 6 years) $0.08 benefit per hgt token.  There are some other concerned numbers but i got contacted by a journalist and i guess he will publish it shortly.  However anyone being familar with the gold business knows 2% fee per transaction and 2% management fee,redeem fee etc is extremly high in the gold business and even the fee's are so high they are so GREEDY (cause else you can't call it) that they will share only 10% of revenue from the management fee. Themself they keep whole ownership of the company and of nearly all profit/revenue for themself . They claim its because of the high cost but anyone can check himself how much it cost to store gold even as private person and that these companies are way smaller and still making good profit.  So anybody investing his money for a 10% revenue share of the management fee must be aware the benefits should this project even succeed will be very small  You are basicly financing this company with no real compensation at all.There is only one beneficiant which is the owner getting cheap money and taking no risk.   What makes me really mad is the clear attempt of the team to get cheap money and kick off investors with some poor bones.  If you check max benefit a HGT token is allowed to get and ICO price the difrrence is just arround 3 times from ICO price.  Is that really a fair deal ?  here from their website      You see these 0.0038g maximum limit they put for each HGT ?Limiting the max benefit to currently $0.16 . Do anybody really belive they made it by mistake seeing all the other low profit sharing attempts ? Sorry but i belive its done on purpose. The CEO knows exectly how to count so he knows also exectly about the limit he put for you guys   They didn't even talked about it till i exposed this fact where they later banned me claiming i was creating fud but noone just showed me i'm wrong by proofing his numbers cause my numbers are legit and say everything about that project so they started the personal way to attack someone and discredit",False

Having said that, I think the logic your pointing at isn't quite as true as one might think. We all know a quantity of tokens right now that are rising like mad, yet there is no actual business backing them, so I am not sure -given the rather irrational rationale behind crypto prices- that any project's value is correctly indicated by the price of the token..  Contrary to most of the current projects in the crypto space, HelloGold is already running a business with thousands of retail customers, and it's revenue stream isn't exclusively linked to the crypto world, which I believe is a good thing given the volatile nature of this environment right now.  But in any case you are right in pointing at the low traction that HGT currently has, this is actually the main concern our supporters are voicing on our Tekegram group (https://t.me/HelloGoldOfficial). It is something we are currently tackling, refocusing some of our resources to marketing in the crypto world (we've been busy focusing on retail customers for our core business so far) and working on some new feature for the HGT token...

In the 5 months since Round 1 of the Token Sale, the HelloGold team has grown extensively from 16 to 40 team members. An offsite was planned to ensure that the direction going forward both for 2018 and in the long term remained clear for everyone. It is a credit to the entire team that HelloGold’s cause of democratising financial inclusion and the team culture of openness and inclusivity continues even after the surge in team members.  On the marketing side, February 2018 was HelloGold’s best month so far with regards to gold sales. Overall customer AUM and activation rate improved as a result of a) targeted communications and b) lower gold prices. We’ve also seen a 50% increase in customer registrations from the previous month.  Moving forward there will be some fluctuation to customer acquisition. The customer experience has been overhauled so that customers get to experience the app before committing any personal data. As a result we expect lower registrations initially but higher activation rates in the medium term. Additionally the entire digital acquisition strategy is being reviewed for funnel optimisation and this will take a few weeks to bed in.  Meanwhile we’ve seen strong press coverage on GoldX being shariah-compliant and this has put some tail wind on HelloGold customer acquisition. There will be more announcements over the next few weeks and we expect the additional press coverage to benefit HelloGold.  https://medium.com/hellogold/hellogold-foundation-update-9-7th-march-2018-c487ee52019",False

Southeast Asian fintech firm HelloGold and Malaysia’s reverse-vending machine (RVM) company KLEAN are implementing a recycling scheme that offers Malaysians 0.00059 grams of investment-grade gold for each recycled plastic bottle and each aluminum can.  Anyone can start earning gold by first downloading the HelloGold app from the Google Play Store or Apple Store and registering for an account. Once registered, users can bring their plastic bottles and aluminum cans to any KLEAN RVM for recycling. After depositing the bottles or cans in the machine, users can choose to convert their KLEAN e-credits into gold through a seamless integration between the KLEAN digital wallet and the HelloGold mobile app. Users can also register for an account at any of the forty machines that will be available across Klang Valley in July, and 500 machines across Malaysia at key locations before the end of the year.  Robin Lee, CEO and Co-founder of HelloGold, said, “Emerging economies across Asia are dealing with increasing plastic use and consumption. Without adequate recycling infrastructure or habits in place, these plastics end up in landfills and oceans destroying the environment. HelloGold’s partnership with KLEAN will incentivise people to clean up the environment, while accessing new financial products such as gold.”  “In our mission to enable everyone access to safe and affordable gold products to protect their savings, HelloGold has been expanding our reach to millions of online and offline communities through key partnerships such as Axiata’s Boost and Aeon Credit. Our latest partnership with KLEAN reflects our shared values in using innovative technology to enable financial inclusion and wealth creation for the man on the street,” Robin concluded.  Increasing plastic waste has become a pressing environmental problem for countries across Asia. Six of the top ten countries most responsible for plastic waste entering the ocean are in Asia, leading with China and followed by Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. Only 14% of plastic packaging is collected for recycling globally, an estimated US$80-120 billion economic loss per year.  Nick Boden, CEO of KLEAN, said, “Plastic waste is increasing around the world, yet recycling rates remain low. Through this partnership, we aim to encourage greater recycling by showing Malaysians the potential wealth and money that lies around our communities, in our landfills and floats in our oceans.”  Nick continued, “After launching in Malaysia, we see great potential to expand our offering to other countries such as Singapore and South Africa. In countries such as South Africa, plastic scavenging is often the main source of income for families who must sell their plastic within an informal economy that is dominated by middle men with high fees. Enabling these families to directly access virtual currency or gold at KLEAN’s reverse vending machines will allow for a safer and more stable economic livelihood.”  The KLEAN Reverse Vending Machines collect aluminum cans and plastic bottles, sort and crush on site, while registering users and rewarding them with virtual points. These collected items are then smelted back into aluminum in the case of cans and recycled into PET pellets in the case of plastic bottles.  According to Reuters, imports of plastic waste have increased sharply in Southeast Asia following China’s decision to ban imports of plastic waste from the start of 2018. Malaysia’s plastic imports jumped from 288,000 tonnes in 2016 to 450,000 tonnes in 2017; in the same period, Vietnam’s imports rose 62%, Thailand’s 117%, and Indonesia’s 65%.",False

The partnership is looking to integrate the HelloGold offer with Boost, allowing Boost users to buy 99.99% pure gold starting from RM1 (US$0.24).  “HelloGold was created to make gold and other sophisticated financial products affordable and available to everyone. This agreement with Axiata Digital takes us dramatically closer to that vision,” said HelloGold chief executive officer Robin Lee (pix).  HelloGold provides an app-based platform that allows customers to buy, store and sell physical investment-grade gold. The physical gold is safely vaulted and can be delivered to the customer directly. It is also the world’s first Shariah compliant gold digital application.  Since its launch in April 2017, the app has had 20,000 downloads in Malaysia, won the IRBA’s Most Innovative product award and been selected for MOF’s TenXClub.  HelloGold is currently developing an application using blockchain for the mass market, where end users benefit from the application of the technology without needing in-depth knowledge of the underlying technology. In the long term, customers will be provided the option of converting their vaulted gold to a digital gold token (GBT).  This will enable customers to use the stored gold as value beyond the HelloGold System. Once the GBT are successfully traded on exchanges, the tokens will be available for purchase. According to HelloGold this will create a stable cryptocurrency fully backed by physical investment grade gold.  Meanwhile, Boost aims to revolutionise the way consumers transact in today’s increasingly digital and mobile world. Combining the lifestyle needs of consumers and cutting-edge digital technology, Boost makes cashless transactions easier, faster and more secure, and provides a rewarding experience for consumers right from their smartphones.  https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/startups/hellogold-boost-partnership-enables-more-users-purchase-gold",False

You can currently buy HGT on Ether Delta: https://etherdelta.com/#HGT-ETH and COSS: https://exchange.coss.io/pair/hgt-eth. we are working on listing HGT on other exchanges - if you could introduce us to some reputable ones that would be great!  Our invite link to Slack is: https://hellogold-foundation-slack.herokuapp.com/. Can you not register using that link?  The app is open only to those who are in the markets our business is in as we will need boots on the ground to do KYC registrations and customer service for the mass market user. We plan to be in Malaysia, Thailand, China, Indonesia, and the Philippines in 2019. For those not in these markets, they can convert crypto/fiat at exchanges worldwide (where exchanges will conduct the KYC) and use those to buy GBT from anywhere in the world, opening up access to anyone. Of course as a startup there may be changes to how we do things depending on how things go!  GBT has been designed in a way that the management fee gets deducted from your wallet automatically. So if you got 100 GBT at start of the year, you will have slightly more than 98 GBT (not 98 GBT exactly - long story - tl;dr is that there's a reverse compounding effect).

We've been against seeing scammy and paid writeups since the beginning. We've been listed on SmithandCrown, ICOage and CoinGecko.  As for GoldMint, Digix, Orocrypt and all other blockchain efforts that digitize and democratise gold, our answer is that the total value of “above ground” gold stock is approximately $7.5trillion, of which the largest gold fund in the world (SPDR GLD) accounts for only $30billion worth of gold (0.4% of the total). Our five year goal is to reach $6billion of gold AUM. As you can see from these numbers, the gold market is absolutely massive and there is room for literally tens of businesses to succeed. In this market, competition between all these businesses is a good thing as it keeps everyone focused on serving customers well.  Each has their own target audience, fee structure and unique structure of running their business.  Our primary target market is the Asian mass market, which is unique to us.",False

We’re aiming to help start the first wave of responsible crowdsales, with a live & revenue-generating product that has thousands of users signed up in the few months since our public launch in April 2017.    WHITEPAPER| CROWDSALE INFO | BUSINESS PLAN | TOKENSALE SITE | SLACK | MEDIUM | REDDIT | APP DOWNLOAD | HELLOGOLD WEBSITE  HelloGold - Introduction  During the Asian Financial Crisis in the late 90s, Robin Lee (CEO of HelloGold) saw first-hand how “bad things can happen to good people” as domestic currencies were hit by extreme devaluation. People who had worked hard woke up to find the value of their savings slashed overnight, with a devastating impact on how they could provide for their families. The challenges of saving and protecting wealth today are no less daunting. Even in ‘normal’ times, cash savers have their wealth eroded via inflation.    Those saving in gold are protected from fiat currency devaluation; those who hold gold over longer periods can make large profits, especially in local currencies declining against USD (in which gold is denominated globally). But only the wealthier and more sophisticated savers can buy gold in an affordable way, due to high mark-ups. The unfairness of the economics impacts those least able to fend for themselves.    So HelloGold wants to democratise an invaluable savings product for the person in the street by digitising physical gold to a transaction size that is affordable to them.  To do this, Hellogold has built an app that allows millions of underserved, low-medium income people from emerging countries to conveniently save in gold instead of their unstable domestic currency, by drastically reducing mark-up prices.  Core Product    Founded in 2015, we have received traditional funding thus far. And after our public launch in April 2017, we’ve already got over 2000 registered users in Malaysia, and have collaborated with Aeon Credit Services (which gives us the potential to reach over 100mil people across Asia). We now plan to expand into other ASEAN countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, plus China.  With the potential of reaching millions of customers, HelloGold is now working on integrating blockchain tech and Ethereum smart contracts into its backend, which will improve the product’s security and transparency while advancing the blockchain industry, with millions of (non-crypto) people using blockchain.  Current HelloGold System     HelloGold Incorporating Blockchain     Ultimately, Hellogold could be kickstarting the implementation of blockchain tech into hundreds of thousands of applications that are built for the everyday (non-crypto) people. In the future, this will provide mass market HG customers with a ‘soft’ entry into the crypto space by allowing them to convert gold held with HG into GBT at no cost.  As a supporter, what’s in it for me?  If you've not noticed by now, most of you guys don't fit the HelloGold core product’s target audience. That's because the app is not built for the crypto-niche. It's built for low to medium income people from emerging countries. This is one of the first crowdsales where you're investing in a project that you wouldn't personally plan to be a main user of.  Aside from its core goal, HelloGold will create a stable coin backed by the existing gold operations called GBT (Gold Backed Tokens). Each GBT is backed by 1 gram of 99.99% investment grade gold.  In order for HelloGold to expand into more markets and integrate blockchain tech, HelloGold Foundation (HGF) will raise funds via a crowdsale. Subject to a successful fundraise via crowdsale, it is envisaged that HGF will give HelloGold funds by way of grant(s) for HelloGold.  In turn, HelloGold will endow 10% of it's annual management fee revenue to the Foundation. This endowment will be converted into Gold Backed Tokens (GBT) in 1g increments.  1 GBT = 1g of 99.99% investment grade gold.  HGF will then decide on the distribution of GBT to HGT holders as a reward for supporting the crowdsale. Both HGT and GBT will be independently tradable on public exchanges. Once the system has been developed, GBT will also be available by opening a HelloGold account and converting gold balance to GBT or by purchasing GBT directly from HGF.    Crowdfunding Structure   We're launching a 3-round crowdsale (with the 2nd and 3rd rounds scheduled for 2018 and 2019) for a live and revenue generating product, aiming to raise a capped $8mil USD each round - just as traditional companies have multiple funding rounds with VCs. The first round is divided into 5 tranches, has a pre-sale to avoid whales in the public sale, and has a KYC process which allows us to limit the amount of tokens that can be bought by each person to $50k/wallet.  300,000,000 (three hundred million) HGT will be sold in each Round. – i.e. a total of 900,000,000 (nine hundred million) HGT will be sold in all Rounds. For the avoidance of doubt, the remaining 100,000,000 (one hundred million) HGT will be Supplier HGT used by HGF to defray any and all costs and expenses arising out of or in connection with the three (3) Rounds of Crowdsale.  Round 1 will comprise the sale of five (5) tranches of 60,000,000 (60m) HGT, at prices that will be confirmed prior to launch of the Crowdsale due to current ETH price fluctuations.  All crowdsale info will be in English and have translations in Chinese.

And what are the requirements for KYC? HGT will not be available for citizens, green card holders or tax residents of USA and Singapore due to securities regulation, and to implement good faith efforts to avoid money laundering, HGF will be implementing a KYC/AML process for crowdsale purchases of HGT. You will need to provide:  Name as per passport Date of Birth Photo of passport biodata page Selfie holding passport with biodata page open Document with residential address Your wallet Ethereum address  Apart from this, the KYC process will allow us to create a $50k/wallet cap to prevent whales from monopolizing the public sale.  Aren’t you guys just like Digix?  While Digix and HelloGold share some similarities, they’ve got some key differences.
