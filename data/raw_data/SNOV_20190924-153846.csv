As far as I am concerned this was very good.  We see a young and intelligent team that wants to work hard. They want to achieve something.  The price of SNOV has now dropped by 30% and I wonder why.  I accidentally discovered SNOV. I think it has become one of the most successful projects of 2017, and that it will also be one of the best projects of 2018.  Snov has a unique team that wants to achieve something. They also have a real product. There is no reason to doubt the course of SNOV as far as I am concerned.  I believe that this project is going to be really big and will soon be entering the top 100 on Coinmarket caps.  Be honest ... How many projects are there with a totally transparent team, a team that wants to work, a real product in a millions market and with knowledge of programming and marketing?  There is no rational cause for a fall in the SNOV rate. This will simply be one of the best projects of 2018.  I believe that, it feels good.",False

Is this option also available on a free plan?  There would be no forms with criteria. There would be a kind of a marketplace where you can create an order with a specific description (e.g. ""10 000 emails of mothers of boys in California"") and contributors would fill your offer with this data. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Quote from: SingIeTomorrow on November 14, 2017, 09:03:49 PM Hello dev, Gurus this in resources topic, however believe I should deal with it heHow many tokens does contributor have for 1 lead?

From my perspective, once a contributor earns tokens, they'll want to redeem it as soon as possible, so you'll have a constant flow of sellers. Plus, there's always going to be a limit on how much a business will pay for data, so that'll put a cap on the token price. At some point, the ROI from other data sources will be better than Snovio data even if the data isn't as good. Any idea what that cap might be using some of your market estimates?",False

The Snov token would grow with the growth of the number of contributors. They would be paid with tokens for their leads and also each data purchase is then rewarded with 70% of the revenue in SNOV tokens. So there would be a need to buy new tokens and it will cause the growing demand and a high demand implies a price increase.

If you're a daytrader it may not be as easy to say yes or no but on the longterm BTC is far more likely to grow beyond previously achieved highs. You can't expect these currencies to skyrocket without any sort of bear market, short or longterm. But looking on a longer scale let's say atleast 5 years It will be far more profitable to get in on the low now. Most people are scared however because they don't know how far the low can go. But if you buy at 3000$ now and it still dips to 2500$ or you wait and it suddenly rockets up to 3800$ you would still be off cheaper buying it @ 3000$.

Can you reveal what exchanges will you be listed on in October? Or it's kept in secret for now?  Quote from: kirkcoin on September 09, 2017, 12:01:32 AM Quote from: medik29 on September 07, 2017, 10:33:54 PM Quote from: MrBea on September 07, 2017, 09:11:44 PM Hi guys, will your tokens be available for trading on 3rd of October?  Snovio Token Sale starts on October 3rd.     Pre-sale has already been started - https://tokensale.snov.io/#whitelist, at the pre-sale stage we give 15-25% bonus depending on the sum. Presale goes very well (btw we can not disclose all results) and there are chances that the actual crowsale may have no enough room for all.    Do you have a stock exchange that you connect ? Many successful projects can not find the value because can not enter the big stock market. I do not want to this project one of them  We cannot tell it now, but soon our newsletter's subscribers will know it. You may subscribe here.  Quote from: chris_nor on September 08, 2017, 08:22:31 PM I've never actually heard of the term lead generation, but the business model sounds interesting and you say it's a 30 billion dollar market. I will follow this coin.  So basically the Snov company will rewards users from their own pocket, then buy more coins when the tokens are exhausted?  What will happenif the marktcap for the coin sky rockets? You will have to buy the tockens back at a much higher rate.  If there's a situation when we would have to buy our tokens for a high price, it would mean that our company is successful so it would not be a problem for us.",False

In marketing, lead generation is a strategy designed to find specific contact data of potential clients, known as leads. But often, it takes too long to find these same business contacts. That is why, the Snovio team developed a platform that will save your time and efforts to find new leads, and be useful for rewarding all the participants of the transaction.    Project Mission    SNOV.io is a decentralized lead generation and sourcing platform working based on the principles of blockchain technology and smart-contracts.   We use crowdsourcing data collection to grow our database of potential leads. This method of data collection puts us a step ahead of other lead generation services who depend on centralized models of data collection. Thanks to our smart reward system, we’ve further incentivized contributors to regularly renew old data and keep our database up-to-date. This system allows us to boost revenue from selling each lead and reward all process participants proportionally. Data on all transactions between contributors and customers are stored in a distributed register. All purchases and sales transactions are carried out through smart-contracts to ensure the transactions’ security.   We find the main principles of quality data provision to be as follows:   Source of Lead Information Transparency. Client can see the full history of the lead, including the lead source, the time when data was added to the system, the number of times the data was already sold, clients’ reviews about contributor and other details. Data Exclusivity and High-Quality Information. The system guarantees relevance of information. There is no chance that you’ll purchase leads with invalid email addresses and phone numbers. Data Updates This feature provides you with the opportunity to receive immediate notifications upon changes in data of any lead.   Operating Principle   >>Download OnePager<< >>White Paper<<     Benefits for Platform Clients   What SNOV token is?    We will release 2,5 billion SNOV tokens, and their number will forever remain the same. Tokens can be fractionalized to the eighth digit past the decimal point.  Tokens will be used to reward contributors in case the data was purchased. For this purpose, 10% of emitted tokens is reserved. When this reserve is exhausted, Snovio will buy the tokens back from exchanges.    Token Use and Distribution   SNOV tokens will be actively used for internal accounting between contributors and the platform.  We will release 1,5 billion tokens with the ticker symbol SNOV for the token sale at a base price of $0.01 USD. The token sale will be launched on the 31st of October and will last till the 30th of November    Token pre-sale through Whitelist program will run before the token sale: from September, 4 to October, 30, starting at 11:00 UTC. The minimum purchase is $5,000 (minimum purchase of $1 are allowed during the public ICO). The discount and bonus sizes will depend on the purchase amount and will be determined till September 4. To apply pleas fill in this form    Distribution of emitted tokens is as follows:      Application of Raised Funds    The funds raised through the ICO will be applied in the following ways over the course of the next two years:   $3m – Expanding and strengthening our team (development, marketing, sales department) in our Kiev office and opening two new offices (most likely in Dublin and New York). Hiring and retaining legal protection for all key markets. $2m – Enhancing system efficiency. This includes distributing servers in different places around the world to increase system stability and the system’s overall speed. $5m – Marketing and PR. This includes exhibitions at all key conferences, exhibitions, and events dedicated to lead generation, sales, and marketing. $2m – Attracting new contributors to the system. $2m – Promoting the idea of crowdsourcing data collection and decentralized lead generation across the world. $1m – Reserve fund for purchasing only the highest-quality lead generation databases from large data providers on special conditions. The idea of crowdsourcing data collection suits working with individual users, but we will require a different strategy of approach to work with larger players who own databases with exclusive contact data.
