Would you rather I stop ?  I just found out that anyone that has signed up recently to UCASH will not be able to transfer the UCASH in there account for up to 30 days. This is due to the amount of people abusing the sign up bonus. Creating multiple accounts and such. So if you are one of those people congrats on ruining it on everyone else.,False

As a consequence, markets become manipulated giving unfair benefits to these early individuals. Regular users are therefore left out when ICOs raise millions of dollars in digital currencies within minutes, and the future0 health of the network is adversely affected.  That is why the distribution of the UCASH is using an innovative new model the Initial Bounty Offering (IBO). Users can acquire tokens by completing bounties that help build the network. Bounties range from registering an account to translating the white paper to posting on social media. IBO's help grow the network and distribute tokens efficiently and fairly.

In this case you would keep your UCASH currency and gain prepaid access to U.CASH Services. Also as a Benefactor, you get to decide how your benefaction will be allocated.  A good analogy would be;  Lets say UCASH is a telecom company and we wanted to build a new cell phone network. In this case the UCASH currency would be prepaid access to our networks. Now lets say that when you purchased the prepaid access, as an added bonus, you got to decide where your benefaction can be used. In this case, lets say you cared most about a faster network you can choose to benefact network upgrades. Or... Lets say you prefer that you have access to a larger cell network, you can choose to benefact the buidling of more towers.  In this case you get to weigh in on the development of the ecosystem.  So in our case, if you believe that more users are important you can choose to benefact user sign ups, if you feel social media exposure is more effective you can choose social media bounties.
