Records aid in the medical management of patients while serving vital educational and epidemiological purposes. When recordkeeping is adequately performed, it improves the coordination and continuity of care, support program monitoring including reporting outcomes, budgets, supplies, reinforces decision-making capacities, augments staff accountability and achieves more accurate medical data statistics.  https://i.imgur.com/F7AQ8Xf.png  Why Trufield?  There are a variety of electronic and paper medical records systems that exist today, so why do we need Trufield? These are the reasons: » Data Security » Data Analysis » Cost » Accessibility » Data Ownership » Sharing Information » Data Organisation » Privacy and confidentiality » Communication » Teleconsultation  [Read in Detailed]  How Trufield works  Users will register to the decentralized application for their unique, electronic medical IDs. So anyone anywhere can have unique digital medical ID on which their medical records will be stored. This will serve as the template on which all other essential medical information can be added and accessed respectively. This will enable users to access their medical records from any mobile or web based platform wherever they are. With patient consent, health professionals will be able to access and add new medical information using just the patient’s electronic medical ID.  [Read in Detailed] https://i.imgur.com/SCCh2ko.png  What makes Trufield Unique?  » Trufield is free and will always be free for all users. » Trufield algorithms will analyse all medical data in real time. This will remove any disease reporting delays. All data will be analysed to identify disease outbreaks, allocate resources efficiently, anticipate future health problems, identify deviations from expected trends and for planning preventative measures. » Trufield decentralized application will be accessible even to users without internet access using Trufield’s unique USSD protocol. » Trufield decentralized application will be available on computers and mobile phones because these are easy to use, transport, available and are lower in cost than most other electronic systems. » Trufield will be a unique integration of a centralized and decentralized platform. The centralized platform will host the interactive features of the DAPP while the decentralized platform will host the medical information. This will ensure that only vital medical data is stored on the blockchain thereby reducing cost. » Trufield will achieve more accurate vital medical statistics for healthcare providers and patients. » Selective advertising will be permitted on the Trufield application to cover the cost of storing medical information on the Ethereum blockchain and other cost associated with the use of Trufield decentralized application. » With Trufield, patients will be able to share their medical files with other users and secondary trusted parties. » With users consent, selected medical data can be used to help with disease-control planning, plan immunisation and vaccination programmes, clinical surveys, aid population census, market research, and advertising, assist governmental agencies to plan essential health services, etc   https://i.imgur.com/PmmgYwi.png https://i.imgur.com/CLxk1am.png  Trufield Token Rewards  Users will be able to earn Trufield tokens by performing certain actions on Trufield platform or simply by buying them on an online digital assets exchange.Ways in which token rewards on the Trufield platform will be available:   https://i.imgur.com/pQ92b6y.png  » First one million user registration » Users providing consent to the use of their medical data. » Donating to partner charitable organisations through Trufield. » Health providers adding new patient medical information unto Trufield platform. » Referring new users to Trufield.  Trufield token Usability    » Advertising on the platform can be paid for using Trufield tokens. This should generate an increase in demand for Trufield tokens » Trufield tokens can be used for charitable donations to Partner Charity Organisations » With users consent, useful de-identifiable patient medical data can be purchased by vetted institutions and organisations at specified Trufield token amounts, thereby increasing demand for Trufield tokens » Statistical data collected on healthcare providers can be purchased by using specified Trufield tokens. » Trufield tokens can be used to gain entry to all Trufield events and conferences  Technical Details  The Token    Trufield tokens will be created over the Ethereum network, which is currently the standard way to create cryptocurrencies. Trufield token will follow the ERC20 standard, which is the standard expected by exchanges.  Data security    The Trufield project’s goal is to provide a high-level of service to everyone. Data security is paramount in the Trufield project. That is why the Trufield decentralized medical records application project will run over a HIPPA server. HIPPA is a set of rules from the US government required for handling and saving electronic medical records, with a big focus on privacy and security. Using a HIPPA certified server assures users that their medical data won’t be accessible to anyone without your permission. Using Trufield no matter where you live, your medical data will have the best level of security available.  Project technical description      Trufield will be a mobile and web based application that will allow healthcare providers to upload patients’ medical data electronically, patients will give permission for access to their medical information. The development will be Android first because the vast majority of the target market uses Android rather than IOS The App and USSD protocol will communicate with the HIPPA compliant server and the server with the blockchain.

The total Trufield tokens (TRUF) supply will be fixed at 100,000,000 TRUFs and no more tokens will be created thereafter. Trufield tokens will be priced at 1ETH = 1000 TRUFs. During the pre-sale, Trufield will make available 17,500,000 TRUFs for sale at 25% discount. All unsold tokens will be destroyed after the ICO once the soft cap is reached.     Pre-sale starts: 03/07/2018 ICO starts: 31/07/2018. ICO ends: 25/09/2018. Development starts: October 2018 MVP (Minimum viable product): February 2018 Testing of selected entities: March 2019 Release to the public: May 2019   Soft Cap and Hard Cap.    The soft cap and hard cap has been set at 1,200ETH and 100,000ETH respectively, why? The soft cap was set at 1,200ETH because that is the estimated funds required to develop a minimum viable product. This will cover programming, design, testing cost etc of the Trufield decentralized application. The hard cap of 100,000ETH will enable us not only to create the application but to deliver it to the targeted users. We understand the challenge of getting individual patients and healthcare organizations motivated to join the effort of storing medical data electronically. Therefore there will be a massive campaign to educate patients and healthcare providers about the need and use of Trufield electronic medical records system. The hard cap will cover the product, marketing and educational programmes cost.
