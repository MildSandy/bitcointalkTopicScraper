Celcius token is absolute shit, its never going to go up , it has no reason, no utility nothing, its a pure garbage. In contrast NEXO token, is just a turd... Both tokens are shitcoins, maybe nexo slightly less shitcoin, but still stinks as hell.  If you are talking about getting a loan.  1)NEXO - minimum 500 USD, maximum 2M, no waiting que, loan deliverd from 30 min upto 1 day, interest 8% .  While  1) Celcius - minimum loan 10k, you have to wait, interest is variable from 5% (30%LTV) to 12% (50% LTV).   Celcius has much worse token, but a cool community and great manangement, in contrast NEXO has banned half of the people, most of investors sincerelly hate nexo, nexo management  shits on the investors.  In terms of loans, NEXO provides easy loans, while Celcius has a waiting list, and very high minimal requirements.   Other things to consider - celcius pays interest on your crypto weekly, NEXO pays daily only on stable coins.  In. terms of toke. comparison - NEXO has very limited utility, and dividends are not guaranteed on the token as per terms and conditions. So as of know the only utility of nexo is reduction of interest rate from 16% to 8% (if you pay the interest with nexo tokens). In contrast Celcius, has more utility, yet its still bad  coin.   I wouldnt recomend buying Celcius or NEXO - both are bad.     I do cincerelly hate nexo. I do hate it. Cant sell tokens as NEXO doesnt allow loan repayment with NEXO tokens, otherwise would have sold my stack long time ago. They promise a lot and deliver nothing.  Also, tried Celcius, didnt get a loan, but send some coins to get weekly interest - seems nice. Well, have no negative feelings towards Celcius, like the company, but would never buy CEL tokens.  NEXO censors community, doesnt answer questions, does shady stuff. I would not recomend holding large sums with them. For example, they had 30% LTV on nexo token loans, then out of nowhere reduced it to 15% trapping everyone who took loans using nexo coin. And they dont allow loan repayment with nexo shitcoin. So if you put 90k USD worth of nexo, and took 30k USD loan, suddenly you need to add another 110k USD worth of NEXO just to be on 15% LTV.   God how much I hate NEXO.",False

According to Antoni Trenchev, cofounder of Nexo, “banks are if not hostile, then at least suspicious of cryptocurrencies.”   He explains: “Early on Bitcoin has been associated with the dark web and all sort of dodgy activities. But nowadays these illicit transactions are a single percentage of the overall transactions volume. The number one currency for criminals and money-launderers still is the USD and no one would fantom to remove fiat currencies. KYC and AML for crypto are harder and are expensive for the banks, hence a lot of the banking institutions shy away from it.”  This explains why banks have traditionally been reluctant to accept crypto as collateral. This has forced crypto holders to sell their cryptocurrencies for fiat before they can use it in any bank-related activities. But many who believe that the price of their investments will rise are reluctant to do so. Here is where crypto lending projects come in.  By accepting crypto as collateral, these projects allow people to hold on to their tokens while being able to make use of their wealth. According to Trenchev, “We have had people borrow for all sorts of purposes from buying a car and going on a vacation to purchasing a new home, which are pretty significant events in people’s lives.” The same people banks turned down.  Nexo, which is backed by TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, has introduced several initiatives over the past few months and recently became the first project to accept XRP as collateral. The company, which functions as a bridge between the crypto world and the financial world, has also offered the only protection on the market for stablecoins by guaranteeing a 1-to-1 conversion for any stablecoin that is registered on its platform.     Recently, Nexo ranked as the coin with the highest ROI since this October.  (Nexo hasnt even warmed up yet  )  It is unlikely this was the result of a pump and dump scheme as there was no peeks nor sharp drops.  But whether the steady increase continues remains to be seen.  For now, it shows that while cryptocurrencies have slumped, there are still huge opportunities when it comes to investing in cryptocurrencies.",False

This is a very unlikely scenario imo crypto has to die for Nexo to fail.  (different coins have a LTV loan to value ratio)   On the plus side, what if crypto do not go much lower but crypto goes up in value, Nexo will become a big hitter, top 10 coin very quickly.
