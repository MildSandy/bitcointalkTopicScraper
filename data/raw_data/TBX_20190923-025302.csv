The traditional economy changes its form, new values arise in the digital ""world"" and a significant role in these processes is played by decentralised technologies, in which cryptocurrencies and digital tokens play a critical role.  Increasingly, they are described as ""crypto or digital assets"".  Professionals of the crypto market (portfolio managers and traders) are also often not sufciently open to potential investors, as they are afraid of the influence of regulators and do not have a set of technical (software) solutions for the most efcient management of funds and interaction with their customers.  That's why we developed the Tokenbox Platform concept - a trust management ecosystem that unites investors on the one hand, and crypto-currency funds in the person of professional managers and traders on the other.        Terms Of Tokensale ___________________________________________________________________________     •  The ticker of Tokenbox's token is TBX  •  The price of a single TBX is 1 USD during all stages of TGE  •  Tokensale is consisted of two phases: Private Sale and Token Generation Event  •  The Private Sale is being arranged through advanced orders  •  Token Generation Event will commence on the 14th November, 2017  •  Token generation and delivery to its investors will be completed within 10 days of the TGE event  •  Token acquisition is set up via crypto currencies: BTC and ETH  •  Representatives of the The Token Fund and Zerion (Fund’s partner) control smart-contracts and address where cryptocurrency is collected via multi-signature  •  TBX will be further listed at the crypto exchanges and will have its market price        About TBX ___________________________________________________________________________   TBX tokens are utilised on the platform, thereby providing funds and traders with access to the Tokenbox operations as described below. This methodology for utilising a TBX token can best be attributed to several “rules”:    1. A fund or trader who wishes to operate their own fund on the platform and take advantage of all the facilities provided, acquires TBX tokens and deposits them on the platform.  2. Any fund using the platform is required to maintain 5% of all assets in its portfolio in TBX.  3. The value of all assets of the fund (including TBX) for compliance with this ratio is calculated in US dollars;  4. The value of assets in the fund's portfolio fluctuates over time as the value of market assets also fluctuates, according to the transaction volume of incoming and outgoing funds from other investors.  5. Funds can acquire TBX tokens on stock exchanges in order to meet the TBX 5% threshold.         ####################  Tokenbox.io  ####################        ########################################  We believe that today, an instrument that can ensure the efective management of private and institutional investors' assets on the market and can enable this wider market to enter this market, is a necessity.
