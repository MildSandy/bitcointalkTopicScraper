The other 90% this water sport is a daring challenge against the waves and a desperate struggle against their power. Surfing is an extreme sport that implies a serious level of physical load on the body. You can take on surfing at any age, but it is important to remember that it requires a certain fitness level to be able to engage in the sport. Before a surfer sets out to begin conquering waves he or she must adequately assess their fitness level and capablities. Surfing, just like any other extreme sport out there does punish for carelessness. Here’s a piece of advice. If you’re a beginner – don’t run off to buy a surfboard right away. Better rent one for a while – this is usually available on most beaches suitable for surfing. This will allow you to determine what kind of board is best suited for you.  https://d.radikal.ru/d31/1809/d6/38b38a9b818f.jpg",True

It’s because surfing is not just a sport that helps people stay in shape. Surfing is a way of overcoming one’s fears by facing them. Surfing is a way to feel like a conqueror of elements.  The main principle of surfing per se lies in utilizing the energy of a falling wave for gliding over the water surface. By shifting the weight on the board and repositioning his feet, the surfer can steer, accelerate and brake. The main objective of a surfer is to catch the wave. Tube waves hold the most interest to surfers – it is through that kind of wave that surfers are doing their best to ride through.  Waves can be split into two types: reef breaks and beach breaks. At reef breaks the waves break over a rock bottom. They are more predictable and thus more suitable for beginners. However, there are risks. First and foremost a surfer can injure himself as a result of falling down if it is low tide and hit an often sharp reef bottom. Besides, such places often harbor sea serpents. At breach breaks the waves break over a sand bottom and thus deemed safer than the rest. Low-sloping and smooth waves work great for learning the ropes, while sharp waves make for easy injuries and the risk of breaking the board.  Surfing is also split into two types – depending on the length of the board. A shortboard may begin at 180cm while longboards start from 3m. Shortboards are tricky to handle and suit professionals much better than anyone else while longboards ensure smooth gliding and suit beginners perfectly.  Surfing competitions are divided into these very categories. Depending on the surfer’s position on the board, surfing is further divided into two types – bodysurfing (standing upright) and bodyboarding (lying on the board).  https://a.radikal.ru/a29/1808/69/0476181924ef.jpg",True

So if you have made a decision to master surfing, first thing you should do is to choose a location. The ideal place for beginners is Bali, but there are other locations as well. Usually a good surfing school can be found in any country that has nice surfing waves.  Some physical training will come in handy too: a beginner should start training at least two months before the trip. You can improve your swimming skill in a pool, learn to balance on a special balance board. Yoga or pilates will help to improve flexibility and stretching and a jump rope will strengthen leg muscles.  Special surf clothes are not necessary - you can just as well ride waves in shorts or a swimsuit. Nevertheless, if you can get at least a rash vest - take it, because it will keep you from freezing or getting sunburnt. And do not forget sunscreen!  That’s it!

Surfing is very special subculture that rejects the materialism and instead chooses to cherish every moment on the waves. These are the moments when everything becomes insignificant and disappears.  So what is the surfing lifestyle? This means waking up in the morning to birds’ singing, listening to the wind for a minute, then having some fresh pineapple juice and heading out to rip the waves – to risk, enjoy the ocean and impress people around!  You may agree that not everyone can afford the pleasure to live every day of their lives like this (and not everyone wants this either), but to spend all of your free time surfing, or at least a part of your next vacation is certainly a worthwhile idea!

Costa Rica – here you can find surfing waves all across the country’s shoreline 10 months a year. 2. South Africa – best suited for vacation from June to August. 3.

Surfing is an important national sport of Portugal; it became more famous based on the increasing population around the world. Almost 60 millions of the people are participating and every year they are producing income between $ 70 and $ 130 billion which is related to the surfing-related industry. You can see that surfers are suffering from two major problems those are While doing surfing needs waves to travel to an equal height which travels in the same direction. you can see such kinds of waves in all the places on the Earth. However, such places it will not support all the weather conditions.  Based on the climatic conditions they are allowed to surf only once or twice per year. Therefore, when the weather is good and you can see the good waves then you can see the most of the people spends time in surfing. As a result, people will take 6 to 8 years to reach a professional level in surfing. When it comes to another problem, if anyone wants to start to surf then they need to invest a minimum of 750€ and budget for minimum speed need to spend around 270 € per month. It’s good news for all the surfers and sailors that Lipchain decided to create an APP that helps in posting their videos and photos, and results to even earn tokens. As per ratings, given by the community for the pictures or videos posted by the surfer they will receive every month up to 840 € via basic sponsoring program. Lipchain creates a decentralized social network for surfers and provides a chance to post, rate and discuss their surfing of videos or pictures. All these help to attract the sponsors who can share with athletes and producers.

The main issue that almost all sports face is funding and development of the sector as a whole. Surfing is a very popular sport that garners a lot of enthusiasts. It has also been affected by the same old issues and has a number of problems hindering its development and expansion. Among the issues are:  > lack of training grounds for surfing  > beaches polluted with plastic and other trash  > lack of funding for beginner athletes  > lack of ability to train year round  > high prices on equipment and training  > lack of locations for surfing  > restricted access to global championships  > lack of dedicated advertisement channels for advertisers and surfing equipment manufacturers  The LipChain project is ready to tackle all of the above and more, including the development and advancement of surfing as a sport!

However, the few places that are suitable for surfing still exist! This is why today we are telling you about the best places for surfing. All you need to go surfing is a surfboard and some good waves. In fact, it is possible to surf at a sea, but most places suitable for surfing are actually on tropical island ocean shores. The best locations for surfing are believed to be as follows:  1. Hawaii – the birthplace of surfing 2. Bali 3. Australia 4. Morocco 5. Atlantic Europe – Spain and Portugal  What’s interesting is that most of these regions view surfing as more than a form of entertainment, but a unique lifestyle. For example, in Australia, school physical education program includes learning to surf while in California surfing has been viewed as a form of protest against the daily routine living, as a symbol of freedom and “living in the moment”. https://d.radikal.ru/d41/1809/b8/ee5f9446b736.jpg",True

Surfing is the most important sport in Portugal. Every year its popularity is gaining ground more and more worldwide. Have you ever set foot on a surfboard? Don’t know much about the sport at all? It’s no wonder, there is a number of reasons that’s the case. Given that surfing is an interesting, entertaining and simply awesome sport, it’s not exactly accessible to many people. It’s not that it requires high level of physical fitness or special training (although some requirements do, naturally, apply). The deal is, first and foremost, is that surfing is not something you can do anywhere! No, it’s not illegal, mind you, but surfing does pose requirements to the location and the waves must reach a certain height and very few shores have these attributes.  If you already know what places allow surfing and when they are suitable for ripping some waves and you’re full of enthusiasm, ready to set sail to distant shores – hold your horses. First check if you have the budget! Yes, surf training costs a lot. Since you probably don’t boast the talent for surfing, you won’t be able to do without it.  This creates a true vicious circle where first you have to invest a hefty sum into the entire endeavour only to continue funding this new hobby to keep improving your skills. We have found a way out of this loop! We have created the LipChain platform that will allow you to publish your photos and videos and get rewards for that!

Conquering the waves on surfboards has become part of traditional rituals for Hawaiians that were initially available exclusively to the royal family members. The Hawaiians combined sports and art in a perfect balance just like the Greeks in the Olympics. The first surfing competitions were also run in Hawaii.

In many ways it was thanks to travellers and writers who made this amazing sport be known to the world through their literary works. One of the first to describe the unusual water sport of Hawaiians in a novel was James King who participated in James Cook last expedition. Mark Twain has also noted the unique activity when he visited the Hawaii in 1866. Then at one of the beaches he met a crowd of naked Hawaiians engaged in their national pastime – surfing the waves on a board. He later described the visit in his travelling notes. This water activity has also earned a mention by another well-known writer – Jack London who visited Hawaii in the early 20-th century. However, surfing spread across the globe properly somewhere in the 1950s and ever since it has been increasing in popularity, attracting more and more enthusiasts worldwide. It is interesting to note that nowadays surfing is not only a relevant and attractive sport, but has managed to spawn a number of other water activities, such as windsurfing, wakeboarding, SUP-surfing, kitesurfing and other. https://c.radikal.ru/c05/1808/b0/a21e62ee403d.jpg",True

However, did you know that to take on surfing it is not enough to simply grab a surfboard and head out to the nearest waterfront? In reality, today most of the sport’s enthusiasts have to deal with a lot of issues: Ø  Lack of financing that would allow a beginner to reach a professional level – today to get become a professional it would take over 8 years and 3000 euros! Ø  Lack of facilities for training. Ø  Lack of sufficient financing to participate in prestigious international championships. Ø  Lack of dedicated advertisement channels – today equipment manufacturers are forced to fight for attention of each individual member of their audience. Ø  Ecological issue – high level of water and beach pollution combined with lack of interest in that regard from the government. This may sound like overconfidence, but the solution for all of the above and other surfing-related issues is the LipChain application! LipChain is a decentralized platform that allows surfers to find sponsors, participate in unofficial competitions and train year round!

In 2017 Pedro das NEVES alongside with Manuel TAVARES (both part of LIPCHAIN team) started to define a line and a heading for a project. They considerably changed their strategy and developed a new plan as it was decided to use a maximum water line length to 10 meters, dropping this way the initial idea of beating an original time established in 2004  by Mário Sampaio  and João Cabeçadas on a 8 meters water line boat on an event named  “Troféu O Navegador” and instead create a new event time and with that a new format by increasing the water line up to 10 meters while challenging and reopen a new path for other sailors and encourage them to use boats even 1 meter longer than ours to beat the time we will establish.  The boat being used is a 8.93 meters water-line long Grand Surprise built by Archambault. As you all know Lipchain is a community and as a community we look after each other and in order to make this iconic route more accessible for everyone Lipchain will put our very own boat at others disposal in order to attempt and establish a new time.  There will be rules and pre requisites that Lipchain will announce at its given time.   Our boat that is almost a meter shorter than what our rule allows. In theory a 10 meters water line boat is faster as the longer the boat the faster you go. You may wonder why we would start it with such a disadvantage. But that is exactly what we want, the 10 meter water line rule is created not only to create a safe event but also to match the average boat size we find in Portugal, as we aim to make it accessible and possible for everyone to establishing and new time, in an attempt to get Portuguese sailing community involved in offshore sailing and inspire young sailors.  As mentioned before there is already a reference time that was established in 2004 with the event called “Troféu O Navegador” where Mário Sampaio and João Cabeçadas set the time of 88 hours from Lisbon to Madeira and 78 from Madeira to Lisbon. We will use this as a reference time only to give general public a reference time so they can follow and cheer for us. This meaning we are organizing an independent event from “Troféu O Navegador”.  The 10 meter water line rule is created to match the average boat size we find in Portugal, once again leaving this way an open path for the most adventurous sailors and inspire youngsters to attempt this iconic route between the old continent and the Madeira Island.  This time around, the passage will be held double handed to make it more challengeable but we leave it optional for future boats that would like attempting a new record letting them choose to go fully crewed or double handed for their attempt.  The record to be set is the main event that the LIPCHAIN sailing team will endure but as Lisbon and Setúbal offer a great variety of races, the boat will be entering local races at the two Cities, sailing then a fully crewed boat combining youth sailors that will be formed and trained under the supervision of Pedro, while using the boat as a sailing academy for youngsters that aim to be successful in the professional scenario.  To come back to the sailing record attempt, the departure is imminent and is depending from weather conditions. As per the last forecast, the team tried already to leave this past weekend the 4 of August at 12h00 local time, but weather forecast made it impossible as the wind was not favourable.  To keep you informed we use a 3 color code:  Code Red: The weather conditions are not suitable and we are waiting for a favourable weather window.  Code Orange: The weather conditions are promising and we are in an eminent departure.  Code Green: The record attempt is ongoing  https://d.radikal.ru/d36/1808/6d/a3e897eb2cb3.jpg",True

Skipper - Pedro das Neves Co-Skipper - João Cabeçadas Official time registration: Comando Naval - Planeamento e Operações Correntes (Portuguese Navy);   Note: Because of its similarity between this attempt and the «Troféu o Navegador», it is opportune to clarify some details: In 2004, the sailor and architect Mário Sampaio had the brilliant idea to create a trophy for the fastest time sailed between Lisbon and Madeira on a small and short crewed yacht. Specifically a waterline length under 8m and double-handed crewed, amongst some other details. Mário Sampaio named that trophy as « Troféu o Navegador ». Because the LIPCHAIN yacht is oversized to challenge this trophy, we have decided to just make a fast run along the same race course. Obviously our run will not qualify for the Troféu o Navegador, but we’d like to use it’s time of 88h as a reference, considering that since our yacht is larger than the one used by Mário Sampaio and his co-skipper João Cabeçadas, our fast run will only have a meaning for us if at least we  beat their time. This is why LIPCHAIN Record Attempt Lisbon-Madeira thanks the Troféu o Navegador and his creator Mário Sampaio to allow us to use their set time of 88h as a reference for us.  https://c.radikal.ru/c27/1808/f1/8b4c79a15eb6.jpg",True

Jack had got tired of swimming for his board every time he bailed, trying to catch it in the ocean waves and dodge other surfers at the same time. This is when he decided to make a special leash that would stop the board from drifting away.  🔸If you have seen Jack on pictures you may have noticed the black eyepatch he is wearing – it has become somewhat of a brand symbol for his brand. What’s more interesting is that he lost his eye to his own invention – the leash! Initially Jack used a material not quite suitable for the purpose – the improvised leash would not only prevent the board from drifting away, but make it spring back at the surfer. One of such times the board sprung back to take out his left eye. ________________________  🔹https://lipchain.io/. https://a.radikal.ru/a20/1808/63/6e90da2fa498.jpg",True

After the injury he could no longer work at the factory and settled for a job as a security guard on cargo trains. His job was to check the train for freerider kids.

This is why surfers are much more aware of the pollution level of the ocean since they are as driven to protect it as virtually nobody else. We believe that every surfer has a moral obligation to fight marine pollution since ripping the waves is a fun and sacred obsession.   Every surfer can begin fighting marine pollution from themselves. To do this they need to perform a few simple actions:  1. In a session a surfer catches a few waves. As a sign of gratitude to the sea they can grab a garbage item on the way back to land for every wave they have ripped. 2. Many countries have beach cleaning events. Surfers can participate in these events and even organize their own since the more people are involved in cleaning, the cleaner the coastline. 3. Another way of fighting water pollution is participating in environment activist groups. The more surfers are participating in these groups, the more people become aware of the ocean pollution issue.  The LIPCHAIN project team believes water pollution with plastic waste is a huge issue in desperate need of both a solution and attention. Since national governments are usually ignoring this issue, we have decided to participate in cleaning the ocean ourselves. For that we plan to send 5% of sponsor revenue to the Sea and beach cleaning foundation. To learn more about the LIPCHAIN project, please visit our official website at https://lipchain.io.",True

If past experience is any guide, enjoying the waves without arms and legs is possible, however, bad mental state can ruin the fun.  Every surfer has to face a whole plethora of psychological traps when faring into the ocean that can either hinder their progress or kill the interest in surfing entirely.  >Fear. It can both drive or hinder progress. It really depends on the individual – for some people the fear drives to overcome and face the challenge the waves present, for others it prevents them from leaving their comfort zone, hindering their progress. Expanding the comfort zone should be done gradually. It is always better to have a more experienced surfer by your side in that case.  > Aggression. Aggresion prevents a surfer from focusing and deal with the wave. The source of aggression can become external factors – broken waves, distracting crowds, etc. In this case it is vital to realize that changing the situation is impossible, and the only right path is to adapt and calm down.  > Frustration. It is easy to delude oneself into thinking that surfing is nice and easy after looking at pictures of surfers online. This impression breeds inflated expectations in beginner surfers who turn out to be unprepared for frequent bails and failures. There is only one recipe: education – informational articles, video lessons, instructors’ guidance.  > Stagnation. If at some point a surfer begins to think he has stopped growing and the ocean is no longer bringing him the joy it used to, he just needs to take a break. Soon he’ll be aching to get back to the sea.  Join LIPCHAIN – a global international surfer community. Learn more on our website: https://lipchain.io.",True

Today it has over 60 million enthusiasts fuelling the global surfing industry with 70-130 million dollars in revenue yearly  There is a number of issues hindering the progress of the industry, however, the most prominent of those are the following two: 1. Lack of suitable surfing zones and a short surfing season Surfing requires waves of a certain height and direction, the entire planet only has a few zones where that is reachable. Besides, the weather in these zones is ever-changing and is generally suitable for surfing twice a year. Even good weather in a place with good waves does not always suffice for surfing as these times usually see beaches packed with people. It is incredible, but all of the above makes reaching a professional level in surfing 2. High training cost To begin surfing one must have a starting budget of around 750 euro. Every consecutive month of training will tally up to 270 euro. Besides, later down the line more money will be required to purchase the equipment needed to increase one’s proficiency level.

We plan to create a social network in which sportsmen and enthusiasts of water sports can earn LIPS tokens for the content they create.  How will our network differ from similar projects?  1. Our project is aimed only at the community of surfers and seafarers  2. Income will not only receive athlete (who is in the video), but also the producer (who made the video or picture)  3. The sponsors of the video will be able to choose the individual athletes or locations that are interesting for the promotion of their business  How it works?  A sponsor can be a private individual, or any regional or national business in the region. The athlete will have to make a short video to the sponsor with the help of a sponsor or some promotion of his sponsor.  When the sponsor wants to order an advertisement, he directly selects either a specific athlete and / or a video producer or a location / zone and checks in the specified location which athlete / producer generates the most viewed or liked videos.  Based on the number of views, athletes / producers have a rating from 0 stars to 5 stars. This will depend on their income. Also, revenue will depend on the region in which the video is created.  The app will share 60% of the advertising fees between the surfer and the producer depending on who the sponsor chose to finance:  • if the surfer is chosen, they receive 40% and the producer 20%;  • if the producer is chosen, they receive 40% and the surfer 20%.  10% will be used to develop and manage the application.  The remaining 30% of the sponsorship budget will be transferred to a decentralized development fund. The allocation of which will be decided by the community.",True

The built-in surfer market exists, has very favorable demographic and economic attributes, and a propensity to regularly travel, even internationally, to surf high quality uncrowded waves. The potential is even greater given the exploding learn-to-surf market, the broad market appeal of surfing, the proven increased real estate values, quality surf breaks, and the implications of this has for onsite and adjacent retail, restaurants, timeshares, resorts, hotels, and residences.

You might think that surfing is easy - take the board and roll. But no. In fact, each wave has its own price (the real price in dollars) and to train a sportsman you need to have money.  So, how much does a wave cost?  Based on Wagner, Nelson, and Walker's (2011) work, surfers pay $ 25- $ 100 in travel costs for a 2.5 hour surf. Assuming 20 waves are ridden during this session (1 wave every 7.5 minutes over 2.5 hours) surfers are paying $ 1.25- $ 5 for each wave ridden every time they go surfing, often in crowded poor quality conditions.  And what about international Surf Tourism? Most surf resorts charge between $ 120 and $ 600 dollars a day to provide surfers with luxurious accommodations, chef prepared meals, and daily transfers to nearby high quality surf breaks. ln the swell season of a high quality surfing destination, a standard 10-day surfing vacation is considered successful, in lieu of crowding and natural surf condition variability, if surfers experience 1-2 days of very high quality conditions, 1-2 days of minimal or no surf, and 7 days of good surf. Under optimal conditions, the average surfer will catch approximately 15 waves per session (one wave every ten minutes over 2.5 hours) and surf two sessions per day for a total of 30 waves per day. Assuming an average additional cost of $ 1500, this translates to between $ 9 and $ 25 paid for each wave surfed.

As you may have seen in our documentation, LIPCHAIN is a unique project dedicated to a huge waves catchers community representing tremendous market.  In order to solve the main problems that face this community, we came to the idea to create a decentralized social network that will allow both surfers and producers (could be family surfer’s member), to earn tokens simply by publishing pictures and/or videos on the App. Which is of course not the case for other social networks.  To take profit of this huge market, we will also organize a sponsoring system that will allow both surfers and producers to publish advertising on the App and earn tokens without being pro-active to find external funding solution.  On the top of that, the main problem remains the dependence to the weather conditions and the overcrowded seas when waves are there.  In order to solve this situation, we will build LIPWAVE Pool Centers, that will offer year-around Olympic training conditions. LIPWAVE Pool Center will be able to let 100 athletes to surf each single hour by generating a wave every 6 to 8 seconds from a hour fees of 20€. It means that every LIPWAVE Pool Center will be able to generate perfect waves for more than 1.000 surfers per day. With such pool center, it is possible to develop athletes to a professional level 10 times faster.  The first LIPWAVE pool center will be built in Portugal, and the place for the second one will be decided by a transparent voting of the LIPCHAIN community. We will also work on ecological resort to be built around these center. They will be financed with external funds but will be integrated in the LIPCHAIN project by the use of LIPS token.  Finally, as you may know, surfers and sailors love nature and condition of seas and oceans is a sensitive matter for them and for us. To make them cleaner, firstly LIPCHAIN will develop partnerships with surfboard producers in order to develop more ecological surfboards. Secondly, a percentage of the App advertising revenues will be allocated to specific foundations related to cleaning of seas and beaches.  According all this, we are definitively convinced that LIPCHAIN has a wonderful future coming and the enthusiasm the existing member of LIPCHAIN community shown us so far is the best indicator of this success.  Come visit our site, watch our videos, contribute and get LIPS tokens and let’s enjoy the path all together.",True

The primary issue is lack of financing that would help newbies turn into real professional athletes as well as lack of surfing infrastructure for training. With that said, surfers have very limited access to world championships. Among other significant problems lack of proper advertisement channels that would allow sailing equipment manufacturers reach their target audience and last but not least, the large number of world beaches polluted with plastic waste.  We believe that leaving the situation as it is would be criminal. That’s why we have decided to develop a special app called LipChain that would allow:  - publish photos and videos and earn money surfing; - build closed wave pools for year-round training within a private eco-resort; - vote for a champion of the surfing community; - get access to the global community of surfers and sailors as well as useful tools for choosing athletes for sponsorship; - send 5% from sponsorship proceeds towards cleaning the sea and beaches.

According to Ponting and O'Brien, the latest study suggests that today there are 35 million surfers who practice their wave-riding activities in at least 162 countries. But just in 2002 the number of participants was only 10 million surfers worldwide back! Analysts promise an estimated of 60 million community members by 2018.  According to an estimate by O'Brien and Eddie (as cited in Ponting & O'Brien, 2014), the global surf-related industry is currently responsible for revenues ranging between $ 70 and $ 130 billion each year. As we can see, the market associated with surfing is very promising and it's the Lipchain project that comes to this market! Our project will unite the global surfer community! Liochain is a decentralized landscape providing surfers with sponsors, unofficial competitions and year-round training habitat. Worldwide surfers will be able to earn tokens by simply practicing their favorite sport, can become champions faster and contribute to the cleaner oceans in the process.  The Lipchain app is a unique development of our team that was created by surfers and sailors from all over the world.  Are you addicted to surfing and want to support our project?
