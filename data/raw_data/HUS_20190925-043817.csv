However the big problem with the status quo is, that the parties involved in the sex trade cannot easily verify each other without disclosing their identities. With our solution, both parties can easily and anonymously verify each other before providing of the service.

The utility token will not be used to mediate payments between clients and the service providers in our platform (this could be classified as a *procuring of sexual services* or *pimping*). It will only be used for mediating payments for advertisement and security deposits for additional trust.

We will operate our own listing platform only in selected countries. However, since the infrastructure is open, any existing or future listing platform can join. In this case, the regulatory and cultural compliance fully depends on the listing platform. We believe, that the sex is the most natural activity any humans can engage in. Moral biases and social stigma makes the work of many sex workers very difficult. Although this topic may be uncomfortable for some people to discuss about, only an open discussion about this topic may improve the status quo.",False
