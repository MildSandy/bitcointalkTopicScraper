The app works in parallel with the main BoatPilot application, receiving data on the planned route, waypoints, and other key information. The Epson headset application is responsible for visualizing and superimposing all the necessary navigational information on the surface. As such, after setting the necessary objectives on the navigator, skippers can concentrate completely on yacht control, without being distracted by the navigator screen and dash.

Most data suppliers (for example, OSM) are bloated and lack optimal storage structures. Our algorithm will find and eliminate such redundancy, which in turn will cut the size of the database to a fifth. A key feature of our algorithm is its parallelization. It allows you to use MapReduce algorithms on a computing cluster. The software algorithm is implemented via Python using ZeroMQ to distribute tasks throughout computing nodes. The common and open ESRI Shapefile is used as an output format, allowing the results to be used not only on mobile devices, but in the vast majority of GIS packages.

As for NAVI usage, first of all, NAVI is going to become a very perspective and valuable cryptocurrency as we will use well thought-out and very effective token growth cost mechanism within the project for this aim. At second, BoatPilot will have a loyalty program that will be made available to users who maintain NAVI tokens in their e-wallets. Users will be rewarded with bonuses and gifts for retaining NAVI tokens in their wallets for a specified period of time. For example, a 25-50% discount to rent a yacht from our preferred vendors. For high quantity token holders, BoatPilot will arrange an exclusive luxury yacht once per year for a period of one week (with capacity for 5-6 people). And finally, you can get bonus up to 100%.

We are developing a hardware module called BoatGod, which allows a navigation program installed on a tablet computer to connect to onboard networks, thereby providing the ability to analyze information and receive/send data to the onboard network. Additionally, BoatGod users will be able to control onboard devices such as the vessel's autopilot, engine, onboard lighting, and media system. With BoatGod, skippers will be able to monitor the status of all the vessel's systems and manage them. We also plan to give BoatGod capabilities to remotely control NMEA-compatible devices. The end users of these solutions are not only private owners, but also large charter companies interested in remotely monitoring all onboard systems, from electronic devices to engines, of vessels currently in use by their clients. BoatGod will allow users to fully control the vessel, collect and analyze geo-information to refine navigational data, and quickly obtain navigational information synchronized with personal mobile devices.

Quote from: sergey345 on February 25, 2018, 09:25:34 PM Dear Team, any predictions on token value growth? Frequency of token use directly contributes to its growth potential. In other words, the more actively a token is used within the project, the greater its potential for growth. That said, we aim to stimulate NAVI value growth with a two-prong approach. First, every time tokens are used to rent or book a vessel, those tokens will be immediately burned and taken off the market. This model assumes a gradual decrease of available tokens, and an organic increase of demand and price. Second, at least 25% of all advertising profits will be used to buyout tokens available on cryptocurrency exchanges. We then will burn at least 50% of the tokens, removing them from the market, and further stimulating NAVI value growth. A combination of factors will ensure a powerful incentive for NAVI exchange rate increases: •The less tokens available on exchanges, the higher the NAVI exchange rate (effect of supply and demand). •Gradual decrease in total number of tokens available to the public, due to buyout and burning, will decrease the supply and increase token value. •All members of the BoatPilot team and TGE participants will be interested and vested in raising advertisement revenue (main source of project revenue and team profits), and buying out and annulling NAVI. •The project team will hold 20% of the tokens initially generated, which will be available approximately five-six months after the TGE. This will further incentivize the team to maximize NAVI value growth. This aspect is not exclusive to us – all successful TGEs use this approach. •Finally, if the TGE reaches the Hard Cap, we will be able to enter the markets in North and South America and the Asia Pacific region in one to two years. This will increase advertising revenue and, subsequently, the number of tokens bought out from cryptocurrency exchanges.

No question is not stupid for us. We really appreciate your input. BoatPilot is not only a tool, it is a marketplace that provides businesses of any size – from large brands to small seaside restaurants – effective and convenient access to the international yachting market, which will reach $74.7 billion by 2022. The big part of benefit BoatPilot gets from its commercial advertising. As for NAVI usage, first of all, NAVI is going to become a very perspective and valuable cryptocurrency as we will use well thought-out and very effective token growth cost mechanism within the project for this aim. At second, BoatPilot will have a loyalty program that will be made available to users who maintain NAVI tokens in their e-wallets. Users will be rewarded with bonuses and gifts for retaining NAVI tokens in their wallets for a specified period of time. For example, a 25-50% discount to rent a yacht from our preferred vendors. For high quantity token holders, BoatPilot will arrange an exclusive luxury yacht once per year for a period of one week (with capacity for 5-6 people). And finally, you can get bonus up to 100%. Our bonus structure will benefit those who are among the first purchases NAVI tokens. The earlier you purchase the tokens, the greater your bonus will be.

BoatGod is also capable of aggregating geo-data from various systems, like the vessel's sonar, to compile updated charts. Yes, you can use the app as a marine navigator without BoatGod.

Quote from: lanfeusst on February 25, 2018, 08:59:59 AM The TGE for everyone will start in March, 1. Am I right? But can I register in the project before the start?  Yes, you are. The open stage will begin on March 1, 2018 and last until April 15, 2018. You can read all the details about the closed and open stages of the TGE in our Token Policy.

We implemented a separate app, modest in its resource demands, specifically for Epson AR glasses. The app works in parallel with the main BoatPilot application, receiving data on the planned route, waypoints, and other key information. The Epson headset application is responsible for visualizing and superimposing all the necessary navigational information on the surface. As such, after setting the necessary objectives on the navigator, skippers can concentrate completely on yacht control, without being distracted by the navigator screen and dash.

BoatPilot is not only a tool, it is a marketplace that provides businesses of any size – from large brands to small seaside restaurants – effective and convenient access to the international yachting market, which will reach $74.7 billion by 2022. The big part of benefit BoatPilot gets from its commercial advertising. As for NAVI usage, first of all, NAVI is going to become a very perspective and valuable cryptocurrency as we will use well thought-out and very effective token growth cost mechanism within the project for this aim. At second, BoatPilot will have a loyalty program that will be made available to users who maintain NAVI tokens in their e-wallets. Users will be rewarded with bonuses and gifts for retaining NAVI tokens in their wallets for a specified period of time. For example, a 25-50% discount to rent a yacht from our preferred vendors. For high quantity token holders, BoatPilot will arrange an exclusive luxury yacht once per year for a period of one week (with capacity for 5-6 people). And finally, you can get bonus up to 100%.

Additionally, BoatGod users will be able to control onboard devices such as the vessel's autopilot, engine, onboard lighting, and media system. With BoatGod, skippers will be able to monitor the status of all the vessel's systems and manage them. We also plan to give BoatGod capabilities to remotely control NMEA-compatible devices. The end users of these solutions are not only private owners, but also large charter companies interested in remotely monitoring all onboard systems, from electronic devices to engines, of vessels currently in use by their clients. BoatGod will allow users to fully control the vessel, collect and analyze geo-information to refine navigational data, and quickly obtain navigational information synchronized with personal mobile devices.

We implemented a separate app, modest in its resource demands, specifically for Epson AR glasses. The app works in parallel with the main BoatPilot application, receiving data on the planned route, waypoints, and other key information. The Epson headset application is responsible for visualizing and superimposing all the necessary navigational information on the surface. As such, after setting the necessary objectives on the navigator, skippers can concentrate completely on yacht control, without being distracted by the navigator screen and dash. We plan to significantly expand the list of supported AR headset manufacturers in 2018.  Kind regards, BoatPilot team.",False

BoatPilot is not only a tool, it is a marketplace that provides businesses of any size – from large brands to small seaside restaurants – effective and convenient access to the international yachting market, which will reach $74.7 billion by 2022. The big part of benefit BoatPilot gets from its commercial advertising. As for NAVI usage, first of all, NAVI is going to become a very perspective and valuable cryptocurrency as we will use well thought-out and very effective token growth cost mechanism within the project for this aim. At second, BoatPilot will have a loyalty program that will be made available to users who maintain NAVI tokens in their e-wallets. Users will be rewarded with bonuses and gifts for retaining NAVI tokens in their wallets for a specified period of time. For example, a 25-50% discount to rent a yacht from our preferred vendors. For high quantity token holders, BoatPilot will arrange an exclusive luxury yacht once per year for a period of one week (with capacity for 5-6 people). And finally, you can get bonus up to 100%. Our bonus structure will benefit those who are among the first purchases NAVI tokens. The earlier you purchase the tokens, the greater your bonus will be.

Most data suppliers (for example, OSM) are bloated and lack optimal storage structures. Our algorithm will find and eliminate such redundancy, which in turn will cut the size of the database to a fifth. A key feature of our algorithm is its parallelization. It allows you to use MapReduce algorithms on a computing cluster. The software algorithm is implemented via Python using ZeroMQ to distribute tasks throughout computing nodes. The common and open ESRI Shapefile is used as an output format, allowing the results to be used not only on mobile devices, but in the vast majority of GIS packages.

Thanks for the questions!     We are developing a hardware module called BoatGod, which allows a navigation program installed on a tablet computer to connect to onboard networks, thereby providing the ability to analyze information and receive/send data to the onboard network. Additionally, BoatGod users will be able to control onboard devices such as the vessel's autopilot, engine, onboard lighting, and media system. With BoatGod, skippers will be able to monitor the status of all the vessel's systems and manage them. We also plan to give BoatGod capabilities to remotely control NMEA-compatible devices. The end users of these solutions are not only private owners, but also large charter companies interested in remotely monitoring all onboard systems, from electronic devices to engines, of vessels currently in use by their clients. BoatGod will allow users to fully control the vessel, collect and analyze geo-information to refine navigational data, and quickly obtain navigational information synchronized with personal mobile devices.

As for NAVI usage, first of all, NAVI is going to become a very perspective and valuable cryptocurrency as we will use well thought-out and very effective token growth cost mechanism within the project for this aim. At second, BoatPilot will have a loyalty program that will be made available to users who maintain NAVI tokens in their e-wallets.

Yes, many geographical objects have a set of user characteristics. Many users can add to or change these attributes, which leads us to the conflicts between editing and searching by an attribute value. Our platform will provide versioning and conflict resolution capabilities, using both a pessimistic strategy and manual data merging in the event of conflicting attribute changes. Additionally, our platform will automatically integrate incoming edits from trusted sources, provide an interface for manual analysis and comparison of edits, and determine the degree of trust based on the history of the source's edits and social  connections.

Additionally, BoatGod users will be able to control onboard devices such as the vessel's autopilot, engine, onboard lighting, and media system. With BoatGod, skippers will be able to monitor the status of all the vessel's systems and manage them. We also plan to give BoatGod capabilities to remotely control NMEA-compatible devices. The end users of these solutions are not only private owners, but also large charter companies interested in remotely monitoring all onboard systems, from electronic devices to engines, of vessels currently in use by their clients. BoatGod will allow users to fully control the vessel, collect and analyze geo-information to refine navigational data, and quickly obtain navigational information synchronized with personal mobile devices.

BoatGod module connects directly to the onboard system of any vessel, collects marine data, and transfers it via Wi-Fi. Our platform will automatically integrate incoming edits from trusted sources, provide an interface for manual analysis and comparison of edits, and determine the degree of trust based on the history of the source's edits and social connections. At the basic level, this will be implemented using Python-based REST interfaces and AngularJS-based WEB UI. Heuristic algorithms of trusted users and workspace optimization to increase operator productivity in case of manual conflict resolution will also be improved.

Google is not is not presented in the yacht navigation market yet, because it is a specific area. The three key players on the marine cartography market are Jeppesen (18%), Transas Marine (12%), and Navionics (8%).

After all, the app is free, and you do not need to buy tokens for using it. Where can the dividends for the holders of tokens take? No question is not stupid for us. We really appreciate your input. First of all, NAVI is going to become a very perspective and valuable cryptocurrency as we will use well thought-out and very effective token growth cost mechanism within the project for this aim. At second, BoatPilot will have a loyalty program that will be made available to users who maintain NAVI tokens in their e-wallets. Users will be rewarded with bonuses and gifts for retaining NAVI tokens in their wallets for a specified period of time. For example, a 25-50% discount to rent a yacht from our preferred vendors. For high quantity token holders, BoatPilot will arrange an exclusive luxury yacht once per year for a period of one week (with capacity for 5-6 people). And finally, you can get bonus up to 100%. Our bonus structure will benefit those who are among the first purchases NAVI tokens. The earlier you purchase the tokens, the greater your bonus will be.

A map is displayed to the AR-glasses, all the nuances of navigation and collected data from onboard systems. AR-glasses will go on sale only if we reach the Hard Cap. It is hard to discuss the subject before the project starts.  Kind regards, BoatPilot team",False

Most data suppliers (for example, OSM) are bloated and lack optimal storage structures. Our algorithm will find and eliminate such redundancy, which in turn will cut the size of the database to a fifth. A key feature of our algorithm is its parallelization. It allows you to use MapReduce algorithms on a computing cluster. The software algorithm is implemented via Python using ZeroMQ to distribute tasks throughout computing nodes. The common and open ESRI Shapefile is used as an output format, allowing the results to be used not only on mobile devices, but in the vast majority of GIS packages.

Most data suppliers (for example, OSM) are bloated and lack optimal storage structures. Our algorithm will find and eliminate such redundancy, which in turn will cut the size of the database to a fifth. A key feature of our algorithm is its parallelization.

We are developing a hardware module called BoatGod, which allows a navigation program installed on a tablet computer to connect to onboard networks, thereby providing the ability to analyze information and receive/send data to the onboard network. Additionally, BoatGod users will be able to control onboard devices such as the vessel's autopilot, engine, onboard lighting, and media system. With BoatGod, skippers will be able to monitor the status of all the vessel's systems and manage them. We also plan to give BoatGod capabilities to remotely control NMEA-compatible devices. The end users of these solutions are not only private owners, but also large charter companies interested in remotely monitoring all onboard systems, from electronic devices to engines, of vessels currently in use by their clients.

We have real advantages over them, because BoatPilot is the first integrated marine navigation service with augmented reality capabilities for private and commercial yachting markets. BoatPilot is completely free to all end users.   Quote from: BazkieBumpercar on February 16, 2018, 05:54:26 PM I ask a stupid question, but still. How will you collect profit? After all, the app is free, and you do not need to buy tokens for using it. Where can the dividends for the holders of tokens take? No question is not stupid for us. We really appreciate your input. First of all, NAVI is going to become a very perspective and valuable cryptocurrency as we will use well thought-out and very effective token growth cost mechanism within the project for this aim. At second, BoatPilot will have a loyalty program that will be made available to users who maintain NAVI tokens in their e-wallets. Users will be rewarded with bonuses and gifts for retaining NAVI tokens in their wallets for a specified period of time. For example, a 25-50% discount to rent a yacht from our preferred vendors. For high quantity token holders, BoatPilot will arrange an exclusive luxury yacht once per year for a period of one week (with capacity for 5-6 people). And finally, you can get bonus up to 100%. Our bonus structure will benefit those who are among the first purchases NAVI tokens. The earlier you purchase the tokens, the greater your bonus will be.

Additionally, BoatGod users will be able to control onboard devices such as the vessel's autopilot, engine, onboard lighting, and media system. With BoatGod, skippers will be able to monitor the status of all the vessel's systems and manage them. We also plan to give BoatGod capabilities to remotely control NMEA-compatible devices. The end users of these solutions are not only private owners, but also large charter companies interested in remotely monitoring all onboard systems, from electronic devices to engines, of vessels currently in use by their clients. BoatGod will allow users to fully control the vessel, collect and analyze geo-information to refine navigational data, and quickly obtain navigational information synchronized with personal mobile devices.

BoatGod module connects directly to the onboard system of any vessel, collects marine data, and transfers it via Wi-Fi. Our platform will automatically integrate incoming edits from trusted sources, provide an interface for manual analysis and comparison of edits, and determine the degree of trust based on the history of the source's edits and social connections. At the basic level, this will be implemented using Python-based REST interfaces and AngularJS-based WEB UI. Heuristic algorithms of trusted users and workspace optimization to increase operator productivity in case of manual conflict resolution will also be improved.

Google is not is not presented in the yacht navigation market yet, because it is a specific area.

Thanks for asking!     We implemented a separate app, modest in its resource demands, specifically for Epson AR glasses. The app works in parallel with the main BoatPilot application, receiving data on the planned route, waypoints, and other key information. The Epson headset application is responsible for visualizing and superimposing all the necessary navigational information on the surface. As such, after setting the necessary objectives on the navigator, skippers can concentrate completely on yacht control, without being distracted by the navigator screen and dash. We plan to significantly expand the list of supported AR headset manufacturers in 2018.  Quote from: Xyver on February 14, 2018, 01:37:50 PM When and what exchanges BoatPilot tokens will be listed?  Our ticker: NAVI. What exchanges exactly we can tell you after our TGE. We are already communicating with some major crypto exchanges regarding ours tokens trade.

Most data suppliers (for example, OSM) are bloated and lack optimal storage structures. Our algorithm will find and eliminate such redundancy, which in turn will cut the size of the database to a fifth. A key feature of our algorithm is its parallelization.

Quote from: chaolang on February 12, 2018, 06:52:56 AM Will all the existing AR-goggles models support your navigation program? We implemented a separate app, modest in its resource demands, specifically for Epson AR glasses. The app works in parallel with the main BoatPilot application, receiving data on the planned route, waypoints, and other key information. The Epson headset application is responsible for visualizing and superimposing all the necessary navigational information on the surface. As such, after setting the necessary objectives on the navigator, skippers can concentrate completely on yacht control, without being distracted by the navigator screen and dash.

Additionally, BoatGod users will be able to control onboard devices such as the vessel's autopilot, engine, onboard lighting, and media system. With BoatGod, skippers will be able to monitor the status of all the vessel's systems and manage them. We also plan to give BoatGod capabilities to remotely control NMEA-compatible devices. The end users of these solutions are not only private owners, but also large charter companies interested in remotely monitoring all onboard systems, from electronic devices to engines, of vessels currently in use by their clients.

Users will be rewarded with bonuses and gifts for retaining NAVI tokens in their wallets for a specified period of time. For example, a 25-50% discount to rent a yacht from our preferred vendors. For high quantity token holders, BoatPilot will arrange an exclusive luxury yacht once per year for a period of one week (with capacity for 5-6 people). And finally, you can get bonus up to 100%. Our bonus structure will benefit those who are among the first purchases NAVI tokens. The earlier you purchase the tokens, the greater your bonus will be.

There are no plans for additional paid features at the moment. But we can take up this question for consideration in case it appears frequently.  Kind regards, BoatPilot team",False

Quote from: DeeSome on February 09, 2018, 04:49:26 PM Will all the existing AR-goggles models support your navigation program? We implemented a separate app, modest in its resource demands, specifically for Epson AR glasses. The app works in parallel with the main BoatPilot application, receiving data on the planned route, waypoints, and other key information. The Epson headset application is responsible for visualizing and superimposing all the necessary navigational information on the surface. As such, after setting the necessary objectives on the navigator, skippers can concentrate completely on yacht control, without being distracted by the navigator screen and dash. We plan to significantly expand the list of supported AR headset manufacturers in 2018.  Quote from: ruxun on February 09, 2018, 05:17:32 PM When does the open stage start?

Quote from: chaolang on February 07, 2018, 10:50:13 PM I am a yacht owner and I want to put it up for sale with your service. What kind of advertising you could offer?  The fee is a classic model that can be chosen in the investor's office. There are CPM, CPC and later - CPL. CPC stands for Cost-Per-Click, so an advertiser pays every time a user actually clicks on ad. CPM (Cost-Per-Mille) - in this model you are going to pay a flat rate for 1,000 displays or impressions of your ad. CPL (Click-Per-Lead) is a model which requires not only a user clicking on the ad but also him completing further action like signing up for a newsletter, becoming a member, watching a video, etc.  Quote from: chrison999 on February 07, 2018, 10:04:37 PM How will BoatGod collect data from onboard systems? I'm not sure that my yacht is modern enough for such technologies.  This module connects directly to the onboard system of any vessel, collects marine data, and transfers it via Wi-Fi. BoatPilot looks like a small USB hard drive and you can connect it with your yacht using universal port NMEA 2000 and NMEA 0183  - standard port for all chart plotters. Almost all yachts have this port.  Quote from: CryptoPromotions on February 07, 2018, 09:44:30 PM Charter business is interested in the possibility of remote control of the vessel, your BoatGod gives such an opportunity? earlier you've written that he is close to smartthings  We are developing a hardware module called BoatGod, which allows a navigation program installed on a tablet computer to connect to onboard networks, thereby providing the ability to analyze information and receive/send data to the onboard network. Additionally, BoatGod users will be able to control onboard devices such as the vessel's autopilot, engine, onboard lighting, and media system. With BoatGod, skippers will be able to monitor the status of all the vessel's systems and manage them. We also plan to give BoatGod capabilities to remotely control NMEA-compatible devices. The end users of these solutions are not only private owners, but also large charter companies interested in remotely monitoring all onboard systems, from electronic devices to engines, of vessels currently in use by their clients. BoatGod will allow users to fully control the vessel, collect and analyze geo-information to refine navigational data, and quickly obtain navigational information synchronized with personal mobile devices.

To raise funds for BoatPilot’s future development, we are launching an Token Generation Event (TGE), to offer NAVI tokens to the general public. The financial model assumes two possible courses of development and functionalities of BoatPilot. Both are based on the amount of funds raised through the TGE. The TGE will be launched in two stages — closed and open. During the closed stage, which is often called pre-fund or private placement, BoatPilot will engage with private investors, funds and large market players. The minimum amount of NAVI tokens purchased during the closed stage is $25,000 (equivalent in ETH, BTC, BCH, LTC). There are provisions for bonuses reaching up to 50% or 100% of tokens purchased, and will be discussed on an individual basis. The second stage of the TGE will be open to the public – anyone from cryptocurrency enthusiasts, to yachting professionals is welcome to participate. You can find more in our White Paper.

Yes, many geographical objects have a set of user characteristics. Many users can add to or change these attributes, which leads us to the conflicts between editing and searching by an attribute value. Our platform will provide versioning and conflict resolution capabilities, using both a pessimistic strategy and manual data merging in the event of conflicting attribute changes. Additionally, our platform will automatically integrate incoming edits from trusted sources, provide an interface for manual analysis and comparison of edits, and determine the degree of trust based on the history of the source's edits and social  connections.

Thank you for the questions!     By burning tokens we aim to stimulate NAVI value growth with a two-prong approach. First, every time tokens are used to rent or book a vessel, those tokens will be immediately burned and taken off the market. This model assumes a gradual decrease of available tokens, and an organic increase of demand and price. Second, at least 25% of all advertising profits will be used to buyout tokens available on cryptocurrency exchanges. We then will burn at least 50% of the tokens, removing them from the market, and further stimulating NAVI value growth.  Quote from: chrison999 on February 07, 2018, 07:58:47 AM which AR-goggles models will support your program?  We implemented a separate app, modest in its resource demands, specifically for Epson AR glasses. The app works in parallel with the main BoatPilot application, receiving data on the planned route, waypoints, and other key information. The Epson headset application is responsible for visualizing and superimposing all the necessary navigational information on the surface. As such, after setting the necessary objectives on the navigator, skippers can concentrate completely on yacht control, without being distracted by the navigator screen and dash. We plan to significantly expand the list of supported AR headset manufacturers in 2018.  Quote from: chaolang on February 07, 2018, 08:18:05 AM Do you optimize your service for mobile devices?  Most data suppliers (for example, OSM) are bloated and lack optimal storage structures. Our algorithm will find and eliminate such redundancy, which in turn will cut the size of the database to a fifth. A key feature of our algorithm is its parallelization. It allows you to use MapReduce algorithms on a computing cluster. The software algorithm is implemented via Python using ZeroMQ to distribute tasks throughout computing nodes. The common and open ESRI Shapefile is used as an output format, allowing the results to be used not only on mobile devices, but in the vast majority of GIS packages.

Users will be rewarded with bonuses and gifts for retaining NAVI tokens in their wallets for a specified period of time.

One of the ways we choose to solve the size problem is by using variable resolutions depending on depth. For example, having 1-meter resolution for depths up to 5 meters, and raising the resolution as depth increases. This does not affect navigational capabilities, but significantly enhances performance and reduces the amount of data stored and processed.Our algorithm will find and eliminate such redundancy, which in turn will cut the size of the database to a fifth.

Additionally, BoatGod users will be able to control onboard devices such as the vessel's autopilot, engine, onboard lighting, and media system. With BoatGod, skippers will be able to monitor the status of all the vessel's systems and manage them. We also plan to give BoatGod capabilities to remotely control NMEA-compatible devices. The end users of these solutions are not only private owners, but also large charter companies interested in remotely monitoring all onboard systems, from electronic devices to engines, of vessels currently in use by their clients. BoatGod will allow users to fully control the vessel, collect and analyze geo-information to refine navigational data, and quickly obtain navigational information synchronized with personal mobile devices.

The fee is a classic model that can be chosen in the investor's office. There are CPM, CPC and later - CPL. CPC stands for Cost-Per-Click, so an advertiser pays every time a user actually clicks on ad. CPM (Cost-Per-Mille) - in this model you are going to pay a flat rate for 1,000 displays or impressions of your ad. CPL (Click-Per-Lead) is a model which requires not only a user clicking on the ad but also him completing further action like signing up for a newsletter, becoming a member, watching a video, etc.  Quote from: DeeSome on February 05, 2018, 10:06:58 AM Can I transfer tokens after TGE or till the coin is launched in to coin market?

We have 1-meter resolution for depths up to 5 meters, and raising the resolution as depth increases. This does not affect navigational capabilities, but significantly enhances performance and reduces the amount of data stored and processed. The most data suppliers  (for example, OSM) have a coastline contour encoded as 1,000 curves with a resolution of 1 meter, but it is much more efficient to present it as 10 curves with a resolution of 100 meters without significant loss of accuracy. Depth charts can be presented with a vertical resolution of 0.1 meters, which is also clearly excessive for the private yachting sector. Our algorithm will find and eliminate such redundancy, which in turn will cut the size of the database to a fifth.

Quote from: granathus on February 04, 2018, 09:17:36 AM Will all the existing AR-goggles models support your navigation program?  We implemented a separate app, modest in its resource demands, specifically for Epson AR glasses. The app works in parallel with the main BoatPilot application, receiving data on the planned route, waypoints, and other key information. The Epson headset application is responsible for visualizing and superimposing all the necessary navigational information on the surface. As such, after setting the necessary objectives on the navigator, skippers can concentrate completely on yacht control, without being distracted by the navigator screen and dash. We plan to significantly expand the list of supported AR headset manufacturers in 2018.

Thanks a lot for questions!     The reason is that most data suppliers (for example, OSM) are bloated and lack optimal storage structures. For example, a coastline contour can be encoded as 1,000 curves with a resolution of 1 meter, but it is much more efficient to present it as 10 curves with a resolution of 100 meters without significant loss of accuracy. Depth charts can be presented with a vertical resolution of 0.1 meters, which is also clearly excessive for the private yachting sector. Additionally, using several data suppliers means that part of the information is duplicated. All of the above raise reasons for optimization to make the database usable on mobile devices. One of the ways we choose to solve the size problem is by using variable resolutions depending on depth. For example, having 1-meter resolution for depths up to 5 meters, and raising the resolution as depth increases. This does not affect navigational capabilities, but significantly enhances performance and reduces the amount of data stored and processed.

Yes, BoatPilot is more like chartplotter, not navigator. Initially, the chartplotter is a paper map with depth. The usual navigators do not show the depth.

Additionally, BoatGod users will be able to control onboard devices such as the vessel's autopilot, engine, onboard lighting, and media system. With BoatGod, skippers will be able to monitor the status of all the vessel's systems and manage them. We also plan to give BoatGod capabilities to remotely control NMEA-compatible devices. The end users of these solutions are not only private owners, but also large charter companies interested in remotely monitoring all onboard systems, from electronic devices to engines, of vessels currently in use by their clients. BoatGod will allow users to fully control the vessel, collect and analyze geo-information to refine navigational data, and quickly obtain navigational information synchronized with personal mobile devices.

Quote from: CryptoPromotions on February 03, 2018, 10:55:55 AM Why would you burn some of the tokens after using them?  By burning tokens we aim to stimulate NAVI value growth with a two-prong approach. First, every time tokens are used to rent or book a vessel, those tokens will be immediately burned and taken off the market. This model assumes a gradual decrease of available tokens, and an organic increase of demand and price. Second, at least 25% of all advertising profits will be used to buyout tokens available on cryptocurrency exchanges. We then will burn at least 50% of the tokens, removing them from the market, and further stimulating NAVI value growth.

The cut-off for BoatPilot TGE funding is $3 920 000. If this is not reached before Token Generation Event end date, all investments will be refunded to the participants.  Quote from: Xyver on February 02, 2018, 09:20:54 PM What algorithm did you use to optimize your service for mobile devices, taking into account their limited productivity?  Most data suppliers (for example, OSM) are bloated and lack optimal storage structures. Our algorithm will find and eliminate such redundancy, which in turn will cut the size of the database to a fifth. A key feature of our algorithm is its parallelization. It allows you to use MapReduce algorithms on a computing cluster. The software algorithm is implemented via Python using ZeroMQ to distribute tasks throughout computing nodes. The common and open ESRI Shapefile is used as an output format, allowing the results to be used not only on mobile devices, but in the vast majority of GIS packages.

Will BoatPilot deal with this influx of different information??  Yes, many geographical objects have a set of user characteristics. Many users can add to or change these attributes, which leads us to the conflicts between editing and searching by an attribute value. Our platform will provide versioning and conflict resolution capabilities, using both a pessimistic strategy and manual data merging in the event of conflicting attribute changes. Additionally, our platform will automatically integrate incoming edits from trusted sources, provide an interface for manual analysis and comparison of edits, and determine the degree of trust based on the history of the source's edits and social  connections.

We're world’s first, free marine navigation program with highly developed functions and regular, timely updates. In BoatPilot charts are loaded and updated automatically when the app is started. Also it can be used offline. In additiond, charts are constantly updated using data from onboard systems, and can then be edited or added to by users. Beside this, your product is completely free.

This solution will save all of the track’s necessary attributes—coordinates, speeds, course—with high temporal detail. When integrated with the onboard network, BoatPilot will add depth, fuel capacity, prevailing winds data, and any other  information from the onboard sensors.

Quote from: baokychen on February 02, 2018, 11:05:27 AM i read the whitepaper and cant find out why do you need blockchain for your project  As a project from the real (active) business sector and not from the blockchain sector, we will use TGE to crowdfund further development of the project, creating the NAVI token to be used within the BoatPilot ecosystem by all users, businesses and advertisers that are associated with it. We also use blockchain to store and secure our geo-data. Additionally, within the Pocket Skipper app users will be able to book yachts and marinas using their NAVI tokens, as well as the usual payment methods (credit cards, PayPal, etc.). This means tokens purchased during the TGE, or later at an exchange, can be used for any future yachting trips. BoatPilot's loyalty program will be made available to users who maintain NAVI tokens in their e-wallets.  Users will be rewarded with bonuses and gifts for retaining NAVI tokens in their wallets for a specified period of time.  You can find more details on the use of the NAVI token within our ecosystem, as well as how we plan to generate token growth in our White Paper  https://www.boatpilot.io/docs/BoatPilot_White_Paper_EN.pdf (see page 16-19)  Kind regards, BoatPilot team",False

CPM (Cost-Per-Mille) - in this model you are going to pay a flat rate for 1,000 displays or impressions of your ad.

BoatPilot is a marketplace that provides businesses of any size – from large brands to small seaside restaurants – effective and convenient access to the international yachting market, which will reach $74.7 billion by 20221. Best of all, BoatPilot advertising works even when the user has no internet access. We plan to become the world’s leading marine navigation solution for mobile devices hones and tablets), and built-in navigation systems produced by equipment manufacturers; also we plan to provide the yachting industry a convenient and fully functional platform to advertise products and services in a market estimated to be worth over $200 billion annually.

Quote from: josecauy on February 02, 2018, 09:16:37 AM Where can I find the russian yellow paper? mobile devices have limited computing power and RAM, how did you adapt your service to this?  Here you can find our Yellow Paper: https://www.boatpilot.io/docs/BoatPilot_Yellow_Paper_RU.pdf One of the ways we choose to solve the size problem is by using variable resolutions depending on depth. For example, having 1-meter resolution for depths up to 5 meters, and raising the resolution as depth increases. This does not affect navigational capabilities, but significantly enhances performance and reduces the amount of data stored and processed. Our algorithm will find and eliminate such redundancy, which in turn will cut the size of the database to a fifth. Industry standard library GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library) will be used as the database library for all geo-data. GDAL is a stable high-speed library, supported by the community, as well as by large commercial and non-profit organizations such as Oracle and the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.

The TGE is a very effective and easy way to draw attention of lots of investors to BoatPilot and raise funds at the same time. We will hold the TGE in two stages – closed and open. The closed stage is for private investors, funds and large market players as the minimum amount of NAVI tokens purchased during this stage is $25,000 (equivalent in ETH or BTC). The other stage of TGE will be open to the public. It is also possible to deposit funds in cash or transfer them to the company’s  current account. You can read all the details about the TGE in our Token Policy https://www.boatpilot.io/docs/BoatPilot_Token_Policy_EN.pdf..  Best regards, BoatPilot team.",False

Thank you for the questions!     The current European yachting charter business is valued at $13 billion, and is estimated to increase to $13.6 billion by 2020. BoatPilot received exclusive rights to book over 13,000 yachts from more than 1,000 operators in Europe since May 2016, making our project one of the leading players in this segment. Currently, the European yachting market exceeds $20 billion, with the share of commercial marine cartography in Europe being approximately $154 million in 2015. It is projected that by 2020 the marine cartography segment will reach $166 million. On the other hand, the total volume of the European yachting advertising market is estimated at $100 million as of the year 2014. Don't forget that BoatPilot is also a powerful advertising platform with a very targeted and affluent audience.  Quote from: ianp on January 31, 2018, 08:51:10 AM when did you begin to develop this idea of the project and what did you do to the beginning of the TGE?  Following more than two years of active work on BoatPilot, our results include: •Over 35,000 downloads of BoatPilot MVP on Google Play. •The fastest growing audience in the yachting industry. •Highly targeted audience with unique parameters that are available to advertisers. Parameters vary from the type of vessel, to number of miles sailed, and include current geographical location. •Signed agreements with several charter and service companies. •Exclusive rights to book over 13,000 vessels in Europe from over 1,000 participating companies. •World’s first, free marine navigation program with highly developed functions and regular, timely updates. •Full coverage of the Mediterranean3  with the most precise database, with nearly twice as many marinas listed in BoatPilot than in other marine navigation programs (350 versus 180).  Quote from: DeeSome on January 31, 2018, 09:16:31 AM What mechanisms do you use to keep your token afloat and grow in price?  We take the following responsibilities to ensure that NAVI cost continues to rise: •Burn all tokens used to book yachts, marinas and others through Pocket Skipper app; •Use at least 25% of the profits raised through advertising to purchase NAVI tokens and burn at least 50% thereof for the period of 3 years after the TGE.

Thanks for the questions!     If you have $100,000 and more in NAVI equivalent you'll get one free yacht vacation per year. If you have $50,000-$100,000 in NAVI equivalent, you'll get one annual discount for yacht rental of 50%.

Don't you plan to introduce a fee in the future if the project does not reach the hard cap?  Yes, Pocket Skipper is absolutely free and will stay that way. Within the Pocket Skipper app, users will be able to book yachts and marinas using their NAVI tokens, as well as the usual payment methods (credit cards, PayPal, etc.). This means tokens purchased during the TGE, or later at an exchange, can be used for any future yachting trips.  Quote from: TomKoinify on January 31, 2018, 11:05:14 AM what does your project have to do with blockchain? Do you store all the data entered through the BoatPilot in a distributed ledger for security? I understand everything correctly?  As a project from the real (active) business sector and not from the blockchain sector, we will use TGE to crowdfund further development of the project, creating the NAVI token to be used within the BoatPilot ecosystem by all users, businesses and advertisers that are associated with it. We also use blockchain to store and secure our geo-data. Additionally, within the Pocket Skipper app users will be able to book yachts and marinas using their NAVI tokens, as well as the usual payment methods (credit cards, PayPal, etc.). This means tokens purchased during the TGE, or later at an exchange, can be used for any future yachting trips. BoatPilot's loyalty program will be made available to users who maintain NAVI tokens in their e-wallets.  Users will be rewarded with bonuses and gifts for retaining NAVI tokens in their wallets for a specified period of time.  You can find more details on the use of the NAVI token within our ecosystem, as well as how we plan to generate token growth in our White Paper  https://www.boatpilot.io/docs/BoatPilot_White_Paper_EN.pdf (see page 16-19)  Kind regards, BoatPilot team",False

By burning tokens we aim to stimulate NAVI value growth with a two-prong approach. First, every time tokens are used to rent or book a vessel, those tokens will be immediately burned and taken off the market. This model assumes a gradual decrease of available tokens, and an organic increase of demand and price. Second, at least 25% of all advertising profits will be used to buyout tokens available on cryptocurrency exchanges. We then will burn at least 50% of the tokens, removing them from the market, and further stimulating NAVI value growth.  Quote from: granathus on January 29, 2018, 04:11:19 PM How much will the AR googles cost and when will they be available?

As many editors are used while offline, changes reach the database only after some time during synchronization. There is a need to resolve conflicts between editing and searching by an attribute value. Our platform will provide versioning and conflict resolution capabilities, using both a pessimistic strategy and manual data merging in the event of conflicting attribute changes. Additionally, our platform will automatically integrate incoming edits from trusted sources, provide an interface for manual analysis and comparison of edits, and determine the degree of trust based on the history of the source's edits and social connections.

Thanks for the questions!     The fee is a classic model that can be chosen in the investor's office. There are CPM, CPC and later - CPL. CPC stands for Cost-Per-Click, so an advertiser pays every time a user actually clicks on ad. CPM (Cost-Per-Mille) - in this model you are going to pay a flat rate for 1,000 displays or impressions of your ad. CPL (Click-Per-Lead) is a model which requires not only a user clicking on the ad but also him completing further action like signing up for a newsletter, becoming a member, watching a video, etc.  Quote from: actudoran on January 29, 2018, 09:17:17 AM so much information and so much details!

CPC stands for Cost-Per-Click, so an advertiser pays every time a user actually clicks on ad. CPM (Cost-Per-Mille) - in this model you are going to pay a flat rate for 1,000 displays or impressions of your ad. CPL (Click-Per-Lead) is a model which requires not only a user clicking on the ad but also him completing further action like signing up for a newsletter, becoming a member, watching a video, etc.  Best wishes, BoatPilot team.",False

I want to understand everything before taking part in TGE. I'm afraid of being involved in scam. For example, I did not understand, what is your maximum emission?  Thanks for the question! I'll explain. BoatPilot TGE is held in two stages: closed stage, or private placement, and open stage, or public placement. Now there is a closed stage, which began on January 9. During this stage 112 million tokens are released. And 229,737,610 NAVI tokens are released as part of the TGE public placement. If something else is not clear, let us know!

We take the following responsibilities to ensure that NAVI cost continues to rise: 1.Burn all tokens used to book yachts, marinas and others through Pocket Skipper app; 2.Use at least 25% of the profits raised through advertising to purchase NAVI tokens7 and burn at least 50% thereof for the period of 3 years after the TGE.",False

The following bonus structure is anticipated for the closed stage:      No amount under $25,000 (or 50 ETH / 2.5 BTC / 15 BCH / 250 LTC) is accepted during the private placement.

The following bonus structure is anticipated for the open stage:     229,737,610 NAVI tokens are released as part of the TGE public placement. The tokens are distributed as follows:    The number of tokens released during public placement is based on the assumption that no funds were raised during the closed stage of the TGE. However, in reality private placement will generate demand and funds raised will be greater than zero, so the Hard Cap can be reached before all tokens are sold. In this case, tokens that remain on the market after the Hard Cap is met will be bought out and burned. All funds transferred during the closed and open stages of the TGE are held in a special escrow vault and will be unavailable until the TGE is over.  ABOUT BOATPILOT        UNIQUELY DEVELOPED Unlike most existing marine navigation systems on the market, our product is uniquely developed for private yachtsmen and small yachting businesses  RELEVANT NAVIGATION Most relevant and precise navigation information on coastal objects  AUGMENTED REALITY BoatPilot supports an augmented reality (AR) function, which allows the skipper to use AR glasses to see all necessary data incorporated into actual surroundings, and avoid distractions by the traditional dash – this feature is especially useful during poor visibility conditions, or at night  USER GENERATED CONTENT BoatPilot users can add to and update the existing database and generate relevant content (comments, photos and routes), which is then checked by other members in the yachting community  BoatPilot is the first, free integrated marine Navigation Service with augmented reality capabilities for private / commercial yachting markets.  BoatPilot Tokenization Explained  BoatPilot users who have installed the module BoatGod on their vessels will transmit geo-data, which will be used to update marine charts and make them more precise. In return, we will reward them with NAVI tokens — the more someone sails, the more geo-data they share, the more tokens they receive.  To ensure that these bonuses are paid out, we will purchase NAVI on crypto-exchanges. As BoatPilot coverage territory grows and NAVI are mined more actively through geo-data sharing, we will buy back more and more tokens, stimulating token price growth.  Additionally, we will burn a part of the tokens to raise the price further by lowering the circulating supply.  Check our White Paper for more details.    How BoatPilot works  WHY INVESTORS CHOOSE US? UNIQUE INNOVATIVE PRODUCT BoatPilot is based on unique software components. Each component will function as part of our system, and can be used as a ready-made solution by other marine navigation manufacturers and marine chart aggregators.  •Vector geo-navigation information optimization module can be used on mobile devices with limited computing capabilities and storage space. The module can be used within a cluster.  •High-load cloud server platform for collaborative work on gridding, with arbitrary data structure and geo-data ranking and indexing functions.  •Cloud server platform for real-time collection and visualization of main marine indicators (coordinates, speeds, and routes) of vessels equipped with geo-location GPS and GLONASS devices, as well as a server for storing and cloud-synchronizing this data.  •Innovative wireless hardware module BoatGod for iOS and Android platforms designed to work with the vessel's onboard systems based on the NMEA standard, which allows receiving information from all of the vessel's devices and, if necessary, controlling them. BoatGod is also capable of aggregating geo-information from various systems, like the vessel's sonar, to compile updated charts.  •Augmented reality navigation system, which allows the skipper to avoid distractions of the dash, as well as receive tips on waterways, trajectory, danger signs, radio-channels, etc. This is especially important while navigating at night or in bad weather conditions.   SCALABLE BUSSINESS MODEL  Our business concept is ready to scale: strategy to expand to new geographies and markets clear development plan, implying continuous innovation of the product already functioning product, demanded even without marketing strong team passionate about yachting  CLEAR ROADMAP BoatPilot financial model assumes two possible courses of development and functionalities of BoatPilot. Both are based on the amount of funds raised through the TGE:  Soft Cap – $3 920 000 Hard Cap – $9 850 000 Please, see our Road Map below.  If the Soft Cap is not reached during the TGE, all investments made will be returned.  The TGE will end automatically when the Hard Cap is reached.  It is likely that the funds raised during the entire TGE will be in the range between the Soft and Hard Caps, in which case our team will do everything possible to develop the functionalities outlined under the Hard Cap goal.  As soon as the final amount of funds raised is available, a detailed action plan will be issued via a press release.  BoatPilot aims to ensure complete transparency and accuracy in its approach to all investments made during the TGE, and at later development stages.  TEAM OF EXPERTS, PASSIONATE ABOUT YACHTING  Experienced team of developers, who's in love with sailing! Meet our team and advisers here.

Using Navionics I can make routes and see deviations from the route. You do not have this, right? Why? Will it appear?  Actually, we are a chartplotter, we are not a navigator.
