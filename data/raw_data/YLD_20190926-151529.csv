Unfortunately wanting to succeed isn't actually enough evidence to warrant investment - or else the financial universe would, I'm sure, be a lot simpler.  From what I gather this is essentially raising money for the companies backing the ICO to fund expansion? I can see the benefit of launching an ICO instead of listing/seeking PE or seed funding, I'm sure it's a lot cheaper. What I can't understand is why you would expect anyone to invest without having an extremely thorough explanation of company accounts, meetings with management and so on. Why would a private investor not expect the same level of detail as an institution funding directly?  Everything here is so weak - I have seen no facts or figures backing up any claims other than ""we're going to do this"" and ""we sell supercars"". This means absolutely nothing. What are their margins? How strong is their balance sheet? What are the management's plans for the company and how do they plan to achieve these? Further, ""a verified track record"" of trading shows absolutely nothing about the company! Where are your funds under management? What are your risk parameters? If you were consistently achieving the returns that you claim you would have major financial institutions lining up at your door offering billions for you to manage, or alternatively buying your technology making you millionaires on the spot. Unfortunately since they have not, this makes me doubt your potential.  Claiming one of your backers is ""unwilling to release information... because of competitors"" is ridiculous. What you have essentially told me is - ""invest in me because... trust me"". And at the same time I see the founder splashing a load of cash on helicopters for his father and supercars. How is that a convincing argument for me to know my cash invested will be used wisely?  All I have deduced from the information provided is that you want cash from investors but aren't willing to give tangible investment information. It's all a show.",False

Company accounts are all available via companies house any user can do their own DD on the partners, you would not get companies like redline selling £1mill + cars if they needed money etc. The yield coin project is about creating multiple business structures under Yield Coin by business owners who understand exactly how to run profitable businesses. The idea behind Yield Coin is to drive liquidity through to the coin to drive the value higher, using businesses to adopt the coin to create the demand. Rather than sitting their and expecting speculation. So when you say everything here is so weak it really is more that you probably have not researched the companies, of which all is publicly available via companies house. Again you simply need to do your own research, the focus should not be on the partners as we will be partnering up with 50+ businesses, we are allowing businesses to accept Yield Coin as a form of payment to open their business to the new crypto customer, in return we receive the liquidity via the sales for their products/services coming through our cryptocurrency. Helping businesses to truly adopt the payment of crypto's and in return gaining liquidity is a great exchange, and having partnerships all in place is a great place to be. The project is fully on the way with soft cap getting hit.

It seems suspicious that a money-back guarantee was only set up to this limit, meaning any new investors will have no recourse if things go wrong. I wonder where that initial investment came from?  2) The only responses by YieldCoin are to comments by active members. Further, aside from these two active members all other comments are by brand new users. Is YieldCoin perhaps having their employees/associates with vested interests commenting with positive messages?  3) No single point of failure is great, only if every other point is strong enough to withstand the failure. Is there evidence that each business model is strong and profitable? I am yet to see any balance sheets or any financial information confirming these companies. Until then the multiple points of failure argument is surely moot?  I appreciate these come across as detailed however as an investor one must always be looking at the deeper picture...",False

Otherwise, we would have cancelled Yield Coin and returned money to the contributors at that time. With regards to things going wrong now, we are fully committed to making Yield Coin a success and with the multiple projects and work with the businesses we believe we can make our current contributors a good return where we at from now.  2) We are trying to answer all questions posted regardless if they from active/nonactive/junior/senior members. We have told our current contributors about this thread and it is up to them to post. With the bounty programme on offer (stated in this post) then of course people are going to post. We want to get Yield Coin out to as many people as possible. We don't see this as an issue or a bad thing, at the end of the day it is up to contributors whether they agree with the comments and see Yield Coin as a great opportunity and one that has advantages over the other ICOs currently in the market.  3) The majority of the projects are mutually exclusive and therefore if one fails it will not have an impact on the projects. The projects where we can provide a track record for we have, current Samuel & Co Trading fund has a verified track record that is publicly available (https://www.myfxbook.com/members/sandctrading/samuel-co-trading-samuel-leach/1868300). The performance and growth of Samuel & Co Trading is clear to see. As for the other Partners of Yield Coin, they are understandably unwilling to release more information of their business because of competitors.  However if you look into them i am sure you can see what they are doing and equally their growth. Take redline, they sell up to 70 super cars monthly and of which some are hyper cars. They would not have a show room like they do if they are under performing. You have to remember our coin is not a concept, these are real running businesses which some have been running for over 15 years, they are not start ups.",False

After doing my due diligence, reading the white paper and researching the team, I had a gut feeling that I could be investing in something potentially huge.  I feel that Yield Coin will overtake Electroneum as the UK leading Crypto as it has far more to offer with huge growth potential.  The fact that it will be pegged to multiple businesses in different sectors shows diversification with a long term plan.  The founder is also well known in his field, is very transparent and displays verified track records within the financial markets.  I am really excited for this project and will definitely be investing!!!!!",False

The ICO has excellent structure and exceeded its soft cap of $1.5million in under 12 hours. This statistic should entice other investors due to the rate of interest increasing. YC has a great team behind it with years of experience in the required industries and companies to make YC's future limitless!!",False

With it being FCA compliant and ready for any potential regulation, I think this shows how trustworthy the team behind the coin are and with their track records I think this will be a real success.  Being pegged to different projects/businesses reduces the risk to an investor and is such a brilliant idea as this should create stability. My advice would be to get in early and take advantage of the bonuses on offer. Can’t wait for it to be listed on the exchanges and to see where it can go.",False
