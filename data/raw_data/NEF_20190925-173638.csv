Based on the history of the change in the value of the most popular criterion, we can conclude that this is one of the most volatile assets, which has a general stable growth in price, and since it is the most capitalized, this dynamics reflects the state of the entire crypto-currency market as a whole. For people who assess their portfolio in relation to a fiat such as the Dollar or the Euro, this means that the assessment of their portfolio can be constantly changing during any period of time, both to the large and smaller side. All this led to the fact that using the majority of crypto currency as a payment instrument was not profitable. And they began to have a character - more promising investment tools, which in turn looks very attractive for use as collateral. Given that in most countries it is impossible to obtain a bank loan on the security of crypto assets, due to the lack of legislation and the legitimacy of these assets. This will serve as an impetus for the development of a new direction for financial lending, and will allow owners of crypto-currency assets to preserve and increase their portfolio. Any participant of the crypto-currency market, be it a miner, trader, exchanger and simply an investor who prefers to keep in the long term, periodically needs a traditional fiat currency. However, the sale of crypto-currency assets can be quite complex, but a necessary task, in the absence of an alternative option. And knowing how the market is structured and that the price is likely to continue its growth movement, you will potentially lose your profit. It follows that the ability to quickly and without any problems to use their crypto-currency assets, while not losing the opportunity to obtain further profits from growth, is simply necessary for any cryptoinvestor. Lending - an excellent solution to this problem. Lending in a stable currency, secured by volatile crypto-currency assets, would create a new direction in the digital economy. And it would also reduce the risks of both sides in case of a deep correction of the market.  Troubleshooting  The solution to this problem should be a classic P2P lending model, in which the creditor is a regular user, not a bank or other financial institution. However, a significant drawback of this model is the lack of protection and any guarantees, either for the user or for the creditor, from any fraudulent actions by either party. NEO Finance is a decentralized platform that takes into account the weaknesses of classic P2P credit models, which will create a stable and secure system for crediting users. It will provide you with fiat money, secured by crypto-currency. Thus, this will save you from the need to sell the crypto-currency, if you have an urgent need for money, and will allow you to use your portfolio without the need to sell it. Thanks to the economic model of NEO Finance, the value of the pledge asset is public and understandable to each participant in the transaction, and the terms of the loan itself are fixed in the detachment. Since the terms of this transaction are regulated by a smart contract, the solvency of the borrower, the assessment of the collateral, and the need to collect it from the borrower is no longer necessary. All this makes it possible to reduce financial costs, which in the traditional banking credit system are subsequently pawned in the interest rate on the loan.  The platform  NEO Finance offers an international platform in which participants have the opportunity to instantly receive a money loan with fiat money on bail of volatile crypto assets such as: • Bitcoin • Ethereum • Ripple • BitcoinCash  Receipt of credit funds can be carried out in the following ways: • In your wallet NEO Finance • With the help of a payment card NEO Finance, with the possibility of cashing in any ATM • Using the user's bank card (for an additional interest)  Eco-system  5.1 Term of the loan. The duration of the lien will be up to 1 to 12 months. At the end of the loan period, the deposit will be returned in full. Loan term is established personally by the borrower. 5.2 The system of remuneration for the provision of credit. The reward system is quite simple and easy to calculate. It consists of the percentage that is paid to the lender and a one-time fee for the platform. All fees are paid in advance by the platform token. 5.3 Interest rate. The interest rate is an average of 8% per annum, depending on the term and amount of the loan. It is fixed for the duration of the smart contract. 5.4 Platform remuneration. In addition to the interest rate that is paid to creditors, the platform once charges 2% of the total amount of loan funds paid to the borrower. 5.5 Return of loan. Borrowers can repay the loan at any time, during the entire term of the smart contract. Replenishment occurs through a personal cabinet or mobile application in any of the listed ways: • Payment card platform • Transferring funds to a crypto-wallet • Due to the partial sale of the security asset • Other crypto-currency assets at the market rate  If the borrower fails to repay the loan on time, part of the collateral equal to the amount of debt will be released and implemented by the platform to compensate for losses caused by the borrower's failure to comply with the terms of the smart contract. The remaining part of the collateral the borrower will receive back. 5.6 Participants in the platform. The borrower is a participant in the platform who has received a loan in a fiat currency, on the security of cryptocurrency assets. The creditor is a participant of the platform who has deposited money in a fiat currency to issue a loan to a borrower against a security of crypto-currency assets.  Diversification of risks  6.1 Diversification of creditor risks. To protect the lender from the loss of the borrowed funds, the platform provides the borrower with a sum of fiat funds comparable to 50% of the assessed value of the security asset. If the value of the collateral is reduced by more than 30%, the system will automatically notify the borrower and offer him three options for resolving the situation: • Make an additional deposit by crypto currency • Repay part of the loan with fiat funds • Pay off part of the loan due to a partial sale of the collateral. If the decrease in the value of the pledge asset is more than 40%, the system automatically sells the collateral, the amount necessary to cover the loan. The remaining crypto assets will be returned to the borrower. Monitoring of the definition and tracking of the break-even ratio of the collateral asset will be carried out by selflearning artificial intelligence on a specially developed platform algorithm. It will allow to determine not only the current break-even ratio of the pledge asset, but also to calculate it in advance, depending on the situation on the market. At the initial stage of the work of artificial intelligence, the break-even ratio will be calculated by calculating the percentage of the initial value of the pledge asset, relative to the present value of the same asset. In the process of platform development, the calculation of this coefficient will be carried out by analyzing statistical data on the current state of the market, based on the indicators of various financial instruments obtained through API-keys of exchanges. 6.2 Diversification of the borrower's risk. That the borrower could minimize the risk of his investment portfolio, which acts as collateral, he can do the following: • Make a pledge asset with a set of several crypto-currencies of different volatility • Set the maximum threshold for reducing the break-even ratio of the security asset, at which point the system will automatically sell the collateral, the amount necessary to repay the loan. Then it will repay the cost of the loan, and the rest of the collateral will be returned to the borrower.  Card    Each registered user is provided with a unique payment card. It provides a unique opportunity to withdraw cash at any of the world's ATMs, make instant on-line and off-line payments, at any outlets. (Where non-cash payment is available). The card has a unique design and technology PayPass for convenience of contactless payment. Instant SMS notification of the expense transactions on it, as well as the possibility of obtaining a cache of beaks in platform tokens, as a reward for using the card. To date, payment cards will work in the MasterCard payment system. The issuer of the cards will be banks, with whom agreements on intentions of cooperation have been previously concluded. The names of banks for commercial purposes were not disclosed. In the future, after developing the necessary software, a payment gateway and obtaining a PCI DSS certification, the issuer of payment cards will be our platform. The cards will work in VISA and MasterCard payment systems, as well as JCB for the Asian market.  A card account can be in one of the following currencies • USD • EUR • GBP • CNY • RUB  Cash-back The size of Cash-back is 1%, for purchases made in: • Stores of digital technology • Online stores • Cafes and Restaurants • Partner stores, the list of which will increase as the platform develops.  In addition, when shopping in partner stores, cardholders receive discounts of up to 10%. The received Cash-back is returned to the card in the form of platform tokens. You can use the accumulated tokens at your discretion.  The exchanger      Integrated into the platform, the cryptocurrency exchange system will allow users to instantly exchange Bitcoin, Ethereum, corrugation, Litecoin, BitcoinCash, NEFCoin, USDT, USD, EUR, GBP, RUB.  Trading platform    We follow the trends and classical methods of multiplying your funds. That is why, especially for participants who prefer to multiply their assets, we develop and integrate a platform for trading on the main capitalized exchanges through the API. The basis for the mechanical construction of the platform is the DASH algorithm for the Build template. The user can use the frozen lien as a trade balance. The withdrawal of profits from trade will be possible after repayment of the loan amount. Thus, the user not only retains profit from the potential growth of his asset, but also can multiply it. The rules for calculating the break-even ratio of the collateral are not changed. When the loan is repaid, the platform will automatically withhold a commission of 10% of the profits traded. We envisaged risks and took into account the algorithm for building a neural network with the subsequent integration of artificial intelligence. We have at our disposal a staff of BigData developers with a global experience of the AI market formation participation.  Token    NEFCoin (NEF) is a token created on the basis of the ETH standard ERC-20. The NEF token will be used in the system: • As a currency for the issuance of loan funds • Commission Fees • Receiving cash-back • Implementing transactions within the platform  NEFCoin (NEF) is required throughout the project to support ongoing development and operational requirements. All employees are rewarded in NEF tokens. The initial volume of tokens will be 1,000,000,000 NEF. As the platform develops, if necessary, an additional issue of tokens is possible.  Token distribution and financial model     11.1 Distribution of tokens • 20% - Pre-Sale • 41% -Token-Sale • 15% - Reserve Fund • 12% - The team • 5.5% - Bonuses • 3.5% - Bounty • 3% - Advisers  11.2 Financial Model The cost of the token is 1 NEF = 0.1 $ The volume of the minimum purchase is 1 000 NEF = 100 $ Unsold NEF will be frozen by the system. The withdrawal of the reserve will occur as the need for additional tokens appears as the platform develops and the money turnover increases.  Model of distribution of finance: • 35% - Development and maintenance of the platform • 27% - Marketing • 15% - Platform reserve • 10% - Development of strategic partnerships • 5% - Obtaining legal status and licenses  To implement the project it is necessary to achieve the following indicators: • Soft cap 23 000 000 • Hard cap 61 000 000  Holding an ICO The ICO period will be carried out in two stages: • Pre-Sale from August 22, 2018 to September 5, 2018 for this period will be realized 200 million NEF • Token-Sale from September 6, 2018 to September 30, 2018 for this period will be sold 410 million NEF  The minimum amount of attraction is 23 000 000 USD, upon the achievement of 61 000 000 USD the sale of tokens will be completed. Important! In the case of not reaching the Soft cap before the end of the ICO, all the funds raised will be returned to users in the previously acquired volume.  Roadmap    Team",True

Dear users, critics, current investors, potential investors. We are glad that you criticize and discuss our project, up to nuances and minor flaws. It is wonderful. You help us to improve and develop. And now our personal opinion: before launching the development of ICO and our project, we analyzed the market, from the current projects released to the stock exchange, to projects that decided to deceive investors by issuing a fraudulent fund-raising. At the end of the analysis - we made a decision and declare: ""We are not going to adapt to the system, we are not going to produce a project on a template, the same goes for the compensation program, stories about the personal life of our team and their achievements in society."" We gathered a circle of experts and experts capable of producing a really high-quality product and we will show Do you need this to show the quality of the team - do you need to know each member of this team personally? Or do we still look at the product itself? We are not going to involve most of the crypto-general in its implementation We believe that it is not advisable to declare publicly and demonstrate to the state authorities and the ordinary society their financial achievements and estates at the disposal of millions of dollars for the sale of the product, because in the first place - we must provide the product itself, our creation, our achievement. ""  1. Another random platform with crypto-fiat. We are well aware that to date there are several companies that have announced the creation of their own plastic card. This is explained by the desire to optimize and simplify the possibility of urgent transfer of funds without the participation of online exchange offices, which currently regulate the rates and interest for withdrawal, as well as exclude the possibility of fraud from the exchange office. Sometimes it is worth paying a fixed interest rate for the urgency of withdrawal in an ATM, rather than saving on nerves and emotions.  2. The short period of existence of pages of social networks, media sources and journalistic accounts is explained by the fact that we are of the opinion that there is no need in some cases for a public statement on the implementation of collection of such a scale of investment funds. To date, there are many precedents associated with public statements of the estate at the disposal of working capital (it does not matter whether it is a crypto currency or another kind of bank notes). Take as an example the fact: how do you think how many crypto-billionaires try to keep anonymous, because? can fall under further pressure from the state authorities of the country of their stay or the country of their business. No, we do not in any way claim that our team uses extraneous names, surnames, photographs and so on. We simply adhere to the rules of conducting a quality business that can lead our company to success and provide you with a developed product that can change the world and make it richer.  3. GITHUB. A linguistic error in the name of the company. This fact was checked and the relevant persons responsible for content and content were brought to disciplinary punishment! Thank you to our critics, for helping us improve! We appreciate it and perceive it as support!  4. As for our PR-manager, Jessica. To date, at its disposal more than 3 projects for implementation. Some of them require no time spent on participating in outside projects.  5. The name JOSEF is correct. The general manager of the company comes from the Czech Republic, the name is written without the use of the ""PH"" signs at the end.  6. NEF TOKEN: We are aware that earlier some companies announced the release of a similar (by name) token. Relations with him we do not have. Our goal: the early release of the token on the exchange, analogues at the moment for linguistics and the origin of the crypto currency in the market - no. We act like an ""Arms Race"", and we will take pride of place in the top 10 crypto currency. We are sure.  7. We have no relations with organizations with similar names dealing with a similar type of activity. all of them are on the territory of the traditional market, which has nothing to do with the market of crypto-currencies.  8. The early term of creating a website and registering a domain, we consider not an objective reason for identifying doubts. Initially, the project strategy and its further implementation plan are developed. Everyone has their own business model of development.  9. Andy Curtman is our freelance designer, with whom we have been working for more than six months. We published it in the section of our team, not so that you would check how competent it is in this matter, and first of all to show you our performers. This photo was published by him personally, and even if he has to do with the account in the instagram - for us it does not matter its origin, t. first of all we look at the quality of the product, which every member of our team controls.  10. Similarity of descriptions (2-3 sentences) with some sources on the Internet. Note that the wordings coincide in the description of the position of a specialist. Is it that the copywriter who prepared the text used a template, a ready source and did not pay 2 minutes for rewriting - is there something bad?  11. Regarding your opinion that you should not trust a company that used someone's photo: we do not consider it objectively and not applicable to our project. First: we analyze one photo. The answer was previously stated. Read above. Secondly: we did not call a special photographer to photograph the team on the same background and so on. We are all people and this is our desire, choose the photo on which we look best. Or are there any mandatory requirements for placing photos in the project?  12. Regarding the presence in the team of investors of early periods: how did the company take it that all investors publicly advertised sources of their investments and relations with the projects? Why should this be published somewhere?",True

The MasterCard payment system is by far one of the most widespread in the world and operates in most ATMs. Prior to obtaining the necessary licenses and developing a payment gateway, the issuer of the card will be the banks with whom relevant partner agreements are reached.
