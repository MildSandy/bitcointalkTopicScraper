ZEON Mission  ZEON Network is a foundation and community driving project. ZEON is solving the problem of ""Mass Adoption"" in crypto by enabling safe investment for everyday people. Expect a list of companies that will accept ZEON (flight tickets, gadgets, services, rent, travelling etc.).  The main difference between ZEON and other projects is that no one has been able to solve the issue of scams and insurance in the sector. Our goal is to guarantee safety and allow users to invest with minimal risk. Our mathematical model shows that we can reduce the risk of lost tokens by 85%.   ZEON ATLAS - SECURE INVESTMENTS IN ANY ICO/CRYPTO PROJECT WITH MINIMAL RISKS. YOU CAN CONTROL THE FUNDING.  NO.1 PLATFORM OF INVESTING THE SMART WAY TO INVEST  Build your crypto portfolio in minutes Buying and selling any token. Return on investment at any time Based on Ethereum smart-contact, DAO principal, no fees ZEON insure risks of scam by 80% by using oracle Hyperion The project receives a daily portion of funding Based on fair funding, when an ICO receive payments equal to their work done Payments can increase if work is completed on time and with the interests of investors and vice versa. The ZEON protocol is moderated with reliable data from Oracle Hyperion.  2 types of interaction with the ICO/crypto project: 1. ZEON tokenholders make secured purchases. 2. ICO/crypto project itself issues secured purchases. Once ZEON is purchased as a part of a particular ICO project, the user receives the tokens in the ZEON Wallet. This allows the project funds to be monitored and enables voting by both parties to either reduce or increase the daily financing of the team (DAO principle). Each user can be sure that their purchase is reliably protected by ZEON.  Secured purchases are possible with the ZEON main blockchain, smart-contracts, and Hyperion.

ZEON Wallet  It allows wallet holders to make deposits, exchange and send P2P on top of the ability to safely invest in crypto projects. There will be a function of safe P2P exchange where ZEON will be a guarantor of a transaction.  THE ZEON WALLET ADVANTAGES:  1. The ability to safely invest ZEON in crypto projects. 2. Google Chrome Application 3. Multi-asset (any block code compatible with the ZEON Wallet). 4. Direct integration with cryptocurrency exchanges as a payment gateway. 5. Built-in calculator with a conversion rate of coins and altcoins to ZEON in real time. 6. Decentralized and risk-free storage and sending of crypto assets (BTC, ETH, LTC, ZEON, any sub-tokens on Ethereum). 8. Full anonymity in the wallet, hiding balances and the history of transactions.   ZEON Masternodes  ZEON Erebus is a multi-level masternode system that encourages users to set up new nodes, save and buy ZEON to increase profitability.  1. Any node can become an Erebus masternode and a participant in a decentralized voting system. 2. Interaction: the ZEON wallet helps to communicate between masternode owners (except those who want to remain anonymous) forming communities. 3. There are 7 levels of the masternode;  1 000 000 ZEON - level 1: Tantalus 5 000 000 ZEON - level 2: Idmont + 3% 10 000 000 ZEON - level 3: Gration + 5% 25 000 000 ZEON - level 4: Ares + 7% 45 000 000 ZEON - level 5: Actaeon + 10% 90 000 000 ZEON - level 6: Chiron +12% 90 000 000 ZEON - level 7: Cronos + 15%  Shift to a new level occurs automatically.  4. Masternodes with dynamic IP address. 5. Low entry cost. The price of the ZEON masternode about $ 5000 at the initial price of the coin. 6. Set up in 1 click for all operating systems. 7. User-friendly interface. 8. Information and statistics. 9. Simplicity of participation; viewing offers, statistics, voting in 1 click. 10. Instantsend 11. Private send (split into different parts, at each stage a new one is selected, masternode mixing, mixing in advance) 12. Structure: Rates (45%) Masternodes (48%) Reserve Fund (6%) Charity: (1%) 13. Multi-node on IP 14. Compulsory rates 15. We use the Equilibrium algorithm to distribute payments between stakers and masternodes. These numbers may vary depending on the preferences of the community. So we can ensure a balance between the two types of network participants.  ZEON does not belong to and is not managed by any person or company, its network is protected by its users and their thousands of nodes around the world.  ZEON ERC20 + ZEON custom  MainNet: 2019 (masternodes).  Block size: 2 MB Block Time: 60 Seconds (Re-targeting every block)  PoS Stake Eligibility Min Input Age: 60 minutes Maturity Confirms: 101 confirms Wallet Status: requires wallet to be kept running & online or hourly Coin Emission Rate: max. 666 ZEON per block (always less due to burnt fees & unused treasury) Coin Supply Control: fees are burnt from coin supply.  Transaction Send Eligibility Minimum Confirm: 7 confirms Privacy Technology: Custom Zerocash Protocol Key Features: Custom accumulator check-pointing system 6% of the earnings from the mining goes to the reserve ZEON Fund (withdrawn from the masternode award fee) to provide user operations Minimum rate: 0,000001 ZEON The transaction fee tends to 0 and is sent to the ZEON Fund for the development of the platform/ecosystem.   ZEON TOKEN DISTRIBUTION  Initial distribution is 50 000 000 000 ZEON. After that there will be a persistent coin emission like Monero and Etheruem, meaning it will not stop like Bitcoin and some other coins will.  It was designed this way because ZEON doesn't have or need miners, so our rewards are paid to people hosting our network (masternodes), people holding the coin and securing the network (stakers), and people working to improve and promote ZEON (community).  It is a fully self-sustaining economic model which will function indefinitely. A perpetual coin emission does not mean we have an infinite supply or any other setup that would devalue the currency. As we will see in the inflation section, ZEON has one of the lowest inflation rates around.  In fact, by staking you cannot only offset inflation but you can earn for holding ZEON.  Demand of ZEON > Supply of ZEON  Soft Cap (Pre-ICO) ~ 2 000 000 USD (reached) Hard Cap (ICO) ~ 15 000 000 USD (11,23M reached)  DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS RECEIVED DURING PRE-ICO & ICO    _______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________  ICO LISTINGS SITES   _______________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________",False
