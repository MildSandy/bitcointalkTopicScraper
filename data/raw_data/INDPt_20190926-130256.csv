Significant number of platforms has been offering access to games after making a payment in FIAT. It means that this system provides the entertainment only if the user previously collected appropriate quantity of funds. In our opinion, in XXI century the entertainment should be widely available with simultaneous possibility to raise funds for next games. In every day playing we do not use the full potential offered by hardware of our computers. InDeep system uses the free computing power of the graphics card. Maximum hash rate is predetermined by the network. That principal does not exclude any user due to the computing power of the hardware. InDeep uses free GPU memory resources that are currently available. The lack of discrimination of users means that our platform is offered to everyone regardless the equipment. The players are also game users and INDP miners. Our cryptocurrency was specially created for the InDeep project. Therefore, InDeep, players will be able to combine the pleasure of playing games and profits.   InDeep Cryptocurrency   The INDP cryptocurrency will be based on a technology similar to DASH. Implementation of script X11 will increase the protection of the web and will provide the safety and anonymity of users. The decentralization and stability of InDeep will be granted by establishment of the master nodes. In total we offer 240 millions coins but 50 millions INDP will be generated in the genesis block. 40 millions we will give to our investors (1:1 based on tokens that they own) and 10 millions will be assined to development team. Therefore 190 millions will be mined by users.   The mining process   INDP is mined by using the unused computing power of the player's graphics card. In order to prevent unequality among users and differences in the hardware, customers have a restriction allowing them to use up to 7% of the maximum graphics card's computing power.   Ecosystem InDeep   Blockchain technology gives the access to anonymous, safe and extraordinary fast data transfer. The scattered structure is a guarantee that InDeep network will provide tremendous stability unachievable on the other platforms. The specific information about Game Client, Wallet, Master Node and Platform will be presented in our WHITEPAPER.

The thing is that probably it is a domain provider fault. Unless we fix it we will be forced to close the InDeep website for approximately 3 working days. Due to the fact that we start preICO campaign we will wait with the decision. We would like to apologize for these circumstances.,False
