ICO July 23 - Aug 10,"   Exactly. You can bet on any event with other CBET players or only with your friends (bet by password). But not only sport events. We are concentrated on wide range of bets.   The platform allows you to create three types of bets: Bet with a third party confirmation by Arbiter without automatic confirmation).  Bet with automatic confirmation by API (weather, sports events). Bet on the competition in games with PvP mode (Starcraft, Call of Duty etc).   Examples of bets third party confirmation (your Arbiter or CBET Arbiter): Who will drink more alcohol? Who is the first to go on a date with Mary? Who will reach faster to a certain point? Who is the first to pick up a girl at a bar? Who will be promoted this month? Who has it bigger?)   Example of bets with automatic confirmation  Weather You can make a bet with a friend or any person on a series of weather events: What will be the maximum temperature in the city X on August 12, 2017? The maximum temperature in city A will be more than in city B. Will there be rain this weekend in Alaska? What height or what speed will the waves reach in Soorts-Hossegor?  Cryptocurrency cost Work on the API occurs with several exchanges, so with a bet you need to choose one, the results of which will determine the choice. It is enough to choose the terms of the dispute, for example: Will the BTC price achieve a certain rate? What amount of turnover will be on a BTC/ETH pair on Poloniex? What is the size of the largest transaction from 08 to 09 PM on the Bittrex exchange for a BTC/LTC pair? How many times will Apple be mentioned in the NY Times articles for July 15, 2017?  And you can play one on one or a wall to the wall (in PvP mode) with a prize fund. StarCraft, WarCraft, World of Tanks, Call of Duty, Counter Strike and other games where there is a PvP mode.",False
