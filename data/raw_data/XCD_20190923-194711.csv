The list of problems facing current Cryptocurrency Exchanges is at an all-time high. We‚Äôre here to fix it.   The key problems: lack of user friendliness of exchanges for newcomers as well as seasoned traders, poor customer support, security breaches and stolen funds, slow website speeds and serverdowntime, unclear policies and hidden fees!  The solution: Capdax Exchange. Capdax Exchange addresses the major problems with a head full of steam, creating a unique user-friendly experience for new and experienced traders alike, and aligning ourselves with the most trustworthy, transparent and secure principles in the market.   So why Capdax over other exchanges?  Capdax Exchange is built on a state-of-the-art modern technology stack using best practices   from high performance web application and experienced developers from the financial sector.  We‚Äôve integrated a few key leading-edge tools that you won‚Äôt find on many other exchanges. Easy Mode, Expert Mode and a masterfully inventive Market Research Page are just a few of the tools that will help all our traders simply make better decisions.           Once again, why Capdax?  The innovative token functionality of the Capdax Token (XCD) separates Capdax from all other cryptocurrency exchanges. Built on a state-of-the-art modern technology stack, this leading-edge token model was designed to push the current state of exchange technology to a new level, with the ultimate focus being on you, the USER.   1. Users will be able to buy and sell Capdax Tokens (XCD) on the exchange (XCD/BTC)  2. The unique functionality of the XCD token is that each trading fee must always be paid in XCD tokens and not using the currencies that are being traded.  3. In the case that you do not own XCD tokens or you opt out of using XCD tokens held in your wallet, a market buy order for XCD tokens will be placed against the base currency and XCD will be bought to cover the fees. This will result in healthy and consistent trading of the XCD token.  4. 25% of the trading fees are collected in a pool that will be used as a reward, an incentive for everyone to hold the token on the exchange.

Welcome aboard!   Quote from: StuFF981 on January 31, 2018, 04:30:53 AM What other tools you will have on page, except Easy Mode, Expert Modeand a masterfully inventive Market Research?   On top of the tools you stated we will implement Social Trading. A function where you may allow friends and family to mirror your portfolio with a portion of their funds. This will minimize the amount of time you have to spend on contacting them and give a heads up every time you find something interesting to trade. It will also drastically reduce the amount of time the followers have to spend on educating themselves in Crypto. The primary benefit of being a Leader in the Capdax Social Trading program is the extra revenue generated via fees from the Followers.   We will focus on setting a new standard for Support. Easy-to-use ticketing system Fully-staffed and well-trained support team Fast resolution for login/account issues Fast processing of withdrawals  Customer service on current cryptocurrency exchanges is becoming a primary concern as exponential growth leads to an ever larger backlog of issues. User trust is eroded when there is no reasonable expectation that a support ticket will be resolved in a timely manner, especially for time sensitive issues such as fund withdrawals and inaccessible accounts. User funds are often locked up for months without any answer from customer service. In an emergency, timely access to funds is essential, and these issues must be handled as expeditiously as possible.   You will be able to Customize your Market Overview to easily see whats going on at the moment with your crypto, and the trading pairs you noted as interesting.   Also, important to note: Capdax will be an EASY-TO-USE exchange for newcomers in the ""Easy mode"", while in ""Expert mode"" we will provide a range of tools to allow seasoned experts the control they need.   For more detailed information I recommend you to read our WP. Link can be found at the top of our ANN.  Glad to see you all around, have a nice day!",False
