As regards to those that will have to be paid for, we will provide extensive previews. However, we might include the possibility of some sort of testing (the content of which should be prepared by the lecturers themselves, of course) but which should not be decisive as to whether the aspiring learner can take a particular course or not. Such testing should be more for informative purposes and for guidance.",False

We kept pondering that question ourselves. The problem is multifaceted, but it can be boiled down to two intertwined phenomena:  1. For the last 150 years, the system of higher education has basically remained the same, while the technological and scientific advancements and changes in the society have been enormous. Basically, the education has not kept up with all the changes around us.  2. The pace of technological advancement is not linear, but rather follows an exponential pattern meaning it is accelerating. As the exponential curve is in its beginnings slow (even slower than linear), one tends to notice its exponential nature only later on. These technological and scientific changes are of course reflected in more or less all the social institutions and the societal structure itself. The system of higher education as we currently have, has a structural problem - it is designed in such a way that simply cannot keep up with the all the changes that occur on annual and even quarterly basis.  However, this does not mean that everything with the higher education today is wrong. There are still some very good aspects, such as it provides a very robust basis regarding fundamentals of all sciences. That's why we would like to supplement and upgrade the current system - make it more agile. Our ambition is to bridge the ever widening gap between the market demands about know-how/skills and what the current education system is able to provide.",False

WHY WE'RE CHANGING EDUCATION?   The education ecosystem is changing rapidly with the arrival of new technologies enabling nano-degrees and micro-credentials and offering students and working professionals alike a way to bulk up their resumes with relevant knowledge and field-specific skills. The e-learning market size was estimated at over US$150 billion in 2016 and is predicted to grow at over 5% CAGR from 2017 to 2024. GLEDOS (Global Education Solution) serves a middle layer and plans to integrate top existing e-learning providers into a platform. On top of that, GLEDOS will build its own base of lectures, provided by professors/lecturers across the globe. GLEDOS tokens will be used for students to pay for the sessions.  2. PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT STATE  OF EDUCATION INDUSTRY  As stated in the Future of Jobs report published by the World Economic Forum, most of the existing education systems at all levels provide highly siloed training and continue a number of 20th-century practices that are hindering progress in today’s talent and labor market issues. Two such legacy issues burdening formal education systems worldwide are the dichotomy between humanities and natural sciences and applied and pure training, on the one hand, and the prestige premium attached to tertiary-certified forms of education — rather than the actual content of learning — on the other hand. Put bluntly, today there is simply no good reason to maintain either of these indefinitely. Businesses should work closely with governments, education providers, and others to imagine what a true 21st-century curriculum should look like.   3. SOLUTION: GLEDOS (Global Education Solution)  1. GLEDOS will shorten the education period from an average of 4-5 years to 1-2 years to get the first job, merely because student attended the lectures most suitable for a particular employer or business field. 2. The platform offers the opportunity to study globally, participate in high-quality sessions provided by top lecturers, and adjust the studying to their time preference. 3. Smart contracts are used to set the rules for businesses or governments to invest in learning (enabling a voucher-based financing system). 4. GLEDOS enables the students to build a learning plan with the support of AI as a combination of lectures across multiple universities or other educational programs. 5. The platform engages students with businesses in the early phases of studying to get valuable experience. 6. The student profiles are matched with the best-fit employers. 7. The blockchain is used to store students’ achievements. 8. GLEDOS offers a new level of partnership between educational institutions, professors, students, and businesses. 9. The new ecosystem motivates professors to deliver high-quality sessions and to improve in deprived or lower evaluated activities. 10.GLEDOS offers a new credential model to increase the students’ probability of getting work.   4. WHY BLOCKCHAIN?  Key features of blockchain used by GLEDOS are:  ● Smart contract is used for purchasing training hours – vouchers (tokens), defining the investment criteria (participation, passing score).  ● Achievement record is a collection of all student achievements, participation, and business interactions.  ● Anytime CURRICULUM snapshot enables students at any moment to prove their personal achievements and send them to their potential employers, even to businesses which are not part of GLEDOS.  ● GLEDOS token is used to pay for lectures, scholarships, mentorships, and for other investments.  ● Pay what you consume is the logic of payment with smart contracts based on actual consumption of a particular lecture (proportion payment).  ● The scholarship program uses smart contract logic – a commitment to receive a scholarship when specific criteria are met.  ● Security is fragmented data storage in an Ethereum based network with encrypted blockchain overlay security to store the achievements, currencies, and other GLEDOS activities.  ● Certification of content providers, professor accreditation, an educational institution with a license to operate and training centers.  ● Standardization enables increased interoperability between systems and allows data sharing and access.  5.

Unsold tokens offered to the public will be burned .  Get whitelisted - HERE https://kyc.gledos.io/ [/b]    7. GLX  TOKEN  GLEDOS token (GLX) will be the fuel of the platform, used by students, businesses, HR agencies, and content providers. It is an application-specific token (utility token), built on top of the existing Ethereum blockchain (ERC20 token), allowing us to give the users back the value of the GLEDOS learning solution.  To ensure the successful launch of GLEDOS, we secured 10% of tokens, which will be invested with the goal of attracting our first users.  When GLEDOS achieves critical mass, it will become self-sustainable with the collection of gas for GLEDOS token transactions. GLEDOS will continue to invest in new programs, new content providers, and businesses. Part of the income will be used for the continuing development, platform improvements, and scholarship programs.  The GLEDOS token will be used: ● As a subscription (gas) to use the solution ● As a payment from HR agencies to get the insights ● As a scholarship investment into blockchain related skills ● As a scoring for the top student, top lectures, and top talent matching   GLEDOS revenue model is based on earnings per transaction and selling the talent pool data.  8. TOKEN DISTRIBUTION   The Public Token Sale Contributors: GLX tokens will be distributed one week after the Crowdsale period expires. Bounties: GLX tokens will be distributed 1 month after the Crowdsale period expires. Company: GLX tokens will be vested over 18 months period with monthly vesting schedule starting 9 months after the Crowdsale period expires. Advisors: GLX tokens will be vested over 6 months period with monthly vesting schedule starting one week the Crowdsale period expires.

A total of 108,000,000 GLX tokens is to be distributed during the public token sale representing 60% of the total token supply. The pricing mechanism rewards earlier contributions with more GLX tokens in exchange for ETH. The token sale system is not time sensitive but rather supply sensitive. Each phase within the public token sale is set to distribute a limited amount of GLX tokens for a predetermined amount of GLX tokens effectively increasing market price discovery.  No more tokens will be minted after the ICO. Payment with ETH will be available. The USD/ETH exchange rate will be locked on the market exchange rate before the ICO start and will be valid for the entire period of the ICO.
