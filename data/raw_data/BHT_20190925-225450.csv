Over the past few months, we have received a unique experience and feedback from projects that have been hosted on our platform. Moreover, we overcame the mark of 30,000 registrations (now> 31,200).  News №1 Based on the received feedback and experience, it was decided to reduce the 7-level referral system to 3-level. That is, the distribution of tokens will now be distributed according to the following scheme:  1 level - 50% Level 2 - 30% Level 3 - 20%  News №2 Now the level of payment in the referral program will be determined before the start of voting. If now one more token is distributed to the referral program for each earned token, then after the introduction of changes this coefficient will be coordinated with the project being placed. This is one of the huge requests of all the projects that were hosted by us. We should respect and listen to the projects being placed, in order to create comfortable conditions for all participants of the platform.   Let's look at an example of how the referral program will be calculated after the innovations: 1. For example, the coefficient that the project is willing to pay into the referral program is 50%; 2. The performer completed the task and earned 300 tokens; 3. Another 150 tokens were generated in the referral program (50% of the earnings of the performer); 4. The person who personally invited the artist receives 50% of this amount under the new system, that is 75 tokens (from 150); 5. The person who invited the person who invited him, receives according to the system of referral remuneration 30% of this amount, that is, 45 tokens (from 150); 6. And one more superior receives according to the system of referral remuneration 20% of this amount, that is, 30 tokens (from 150).   ATTENTION! All updates will take effect on April 6, at 18:00 UTC  P.S. We reserve the right to regulate the system of referral payments, and we take such decisions primarily based on the adequacy and feedback from all participants in the platform (bounty hunters, organizers, projects). Undoubtedly, this decision leads to stimulating bounty hunters to be the most effective on their own and to carry more value for the projects being placed, rather than to rely on referrals. But for those who want to become professional organizers, it becomes possible to earn the most from the first three levels, this encourages them to invite people personally and form powerful teams!

Do u have calculations or maybe economic bases? In case of this project the value of tokens doesn’t matter at all. Have u read white paper? As 4 me, the tokens price at 1$ or 10$ or 0.1$ is reasonable. Because in the end of ICO ALL NOT SALE TOKENS WILL BE “Burned”.

For a more detailed introduction to the project and its purpose, we recommend that you read White Paper.  What's the point of me registering here if I can work directly with ICO? Answer: The main advantage of working with the Bounty Hunter project is the absence of a threshold for entry, when the absolute majority of ICOs put forward exaggerated demands on Bounty program participants. Also, we draw your attention to the fact that you are guaranteed to receive a reward for performing tasks. the token fund released on the Bounty program is frozen and can not be redistributed to other purposes.

Users who have registered and receive at least one star of the performer will receive a free annual subscription.  How are the rewards awarded? Answer: Rewards are accrued after the report is submitted and verified by the moderator.  When can I get my tokens?

How many comments / themes can I create in one forum, in one topic? Answer: One forum can use an infinite number of topics for publications.  I created the video, but I did not get paid for it or charged a little, why? Answer: Charging depends on the number of views and ratings of your video, if there are no people on your channel, then no one will look at it, so this material does not carry any usefulness  What kind of posts / topics are included in the test?
