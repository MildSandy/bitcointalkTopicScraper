I really like the style. The name of the project is also pretty great.  One (or more) of these gaming tokens will really take off. I can see it gaining huge traction with gamers that are fairly loyal to a specific brand - like Blizzard fans.

In terms of our own GameClient for our Indie Game Developers, we will deal the same way with cheaters as everyone does - They will get banned from the game they attempted to cheat on. Besides that, we won't have much influence on cheaters getting banned on Steam/Origin or such.  That process won't affect the price/value of our token too much, as it depends more on the transactions happening through our marketplace, so everything from trades/coaching/gamekeys/...  Feel free to join our Telegram and we can answer you all the questions in there aswell.",False
