In August 2015 their council in Caerphilly unanimously rejected mining company Miller-Argent’s proposal for a new open cast coal mine because of harmful pollution. But in January 2016, the mining company lodged an appeal with the Welsh Government. Now the community is trying to raise money to put strong representation at the Public Inquiry. They need £40,000.  “This community fought for four years to resist this proposal, which would see the company working right up to the doorsteps of the community for 15 years.” said Chris Austin of the United Valleys Action Group (UVAG), “this appeal has been hanging over us”.  In May 2016, as part of a worldwide outcry against fossil fuel expansion, citizens from across Europe gathered in the Welsh countryside and closed down the coal company’s existing coal mine for 24 hours. But as often happens in these situations, once the coal dust settles (in the lungs of local people and their children) business gets back to usual.      This resistance is mirrored in the United States where opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline is also reaching fever pitch. But here also, communities such as the Emery’s Rosebud reservation in South Dakota are relatively poor - many living below the poverty line.  “This is an example of the problem more generally”. said Fraser Brown the Founder of ACT, “Communities can make a gallant effort at creating noise and even stopping developments in their tracks. But eventually corporate power and/or State power outweighs their meagre resources. No more. ACT is the World’s solution to this imbalance of power - it can amplify citizen voice and it can drive resources at any speed and any scale from a global community to ensure that schemes such as Miller Argent’s do not go ahead”.  ACT, an Ethereum blockchain based social action funding platform, is powered by smart contracts, which facilitate a decentralized proposal curation and voting system. Its Founders and backers believe that it could revolutionise the NGO world, and are calling it “NGO 2.0”.  It has already raised $190,000 from 293 participants to build the Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO) on the Ethereum blockchain. It did this in just five days using a new decentralized crowdfunding method called an initial coin offering (ICO), which can only be funded with the Ether cryptocurrency. ACT’s “pre-ICO” started on Tuesday 18th July and runs until 1st August. ACT’s mission is to drive global change by supporting citizen action. It does this through a reliable, transparent and decentralized platform open to citizens worldwide.  Now ACT’s team has decided to support the United Valleys Action Group with a readiness grant as they prepare for a larger proposal on the ACT alpha platform which could be ready as soon as October 2017.  Chris Austin from the Welsh community group told the ACT community, “I hope you can all share in our eventual win when we drive-off this onerous scheme once again.”",False

This is because joganuts has really ""done the reading""!  It is a fact that a double whammy hit our pre-ICO:  1. The whole crypto community had just experienced a massive crash in price, which only hit a floor two days before our pre-ICO. 2. The day before our pre-ICO the CoinDash team failed to conduct their ICO securely and $7million was stolen in the first few seconds of their ICO.  Many of the comments are looking at the ""soft cap"" which was choosen purely to reflect the WINGS forecast of around 15000 ETH. The WINGS forecast is outside of our control but obviously we could not cap far beneath its median, and it seemed logical to soft cap above the median.  Joganuts points to a key project figure of €150k, which is the costing from draglet.com for delivering the six modules of the ACT platform by 18th January 2018 (and first 3 before 18th November). We published this costing and project plan, in fact.  At the time of writing, and with 12 days still to run, the crowdsale has raised $150k. What does this say about the project? It says that this project as as on as it could be. This is a pre-ICO struck by extraordinary circumstances outside of its control but which the project - though happy to engage with all the ambition promoted through WINGS and by others - has been able to weather due to its design, conservative approach, and planning.  So, relating to points 1 and 2 where are we?  ""2"" did not happen on ico.daoact.org obviously because it sits behind Amazon Web Servers and Cloudflare rather in some server (perhaps in some kids bedroom). ""1"" is now history. The rally has been strong and, if we are to be honest, the crash was expected and due.  What remains is the fact that the ACT project is 100% on track and that there remains the quite extraordinary opportunity to buy in at the 10x platinum rate. That means that if you do, your .1 ETH 1 ETH 10 ETH will secure as many ACT tokens as an ICO participant paying ten times that amount just four months from now.  Its up to folk like joganuts and other great people on this forum to keep doing the math. We are focused on the build now, but here to chip in where we can help.",False

It is clear that, although there are significant benefits for everyone from using these ""bounty portals"", the technology is early-stage and therefore some have experienced issues. We wanted to emphasise that these are not our tools, and that we appreciate the ongoing support offered by our amazing partners who operate them.  What we decided is that between now and August 1st, 2017 bounty participants using Twitter and Facebook can be assured that all contributions in the form of retweets, likes and shares on these platforms will be counted manually if needed. This will happen after August 1st. What we also decided is that those who have taken the trouble to contact us on any channel about an issue before now will receive a complimentary gift of 5000 ACT tokens. For the avoidance of doubt, this gift will be taken from a different pool than the social media bounty allocation and only applies to questions raised until now.  It will be difficult for us to respond to new questions about bounties until after August 1st, but you should still direct questions to the ACT bounty post on bitcointalk here. After August 1st we will look after all our partners and friends who supported us so generously with their time and energy!

The first layer is where citizens buy votes so that they can vote on proposals. This is the ETH that capitalises the ACT platform.  The smart contract pays a second layer (decentralised platform) 15% of all these revenues. This rewards curators of proposals and is distributed according to curation effort.  The ACT token is used to buy ACTION tokens which can only be vested over 1 year at monthly intervals. The amount of ACTION held and the curation effort determines how the 15% is distributed.  The more people use ACT globally, the more revenue it will generate and the more ETH will be paid to curators. You can see how the value of an ACT token is linked to the success of the platform, and its network size. You can also see how ACT and ACTION drive network effect.  I hope this helps, and welcome more questions and points of clarification",False

This said, we see ACT as quite fundamentally different from most crowdfunding both philosophically and practically. Think of a top up mobile phone - you don't top up when you want to send an SMS, you keep it topped up. So, in ACT people would keep their voting account topped up so they can react to proposals as they are pushed from the curation platform. You see, the votes applied to proposal are limited so the model depends on aggregate ""will"" if you like.

Ok, so the later point is good to address. This case study of ""Lena"" has become the focus of ""explaining"" ACT. Her story is the main theme of our explainer video, and many other narratives. As well as catching people's attention visually that this is a social cause, the other main reason to use it is consistency. We could have chosen a big systemic issue as a centre pin for the message, but this story of disabled access is just so perfectly pitched to what social justice is about at its core, that we just love putting it forward.  On the other points, you might be referring to the Avaaz platform that now boasts 44 million members from 194 countries, or Change.org, which claims over 178 million “people taking action” (it is actually a for-profit company that Forbes reported in 2012 had revenues over $15 million with 20 million members). These platforms are growing incredibly fast but they started life as digital signature gathering websites. Change.org became profitable by allowing petition makers to sponsor content, and Avaaz (a non-profit) now regularly fundraises for emotive causes handpicked by its elusive team. Both are centralised. What causes are promoted by each? Change.org - the one that pays most to sponsor its content, and Avaaz - the one that will grab the most subscribers attention. ACT is fundamentally different. The crowd decides absolutely everything in an entirely decentralised way, autonomously, immutably, unstoppably (if thats a word), and, above all, by consensus. There is a lot more we could say on this - am happy to do it here, or in pm.",False

Let me address those them as best I can:  > It's written that ACT members votes are “purchased” by donations of ETH (digital currency). in case ACT is interested in donations, why you are accepting any crypto currency or fiat why ETH only?  One of the interesting things about this space is that the user-friendliness of crypto is growing fast. By November this year, there could be many developments that influence what ACT Beta looks like. Its a great function of the community to help navigate every opportunity including this that you mention.  > Who will be in DAOACT -that will decide that project is valid or not? What is the policy for that?  This is the magic. Much of the white paper is devoted to describing the ACE (Act Curation Engine). ACT holders vet or curate proposals. ACT and ACTION (the vesting token) are reward tokens that incentivise accurate and thorough curation of proposals.  > Where are how the funds spending will be published or tracked by regular users? And I didn't understand as soon as me as member bought token spent it on the voice, in what currency the payment will be made? In tokens? in USD? and based on what exchange rate?  The great thing about blockchain is the transparency around transactions, but more details will come out during Beta development. Transparency is fundamental as you point out. When a quorum is reached the proposal maker is funded by the smart contract in ETH. But remember what you pay for votes is pooled and it is the crowd that decides how the aggregated funds are directed.  Hope this helps!",False

Also, please check out our ""meet the team"" video.  Token details  Token name: ACT What does this token represent: It is a reward token that governs the distribution of 15% of platform revenue to proposal curators (see white paper) Total supply: 10 billion ICO format: All ACT will be issued and distributed during the crowdsale (ICO)  ICO details:  A total of 10,000,000,000 (10 billion) “ACT Token” shall be implemented in the smart contract.    More about ICO details in the white paper  Roadmap  In January 2017, we built a prototype of ACT on the Ethereum testnet, and full specifications have since been developed based on the final ACT White Paper. These specifications - including fixed pricing for the smart contract development work (identified as milestones) - will be published prior to the pre-ICO. Furthermore, a smart contract that only allows pre-ICO funds to be drawn from a 3-4 multisig wallet in line with the defined milestones will be implemented. A full analysis of this ground-breaking approach will be published as an article shortly.   Pre-ICO and Bounties details  The ACT donation campaign has three phases:  Pre-ICO: 2pm CET 18th July 2017–1st August 2017 Pre-release access: Close of pre-ICO — 18th November 2017. ICO: 18th November 2017–18th January 2018.  Pre-ICO bonuses:  Platinum — 10x for first $250k Gold — 5x for next $250k Silver — 2.5x after $500k  Example: Donator “Sean” donates $100,000 on the first day of the pre-ICO (phase 1). Sean’s allocation of ACT Token at the ICO is therefore 10x his donation i.e. $1,000,000 worth of ACT Token.  Pre-ICO conditions  Please note: Platinum and Gold bonuses reduce by half (to 5x and 2.5x respectively) after the half way point of the pre-ICO (25th July at 17:00 CEST)  Pre-ICO limits  pre-ICO soft cap—  to be decided after WINGS.ai price forecast event ICO cap — to be decided after WINGS.ai price forecast event (before the pre-ICO) and announced prior to the commencement of fundraising. Individual donation cap for the pre-ICO — $150,000.  Act token price = Total amount fundraised / 80 billion tokens   For complete details about our pre-ICO event please see this Medium post  Distribution of Rewards  Signature campaign - 10% (20,000,000 ACT) Slack / Telegram / Newsletter - 5%   (10,000,000 ACT) Blog posts, articles and videos campaign - 30% (60,000,000 ACT) Translations - 5% (2500000 ACT) Social networks - 15% (30,000,000 ACT) Miscellaneous - 30% (60,000,000 ACT)  More details of our bounty campaign will be announced shortly. Signature campaigns will commence on July 1st, and run for one month.   What are you trying to achieve?  ACT is a decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) that supports the “enabling elements” of citizen engagement  - conditions that affect the ability of state and citizens to engage in systems of social accountability – including the freedom of citizens to associate, their ability to mobilize financial resources to fulfil the objectives of their coordinated actions and/or organizations, their ability to formulate, articulate and convey opinion, their access to information (necessary for their ability to exercise voice, engage in negotiation and gain access to resources), and, the existence of spaces and rules of engagement for negotiation and public debate.  What is the societal problem being addressed?  ACT seeks to boost the enabling elements described above and associated conditions in support of citizen action. The societal problem being addressed is social accountability, which is the extent and capability of citizens to hold the state accountable and make it responsive to their needs. ACT’s objective is to address the imbalance of power between state action and citizen action. Citizen engagement can be defined as the interplay of five constitutive elements: state action, citizen action, information, citizen-state interface, civic mobilization.    It is helpful to consider some hypothetical examples of the interplay at work:  Example 1: The rights of Maria Dzuba’s disabled daughter The ACT white paper, website and explainer video all use the hypothetical example of Maria Dzuba from Minsk, Belarus to help explain the what and why of ACT. In summary, Maria’s 8 year old daughter Lera is disabled and local government refused to repair the elevator in her building for budget reasons. Belarusian law allows for a petition to be raised to create a “public letter” which can be considered. Maria asks the ACT community for $200 to fund her campaign.   Example 2: A journalist detained and in need of legal support Sometimes when civic mobilization occurs within a hostile political system, the independent media that seeks to cover the story can get into hot water. For example, a cameraman could have his/her equipment confiscated and he/she could be detained by the police. In this instance, the person urgently needs the best legal support. ACT could support such an intervention, and even fund replacement equipment!  Example 3: Communities fighting coal mining expansion in the United Kingdom Local communities around the world are fighting open cast coal mining that is harmful to their health and the wellbeing of their children. In some places such as Wales in the UK, expansion plans threaten to drive other existing and new employers from the area who do not want to be located where such health concerns exist. Such local action inevitably ends up weighing heavily financially on communities that initiate them. Consequently, they can ill afford to maintain them let alone expand them in line with the potential for real impact and change.  These case studies are elaborated upon within the white paper  How is success measured?  ACT’s theory of change is described as follows:   ACT at Berkeley University, and other events and media  Top: ACT at Ukraine Meetup; Bottom left: ACT at UC Berkeley; Bottom right: with friends from WINGS and Zurich's Smart Valor in Munich   Enough Thoughts and Prayers.

Shortly, it will release the quotation from Draglet for building the three main components of the DAO, with milestones. This will come in around €150,000 and will be made public. The donation campaign agreement will note that the project can raise additional funds if the pre-ICO does not raise enough, and a provision will exist to refund participants. Of course, there is also the option for the Founders to continue to fund it. The reason for not setting a hard cap in a smart contract that could trigger a repayment if, for example, it fell $1 short, is that at this stage of funding there are so many routes to getting to the ICO. We intend for this to be an open dialogue, and the decision will rest with the question of viability.",False

You might be interested to compare the models of Avaaz and Change.org. One is non profit and the other for profit. For us, sustainability of ACT is all-important. We feel that it should not be an organisation looking for handouts (and paying a large team to find them!). Would love to discuss this more with you, and thank you for making such an insightful point. It might also be interesting for you to review the white paper where you will see the discussion around the price of votes. The initial price we are considering is 10 cents, which most can afford. ACT will achieve scale through aggregate support of the many.",False

Please dig into the white paper and contact us if you want a deeper dive. The ACT Token is critical in this true DAO. Like with Steemit it is the unit of account for another vesting token ACTION, which curators must convert to in order to secure curation rewards. That discourages speculation, and ensures curation that is the longterm interest of the platform. Because ACT help govern how curation rewards are distributed, and 15% of platform revenues are used to reward curators, as the platform grows in scale so the amount available for curation rewards increases. Its a big topic, and we prefer to use white paper as the reference point. Happy to continue this discussion!",False
