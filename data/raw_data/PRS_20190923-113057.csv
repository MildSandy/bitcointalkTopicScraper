However, if you want to know the answer to this question, then it is the following: when you send the ETH or BTC, participating in ICO, in return you get tokens of the current Project.  Advantage is that you get them before the rest. Therefore, when a token is released to the exchange, you can put them on sale at an excellent price and thus earn on the difference between your purchase and your sale.
