I am BPT token holder and will continue to be, for the good and for the bad. They have a great user friendly product(already running) and they also have the first mover advantage etc... Please, we need to differentiate between a scam and a running company(with office, team, product) that doesnt have enough capital to develop the daily activity. This means that once they do have this capital, everything will start again with that available capital, stronger partnerships or maybe even another company that adquires BPT. It has more sense to say that than say that BPT is a scam. We come from a bear market, and lot of companies run out of funding, that doesnt mean that they are scams, only that they need investors to continue with the activity. BPT, in my opinion, will be one of those that will get easily good investors. Its current price is 0.007$ for a company that came out of ICO and only lived through a bear market... I personally see it as a great opportunity to buy now, risk/reward ratio is huge, you can get a HUGE ROI on this rigth now. Lets say you decide to risk 250$ only, you could buy about 30.000BPT. In the worst case you lose 250$, and in the good??? You get a huge return. All of this, having in mind once again, that there is product, there is team, there is community, there is users, there is office etc...There is no money?OK, how much time will a big company with a lot of capital take to invest in a company like BPT and risk a little part of their portfolio on Blockport?

They also admitted that Q3 2019 they would announce something about what theyve decided about BPT's future. Look, Imnot BPT lover at all, first of all because Im not emotional in terms of crypto, or I try not to be. I Just said to main things:1)that its definitely not a scam like many people were saying. A scam runs away with your money. BPT said the things to face, admitting that they are passing through capital problems, like thousands of companies in the history of the world, that years after are covered of gold. Apart of this they have a runningproduct,office,existing team and users etc a scam company doesnt...that has a value to the eyes of any investor who wants to divresify their portfolio and buy BPT or part of it. 2) As an BPT coin holder to my eyes it looks also an attractive opportunity, I believe that without risking so much money you can potentially make huge gains IF positive feedback is given from Core team memebers. Is it risky? Yes a lot, like everything in crypto. BUt high risk=high reward, and here potentially I see possible big gains. If you want to buy in one year or not buy at all, I dont care. The fact is that you never know if price will boom in 2 months or in 12, or even if it will boom. It could be that the company disappears and nobody finally invests, but the core team offically said that they are studying different options and Q3 they will pronnounce themselves, and in the meanwhile even if operations will be paralized, they will maintain product improving. To my eyes it is a company that goes to the face and says the truth, which means that to my eyes is a good idea to put 100$-500$ into it, having in mind that product is there the same that it was 1 months ago, but more than 10 times cheaper. NO financial advice and no buying recommendation, Its only what i will do, because even if they have no money, apparently they are going with the truth; if what they said again is true in the next months someone will invest in BPT and then price could bounce drammatically. If by any case Im wrong(which could also be) then I will lose 250$, but I will lose them happily, because Its the sweet spot to get behind a project....when there is fud all over, no money and anything. BUt there is a promise from the team in getting back to us Q3 regarding posisble investors, and that for me is worth risking a little of money, ROI can be drammatic, if not I lose 250$...As I said, for me worth the risk IN THIS CASE...        Future of Blockport As a responsible but unfortunate measure, we have decided to drastically scale down our operations and development. Running our operations and platform as-is without a substantial investment is currently not an economically viable and responsible option.  Though we will not stop passionately pursuing Blockport’s goals and vision, the current situation requires us to take the platform offline at the end of this month and the core team of Blockport will focus its resources on developing the platform in stealth mode. At this point Blockport is not able to generate sufficient revenues to support a full scale operation and therefore, we will now focus on expanding the platform with unique and value-adding technological features, that strengthen our business case for a potential future restart.  We are already in touch with several parties that have shown interest in supporting a restart of Blockport in the future. However, the form or business structure is still unknown and subject to ongoing negotiations.  The interface and overall platform of Blockport have proven to be very effective in terms of conversion rates and overall user experience, and we plan to strategize around this unique selling point in future plans.",False

At Blockport, we make sure to provide our community with regular, weekly updates on our team’s progress, and on the progress of our cryptocurrency trading platform (Sign up for our weekly update here).  Now, we’d like to zoom out for a change and provide you with a view of the bigger picture:    What have we achieved in 2018, and what’s coming next?  Cryptocurrency listings  When our platform first launched, we humbly began with the listings of a few leading cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ripple.  Over the past few months, we’re happy to have added EOS, IOTA, NEO, Aelf, Tron, BPT and Zcash to our platform, which resulted from the integration with three leading exchanges.  Many of the teams from these currencies have been greatly supportive, and we’ve engaged in marketing partnerships, announcement collaborations and cross-community AMAs that have helped to grow our own ecosystem and community.  With 12 cryptocurrencies now live on the platform, we’re looking forward to continuously grow this list over the upcoming months.  If there are any specific currencies you’d like to see on our platform, be sure to let us know in Telegram!    The Blockport Token  Our very own Blockport Token, BPT, has recently also been listed on our trading platform. Users can buy and hold BPT in order to qualify for a discount on trading fees. Find out more.   Blockport’s Referral Program  Our Referral Program is live! Users can now earn 10 Euros for inviting friends and family to use Blockport. The Rewards Program is two-sided, meaning both the existing user (referrer) and the new user (referee) will receive a 10 Euro bonus in BPT. Find out more about the Referral Program.   FIAT Gateway Withdrawals  The current Blockport version allows users to make direct trades with Euro and other leading trading pairs.  This includes instant iDeal payments for Dutch users, SOFORT payments for other European citizens as well as bank wire transfers and Revolut payments for UK users. These different payment gateways enable fast access to the platform and immense ease of use.  Following this feature, it took time to ensure the converse functionality: Euro withdrawals. With security as a primary focus, we’ve been able to ensure that users can safely and smoothly withdraw the Euros in their Blockport accounts directly into their bank account.  This feature has now been finalised and activated, meaning users can now deposit and withdraw Euros in and out of their Blockport accounts.  Euro withdrawals also go hand in hand with the upcoming feature of BTC deposits, as it allows users to sell their crypto holdings in exchange for Euros directly on the Blockport platform.   Knowing our Customers  From the start, our team has been committed to building KYC and AML processes that not only adhere to the regulatory frameworks around cryptocurrencies, but that also provide our users with a frictionless and hassle-free signup experience.  Despite this making our product more complex (both for users and for our development team), we’re happy to have taken it upon ourselves. The outcome of this approach reflects in the ratio of users that go from signing up to actually trading - a metric which we’re pleased with.   The Blockport Academy  With the goal of facilitating a wider-spread understanding of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, the Blockport Academy is our own user-learning platform.  The Academy explores the history of cryptocurrencies, the meaning of ‘distributed ledger technology’, and a broad range of other interesting and informative learning materials about the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. It’s an ideal introductory platform for anyone looking to broaden their knowledge about blockchain and cryptocurrencies, or for someone looking to impress their friends at an upcoming dinner party.   The Blockport team  Acknowledging product development only makes sense if we also acknowledge the people development that goes along with it.  At Blockport, we’ve grown from a core team of 5 to a core team of over 25. All in all (freelancers and remote team members included) we’ve brought together a group of almost 40 talented developers, designers, data scientists, marketers, cryptocurrency experts and platform specialists. We are proud to see how well the team has developed itself in such a short and turbulent time!    The Blockport Community  At Blockport, we treat you, our community, as an extension of our team - including you where possible in product development, and making sure to always keep you updated with our latest news.  With an active Telegram channel and a dedicated team of community managers, we’re proud to be continuously sparking meaningful discussions amongst our growing community, despite the the market conditions - and we’re grateful for the role that our community plays in Blockport!  What can you expect from Blockport in 2019?  With the new year at our doorstep, we are preparing ourselves to further expand the Blockport platform with both small and large upcoming features that allow our users to take part in the new digital economy with even greater ease and safety.  In the short term, think of cryptocurrency deposits, additional fiat currency (USD, GBP) deposit methods and trading pairs, additional listings of crypto assets, social trading features and developing our own internal matching engine.  In the long-term, think ‘decentralising’ specific components of our trading platform to combine the best of both worlds - realising a hybrid-decentralised platform.  As part of our 2019 growth trajectory, we’ll be opening up the platform to users outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).  This will mean that users from around the globe (apart from certain countries) will be able to use Blockport and join our community of users.  Just like with our current users, we’ll continue to make our product roadmap as inclusive as possible - letting our users help determine which features they’d like to have built, or which currencies they’d like to have listed.  Having integrated our platform with multiple traditional banking partners since our inception, we’ve experienced first hand the many barriers that still exist between everyday people, the traditional world of finance and the new digital economy of cryptocurrencies. Therefore, our 2019 roadmap includes building additional solutions to better facilitate the move to cryptocurrencies across the board, starting with fiat-to-crypto transfers. More on this will be shared in the new year.  Next to our product roadmap, we are also in the process of raising our first round of equity investment to fuel our growth in the coming years. Expect an update on this in January.  All in all, Q1 of 2019 will be a very exciting time for Blockport, with many upcoming milestones in the pipeline to look out for.  To find out what else we’ll be getting up to, have a look at our live roadmap.   Product Hunt launch  Our full platform release is coming up, and we’ll be running a launch campaign on ProductHunt - a leading platform to discover new tech projects and products.  For now, please create an account on ProductHunt and follow us to get notified directly when we launch officially. We’d greatly appreciate it if you could help upvote our launch on ProductHunt.   A final reflection  Overall, 2018 has been a year of immense growth for us. Without trying to seem one-sided however, we have to acknowledge that this growth has been met constantly by immense complexity, sometimes chaos, and always a challenge. For helping us overcome the hurdles we constantly face, we’re grateful to the incredibly supportive Blockport team, the Blockport community, and everyone else that’s helped to get us to where we are today.  Wishing everyone a happy holiday and a successful 2019!   Until next year,  Zowie, Sebastiaan & Kai",False

Next to Bitstamp, we are very excited to announce that we will be officially integrating Bitfinex as a second external exchange. This means that we can list a broad range of new coins and tokens to our platform in the upcoming months!  In total, Bitfinex supports 90+ crypto tokens and coins with high liquidity, which can potentially be added to the Blockport platform.  The listing process will be gradual and dependent on numerous factors such as legal, regulatory and marketing strategy. We are very much open to get in touch with all projects that have their coin or token listed on Bitfinex, so that we can thoroughly plan their listing on Blockport.  Increased deposit limit  In line with the Bitfinex integration, we are also happy to confirm that our deposit limits will be raised from 2.500 EUR per user, to a monthly limit of 50.000 EUR per user once the Bitfinex platform is integrated. This will greatly open our doors for larger traders to use the Blockport platform!  Blockport future roadmap  Despite the recent decline in the crypto markets, extremely exciting times are ahead of us, and we are continuously improving the usability and functionality of our product. Keep an eye on our roadmap to stay up-to-date with our progress.  Apart from the Bitfinex integration, we’re currently working on the first version of our ‘social trading’ features, native BPT/EUR trading pair, credit card support and many more functionalities.  Additionally, we’re also preparing our internal listing policy to accept future listings of new tokens and coins on the Blockport platform. More info will follow soon.  About Blockport  Blockport is an easy-to-use cryptocurrency exchange that bridges the traditional world of finance with the new digital economy of cryptocurrency.  The Beta that is live now, allows you to buy, sell and exchange the five leading cryptocurrencies directly with Euro. If you haven’t signed up for an account yet, you can start trading immediately here!  The Blockport’s native token (BPT) allows users to pay for discounted trading fees (Binance model) and ‘social trading’ features directly on the platform.  BPT is currently only available on KuCoin’s exchange, but can soon be purchased directly on our platform with Euro.

Apart from that, we’ve been working on the following:  Refining and developing BPT’s utility for discounted trading fees.  Improving the platform’s trade order system, making the order-execution faster and safer for our users.  Building additional infrastructure that allows us to integrate with multiple exchanges in a faster, more efficient, and more robust way.  We have been testing crypto deposits on the platform, isolated to Bitcoin within our test environment (for now).  Improvements to the trade order form so that it will be easier to understand for novice users.  We revisited the copy (text) of our onboarding flow. It will soon include proper explanations of why we need certain things that we ask for (like ID and address), and guide users to their first trade once they’re in the app.  On a non-technical front, we have been preparing for our next community meetup, set for the 23rd of November. Find out more about our next event, hosted in Amsterdam, here.  We have held another biweekly AMA session where our CTO Zowie and DevOps Engineer Maksym answered all of your questions.

Influencers reviewing the platform and sharing their experience.  We noticed that the instalment of the VPN caused unwanted hassle for every Beta user so far, therefore we have decided to not invite any influencers before we go live next week.

The Blockport project is now officially live for six months and a lot has happened since January this year. After a half year in existence, Blockport managed to do a successful fundraising that sold out within 12 minutes, expanded the team from 8 to 35 people and built a working fiat-to-crypto exchange that is easy-to-use on mobile and desktop.  Blockport aims to become a social crypto exchange that will eventually be built on a hybrid-decentralised architecture. The social trading features will enable users to follow or copy each others portfolio or trading activities and turn Blockport into a knowledge-sharing platform where BPT can be used to pay for these premium features.  The hybrid-decentralised architecture allows us to trade on multiple external exchanges while storing users' funds on the blockchain. This way Blockport can access liquidity from external exchanges and securely settle it in a decentralised way.  Product roadmap  Right after we launched the first version of the Blockport platform we also announced a new way of communicating our product roadmap. This new roadmap visualizes the product features we are currently working on, and plan to release within the next three to six months.  The following exciting features are being added to the platform soon: - A second exchange that allows us to add a significant amount of new trading pairs (most probably this will be Bitfinex or Binance) - A first version of the social trading features (trader profile page where you can share your trading results with the community or social media and earn BPT as a reward) - Add credit cards as a new payment method with additional fiat currencies (Visa, Mastercard, American Express)  Despite all these milestones and exciting new developments we noticed that the sentiment among BPT holders has decreased recently. Therefore we would like to take the opportunity to explain the Blockport token's utilities and future value for us as a company and the community.  BPT's Social Trading Utility  Blockport aims to become a social cryptocurrency exchange that combines the aspects of trading, knowledge-sharing and social media in one easy-to-use platform.  The social trading features that are developed within the next six months will enable users to follow or copy each other's portfolio or trading activities, where BPT is used as a means of payment.  Everyone can ""open-up"" their Blockport profile to other people using the platform and invite others to start following them in return for an X amount of BPT. As a lead trader you can set the amount of BPT that you wish to receive from followers.  Being a lead trader, you can share your trading activities, performance, strategy and portfolio with your followers and earn BPT as a reward. This way, beginner traders can learn from experienced traders and experienced traders are incentivised to share their knowledge with beginners.  To clarify, the social trading features are especially interesting for (professional) crypto influencers that have a large following on social media, because Blockport will offer them a platform where they can directly earn BPT by sharing their trading strategies with their followers. This way we are bringing together social media and finance on one single platform.  To summarise quickly: If more users want to use the Blockport Social Trading features to follow their favourite crypto influencer or professional trader this will drive the demand for BPT.  BPT's Discounted Trading Fees Utility  The Blockport token can also be used to pay trading fees at a substantial discount. This feature will be built in natively. The exact discount amount is yet to be determined.  BPT's Higher Limit Utility  On the Blockport platform there are deposit and withdrawal limits. If you are a BPT holder you will be rewarded with higher limits for your account. Currently, we have a first implementation of the concept where you can send a small amount of BPT to proof that you have BPT to be able to unlock the tier 2 verification, which allows for higher deposit limits. In the future, the higher limits utility will not be based on a one time fee but instead will require you to hold a minimum balance of BPT on your account if you wish to have higher deposit and withdrawal limits.   Blockport token shop  As described in the white paper we have allocated an amount of BPT that can be bought by users on the Blockport platform in the token shop. This token shop will be temporarily implemented to enable users to buy BPT while the internal exchange is still in development. The token shop allows users to buy BPT directly on the platform so that they can seamlessly use BPT for the platform's premium features during the development stage.  BPT can be bought in the token shop with Euro directly on the Blockport platform. The price will be slightly above the average market price, to protect current BPT holders. Once the internal exchange is implemented we will dismantle the token shop and offer multiple markets for BPT natively on the platform.  BPT Referral fee  Just like PayPal, Uber and AirBnb, we will reward everyone who successfully invites new users to sign up for the Blockport platform. The referrer will always receive his referral fee in BPT.  BPT Listing fee  Currently, Blockport's coin listing process is limited by the trading pairs that are supported by the external exchange we currently integrate with. Once we integrate the Blockport platform with multiple external exchanges and/or have our own internal exchange up and running (work in progress, see roadmap for more info) we intend to have a listing process for new coins and tokens on our platform. Blockport envisages only accepting listing fees paid in BPT.  Conclusion  The token shop and utilities described above should strengthen the direct link between Blockport's performance and BPT. Blockport intends to integrate BPT with the platform to the fullest extent possible.  *As the platform is in full development and we cannot predict the future, we may later decide to alter the functionalities and utilities described in this article.",False

We are dependent on the 3rd party tool that we used to facilitate this contest. Their team is working on it but could not provide a definite time yet. We are aiming for end of this week. Apparently, it was not built for 1+ million contestants. (we are the biggest campaign they ever had including the campaign they did for Bruno Mars). Therefore, we don't have an exact time estimation yet since technicalities are blocking us to do proper validations on users. We will give an update when we have more information.

When we plan to “open” the Beta this basically means that we are opening the 1.0 release, since the features offered are identical (even three coins more than anticipated).
