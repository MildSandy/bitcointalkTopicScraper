We would like to make a statement, that no USA (including all territories of this country) residents are allowed to obtain BALT tokens and participate in Baltic.fund campaigns, and here is how we eliminate them from taking part:  1. As a first step, everyone, who would like to join our community, no matter whether this person wants to purchase tokens or participate in our bounty campaign has to register at our website and sign the Terms between our company and himself/herself. Simply reading our Whitepaper is not enough. The only legal agreement between us and the token holders are Terms of Use, every participant of our ecosystem must register at our website, read and accept the Terms, otherwise he is not allowed to take part in any Baltic.fund activities.  It is clearly stated in our Terms of Use, that no USA (including all territories of this country) residents are allowed to obtain BALT tokens.  2. But that‚Äôs obviously not enough, that‚Äôs why we run KYC procedures on every person, who is registered at our website. Our KYC policy is very strict (and recently we explained why)and the KYC is mandatory for every token holder, no matter if a person purchased the tokens or receive them for the participation in our bounty campaign. In case, we have any doubts, we run additional KYC (including, but not limited to a video call with this person), and in case we still have doubts, we ban this person from receiving our tokens.  We take all these measures to be sure, that we comply with all the laws and regulations.  Also, we would like to point out, that our Whitepaper, Summary and other materials, including the articles on how our platform works, are advertising materials, and they don‚Äôt explain the legal regulations between us and our token holders. We oblige our community to read and agree to the Terms of Use.  In conclusion, we would like to add, that as it is stated above, there is no possibility for USA (including all territories of this country) residents to purchase, obtain, or somehow recieve BALT tokens.  https://medium.com/@baltic.fund/regarging-nasaa-international-crypto-crackdown-66e2849c6262",False

Firstly, we pre-select the most promising startups out of thousands. We use an AI-based analysis tool to narrow the list, but the final preselection is up to industry experts. The platform offers the investors, which startups to support, based on their investment background, personal preferences, and exit strategy. The platform manages the whole acceleration process and paperwork, offering the investor weekly results of the acceleration. During the last 4 weeks of the acceleration, startups are introduced to matching seed/A-round investors worldwide. The early investors decide either they convert their options or sell them to the seed/ A-round investor(s) and exit. The platform offers the investors recommendations and projections based on predictive analysis, AI and experts opinions.  So, what it has to do with the ICO?  Acceleration program costs a certain amount of BALT tokens for each startup, depending on the startup score. We sell these tokens to investors during our ICO. Investor uses these tokens to fund a startup(s) acceleration. Startup(s) offers investor (s) an option, which can later be converted into equity share or sold to the next investor during the seed funding round.  How does the blockchain fit here?

First of all, you are right, there are more opportunities for startups in big cities: community, events, accelerators, mentors, etc. However, I can name several examples, when a startup from relatively small town became a global leader (check Ultimate guitar from Kaliningrad, Russia) and, also, when a small city started to develop infrastructure for startups and talents and became a local startup hub (check Tartu in Estonia).  I believe, what really matters, is not the town, where the startup was born, but the team and idea. But startups that are launched in bigger cities have more competitive advantages from the very beginning.  Partly, our platform will solve this problem for startups from small cities: they will be offered an online acceleration, which means that they will have nearly the same opportunities like startups from big cities, but online: mentorship, community, acceleration programs, access to funding.",False

This article is very important, please, check it.  How our smart-contract worked before: BALT tokens from our wallet were automatically sent to every person who completed the KYC, was approved by our KYC team, and purchased tokens.  What were the problems: 1. Exchange wallets owners experienced problems with receiving tokens. Despite we warned our supporters, that tokens should be purchased from Ethereum wallets only (like MEW), we still received quite a number of transactions from exchange wallets. What happened after, is that tokens were lost at their way (and, sometimes, even the payments were lost and we had to deal with the exchange customers support), because they were sent back automatically. 2. Complaints about KYC, the majority of our users wanted to make a payment in order to ‚Äúreserve‚Äù tokens, and complete the KYC afterward. 3. No opportunities for Bitcoin owners.  Important notice! Everyone, who already purchased our tokens‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou have nothing to worry about. We have the list of all your wallets, so new BALT tokens will be transferred to you during the next 24 hours.  Also, the pre-sale period is extended to March 26, 2018, so you will have enough time to buy tokens.  So, how it works now after we deployed new smart contract.  We changed the order of actions for KYC (but we still require it).  You still have to do the KYC to receive tokens, but now you have an opportunity to pay for the token first and to complete KYC during the next 90 days.  So, how it works now: 1. You complete KYC, you are eligible to buy our tokens, your profile is confirmed. We sent BALT tokens to the Ethereum wallet from your website profile. 2. You complete KYC, you are not eligible to buy our tokens. You get notified by the e-mail and in your profile, and we make the refund. 3. You don‚Äôt complete KYC in 90 days. We will remind you every week, that you have to complete the KYC, however, if you fail to upload 2 documents and fill in 6 fields in 90 days, you won‚Äôt receive tokens and we won‚Äôt make a refund.  We added new payment methods and the tokens are sent manually now.  1. You have Ethereum wallet. The simplest case for both‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou and us. You register on the website, purchase the tokens, complete the KYC and we send tokens back to your wallet.  2. You have exchange wallet. You register on the website, choose ‚Äúexchange wallet‚Äù as a payment method and follow the instructions. After you complete the KYC, you still have to add any ETH wallet to your personal account on baltic.fund, so we could transfer BALT tokens to you.  3. You have Bitcoin wallet. You register on the website, choose ‚Äúbitcoin wallet‚Äù as a payment method and follow the instructions. After you complete the KYC, you still have to add any ETH wallet to your personal account on baltic.fund, so we could transfer BALT tokens to you.  4. You want to pay in EUR/USD. That‚Äôs fine, many of our investors, especially funds do this. Contact us at support@baltic.fund with the topic ‚ÄúToken purchase‚Äù and you will be redirected to the right guy.

Our CEO, Marius Parescius is a well-known European IT and cybersecurity professional, Lithuanian serial entrepreneur and mentor, IT counsellor to the Lithuanian Parliament, CEO, and founder of Baltic startup incubator and technology hub, Business Hive Vilnius (BHV).  But the most interesting fact about him, that in 1999 he launched the very first social network in Baltics (and, probably, in EU) ‚Äì Draugas.lt. It started as a dating site, and those time most of their users didn‚Äôt even have personal computers. So they sent their photos to Draugas.lt via post, Draugas team scanned the photos and put them on website.

Briefly: a team that claimed to be Lithuanian stole 6M during the ICO and dropped their website, leaving the only word ‚Äúpenis‚Äù on it. There were plenty of articles about the issue in the media worldwide.  Marius and the team members of our cybersecurity startups, being both Lithuanians and blockchain experts, started to investigate the case. So they found out, that the team had nothing to do with Lithuania, the identities of founders were stolen, and the raised amount was only 6K euro. Moreover, they traced another scam ICOs of that team.

Just imagine, that in less than 1 year teams based in Lithuania raised over 0,5B USD via ICOs. It‚Äôs quite an amount for such a small country. Most of these projects are fintech industry players. In 2017 the Bank of Lithuania introduced special banking and payment institution licenses for startups, that lead to 32 new fintech companies in the country during 2017. 80% of these companies, including Revolut, relocated to Lithuania from different parts of the world, including UK, Israel, India, China, etc. So meet the Amber Valley for IT-entrepreneurship ‚Äì the Baltics, and Lithuania, as a biggest Baltic state.
