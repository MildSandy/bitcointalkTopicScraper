It's a great way to earn passive income and make money while you sleep!  Below we outline the what, the why and the how. So…   What is a node? Every Blockchain Network is a collection of servers called nodes. Nodes work together to provide safe, secure, immutable data storage and access in a shared and decentralised system.  What is a Sponsored Node? Sponsored Nodes are very similar to the standard Master Nodes in cryptocurrency, but applied to business use cases. Any individual may sponsor a node by depositing 20,000 ECOM with the Omnitude Foundation. In return, node sponsors receive a share of the ECOM transaction fees for that node.   Why would you want to sponsor a node? The Omnitude platform is a disruptive technology that brings significant cost reductions and information efficiency benefits to businesses. These should provide room for out-performing yields once sufficient adoption has occurred, therefore generating a recurring passive income for sponsors of Omnitude nodes.     Things you need to know:   How do you claim my own Sponsored Node?  Omnitude has made it easy. Sponsored Nodes are completely turn-key. Simply deposit your ECOM with the Omnitude Foundation and comply with node sponsorship requirements. Exact details on how to do this will be released in the near future.  What ROI can I expect?  While far from finalised, and subject to future information, network needs, and the usual disclaimers, etc., our preliminary testing finds we can offer sufficiently low transaction rates to deliver the benefits of Blockchain to enterprise customers while providing a positive margin and return on investment (ROI) at modest utilisation rates for Sponsored Node claimants.  Omnitude Node Sponsors receive 60% of transaction fees, from which node operation expenses are then discounted. In the event transaction fees do not exceed node operation costs, Omnitude will subsidise as necessary for at least the first year and review annually.  What are the Node Sponsorship requirements?  Details are still being finalised but will include reasonable minimums on time commitments, sponsor identity data, and other vetting.  So to summarise, all you need it 20,000 ECOM to sponsor a node, there is no other work for you at all. All ECOM will be held by the Omnitude Foundation, and providing all the Terms & Conditions of sponsorship are adhered to, the full balance can be returned to you if you decide to relinquish your sponsorship.",False

Though best known for its use in cryptocurrencies, blockchain is a secure register for storing data, and data security can be crucial to an F1 team’s competitiveness, helping them protect trade secrets from rivals.  Omnitude launched its initial coin offering in March, and the partnership with Williams Martini should bring in additional funding. As part of the deal, Omnitude’s branding will appear across Williams Martini racing property and personnel.  Formula One teams handle a lot of data. Each car has hundreds of sensors onboard, collecting detailed information on almost everything imaginable. Race weekends produce perhaps 30 gigabytes, entire seasons add up to several terabytes. Just handling that data can be a challenge, but security is important, too. Teams have famously tried to get insider information on each other throughout the history of the series, and while the driver is an important part of success, the car, and its engineering design, is crucial. Blockchain could be a way to more securely store that data.  “Williams prides itself on speed of innovation and engineering excellence,” Claire Williams, Williams Martini’s deputy team principal, said in a statement. “We welcome the opportunity to form a close partnership with Omnitude and provide the ideal environment to showcase radical new technologies that have the power to transform the capabilities of businesses around the world.” https://www.sporttechie.com/omnitude-blockchain-formula-one-williams-martini-racing/?utm_content=buffer8c83d&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter",False

Enterprise middleware technology provider Omnitude will work with the team to explore how blockchain technology could be implemented into numerous aspects of how a Formula One team operates.    Omnitude, a company on a pioneering mission to revolutionise connectivity between blockchain technologies and enterprise systems partners the team as the firm seeks additional funding, after their token sale launched in March 2018.    Williams Martini Racing has a relentlessly innovative presence in motorsport, leveraging data to hone its competitive edge. A partnership with Omnitude allows Williams Martini Racing the capabilities to utilise blockchain technology in one of sport’s most demanding and data-driven environments.   Omnitude have agreed a multi-year partnership with Williams Martini Racing, which will see branding on the team’s drivers and senior personnel from the Spanish Grand Prix. The company’s logo will also appear on the team environment over a race weekend and on the car for the Spanish and Monaco Grands Prix.   Omnitude will be looking to showcase their ability through a close working relationship with the team to highlight how blockchain technology can be implemented into everyday businesses.   Omnitude's smart integration layer allows enterprises to adopt blockchain on a 'plug and play' basis, without needing to replace existing systems. Helping to drive mass adoption of this technology, making it quicker, easier, and cheaper to integrate blockchain technology into businesses of all sizes.   Talking of their involvement with Omnitude, Claire Williams, Deputy Team Principal of Williams Martini Racing, said: “Williams prides itself on speed of innovation and engineering excellence. We welcome the opportunity to form a close partnership with Omnitude and provide the ideal environment to showcase radical new technologies that have the power to transform the capabilities of businesses around the world.”   Commenting on the collaboration, Chris Painter, CEO and Founder of Omnitude, said: “We are exceptionally pleased to have signed this deal with Williams, to look at how Omnitude’s expertise in blockchain technologies can be implemented across their organisation. Working with Williams Martini Racing is a major validation of our product and vision and this partnership is a natural pairing of two of the UK’s most innovative and cutting edge organisations.”",False

This has prompted many current token sales to review their strategies and we are no different. We have thought long and hard about how to achieve the best result for our participants and our vision and consulted our community along the way.  We have now made the decision to extend the opportunity of participating in our token sale, the sale will be extended until Thursday 31st May 2018.   Why have we done this? Well for several reasons, really...  To allow the market to recover (and alongside this the price of ETH) to ensure that our participants get a good deal from contributing to our project. To enable us to continue negotiations with some big name Customers/Partners and if possible within the time frame given, publish these to our community to illustrate the potential of Omnitude and the enthusiasm and confidence we are receiving from some very exciting businesses.These Customers/Partners are a big deal, they include governments, sporting giants and iconic global brands amongst their ranks. All of them excited at what Omnitude can bring to their businesses and organisations, all of them instantly recognisable anywhere in the world. To prove to the crypto market we are beyond serious in our dedication to driving the mass adoption of blockchain through a vision that is very, very big. You will be able to come and meet us at Consensus in New York on May 14th-16th 2018 where we are a major sponsor along with IBM, Accenture and Microsoft.  Is our roadmap affected? We are still dedicated to meeting the deadlines we have set out on our roadmap, this decision does not affect that in the slightest.   Burning tokens We are still dedicated to burning any unsold tokens at the end of the sale. Ensuring that the total amount of publicly circulating tokens will always be 55% of the total supply. As we have always promised. And remember the % of tokens allocated to the team will be locked and 20% of the total token allocation for the team only will be unlocked on an annual basis over a five year period. This helps us protect the inherent value of our ECOM token.   Still no Whales! We are still not accepting any Whales at huge discounts, the maximum discount we have ever given is 15% and that is still the case. We have turned down over $30 million in contributions because the requirements of huge discounts seemed neither fair or sensible for our participant base. We need our token to be primed for solid stable growth, not susceptible to large dumps on the market.   Solid and stable growth for ECOM Our ECOM token has utility baked into it so it will always be needed to access and undertake actions within the Omnitude ecosystem. Consequently, the value of our token will increase with the growth of our ecosystem.   Annual audits We are committed to being audited annually by a credible financial authority just like any other UK business, and having these results made public.   We are telling you this now because it seems the most open and honest way of communicating our decision, we did not want to wait until the last minute. This way you can make an educated decision on when the best time to participate would be for you.  Omnitude is going places, and we are bringing all our participants with us.

I would say, the answer would most likely be, how they're aiming to tackle fraud...They do this by giving each of their customers an identity, intended to create a safer way of processing transactions on all of their connected sites. This transparency is also used for retailers and their customers (manufacturing origin to be in real time order tracking).  They also have a protocol for proof of interactions. Allowing anyone to look at any past transaction of users, seeing when previous transactions have been made between the two parties. Essentially allowing users to identify whether or not one party is a reliable client or not. Just like when you're making a purchase online, with eBay or Gumtree. If you are uncertain about the seller, you view their past selling history to validate your decision. These types of transaction validation methods have been proven to work, I think that's why Omnitude has chosen them for their service.  I've noticed that a lot of other ico are trying to take down similar problems. However they do so in the most complicated ways, with the elaborate confusing plans, I think sticking to simple methods that have worked before, will mostly work in the future.

Even from one of the CEO's own articles   Built upon complex cryptography, the blockchain effectively provides a permanent, incorruptible and irreversible record. This means, in theory, it leaves no room for fraud of any kind throughout the supply chain. This ability for blockchain technology to provide a full audit trail has made it attractive to multiple industries.  It really shows that the ability for the other nodes and parties along the blockchain to entirely audit every single member makes its appealing to the e-commerce industry.    On their journey through the supply chain, an item’s location can be recorded at key points by trusted ‘witnesses’ and tagged with unforgeable cryptographic identifiers which are then written immutably to the blockchain.  This is so key when determining the rights of each party in a ""he said, she said"" situation. Ultimately, it comes back to the idea that governance and enforeceability of contract are at the heart of teh benefits that blockchain has to offer.",False

Once it has really been adopted on a mainstream level, business-to-business interactions will never be the same.  Ebay, Amazon and even Alibaba and its variants have revolutionised the way we purchase items and the speed at which we are able to have them delivered. It truly is about the convenience and the hassle-free way of living.  With blockchain tech, we can expect a significant disruption with these ecommerce giants as it will innovate how quickly, efficiently and with a great level of security that we can conduct online transactions and purchases.  E-commerce fees and percentage margins are way to big. They can really charge this because they are the source of validity for the transactions. However, blockchain will flip that upside as each node is now a verifier of the transactions taking place.

Quote These fees vary by platform, but the range is generally 10–50% of the total sale price. Retailers build the cuts that E-commerce platforms take into the final price, which leads to higher prices for consumers and less profit for retailers. It’s a lose-lose for everyone except the E-commerce platform.  Furthermore, many of these centralized platforms cut-off direct contact between consumers and sellers. Amazon, for example, allows retailers one follow up email asking for a review and/or checking on the satisfaction of the customer. This drastically reduces the amount of relationship management a retailer can provide. To make matters worse, Amazon employs its own customer service team, who aren’t familiar with the products or company policies. This further adds to the transaction cost and could easily be done by the merchant directly.  Blockchain really can eliminate this model entirely by proposing a decentralised, everyone-monitors-everyone kind of setup.  Even as I said earlier, these giants will either try to oppose this huge shift in the eCommerce world or risk their  $22 trillion as of July 2016 being chipped away to blockchain enabled platforms such as the plug-and-play solution that Omnitude is offering....",False

I think that would be a very good idea for a collaborative environment.  Deployment of the platform is a strong indicator of how well teh company will function in reality and not just in the ether of the internet. If Omnitude can reduce implementation time and plug their middleware into existing eCommerce sites and platforms such as ERP software, tehn supply chains will see the benefits roll in. Investors of the token on the other hand will see the token value rise. It is a win-win outcome.  This all hinges on how efficiently it is rolled out. Seems very promising in that sense.

We’re delighted to have you on board.  If you haven’t yet had the chance, there is still time. We’ve decided to extend the cut-off date for our pre-sale by two weeks until 10PM GMT on Friday, 16 February 2018. A number of people have contacted us requesting the extension because, as you know, market conditions have been particularly harrowing over the past 24-hours.  Secondly, we think it prudent, with the further regulation meetings between the SEC and CFTC happening on the 6th February 2018, to extend the cutoff date. US investors might want to get in earlier than later, as we can’t guarantee that they’ll be able to participate after the 6th February.  So far we’re confident of the initial projections we made of raising $2M. On advice from our community and advisors though, we did raise that cap to $4M. We have, however, raised enough to move forward with the project as planned and stick to our roadmap.  We did discuss the recent events with our team and advisors and after some robust debate, we’re happy with the decision to extend. Please note that we will not be adjusting any rates or individual caps of the pre-sale.  We feel encouraged by seeing, over the last few weeks, our community grow exponentially day after day as the word spreads about our exciting and pioneering project.

This will help to drive mass adoption of blockchain technology, making it quicker, easier, and cheaper to integrate for businesses of all sizes. In bridging the gap between blockchain theory and practice, Omnitude aims to provide quicker, safer and more cost-effective ways to solve a variety of pertinent problems for online retailers, including fraud, supply chain inefficiency, and identity theft, as well as reducing item returns and improving data security.   Omnitude has specifically chosen Hyperledger Fabric as a blockchain implementation framework because of its stability, security and ability to process large volumes of transactions quickly. We believe this is one of the aspects that sets Omnitude apart and will drive the success and adoption of our ecosystem.   Omnitude can help achieve:  • The creation of transparent and accountable manufacturing and supply chains  • A significant reduction in eCommerce fraud  • The enablement of a single customer identity for use across any Omnitude connected eCommerce site  • Blockchain integration between enterprise systems such as ERP & WMS  ….and many more solutions from Omnitude and the community in the form Omnitude DApps.  What are the existing problems in eCommerce?  With global eCommerce sales reaching $1.86 trillion in 2016 and a projected sales revenue of $4.48 trillion 2021, online retail shopping is one of the largest global markets. However, this industry suffers some serious challenges. For example, 45% of online merchants and suppliers report losses greater than $1 million in revenue due to challenges faced when integrating cross-channel capabilities into their commerce strategy. Online payments are a further instance where eCommerce merchants lose out, with an average of 5.65 cents lost per $100 spent due to fraud. The Nilson Report estimates that $31 billion will be lost to the misuse of online chargeback rights alone by 2020. This is not to mention clean fraud (impersonation of legitimate cardholders), account takeovers, identity fraud, and re-shipping scams. From the consumer's perspective, fraud may arise from fake reviews and flimsy reputation systems which create an allusion of trust - research suggests up to 1/3rd of online reviews are phony and serve to bolster the merchant themselves or damage the reputation of competitors.    How does Omnitude solve these issues?  In this turbulent environment, the need for an effective, state-of-the-art solution prevails.  Omnitude’s implementation of a 'Single Identity' and 'Single Reputation' on a blockchain will provide the means to help merchants reduce the most common form of eCommerce fraud, Identity Theft, whereby fraudulent transactions are undertaken using a different identity, typically spending on someone else’s credit card or account. In providing users with a Single Identity on the blockchain, Omnitude will relieve merchants from the need to keep and secure extensive local databases containing sensitive personal data about their customers. Such databases are at risk of being compromised by ‘hacking’.  Omnitude will also reduce Merchant Fraud (i.e. the collecting of payment upfront, but with subsequent failure to deliver) by facilitating staged release of payments depending on stage of delivery. This will be executed by smart contracts on top of Omnitude which tracks an item's progress as it passes throughout a supply chain (e.g. identified by painted 2D graphene security tags or serial numbers). Micropayments with staged release, transparent traceability, and immutability, all work towards reducing merchant fraud. The risk of Chargeback Fraud is naturally minimised by reducing the use of credit cards.  Implementation of an Omnitude Identity (OID) backed by the blockchain will also be used to ensure merchant reputation is easily verifiable and legitimate. By establishing unique OID's for each consumer, Omnitude is capable of implementing a 'proof-of-interaction' (POI) whereby each transaction made by an OID will be recorded on the blockchain. Each purchaser must have a legitimate POI and reputation to write a review, and production/delivery of the product to that consumer (as traceable through Omnitude) must be confirmed before a review may be written, thereby eliminating fake reviews from the merchant themselves. An economic incentive system may also be established (based on a distribution of the ECOM token) to ensure reputation is further legitimised. Further to this, affiliate fraud (manipulation of traffic to gain more money from signup and advertising statistics) is reduced by the introduction of POI (i.e. affiliate rewards may only be delivered if there is a follow through by the customer).  These are but a few examples of how Omnitude may benefit supply chains and eCommerce, read more about how Omnitude plans to implement these solutions in our whitepaper.   What is the ECOM token?  An ECOM utility token will be launched alongside the Omnitude platform. Merchants, customers, and suppliers will require ECOM to participate in the Omnitude ecosystem.  The ECOM token will serve several primary functions:  1) A native method of settlement between parties to access ecosystem resources.  a. Merchants will make payments in ECOM to other ecosystem participants to use the on-ledger Omnitude solutions for Supply Chain Provenance, Delivery Cycle, Transparency Data, Single ID, Single Reputation and Proof-of-Interaction.  b. Customers will make payments to merchants using ECOM, cryptocurrencies, or FIAT.  2) An incentive for ecosystem participants to operate and secure the ecosystem.  a. The consistency of Omnitude’s immutable blockchain will be guaranteed by a distributed, peer-to-peer network of validating nodes running the Omnitude Core client application. In return for enforcing Omnitude’s Delegated Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (DPBFT) consensus algorithm, validating nodes will share in ECOM block rewards.  3) A means to raise funds for long-term development of Omnitude.  a. Through the crowdfunding, the Omnitude Foundation is raising funds for the initial issuance of ECOM, and for the development and launch of the Omnitude ecosystem.  b. The ECOM coins issued during the crowdfunding will be the initial float to bootstrap the ecosystem.    Proposed Token Sale Structure  Ticker: ECOM Tokens: 100M (Team & Advisors = 12%, Omnitude Foundation = 33%, Pre-sale Investors = 5%, Main-sale Investors = 50%) Inflation: None (no further tokens issued) Private pre-sale cost: $0.40 USD/ECOM (Sold out ahead of time even during turbulent market conditions!) Private pre-sale cap: 5 million ECOM (2 million USD) Token Sale cost: $0.46 USD/ECOM Token Sale hard cap: 50 million ECOM (23 million USD) Total sale cap: 55 million ECOM (~25 million USD)  Token sale will require KYC and $50k USD limit per person, per day.  Following the 1st round, unsold tokens will be made available to all those registered with each individual able to purchase another $50k USD worth of ECOM until sold out.  This will repeat until the 5th round at which point the token sale will end if still not sold out.  In the event that the Token Sale funding cap is not reached, all remaining tokens will be burned.   How do I participate and what are the terms of the token sale?  Our main ICO will be launching March 28th 2018 so sign up at our website (http://omnitude.tech) to get the latest.

However, down the line these things are lost just like that. To ensure that things fall in a correct order, there is Omnitude that is all about creating that connection besides keeping it going for long. So what is Omnitude? Revolution is a way through which one can achieve success but it can never be said for sure. Therefore, Omnitude has taken baby steps to see to it that all things are absolutely clear before taking a stance. With Omnitude, there would not be a communication issue between that of the enterprise systems and the blockchain technologies. In simple words, it is a platform that works solely as a middleware. Due to this kind of interaction, a complete transformation can be seen in the working of blockchain. Moreover, you do not have to worry about the way things handle this new system as Omnitude sets itself in a very smooth way.",False
