Unlimited data to study. Fast and real-time feedbacks. Endless opportunities. It’s got it all. Some people call us systematic. Here’s what that means to us: we combine fully-automated and scalable AI technology, deep neural networks and machine learning with a performing infrastructure architecture and a data-driven approach, to develop sophisticated trading models for the sports betting market. AI brings new complexities to the market. And AI programs will only get more complex as computing power increases and more data become available. We use technology in an effort to constantly refine our investment process and our insights into how the markets will behave. Risk is a living thing in our business, and we watch over it carefully.   pre-ICO pillars  #1 AI + Systematic perspective #2 Betting automation #3 Multi-sport approach Managing sports betting market as an alternative asset class means a huge effort in tech, building a one-stop-platform for the BetBox Edge Fund to manage bets globally  To implement BetBox's vision, we are launching an initial coin offering (ICO) to issue BetBox tokens on the public blockchain. The tokens called BetBoxTokens (BETX) will be issued during the pre-ICO and ICO. Only 31.31% of the tokens will be distributed during pre-ICO. The hard cap (the total supply of tokens) during pre-ICO will be 7.8M BETX tokens and the soft cap will be 746093 BETX. The price of a token during the pre-ICO will be 0.0034 ETH (there is no minimum purchase amount), and price during the ICO will never become less than 0.017 ETH per BETX price. The BETX discounts during the pre-ICO will be diversified in 4 tranches, as follows: 0 - 4254.45 ETH => 30% BETX for free 4254.46 - 8508.90 ETH => 20% BETX for free 8508.91 - 12763.35 ETH => 15% BETX for free 12763.36 - 17017.80 ETH => 12.5% BETX for free The earlier you invest, the more BETX tokens you get, at a lower price. There is more: if you invest during pre-ICO period you receive FREE 1 GiftCoin for each BETX purchased, which let you the opportunity to observe day by day our investment moves in European Top Players algo-trading box (1 GiftCoin = 1 day of free access). Both pre-ICO and ICO Investors  will receive 20% of the net transaction revenue earned by BetBox Hedge Fund (30% Performance Fee) on a weekly basis. Net transaction revenue represents the difference between  performance fee charged by BetBox to manage the Fund less direct costs associated with the transaction. Allocated commissions will be distributed via smart contract to BETX tokenholders.   HEDGE FUND'S STRATEGY  Our approach is rooted in science, rather than financial theory and implemented by a large team of researchers with backgrounds ranging from physics to computational math, ingesting more than 1,600,000 pieces of information daily. BetBox has developed a large amount of proprietary technology and algorithms, finding knowledge in unstructured data and sitting at the core of our trading activity. The fund will aim to provide capital growth by investing in sports betting markets through our algo-trading and systematic approach and will not invest more than 10% of its AUM (Assets Under Management) into each BetBox algo-trading model. The fund will have a 3% yearly management fee plus a 30% performance fee. The BetBox hedge fund's performance fees are uncapped, so there is no maximum fee charged.
