What can CEO do if a group of scammers paid themselves before CEO becaming team member then that paid persons dissapears? huh? All founders(Scammers/ Blackstone, Sagemark, Alan, Shad) must thank to the CEO btw.

OPL has so far funded and supported the development of ODN, a fork of Stratis, and is working with developers from the community to add masternodes and service nodes with an aim to run decentralized applications on the ODN blockchain.  OPL has supported the development of the Obsidian Secure Messenger (OSM) mobile app which is currently hosted and maintained by Claus Ehrenberg (Blackstone).  A primary current focus is the development of a PoS privacy coin, ODIN Blockchain, and other technology around this.

Here's the info.  In the following we’ll provide a brief overview for the reasons for the upcoming split, as well the vision of ODIN.  During the process of working on Obsidian, the team realised they were utilizing only a small fraction of the potential that was possible from our project. In addition, many new technologies emerged as this whole field continues to mature.  The former development team's strategy was to adapt a centralized, non-crypto/blockchain based messenger into a decentralized, crypto supporting and blockchain based secure messenger. However, it became crystal clear that the original Obsidian project could be expanded far, far beyond this limited objective.  We could become a complete open source, mobile based development platform ecosystem with a privacy mandate. One that was ideally placed to target decentralized blockchain projects in a unique, compelling human-centered way; an ecosystem which encapsulates all our core values.  These realizations coming to light, coupled with the several deficiencies encountered during audits on ODN, led us on this new path. One where we could fix all the mistakes from the past, and which would allow us to create a stronger, much more future-proof foundation.  Thus, Odin was born.  To work on this much larger scope, we have brought in a new Odin core development team that had a much greater understanding of our key issues and who are much more capable in accomplishing this expanded vision than Obsidian's original core team.  They have completely revised and redesigned the old system, and are implementing a much more robust, cohesive and agile blockchain which enables us to meet our expanded vision both in terms of quality as well as rate of progression.  They have put decentralization, the coin, the blockchain platform first, as to have a solid foundation for further applications and other software to be built upon.  We will therefore soon release ODIN which is a uniquely human-centered blockchain development platform, that will hold community at its core much more than what we originally could have envisioned. However, the release of ODIN does not mean we will pull all support from ODN. As a chain started by OPL, we consider it our responsibility to keep it viable and alive. Therefore, as part of our commitment to the ODN community we will continue to provide support and improve on this chain as well.  -Pete",False

When he does, please make him feel decently welcomed.

And you can not compare bitcoin with obsidian, or if they made an ico or not. those are 2 total different things. As they intentioned to provide master nodes and be a POS coin they had to provide coins to the community. So they had 2 choices. One airdrop them, so people can start staking or make an ico for a small amount of premine.  In my opinion they made a good choice.

We were trying to be discrete and diplomatic about this and postpone any major disclosure, until we could surprise the community with a big batch of great news, as we believed that this would yield optimal results: Professional, calm and organized negotiations, avoiding community confusion and stress, reflecting best on both parties’ appearances and ultimately following up with a positive announcement, leading to the most hopeful and positive sentiment from the community and the markets.  That said, since the former lead developer disclosed information about our offer in parts as opposed to an organized and clear description, we want to give you a brief overview of the offer we made him regarding the current negotiations:  Split: Obsidian is split into two separate entities, with two coins and two distinct paths. One would be led by the foundation and one would be led by Claus. Both parties swap their respective coins in order to reduce their holdings in the other party’s coin in order to ensure they do not threaten their counterpart's environment, but still have sufficient holdings in order to have a vested interest in their counterpart’s success. Existing coin holders have their balances mirrored on the new coin's blockchain (snapshot + “free coins”). This, while certain mechanisms will serve both platforms, and both platforms will collaborate on the communications and business development front, in a non-obligatory manner, for mutual benefit.   Simply put: A new coin is made, existing coin holders receive an equal amount of Newcoin holdings in addition to their ODN coins. Pete moves to a new chain, Claus gets a soft launch on the existing chain which already comes with exchange listings, brand recognition, existing communities and Claus already has a strong and positive reputation. To use a roulette analogy, instead of betting all in on red (foundation) or black (Claus), the ecosystem gets to “magically” double its bet and bet the original all-in sum on both red (Pete) and black (Claus). We intend to lead to the recovery of the project and to the future prosperity of a reputed and successful project and we intend to carry ourselves accordingly. To achieve this, we will continue the negotiations in a professional and discrete manner and will not give “live updates” on public channels, but rather a weekly update.""  I think this is a really positive move as it could not continue as it was, and ODN is such a great proposition, especially at this moment given all of the issues being seen with FB etc over data. Now is the time to take action and move forward rather than continuing as was........",False

Regarding differences with most competing messaging software, please have a look at this: https://imgur.com/a/J6OrG  Regarding Signal, there are a lot of similarities regaring the encryption. However, Signal requires you to a phone number, which may be used as an identifier. The Obsidian Messenger requires none of these, instead only giving you a 10-digit identifier which you can give to other people to contact you with; your public key. Furthermore, the blockchain is hosted on master nodes. These masternodes emulate the tasks which are usually handled by servers: They ensure the messages are delivered to the recipient.  Beyond the messenger application, Obsidian is a platform, meaning other applications can be built to utilise the blockchain as well. One of these is the recently announced Glass project, which aims to be a one-way mirror of sorts as a gateway to services for which anonimity might come in handy. Think therapists, lawyers, or even informing the police.  If you have more questions we'd love to see you on the discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/BwDcpZy",False

Though still in beta version, so there are things to improve, but I'm very pleased with what they have done so far and I think it's exciting being part of this platform. Maybe its just a matter of high supply and people actively trying to push the price down to stock up on cheaper coins?

They’ve been making showable progress lately, with their first app, the messenger supposedly going live at the end of the year. They also are doing a complete relaunch with new marketing that is scheduled for December 4th. Lots of positive news lately that I think has contributed to the price rise. Unless something shocks the crypto space on the short term I think price will keep rising in Advance of the 4th and depending on how the work they’ve done is received it will either crash back to $.25 or keep going.

I think this is a good move because I think that a lot of people have a hard time understanding what obsidian is and is trying to be. I think this project has huge potential especially at these cheap prices. A new white paper with better information about what they are trying to do is a step in the right direction. The coin itself has bottomed out at $0.22 - $0.30 for quite some time now. Obviously its lost more and more against bitcoin, but I think there's a lot of potential here since they do have a decently sized team and seem to be giving this a real try.

Anyone who ""liked"" this or any other coin at its high is lying to you or themselves if they say it's out of utility that they appreciate it.  Not saying ODN doesn't have a future, I have plenty staking as we speak it's just that no coin is really ""worth"" what people pay until the base is large enough to have appropriate diversity. When there are only X people using a token, then the spikes are almost assuredly because of get rich quick speculations....how could it be anyrhing else when most of these projects teams are working hard, but are only in the infant stages of the real, final working product.  Ffs ether is more valuable to me than bitcoin for so many reasons but not the least is it's not even close to it's final iteration and have still accomplished so much...yet ether price not only holds its value better but has more natural climbs (most of the time) cause these billionaire hipsters who talked shit on bitcoin now advise investing huge chunks of their portfolios to it.  Bitcoin is absolutely not worth what it's at now, but oh well...tulips I guess. Get ether and odn before guys like Mark Cuban  (not hating on the guy) advise that, cause you'll certainly see a flood of greedy money into that too.  If ODN can get some adoption by the oublic...the real public not hopeful investors, then it will grow properly. I'd honestly rather see real growth than get rich quickers blowing it to the moon, but if they can get real people to adopt it will likely boom to the moon but be a natural result of true adoption.  As long as it never costs me 2.20 in ODN for high priority send I'll be happy... I'm so butthurt about bitcoin not because I missed out on buying tons cheap  (I got ether early instead) but because I loved it. I loved that you could get nearly instantmy recognized transactions for 10-20 cents. I think ODN sounds nifty and it's still at the point where the psychological value is there...if you send a friend  $10 it would be like 40 Odn opposed to .00000001 btc or whatever it will be in the future.  Lets just all hope that ODN continues the hard work for the projects sake. The fastest projects to get laymen usable working product into the market will probably get the most notoriety, and there are more than a few projects competing in every single category  EDIT: maybe get some debit card system in the future...if it worked SO many people would adopt. Look at TenX...and they're still nascent who knows if they'll succeed. I'm rooting for ODN and EON",False

When Masternodes are released the purpose will be to provide decentralized support for Obsidian dapps network resources.  The staking rewards are randomly awarded, but over time the return averages out to 10% or the total supply distributed evenly across the balances of all staking holders.  Like with stratis, each coin can be thought of as a lottery ticket to win the new block for each block added to the chain, and upon acceptance of a new block 20 ODN is paid to the holders address.  Stakers also will receive transaction fees for transactions within each block, as well as service fees for the use of odn dapps such as the upcoming obsidian secure private messenger.  Once masternodes aer released, the masternodes will need to provide enough system resources to the network for supporting odn dapps, but increased network activity will lead to greater transaction and service fees.  As with any decentralized ecosystem, there is likely to be adjustments made to the network to maintain a healthy incentive for the operation of masternodes as the network grows. This will ultimately involve reducing or eliminating the ability of non masternodes to stake.",False

I think that the team has servers to support usage of the apps in the beginning before the masternodes are released.  try this link for slack group https://obsidianplatform.com/join_obsidian_slack   Quote from: seivold on October 26, 2017, 12:47:17 AM Nice! I like the concept. It looks like you are planning to be able to send many different file types. What will be the file size limit for encrypted messages?  The first dapp, secure private messenger will send messages and files encrypted off the chain through the masternodes. messages will require a payment. the initial figure is 0.00002ODN per message. I believe file transfers will require payment proportionate to the filesize. These fees are collected by the operators of masternodes. File transfers are probably not implemented yet, but that is just my guess. one of the features planned for implementation are group chat rooms.  There could be other stuff coming later on like streaming but that would need a robust masternode network.  One thing to point out is that due to blockchain transparency we cant expect for p2p odn payments to be anonymous. solutions can be implemented and alternatively there could be abilities to use other privacy coins through the messenger.  Being a code fork of stratis, blockchain unrelated, it is likely that some of the exciting new features of stratis will be ported over to obsidian as well. Obsidian is a platform and i am hoping to see more dapps coming to it in the future.

Also, the reward earned by all current wallets is the same 10% reward that may be reserved exclusively for Masternodes in the future. The current implementation of Masternodes pays a 10% reward on all coins in the connected wallet and a required minimum balance, like 10,000 ODN, is not in place yet, so that the network is being protected by the maximum possible number of nodes, including those wallet nodes holding smaller amounts.

This is done with the following method:        go to Help -> Debug, and click on Console - The command is: walletpassphrase <passphrase> <timeout> [stakingonly], so you would type:       Code: walletpassphrase <passphrase> 9999999 true           Once you've unlocked the wallet, or if you haven't encrypted it (this is strongly recommended against - you should always encrypt your wallet by going to Settings -> Encrypt Wallet), you can type this command in the same console window to check on your staking status:    Code: getstakinginfo  which should show something like this:  Code: { ""enabled"" : true, ""staking"" : true, ""errors"" : """", ""currentblocksize"" : 1000, ""currentblocktx"" : 0, ""pooledtx"" : 0, ""difficulty"" : 3329038.46672763, ""search-interval"" : 16, ""weight"" : 243243435, ""netstakeweight"" : 4056336904316579, ""expectedtime"" : 2592124460556 }  If you see ""enabled: true"" but ""staking: false"", it means that the coins in your wallet are not yet mature. I believe they need to be in your wallet for up to 60 blocks before they can start staking. Just wait an hour, and your wallet should start the staking process.  The other method to view your potential rewards is to close the console window and hover over the lightning bolt in the lower left hand corner of the client. This will tell you if you are staking, and how long a reward will take. The PoS reward is 20 ODN per block for the first year, then it will be change (lower) after that.",False

Some of the blocks get ""out-of-sync"" with the network (the ""too early"" errors) and others just are superseded by a previously mined block on the blockchain, and to avoid creating a fork, they are automatically discarded (the ""REORGANIZE"" messages).  When the network is fully PoS those messages will start dissapearing due to the different algorithm managing the staking. Ah .. and some of the mined blocks are rejected due to a ""proof-of-stake"" block found first and these take precedence.

Testers, you can now go and mine yourselves some coins. Mining is required at the start, so that the blockchain doesn't get stuck when no amount is available for staking. The mining reward is 4 ODN per block.  This also means that you can send minimal amounts of money around to each other, which will be a great way to test.  Download from out GitHub repository https://github.com/obsidianproject/Obsidian-Qt/releases  So, start mining by entering the following in the debug console:  setgenerate true  This will be less rewarding than staking, however both run simultaneously.

Comparatively to most ICO's this is a fairly small number, considering the size of the team. These funds will be distributed immediately after ICO but as stated will account for future development and thus do not simply get wiped from the coins growth potential.  The other 50% will be retained (possibly in escrow) for advertising, marketing, developers, daily operational costs of the company, compliance, and other similar expenses necessary to further the future of the coin in value and functionality. This could also include a monthly salary for the core and 2nd tier members of the team. (Mainly for 2nd tier devs as the core team already receives distribution from the first 50%).

Those hosting ICOs do so in a terribly legally murky environment, and I think there are going to be a bunch of people going to jail when regulators come knocking. Where I've consulted to projects who have insisted on an ICO, my recommendation has been for them to engage good legal counsel, and to strongly consider registering it as a security with the SEC and other similar bodies around the world.

We understand the resentment but the fact was creating 10,000 individualized wallets for our users security was just overbearing on the ETH api (btc was fine). We couldn't of planned for it and have been facing it's affects for the past three days (and still going). Just re-posting email out of clarification.   It is our pleasure to announce the extension of our ICO period by one week. The new ending time is as follows:  Saturday, August 26th 3:00AM GMT  Why did we decide to extend the ICO?  When we initially started the Presale/ICO we intended for a total period of 5 weeks, 4 weeks presale and 1 week ICO, where we would ramp up efforts on all ends. During that period we took an extra step to ensure the security and privacy of our registrant's funds, by implementing uniquely created contribution addresses. However, with that implementation came a slew of issues. As it turns out the Ethereum explorer API had many issues keeping up with our quickly increasing wallet count, as well as their very own ongoing network issues and load. As such we ran into bugs that included; inability to login, inaccurate reporting of ODN both as a whole and individually, the need to shut down many of our ads (due to traffic slowdown) and more. The system we added to protect our users in turn was also the system that caused hardship on the frontend. The good news is your contributions and ODN holdings are 100% secure and our backend is readily protected at all times. In fact, and I kid you not, the keys to those wallets were brought from overseas, by hand, to the UK where they now reside in an untouchable safe. We are that serious about security.  A wise man once told us that if you have a product you believe in, that your best bet is not rushing it and compromising it's structure and integrity. Thus we are going to use this time to implement a work around of current API issues, while working on QT/Testnet in tandem, and making sure the final days of the ICO go smoothly and lead to a clean and professional release. Furthermore this extra time gives us some room to keep building our community, whose growth has been nothing short of amazing lately. Lastly, just to reiterate, we are not changing any other terms and we will be burning (or not creating) any unsold coins at the end of the ICO.   While our app may be about privacy I hope our contributors now have a good idea of the team they are backing. We are an open book. We're always active and we'll continue to be so through the entirety of the project. We welcome you all to continue to communicate with us on a daily basis and be involved in the future of the Obsidian Platform.  A huge thank you to everyone thus far and we hope you all understand our decision. We truly look forward to continuing down the road we are already on with all of you.  - The Obsidian Team",False

If I understand correctly, you're selling 60% of the tokens you have and getting paid for them, and still holding 40% of the supply ? I'm a trader and that's the only reason I consider buying tokens, I really think your technological added value to the token is great and all but at the end of the day  for me it comes to sells and buys. Why would someone else buy this token for me at a higher price later on ? and will I able to sell it to them ? I might use messaging once or twice a month, but i trade daily. And as a trader I really think that owning almost half of the supply while getting paid for the other half is too manipulable of a market to get into.

Primarily ODN currency will increase in value in proportion to the network / user adoption of the messaging app. As we roll out to multiple platforms, add more features, and market the product, and help to educate people in the importance of their own privacy and ownership of their data, the install base of the application will undoubtedly grow. With this growth will be an increased demand for ODN currency which will translate to an increased valuation.  I hope that answers your main question, and if you have any further questions please fire away. You can also ask questions in the Obsidian public Slack, where there are usually core members and other community helpers there to point you to information or help you out. Thanks!",False

So i'll answer this as best as I can with the information currently present.  Right now the focus is almost entirely on the OSM app. The reason being is the app developed is real world operational and more secure and anonymous then things such as whatsapp/signal. Keep in mind whatsapp uses signal protocol which does not have protection against collecting/selling meta data whereas Obsidian has it already built in. We believe OSM should be the focus and we intend to build functions around it for most of the foreseeable future, unless outside devs join in and can start immediate side projects. OSM is government level secure (well, when the government doesn't screw up) and we intend to push it as such.  Going forward thereafter there's been mention of STUN server and other such inclusions. The obvious steps are video apps, calls, etc.  We believe we may have a beta demo out sometime in the next few days actually!  Android is a huge focus. Our app is OS friendly and we do intend to have it mobile and accessible very soon.",False

Because of this, Stratis would have absolutely no reason to back us in any major way.

Following some excellent questions in our official Obsidian Platform Slack we have decided to share some key Q&A in advance of the pre-sale.   Does the Obsidian Platform have a plan for mainstream adoption?  It is our goal to achieve mainstream adoption of the Obsidian Secure Messenger, that is going beyond crypto space and evolving OSM into a multi-platform application for smartphone use like Signal or WhatsApp. Consequently, the coin that powers the Obsidian network economy must find equally broad adoption as a token for payments in general.   How many initial ODN coins will there be, and how is that effected by PoS rewards?  There will be a total coin emission of 98 million ODN for the ICO. Staking rewards are 10% of the initial amount of coins, i.e. 9.8 million per year. We plan to change the reward model later when we have gathered additional data about the obsidian network economy. Ideally we'd like to come to a zero-inflation and incentify node owners by transaction fees only.   Is ODN ""The One Coin To Rule Them All""?  “The One Coin To Rule Them All” - will there be any coin that achieves this feat? We can imagine that the future will see a multitude of widely used coins, such as we see many fiat currencies in the world today. I believe, quick exchange from one currency to the other, perhaps in-wallet, might  be where we are going. Owning a bundle or portfolio of crypto currencies seems economically reasonable to me, as it reduces total risk. It's also possible that crypto currencies take off in such a way, and I hope that, so then one blockchain can never be enough to provide the total capacity needed.   Will ODN have smart contracts like Ethereum?  Stratis will also be implementing a solution for smart contracts, based on dotnet. However, we in general consider that smart contracts, at least on the main chain, are not yet a fully proven concept. We will likely approach this from the side, and they would initially be introduced based on actual use cases, (for OSM in particular), we want to enable with them.   Will ODN be minted in perpetuity?  No. Our current concept is to reduce inflation to zero over the next three years, possibly in less time than that. The high staking reward is in place initially to encourage rapid growth and build a strong foundation network, will the help of a wide range of stakers, large and small.  What is the innovation story for the ODN coin?  A key innovation with our ODN coin is as follows. We believe that we have already chosen an exceptionally good base - Stratis, which is in turn based on Bitcoin. We plan to maintain this connection and steadily pull all proven innovations from these sources to ODN, too. Examples include SegWit and Lightning networks. In addition, we will review the features which may improve our application(s) and services, such as enabling very lightweight mobile wallets in the Obsidian Secure Messenger (OSM).  We really appreciate all the early community involvement which we continue to warmly welcome. Look forward to speaking with you all. Good luck in our ODN pre-sale!",False

Introduction time, (as my reserved spot was deleted by forum mod, I'll post here).  I am Pete McClory, CEO of the Obsidian Platform, and thought it beneficial to introduce myself, plus go into some details around where we are and where we are going with various aspects of the project.  Some condensed history  1980s - 2000 My first taste of entrepreneurship was when I was about 9 years old, selling homemade cakes in class. I was even taking pre-orders, and got a real taste for business from this point on. I had dreams of getting a 2D platform game demo on the front of Amiga Format, but never quite got there. Instead I turned my focus to music and art, which went well for some time, yet I always had a kind of 'pull' towards technology. I think this was partly due to the fact that my father was a Computer Science lecturer, turned senior lecturer at Manchester Polytechnic (and heavily involved in various kinds of technical consultancy, largely focussed on COBOL, well before it was object-oriented).  2000 - 2005 Completed a BSc covered a mix of subjects from media production and animation through to Java programming, Web design & development.  Worked for the Met Police Forensics Department in London, focussed on R&D including 3D Crime Scene reconstructions. Motion Capture studio manager (including 3D motion data analysis and reconstruction. Assisted with PhD supervision at Bradford University.  2006 - 2016 Freelance web design and development turns into first 'proper' limited company, McClory Media. Company acquires another web and print business. 2013, exit out of the first company to set up a Drupal-focused web development company, Curve Agency, in 2013 (still running today).  2016 - present Working in an ever intensifying role with the fantastic guys at Obsidian Platform. Many amazing plans and exciting innovations lie ahead in both the near and distant future.  A big hello to everybody who has so far expressed a positive and collaborative interest in the Obsidian Platform. We have already significantly grown our community, less than 24 hours since the initial announcement.  What makes the Obsidian Platform unique?  We differentiate ourselves from many other ICOs in that we actually have a team of developers, have already completed a significant amount on our initial roadmap. Of course, much of this is outlined in our White Paper and on our current roadmap, but I wanted to clarify that the first Obsidian product, the Obsidian Secure Messenger (OSM) has been in development for nearly three years, and that the Obsidian Platform (blockchain) itself has been worked on since 2016. Soon, we aim to enable developers from many different programming backgrounds to integrate their existing app, or build new apps off our platform without learning a new language.  It is very impressive just how far we have already come with our technology, and must say that the team I work with on a daily basis are really quite astonishing in terms of their diligence and abilities. Yes, we do have a working application which is integrated with the Obsidian blockchain, and as with any software product, there will always be more work to do (new features, improving UI, cross-platform, user testing, bug squashing, etc).  TL;DR  OSM - the secure messaging app has been in dev since 2014. Obsidian Platform in dev since 2016. Pre-sale starts Friday with 20% extra ODN to be gained in week 1 of the pre-sale.  Thank you for reading! Please say hello and we welcome you to join us in Slack.",False

Again, just to reiterate we are not a Stratis side chain, we are in fact a new platform. Because of this, Stratis would have absolutely no reason to back us in any major way. We love Stratis and admire the codebase they have built, that's why we're making use of it and customizing it as we see fit! That's the beauty of crypto after all.  At some point we hope to be able to say to that Stratis team ""hey check out this great platform we've built from your base"" and who knows maybe some day it leads to collaborations and advancements for both.

I think it's safe to say we'll be offering for marketing endeavors, development and of course translation. At some point we may even invite everyone to try and hack our messenger app (we're that confident).  So a little background, the messenger app has been in development since 2014 by one of our devs who has been in the [Suspicious link removed]munity since the beginning. While the app, originally, was just a software project of his, it soon became the center of attention after happening to meet the rest of our core team. We realized that by integrating the app we had a solid use case for an excellent blockchain idea. It creates immediate value for our stakers (on top of the PoS norm) and could be something to build off of for future developers. Not to mention at release it will be technologically competitive with current chart topping messenger apps (in fact we believe it is better due to the removal of the corporation and need for servers).",False
