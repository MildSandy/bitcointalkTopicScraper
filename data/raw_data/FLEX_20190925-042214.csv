The project unites all data providers and gives the user a complete, uninterrupted vehicle record; all without the disadvantages of a centralized database. Consumers can also significantly increase the value of their vehicles at the time of the sale by contributing to the repository of data on the blockchain with help of vehicle tracking devices. VINchain is a decentralized network that allows you to store VIN data on the blockchain, which guarantees complete data invariability. You can pay for requests on the blockchain with VINchain tokens (Icobench, 2018). Read more about VinChain on https://vinchain.io/  What is TrustedCars Flex? TrustedCars is an Award-Winning German Company that is changing Car Ownership forever by turning dealerships into innovative mobility providers while offering customers a commitment-free, all-inclusive and affordable solution. We have designed a solution that offers consumers a convenient way to own a car without ownership responsibilities. In parallel, we offer dealerships an additional source of income and access to a new generation of consumers.

TrustedCars Flex Tokens will help us to build a system of incentives and rewards to bring more efficiency into this malfunctioning industry. The ultimate goal of the Token Sale is to realise our roadmap that incorporates the onbarding of an international user base and the resultant benefits of growth and expansion into other countries. There are various use cases for TrustedCars why blockchain is not only useful but essential for our ecosystem. For example, Payment in this industry is presently not secure and one of the parties always has to make payment or settlement in advance and take some risk. Furthermore, there is no real incentive to bring the car back in a good condition. The TrustedCars Flex payment system uses decentralized blockchain technology with smart contracts to process payments, which guarantees safe transfer of funds and removes the need to trust a single party with the funds. The decentralized payment system combined with our tokenized reward system will let everyone involved in the TrustedCars Flex ecosystem earn and spend Flex Tokens without the need for an unreliable single intermediary or the effort and costs of wiring small amounts in different currencies across the world. Another example is that an IoT device will be installed in the vehicle to motivate driver behaviour and create a reward structure around behaviour – ultimately reducing insurance costs that can either be retained by the dealership or passed on to the consumer. The integration of IoT devices and Blockchain makes an excellent combination in ensuring that vehicles are treated correctly.  5 Points where we use Blockchain and Smart Contracts in the TrustedCars FLEX Ecosystem: The core engine for the revolution of car ownership will be a decentralized Blockchain technology combined with Smart contracts and our Utility Token. Our main goal is 100% transparency. The decentralized Blockchain use-case means that there are ZERO set-up fees or any other hidden costs. The Blockchain enables complex multi-party agreements and provides a mechanism for securing and transferring funds using Smart contracts, which is necessary to bring together the various parties involved in the TrustedCars Flex ecosystem. To be sure that the rented cars are treated well, we trust in the integration of IoT devices in combination with the Blockchain. So, the renters, the car dealerships and the insurances can be certain of the car´s good condition. Our TrustedCars Flex payment system uses decentralized Blockchain technology with Smart contracts to process payments, which guarantees safe transfer of funds and removes the need to trust a single party with the funds.  In addition with TrustedCars Flex every expense that comes with the ownership of a vehicle is included: registration, insurance, taxes, maintenance etc. You actually only have to pay for fuel yourself.   I hope to have answered all your questions.",False

You don't need to just register here for 1 question, this must be inconvenient for you  To your question: This is not the case at all. We have investors who believe in the project and have already invested very large amounts. But we are not just doing the ico to collect money but to build a community. And if you have been watching the Crypto Market you have probably seen that Bitcoin and Ethereum have reached their lowest rate. This makes a lot of the small investors who are important to build a large community be more cautious about the Token/Coin Market. But we need the small investors as well so that's why we have a small pause between Round 2 and Round 3 of the Token Sale to not be that much independet of the crypto market.  Thanky ou for your contribution and for being part of our community. Kind regards from Frankfurt / Germany",False

That is a huge problem in this industry, people bring the car back with scratches and dirty and don't care much. Ans also payment in this industry is presently not secure and one of the parties always has to make payment or settlement in advance and take some risk.  The designed TrustedCars Flex payment and reward system uses decentralized blockchain technology with smart contracts to process payments, which guarantees safe transfer of funds and removes the need to trust a single party with the funds. The decentralized payment system combined with our tokenized reward system will let everyone involved in the TrustedCars ecosystem earn and spend  Flex Tokens whithout the need for an unreliable single intermediary or the effort and costs of wiring small amounts in different currencies across the world.  Furthermore an IoT device will be installed in the vehicle to motivate driver behaviour and create a reward structure around behaviour – ultimately reducing insurance costs that can either be retained by the dealership or passed on to the consumer. The integration of IoT devices and Blockchain makes an excellent combination in ensuring that vehicles are treated correctly",False

Car Sharing is only designed for occasional usage but its not very convenient if you require a vehicle on a regular basis. On the one hand it is very expensive (charge by the minute) on the other hand it is only available in a few major cities. For example Car2Go and Drivenow together are only available in 31 regions in the whole world.  But we already have the infrastructure provided by the dealerships and can use their cars on the lot which just cost money sitting on the lots for months. With our solution Dealerships have an additional source of income and access to a new generation of consumers.  With our solution customers can drive any car they like as long as they want and return the car or swap for another car anytime. The pricing will be comparable to Leasing, for some cars even cheaper. With the huge difference that in our concept everything (except for fuel) is included and the customer doesnt have to sing a contract for 4-5 years.  This solution is also very attractive to businesses. Currently companies lease a vehicle and are locked into a long-term contract for new employees who need a vehicle from day one. But there is always that uncertainty that the employee might not be with the company after their probation period for example. We talked to a lot of companies and they like the idea as well.

TrustedCars Flex will be our new product enabling customers to have the right vehicle at the right time with no compromises. It is a flexible, all-inclusive and affordable solution for having a vehicle for daily use, without buying one or being locked into long-term contracts. With a digital end-to-end solution, consumers can choose any vehicle they want from the available inventory of participating car dealers within the TrustedCars Flex network, digitally sign for it in the bespoke app and they are ready to go. Consumers make a low weekly payment for as long as they keep the vehicle and they can change vehicles as often as they like. There are no hidden costs and the consumer gets a fair price with everything included: warranty, roadside assistance, insurance, maintenance, taxes and registration. Our assurance of listing the most competitive deals in the market means that consumers always get the best price.  With our unique combination of technology expertise and deep industry relationships we have designed a solution that offers consumers a convenient way to own a vehicle without ownership responsibilities. In parallel we offer dealerships an additional source of income and access to a new generation of consumers.  TrustedCars Flex as a high-tech company will help dealerships move up the technology change curve, with an easy accessible all-in-one solution.  How does the project create value to the ecosystem and differs from competing projects?  Payment in this industry is presently not secure and one of the parties always has to make payment or settlement in advance and take some risk. Furthermore there is no real incentive to bring the car back in a good condition. The TrustedCars Flex payment system uses decentralized blockchain technology with smart contracts to process payments, which guarantees safe transfer of funds and removes the need to trust a single party with the funds. The decentralized payment system combined with our tokenized reward system will let everyone involved in the TrustedCars Flex ecosystem earn and spend TrustedCars Flex Tokens (FLEX) whithout the need for an unreliable single intermediary or the effort and costs of wiring small amounts in different currencies across the world.  TrustedCars Flex is incorporated in Germany and is a spin-off of TrustedCars GmbH. The Online-Shop TrustedCars.com launched almost two years ago and is an operating business with a successful product. Currently buying a vehicle with our One-Stop-Shop is as easy as ordering a book on Amazon.  TrustedCars has already raised a seven-digit investment and have built a very strong ecosystem of renowned cooperation partners, many of whom are leaders in their field of operations. More than 100 of the largest dealerships in Germany already trust and work with TrustedCars, with more joining every day. TrustedCars is classified as an innovative company by the German Federal Office of Economics and Export Control and won several awards for the concept. With more than 30,000 listed vehicles in 2017 and currently more than 8,000 vehicles available for purchase, TrustedCars is one of the biggest online shops for used vehicles in Europe.  The goal of launching an Initial Token Sale is to convert the business into a decentralized Token ecosystem that will reduce time and expense for everyone involved in the ecosystem. TrustedCars Flex Tokens will help to build a system of incentives and rewards to bring more efficiency into this malfunctioning industry. The ultimate goal of the Token Sale is to realize the roadmap that incorporates the onboarding of an international user base and the resultant benefits of growth and expansion into other countries. TrustedCars FLEX is raising funds through a public crowdsale, starting on June 4th. Early contributors will be able to join the presale of the FLEX Token, starting on May 14th.

We have talked to most of them and even designed the solution with some of them who are actively working with us ont his project. About the ""old"" concept: We specifically didn't want exclusivity on the cars since we want dealerships selling their cars in their region on their own as well. What we do is to help them with marketing and selling their cars not only in their region but nationwide, with our 150 point car check from well trusted car experts of TUV (a well known and trusted institution in Germany). In addition we deliver the cars to the doorstep of the customers, including registration! Furthermore the customer has a 12 month car warranty and a 14 day money-back guarantee! Which is actualy unique for the automotive industry.  To be honest I don't know what you mean with your question about the funding or the 1490 cars. Please see whitepaper for the roadmap. We will expand to various european countries already in 2019. But we never missed any milestones neither has ever an investor pulled out any funding. A newbie is spreading something like this here... Kind of a competitor?  By the way, we were just named one of the most promising blockchain companies here in Germany. We received an invitation to the Federal Ministry for Economic Affair and Energy next week in Berlin to present our project.

With TrustedCars FLEX you can choose any vehicle you want from the available inventory of participating car dealers within the TrustedCars FLEX network, digitally sign for it in the app and you are ready to go. Drive the vehicle you like as long as you want and return it or swap for another vehicle anytime.   〉 This is how it works 〈  With our paperless end-to-end solution you can choose any car you want from the available inventory of participating car dealers, sign for it in the app and you are ready to go. Drive the car as long as you want and return it or swap for another car anytime. With no fixed costs or long-term contracts but for a low weekly payment including all expenses.  1.

Swap anytime - Freedom to drive the car you want as long as you want.   〉 Significant change in the behavior of consumers 〈  Modern customers prefer convenient, flexible and affordable solutions rather than being locked into long-term contracts or having to spend time on a purchase that is plagued with uncertainty. But if you need a vehicle today and you don’t want to buy one, your options are limited. Current mobility concepts like ride-hailing, car sharing or leasing are either too expensive, not available in your city, unreliable or lock you into long-term contracts.  On the other hand, dealerships usually have hundreds of used vehicles just sitting on their lot, on average more than 100 days and costing money every single day. We have designed a solution that offers consumers an affordable, all-inclusive and commitment-free way to have a car and at the same time offering dealerships an additional source of income and access to a new generation of consumers.   〉 Turning dealerships into mobility service providers 〈  We don’t just want to solve the problem of dealerships with their increasing lot time. More importantly, we firmly believe that the business model of dealerships will change dramatically in the long-term as a consequence of our advancement. Dealerships will not just continue with their traditional business of one-time vehicle sales but provide new mobility concepts for a new, emerging generation of customers.  But more than 90% of dealerships don’t have any expertise in IT, e-commerce, AI, chatbots, apps or marketing to provide such a solution. TrustedCars Flex as a high-tech company will help dealerships move up the technology change curve, with an easy accessible all-in-one solution turning dealerships into mobility providers without any upfront investments.   〉 Secure and incorruptible infrastructure 〈  Right car at the right time, and all with a few taps on your phone, with our paperless end-to-end solution. Using Ethereum-based smart contracts through which all funds are secured and transferred, the TrustedCars Flex ecosystem, as a secure and incorruptible infrastructure, will fundamentally transform the consumer experience in vehicle use and ownership.  Convenient and affordable access to an entire fleet of cars:  ✓ All-inclusive - Weekly payment includes insurance, warranty, taxes, maintenance and any other expense that comes with owning a car. ✓ Hassle-free - Convenient and risk-free. No uncertainties with purchase, financing, insurance, repair or maintenance. ✓ Low weekly payment - Transparent fair pricing with no hidden costs. ✓ Flexible - You can return or swap your car anytime you want. No long-term contract.   〉 Our Achievements with TrustedCars 〈  The contribution of TrustedCars to TrustedCars Flex will not only be IT and infrastructure, but also an introduction of the TrustedCars Flex concept to our car dealer partners and share of a TrustedCars talent pool of developers, support, sales and marketing teams.  ✓ Established ecosystem of long-lasting and renowned partnerships ✓ One of the largest Online Shops for used cars worldwide ✓ Large network of dealerships ✓ Existing minimum viable product   Bounty Thread : Website : Telegram : Twitter : Facebook",False

Currently, if you want to have the benefits of having a car without any of the hassles of purchasing and owning one and without being locked into a long-term contract or paying exorbitant prices, your options are limited.  Car Sharing is a very expensive option, charge by the minute and are only available in some major cities. I guess it is okay if you need a car for occasional usage but not very convenient if you require a vehicle on a regular basis. The same for car rental.  Leasing is becoming a popular option for people who need a vehicle but don’t want the inconvenience and risks of buying one. Leasing is still inconvenient since users are contractually obliged to keep the leased vehicle for a set period, usually 3-5 years, before returning or buying it outright.  TrustedCars Flex is an affordable way to have an affordable, all-inclusive and commitment-free way to own a vehicle without ownership responsibilities.  It is as flexible as rental but more convenient and a lot cheaper than all the alternatives since we use the cars on the lots of dealerships. Instead of vehicles taking space, they are on the road making money to offset inventory-financing and other expenses  We provide a technological solution for dealerships to resolve both sides of the income statement issue: increase in revenue and reduction in holding costs. We already have more than 100 dealerships working with us here in Germany",False
