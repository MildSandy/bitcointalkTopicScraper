After consulting and reviewing our community's opinions by emails, we find that the majority of people think it's better for us to postpone our public ICO. So we are here to announce that DINO public ICO will be postponed until further notice.  For the first 2000 airdrop valid registrations, we will send them separate confirmation emails and the 50 DINO tokens will be distributed after the end of ICO relaunch. And the bounty program will be on hold from now. For those bounty participants, their previous work will still be valid and effective. Later after the ICO is relaunched, bounty program will resume at the same time. The bounty program will then run until the end of the ICO relaunch and bounty rewards will be calculated afterwards.  We are here to apologize for any inconvenience caused. We hope this arrangement would be understood by all of you.

Introduction  In blockchain world, there is a huge knowledge gulf between non-computer professionals from different industries and smart contract development. The DINO Platform aims to address this problem with its proprietary technology, a cloud-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) smart contract Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Leveraging the technology of the DINO Platform, users can build their smart contracts with visualised logic flows.  More than just a smart contract IDE, the DINO Platform is intended to build a smart contract ecosystem together with developers all over the world. In the smart contract market, developers may build and design smart contract templates and sell them to the general public.  Many successful usage cases of the DINO Platform have proven its know-hows can drive the possibility of building smart contracts via GUI interaction e.g. Drag-n-Drop. The implementation of the product is already underway. The DINO team has spent more than 6 years on R&D to develop a sophisticated software development platform, dragonce.com, for users with no-coding experience to build tailor-made ERP solutions.   You can know more about DINO platform via this video  https://dinoplatform.com/assets/images/video.jpg  https://dinoplatform.com/assets/images/bitcointalk/features.png    About Blockchain and Smart Contract  We believe that blockchain-based smart contract technology is generating an extreme interest across different domains. As the field of applications grows, the demand in customising and tailoring smart contracts, which are pieces of self-executing code on blockchain that automatically implements the terms of an agreement between parties to fit very particular uses, also soars. Many experts believe that smart contract is a critical step forward to streamline processes that are currently spread across multiple databases and ERP systems.  There has been an increasing adoption of smart contracts on blockchain. Smart contract platforms, spearheaded by Ethereum, QTUM, NEO and EOS, have been through a significant growth in market capitalisation over the past year. Recently, governments are exploring the possibility of developing their own smart contracts, including US, Dubai, Canada, etc. The market capitalisation of blockchain and smart contract technology has reached US$512billion in 2018, and recently UK government offered US$ 26.6million of investment to support the blockchain related startups because of the potential impact of blockchain technology in the economic development.   How DINO Platform solve smart contract industry problems  It is envisaged that the demand for blockchain technology will grow continuously for most of the industries. The smart contract is the critical component of the blockchain application as this potentially brings automation to business interactions safely and efficiently. The problem is that many users, especially those without programming knowledge, do not know how to interact with smart contracts. This knowledge gulf becomes a huge hurdle to cross in order to expand the commercial and consumer adoption of blockchain technology. DINO is here to bridge the gulf.  Smart Contract audits are getting more and more popular as these contracts are intended to handle real money, so security is a must. With the complexities of a new type of programming environment, even seasoned developers can make mistakes which may cost millions of dollars. DINO Foundation will provide smart contract code auditing service.  The blockchain world is facing a problem. There's an ever-increasing need for the smart contract, but there aren't enough people to build them. Programmers are in short supply, especially blockchain developers, and the need for their expertise won't likely go away in the future â€“ it's obvious that something has to give. Hiring new talents is hard, and retention is also a challenge. More importantly, modern technology development process is very complicated. There is a wide range of different skills and programming languages. These are typically not taught in formal education. That is why the Low-code or even No-code platforms are gaining their popularity.  https://dinoplatform.com/assets/images/bitcointalk/previous_exp.png    Illustrations of DINO platform  Buy smart contract templates on the Contract Market https://dinoplatform.com/assets/images/img_general1.png   Fill in all parameters https://dinoplatform.com/assets/images/img_general2.png   Main points of contract content will be visualized https://dinoplatform.com/assets/images/img_general3.png   Generate Solidity codes https://dinoplatform.com/assets/images/img_general4.png   Deploy on any blockchain networks at your choice E.g.

A token, DINO, will be the internal virtual currency on the DINO Platform for paying the platform service charges, buying smart contract templates from the marketplace, generating the intuitive smart contract logic flows and deploying on blockchain networks.  https://dinoplatform.com/assets/images/img_use_of_token.jpg  https://dinoplatform.com/assets/images/bitcointalk/token_allocation.png",False
