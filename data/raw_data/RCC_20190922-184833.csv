It is simple: Token Market has to send each bounty payment manually. There are a lot of bounty participants and therefore the process of manually checking and then sending RCC takes time.  There is no reason for anyone to be angry. I have explained the error - we announced that the bounty was being paid on twitter, but we hadn't been told that Token Market needed to do final checks before distributing. Now we know that Token Market also need to distribute RCC manually, we can accept that this takes some time. If bounty hunters are desperate for the RCC so that they can sell it immediately, then that is fine, but patience is a necessity. It would be far wiser for bounty participants to hold their RCC until game launch as this would likely result in highest return. But we do not dictate what happens on the marketplaces, if bounty participants want to sell their RCC immediately at a lower price, go ahead.  Thanks for your patience with Token Market.",False

Someone might even buy it from you, if you'd sell it!  More details here: https://reality-clash.com/win-your-own-gun/  We can all work together to help make this game a success for the backers, the players and our team! Get the word out there and earn bounty rewards as a result.  Anyone who can produce very high quality work to increase exposure of the project is able to receive additional RCC per our discretion.

The innovative FPS (First Person Shooter) game uses the camera on the player’s iOS or Android mobile device to overlay graphics onto their real-world environment, so that streets, buildings and other features become part of the game’s landscape. Now, Reality Clash are offering the chance to token sale contributors to get their name in the game through a personalised gun to use in combat. The gun has been designed exclusively for the Reality Clash referral competition and will be the only style gun ever made for the game.  How to enter Anyone who participates in the crowdsale will receive an email containing a referral code and link. All deposits that take place via a referral link will earn that referrer a 5% bonus in RCC Gold, the in-game currency. RCC Gold gives players access to inventory such as weapons, armour and other equipment.  The winner of the competition will be the person who accrues the largest referral balance by the end of the crowdsale, at 5pm UTC on 29 September 2017. To take part simply sign up and deposit any amount of Ether (ETH) to the Reality Clash token sale, and receive your referral link for promotional use.  $2M pledged to date Over $2 million was raised in the Reality Clash pre-sale. Participants in the current crowd sale will be able to purchase RCC Gold coins at a 70% discount now and then get exclusive access to weapons from November 2017. Crowdsale participants will have access to unique weaponry that will not be issued again afterwards, and will be eligible for an early demo of the game.  For any questions regarding the referral program contact support@tokenmarket.net. To participate in the crowdsale visit https://reality-clash.com  Those who have already participated in the token sale will automatically receive an email with referral details. Pre-sale participants please email info@reality-clash.com directly for your referral code. The winner will be announced one week after the token sale closes, and referral bonuses will be credited in RCC Gold after the end of the sale.  Good luck!  P.S.

I have more than once described the unpleasant situation surrounding my participation in Twitter and the Facebook campaign. It is not resolved, so I have to stop participating in it. On August 6, I signed up for the campaign, but accidentally incorrectly filled out the Bitcointalk Profile Link (No. 858 in the Spreadsheet of the Twitter Campaign, No. 691 in the Spreadsheet of Facebook). I registered again (Twitter No. 922, No.  719 Facebook) and asked the manager in private message (August 08, 2017) to delete incorrect entries. But the situation remained unchanged. I am again appealing to the forum manager (post No.  76 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2036661.msg20812249#msg20812249). Later I noticed that my status in the spreadsheet has changed to Rejected. I tried to find out why this happened on the forum (post No.  487 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2028934.msg21337912#msg21337912). I did not receive any responses from the manager, so I asked about it in a private message (August 30, 2017, 12:11:24). Answers also did not receive. I wrote again in the forum (post  No.   559 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2028934.msg21421700#msg21421700). And again did not get the answer. I did not do anything that contradicts the rules, I regularly rewritten in tweeter and posted on facebook. The result – my status is reject. The existence of two records in the spreadsheet is the result of an untimely response of the manager to my appeal. I distribute information about you in social networks half a month, and then I got reject. This is unfair and not professional.",False

We have updated all the sheets.  Please read these two Updates  Update#1: The Rejection due to Low quality, does not mean its permanent. There will be a second round of post count and revision at the end of crowdsale, And where we'll see if you have made more than 60% posts in English boards we'll will accept you.  Update#2: Our Spreadsheets are copied from the original spreadsheets, so we have to update the entries manually once a day or within 48 hours. So please always wait for it before posting here.  We have the right to change the rule any time. Also its not the end of the campaign, you guys still have almost a month to complete the task. And still if we saw any one who is not following the rules will be rejected permanently. In this case, changing the rules relative to the locale looks like an unjustified self-indulgence, you essentially force people to do double work, which probably is impossible for many of them because of insufficient English proficiency. For messages written using Google translator they risk being banned, and the messages themselves are likely to be deleted due to poor quality.  First, we do not really need those people who are making the post in only ONE section, It's literally one section like Altcoin announcement section in local board. Its not even Child board. Second, How does its promoting the project, if its an only one section?  Still, 30 days remaining in closing ICO and you guys just need to make 30 posts. -> Still, those who will not follow the rules will be Rejected permanently at the end of the ICO. -> Those who are saying scammer to us/ and scam to this project. Just check his/her post quality worth getting a negative feedback ""Spammer""  Be careful next time you guys try to mention above words. We are paying you very nice rewards and what we are getting ""Posts in only child board"" #low quality posts? We are expecting some thing worth paying.   Guys! Please dont need to post here that you added our avatar, We shall check it soon. And update the list.  Thank you very much  Regards",False
