Credit-card based offering is now live for unaccredited investors: https://www.startengine.com/epigencare   THE EPIGENCARE NETWORK  Our platform utilizes a scientific recommendation engine to filter skincare products in the $130 billion market and recommend them as personalized options to the consumer. We've developed a personal epigenomics test so consumers can have their skin quality analyzed via epigenetics. Skincare companies can subsequently target profile segments with their products by leveraging our recommendation engine.   PERSONAL EPIGENOMICS TEST TO COLLECT SKINCARE PROFIES Epigenetics is the study of biological mechanisms that can switch genes on or off. Whereas you have the same genetics from the day you're born and throughout your entire life, epigenetics on the other hand encapsulates the dynamic effects of skin. Our test looks at a proprietary panel of epigenetic markers strongly associated with skin quality indicators such as aging, moisture retention, elasticity, etc. Customers collect DNA from their skin with a non-invasive kit and mail it back to our facilities for methylation-based next-generation sequencing.  We developed our epigenetic test through intensive research, as well as through supporting insights and expertise from EpiGentek (also owned by the co-founders), who has epigenetic research products cited in thousands of academic publications.   THE RECOMMENDATION ENGINE The recommendation engine is based on the epigenetic effects of skincare product ingredients on the aforementioned indicators, allowing us to look for the optimal composition of existing products on the market to recommend to the consumer. We're indexing about 20,000 skincare products and their ingredients (FDA-mandated sources), ranging from luxury to boutique. Skincare companies can leverage the recommendation engine as follows: (1) completed skincare tests with available recommendation slot inventory are sent to a temporary holding pool for companies to have a chance to target profiles before the reports are delivered to the consumers; or (2) companies can select the data segments to reach or a specific product they want to promote, then set their budget and competitive bid price (which can be further guided based on predictive modeling), which will enable their products to be auto-inserted into matched consumerâ€™s reports as the tests come.   THE ECARE TOKEN  ECARE is used to tokenize and associate data on the blockchain for data provenance. Companies use ECARE utility tokens to target products to matched consumers. Consumers receive a portion of ECARE when targeted with personalized products. ECARE is fixed at $0.10 each with an inflatable supply and act as loyalty points to be spent toward more skincare tests, thereby generating more data and targetable segments.    INVESTMENT OFFERING: EPIC TOKEN  EPIC tokens are of ERC20 standard, on the Ethereum network. EPIC derives its investment value from usage volume of ECARE, which encapsulates the sales transactions of skincare tests and targeted advertising (ECARE can also move seamlessly with credit card purchases for skincare tests and advertising).  Goal: $20,000,000 USD Price: 1 EPIC = $0.40 USD Total ICO tokens offered: 50,000,000 EPIC 5 EPIC convertible to 1 equity share (48,000,000 total shares issued) 5% Revenue Share (15% & 10% in the first 2 years, respectively)  REGULATORY  The EPIC token is offered through a SEC Regulation D 506(c) exemption, as well as being offered under a concurrent Regulation S exemption. This means: US/Canada investors must be accredited for our Reg D direct offering and most international investors can participate under Reg S with little or no restrictions.  A ""STRUCTURED"" ECOSYSTEM  Unlike many blockchain based platforms, we are building a structured ecosystem rather than an open ecosystem. This means that consumers and skincare companies operate within the defined rules of our ecosystem which is, in a nutshell, to seamlessly and automatically connect consumers with personalized skincare products. We address the major problem of perceived intrusiveness often associated with direct-to-consumer tests requiring DNA (from which companies may sell or abuse your data to others without you knowing). In our model, we associate tokenized data with transaction hashes on the Ethereum network so that consumers can transparently see that sales of their data is being facilitated strictly for their own benefit, all without revealing their identities. In our controlled ecosystem, data can only be purchased by companies to deliver a personalized product to the consumer, and this can be proven to consumers on the immutable ledger feature of the blockchain.    A RECURRING BUSINESS MODEL Because skin is dynamic and can be encapsulated through epigenetics, our test allows for a recurring business model by quantifying progress of one's skincare routine. Tokens rewarded to consumers can be subsidized for additional tests, thereby contributing more data and purchasable recommendation slots back to the platform, and eventually growing the token value with increasing demand. Our structured ecosystem model puts tokenization and blockchain technology into a real-use application. Epigenetic changes are predicted to be reflected within several weeks, and we recommend conducing a test one to two times per year to track progress. We also help buyers save money in the long run by reducing spending waste on non-effective skincare products.  TANGIBLE PRODUCT STRATEGY  Lots of other ICOs have a chicken or the egg problem for their network (no companies if no users, no users if no companies). The success of their ecosystem precariously depends on a forceful push strategy of establishing elusive partnerships. In contrast, EpigenCare will have a tangible product for consumer sales by late Q3 (beta) and Q4 (full). Consumers will be voluntarily contributing data to our platform which enables a pull strategy for skincare companies to participate. Both consumers and companies can make purchases with traditional payment methods such as credit card, and token transactions on the blockchain occur seamlessly in the background -- no technical understanding of cryptocurrency is needed by either parties.     EPIGENCARE TEAM      ROADMAP      DISRUPTING AND IMPROVING THE SKINCARE INDUSTRY  Personalization is becoming increasingly important. Our method answers the age old question of skincare products for consumers: ""Is this product actually working for me?"". Because we can epigenetically assess how product ingredients are affecting one's skin, skincare companies will be keen to adapt to this new scientific marketing channel. We expect ubiquitous adoption as well as significant marketing budgets being moved over from traditional advertising to our platform. Additionally, with blockchain, consumers will be able to transparently see that their data sales are made only for their own benefit, solving the problem of perceived intrusiveness associated with the likes of 23andMe and Ancestry.com. Our goal is be the gatekeepers of skincare data, and to become the first ICO'd company that has a billion dollar valuation based on revenue, not token market capitalization.

Thanks for your insightful questions about EpigenCare's model. We are one of the few companies that are implementing an actual, practical use case of blockchain's primary feature -- tamperproof, anonymous transparency.  We are offering a direct-to-consumer test that requires the consumer's DNA, similar to 23andMe. The blockchain is needed to address the perceived intrusiveness issue often associated with these kinds of tests. Companies will often resell the DNA information to others for profit, without the customer knowing where it goes and how it will be used (an unstructured ecosystem). In contrast, we are building a structured ecosystem such that when a test is completed, we then allow companies to bid for targeted personalized products as recommendations through our scientific matching algorithm on the platform. This would be considered a customer's data being sold to a company, but since it is a structured ecosystem process we are able to seamlessly control the flow of the data for a specific use-case for the direct and exclusive benefit of the customer (which is the user getting a personalized product recommendation) -- this is much different than a personal genomics company selling customer data just to pad its own pockets.  Tokenization of data allows for an incentivization model such that skincare companies will be subsidizing the skincare tests since consumers can re-spend tokens on recurring tests. Therefore this allows us to associate a transaction hash ID (tokenization) with the purchased skincare test and the resulting test profile, and whenever the targeting occurs, a transaction is created on the blockchain. The consumer can choose to view on a public ledger to see where their data flowed to, as transparent proof of how we are utilizing their data, all without revealing any personally identifiable information. This cannot be achieved with a centralized server, which is not trustless.  Hope this helps!",False

Great questions!  1. These markers were selected after parsing through thousands of published peer-reviewed literature that reported various gene methylation markers that are responsible for skin-related biological pathways. We narrowed down the most viable candidates to those with methylation and demethylation states strongly associated with skin quality/aesthetic indicators. In our lab studies with skin samples, we further narrowed down to our final panel of markers that demonstrated the highest correlation to skin quality/aesthetic indicators. As this is the first method using DNA methylation markers to determine one's epigenetic skin profile associated with skin quality/aesthetics, we will be filing a US patent application in April to protect our invention. 2. Yes, there are repeatedly validated scientific tests that can indicate the markers are strongly associated with biological pathways determining skin quality/aesthetic status. We cannot reveal the actual list of markers due to the proprietary nature at this time, however if you visit our Science section of our website (https://www.epigencare.com/science/) you will see several publication examples that illustrate epigenetic correlation to skin quality/features to support our claims. 3. We are bootstrapping as well as receiving financial and resource support through our related company EpiGentek's line of credit. We are likely to sustain 12 months of operations without any revenue, assuming we operate in our current conservative state, with a Q4 launch goal of the commercialized test service. We hope to generate pre-order revenue and raise capital to significantly increase marketing to accelerate our sales and consumer adoption. 4. Our skincare test is catered to all age demographics, but with an initial market entry focus on the 30-40 year old range (individuals with disposable income who are concerned with the widest range of skin qualities and are still inclined to change their skincare regimen). We are looking to bring blockchain tech to the masses, thus the blockchain transactions occur seamlessly behind the scenes when they use their credit cards. Tokens will be presented no different than ""credits"" to the consumer. We will present a simplified and easy-to-interpret blockchain explorer for consumers to track their data use. More tech savvy consumers can verify data on an external blockchain explorer (e.g., Etherscan) and further serve to substantiate our anonymous transparency claims.   source: https://www.startengine.com/epigencare  Join the discussion to know more about epigencare.",False
