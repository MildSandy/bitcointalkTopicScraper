One of which is the upgrade to Solidity version 0.4.23. The main reason we decided to immediately go to 0.4.23 is because it supports accessing dynamic data (such as strings) returned by function calls. Basically, this means that we could use the Eternal Storage pattern in our repository contracts.  What does this all mean exactly? It means that by upgrading to the latest solidity version, we are able to write our data to Eternal Storage and in doing so, separating our data from our logic. In turn making upgrades to existing contracts a lot easier for our developers and transparent to the end-users. Key points we worked on: Features:     Upgrade to Solidity version 0.4.23 (pull request #37).     Improve the upgradability of the smart contracts (pull request #38).     Implement a page where all the details of a request are visible (pull request #106).     Implement a page where you can browse all the request that are relevant to a certain user (pull request #92, #93).     Upgrade profile to match the structure of userprofile (pull request #105).     Refactor pieces of code to keep it maintainable, by making a separate functionality class from Callable (issue #30).     Finalised designing front-end screens using Sketch.  Bugfixes:     Pending request removed but not added to ‘my’ list (pull request #99).     Refactor filter for list (pull request #93).     CSS not loading properly after registering on the platform (issue #79).",False

Let me share just one of our visions. The basic flow is one person funds one issue and one person resolves it. After that multiple people can fund (introducing crowdfunding). Next multiple people can resolve an issue (introducing the team concept). If you can resolve one issue, one can resolve multiple, if we start grouping issues, then we can start funding projects and teams can apply for projects. So why would it not be possible to create an international development factory? If we are able to develop a project, why only start at the development layer, why not start one step before, with the analysis. Give those people/profiles also a marketplace (doesn't exist at the moment).

How we differ from our competition in pure product : We will support multiple platforms, crowdfunding of issues and team collaboration. Additionally we will create a reputation system based on skill , that will allow you to generate reputation cross platform. For example you can get reputation from fixing a python bug on GitHub but also for providing the best answer to a python question on StackExchange. We are aware that the most challenging part is to get the entreprises onboard and are therefor already out in the field pitching our project and collecting feedback so we can make the right pivote where needed to align ourself with their needs.  We are aware of our strenghts but also of our weaknesses , therefore we try to surround us with the right people to strenghten us where we are weak (for example marketing, networking)   If I create a bounty to fix a bug how do you make sure that the ones taking the task are qualified enough? 🤔 We rely on the host platform (e.g GitHub, ...). The project maintainer is the person that will accept the solution, bad quality will be filtered out. The more people that will use our platform the more solutions that will be provided for the maintainer to pick from. Similar to platforms like 99designs.com And if malicious behaviour occurs anyone can raise a disput   Yes but let’s say task would take 1 week to finish I would have wasted 1 week 🤔 You can ask yourself the question how is this quality guaranteed today? (without the financial incentive). We start with that as a base, and we add a reputation system (including penalties) People will be able to stake tokens for working on a request, this will show devs + maintainer how many people are working on an issue   Let’s say I have a smart contract to audit I want to make sure I have a pro doing it 🤔. If a friend got kidnapped I would hire some ex special ops vs crowdsource rescue team no? 🤔 That will be a pro feature, if you are a customer that want specific people to work on it, people with a higher skill/reputation in a certain field, you will be able to configure that in your request, but the price of the request will be higher. The skill token/reputation system can be compared with the reputation on StackExchange. We plan to integrate is cross platform, allow users to get ""java skills"" from answering a question on stackexchange, but also on fixing a java bug on Github   As the platform gains more interest and devs yes but how do you solve the chicken egg problem at start? 🤔 Wwe have tokens reserved in our incentivization pool, so we can do the initial funding to attract and reward developers, and in the 2nd stage enterprises will take over   If am an enterprise I have my own devs why would I want to use your platform? That depends if you want to work with/on open source software. But the feedback we got from a VP from Samsung was the following and I quote "" Today you can not build a product without using open source"". As an example, Samsung has developers, but they do not have enough people to support 900+ open source components that they use in their products. In comes FundRequest.  Many enterprise use OSS code but don’t contribute 🙄 True , but here is a list of companies that support the Linux Foundation (more then3000). Just look at the Premium, gold and silver members (more the 200) . All are potential clients https://www.linuxfoundation.org/membership/members/   Can your platform also work for non dev tasks? Yes, at it's core it is about a request and a valid solution. We start with code, since we know that world best. The reason why we also want to include StackExchange is because it allows us not only to be less depended on one platform (e.g. GitHub), but also it allows us to switch markets. Just have a look at all the sub sections they have : https://stackexchange.com/sites Some examples : Mathematics, Music: Practice & Theory, Languages, Finance & Money,...  How will you monetize? A commission per task? We will not take any fees, we will first focus on mass adaptation. Afterwards we will offer premium features to monetize our platform. Features could be : Ads, job offers, early notifications, ...",False
