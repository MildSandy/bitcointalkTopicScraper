We released our SafeHold to help non-technical users interact with the Ellcrys network easily with a more friendly interface.  The SafeHold desktop app comes with two main features- The GUI wallet and a Miner. The wallet does basic functions like manage accounts, and make transactions. With the miner, users can easily begin mining with just a click of a button.  SafeHold is ideal for those without the experience of writing codes or using a command line interface (CLI). It is also useful for people who have never interacted with the blockchain before and would like to send transactions between themselves.  You can download the Ellcrys SafeHold here.",False

These products can be dApps, web sites, web applications and APIs, mobile applications, libraries/packages and more. We first provide a decentralized code sharing and collaboration system that allows people to start, join and contribute to projects without fear of censorship. Ellcrys will allow thousands of people share ownership of 100% of any kind of application and participate in the governance process that determines how the applications are created, updated, executed, marketed, monetized and acquired. While Ellcrys will offer a dApp system, it is more than a virtual machine for blockchain applications.  I think the major difference between Ellcrys and its competitors is that we are building a protocol that understands collaboration natively. A protocol that defines how software is owned - platforms of today cannot do this without depending on a central authority - and allows thousands to manage that software. When we launch, collaborators will be able to build decentralized and centralized applications that are primarily governed from the blockchain.  Our consensus system is based on BitcoinNG which allows the network to process transactions at a scale similar to visa. Waves blockchain has already implemented BitcoinNG and is currently one of the fastest blockchains in the industry.  We are currently in advanced talks with exchanges with volume above $1B. I am unable to disclose their names until we officially reach agreement in July.  Feel free to read our whitepaper for a more detail breakdown of our protocol. You can also check out our protocol page on our website. We have released v0.1 of our protocol. We still have more work to do but you can join the test network today.

Why we do not consider our current outlook as a relaunch but the next step of our evolution, we acknowledge that the brand has changed but the mission of decentralized software development, ownership and governance still remain the same and much clearer. We promised we would be coming back refreshed this is the manifestation of that promise. We spent a lot of time understanding the problem, researching, gathering feedback and most importantly building.  We are in the final stages of reaching agreements with several exchanges. I would love to share their names but they do not appreciate being mentioned before an agreement is finalized.",False

After the IEO, you will be given an option to transfer from https://my.ellcrys.org to your MEW wallet or any wallet of your choice by clicking a button.
