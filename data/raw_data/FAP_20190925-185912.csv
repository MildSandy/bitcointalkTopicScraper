The thing that makes this different is not enhanced security, an algorithm that allows faster mining, or a cute meme.  I like mocking things - society is always an easy target. When we think of certain types of people having more opportunities or access to wealth we think of it as 'unfair'. But what if all the people reading this right now could be those people with a higher probability of being wealthier?  Since I assume that most of the people reading this post jerk it from time to time this part is important:  Fapcoin employs a ranking algorithm that increases the value of the coins in your wallet based off of how much porn you have watched on your computer.  This only serves to aid the bitcoin community, as I'm sure most of us here look at porn at least a few times a week.  As far as 'concept coinz' go, I think Fapcoin can really make it.

I can't afford to have small flying robots analyze the mitochondria in the semen on keyboards.  I posted this idea here because I can have the benefit of subject matter experts giving me feedback, so I thank you in advance.  First, before ranking, we would look at the appdata (usually in SQLite) for popular browsers and index.dat files for internet explorer (left un-capitalized on purpose). Incognito views are still saved in these databases from my understanding and past forensics research I've done. We would take a whitelist of porn related sites (would have to be updated monthly) and regex the aforementioned databases. Some people have their favorite stars/scenes so duplicate counts are acceptable.  After we have a hit count of the regex results, we come up with a ranking based on your results. I have percentages from 105% - 200%. This ranking affects the value of the currency in the wallet.  The ladies and gentleman in the 200% can stake if they so wish. I've not considered staking, but I'll be sure to take that into consideration.  Thanks for your feedback!",False
