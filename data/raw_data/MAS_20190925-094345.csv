Furthermore, Midas has just won the Vote for Listing on Bibox which is the top 10 exchange in the world. Hence, Please do your research before saying anything and do not be negative.

At first sight, I saw the announcement about partnership between TOMO and Midas. And, I decided to scrutinize abt this project by spending my entire afternoon to read 40 pages of the WP. I found it interesting and decided to invest just a little amount of ETH in the Pioneer sale. But, time by time, new announcement about the ecosystem, statistic and vision of Midas from the cofounders continuously released. I then decided to take a gamble and put the rest bag of my eth to this project. Up to now, what team has done is terrific. The wallet is super smooth and UX/UI is clean, now I can store, swap among ERC-20 tokens and also keep my btc safely in my phone. The upcoming pool in Midas foundation will be a masternode for tomo and zcoin which will generate the passive income for Pioneers (this shit is dope) =)).

I am Midas Protocol's community manager and have been involving in project since the beginning. Firstly i want to thank you for supporting our project. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have on Midas Protocol and Midas Ecosystem.  For those who do not yet understand our project, please let me introduce a bit: Midas Protocol aims to be the smartest universal wallet for all essential crypto needs from safekeeping, intelligent trading, portfolio management, easy conversion to fiat and spending of cryptocurrencies. And we also expand our ecosystem with 3 pillars: 1/ Midas Protocol 3-in-1 Wallet: A multi-crypto-currencies wallet that users can use to store multi-cryptocurrencies and tokens; and conduct complex trading activities directly from wallet with multiple DEXs and CEXs, using multiple advanced order-types including automated execution settings; spend crypto-currencies on any consumer-brand outlets and any e-commerce platform that integrate with Midas wallet.  2/ Midas Foundation: A Decentralised Autonomous Organization (DAO) that aims to kickstart potential frontier technology projects, provide reliable information and validate projects according to Global Transparency Alliance Framework. The foundation is dedicated to bring the most of benefits and rewards to Midas Pioneers & Midasians as well as to grow and protect their investments in Midas Ecosystem. The ultimate objective of Midas Foundation is to innovate in such a way that it can provide passive income and smart investment opportunities to the Pioneers through rewards/airdrops from those projects that are supported by the Foundation.  3/ Vinex Network Crypto Exchange: A centralized exchange using Midas Token (MAS) as base coin for its trading fees. Besides trading pairs with BTC and ETH, it also has trading pair with MAS. This exchange provides not only crypto - crypto trading functionality but also crypto - fiat capability which can be enabled depending on jurisdiction. MAS token collected at Vinex Network will be burned periodically. Vinex will also be a security test & research ground for all functionalities of Midas wallet, especially different type of buy - sell customized orders and AI assisted portfolio balancing.  Hard cap sold out so far and we have completed the distribution of MAS Tokens. MAS Tokens will be listed latest in September and now they are locked.

The private key(s) only stay in your wallet mobile/desktop app, and in encrypted form. It only can be decrypted by your password (to open wallet app). The wallet app will be auto-lock if you're inactive in few minutes (configurable time).     If users are more paranoid, they can use settings to require both Password/PIN and OTP to unlock wallet.     On Midas web dashboard, we use 2-factor authentication (OTP) and consider accepting login by Civic or uPort as a way to fully blockchain-ize our platform. Besides that, we're researching other interesting ways to integrate Civic/uPort with wallet app to increase security and improve UX at the same time. I really like the idea about social circle of uPort. Another thing we're considering is using U2F, USB-dongle, FIDO,... to improve security for Midas desktop wallet app and Midas web dashboard.",False
