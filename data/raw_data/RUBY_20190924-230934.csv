The best would be to lock bounty tokens before entering exchange.

Again, bounty tokens are not locked. And the reality is that the value of tokens is doing N times better when token has volume without initial bounty token dump , buy orders accumulate over time . In this way when bounty tokens come in exchange they have much much thicker buy books which is better for bounty hunters and price of tokens. At this market news are irrelevant, the only news that tend to matter is big listings.  Also there was a an option to pay in ETH but that s out of question as in most projects.",True

The chaos created by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s drastic demonetization demonstrates the potential and danger of the cashless future Modi stunned Indians on November 8, 2016, when he went on TV and declared that the nation’s two most popular banknotes would be worthless within 50 days. All 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee notes were withdrawn from circulation and replaced with new bills.  Demonetization was designed to discourage terrorism, smuggling, organized crime, tax evasion, and counterfeiting, Modi claimed. Some government officials later admitted the move was done to force India into a cashless society. Demonetization Increases the Tax Base Cynics might call the move a sneaky tax increase. India’s tax base did grow because the number of income tax returns in the country by 25%, Forbes contributor Suparna Dutt D’Cunha noted.  Most electronic methods like digital wallets require a bank account, which makes it easier to file a tax return. Less than 3%; (fewer than 30 million) of India’s 1.25 billion people file income tax returns.  India’s experiences will undoubtedly attract the attention of politicians and officials in other revenue-starved nations. Countries likely to follow India’s lead are Latin American nations; like Venezuela and Brazil where just 20% to 39% of the population have bank accounts.  An obvious way for governments to increase the rate of taxation is to encourage the use of digital wallets. Sales or income tax levies can be collected directly from digital wallet transactions with the withholding tax.",True

And how much would it be? How can we use your software if we are just a regular crypto user/trader, not really a big time one?  In terms of development of the software, we currently only working on the UI/UX. We are hoping to use the proceeds of the ICO to build our in-house team and hire the necessary staff to help us complete the project.  The costs of the project could vary significantly depending on the quality. Because we want to develop a very high-quality app (and exchange), we are predicting that the cost of each will be around $500,000-$1,000,000 USD. Combined, the cost will of development should be around 1-2 million USD.  Well, crypto-users will find it incredibly useful because it simplifies your wallets and money into one simple, easy-to-use payment platform. You won't have to enter-in the long Ethereum address to send money to your friends. Instead, you'll select their name from your contacts list and it will automatically send it to them. If they don't have an account, they will be prompted to create one (before your money is sent). Traders will find the app incredibly useful because they can make these payments all while accessing our exchange (Rubiex) in-app.  You don't need to be a ""big time"" trader or user to benefit--it is actually designed for the little guys. The purpose of it is to make small crypto-payments between friends much more easy and simple. Larger payments come with higher risk on our end, and since we are a just a startup, we would encourage those making larger payments to use some of the more established exchanges and mechanisms until we have built up our resources.   If you have any more questions, please let us know!  Thanks, Team Rubius   With how things are running here, you might not get your target funding. So what will happen if you haven't reached your targets? Are you still gonna pursue the ""very high-quality app"" and exchange? Or just return the money to your investors once you haven't get your ico funds?  We agree 100%, which is why we have postponed our ICO and expanded our Roadmap a bit. We will now be doing a pre-sale starting on July 31st and the main ICO will begin on August 21st, 2018.  In regards to your questions on reaching the targets, it depends on the price of Ethereum at the time and how much money we actually raise. We plan to address the situation on a case-by-case basis, but if we determine that we did not raise enough money to produce the software, then we will return the funds back to the ICO participants.",True

Quote from: Julina on May 01, 2018, 10:54:43 PM what is the price of the token in dollar equivalent? I plan to participate in pre-sales. And what is the minimum investment?  The price is based on the price of Ether, so it's dollar equivalent price will vary as Ether changes in price. Currently, with the price of Ethereum at $680, the cost per 7000 RUBY will be $680 (because 1 ETH = 7000 RUBY for the first week). This is equivalent to roughly 10 cents per RUBY.  The minimum investment will be 1 ETH or $1000 USD. We have set this high minimum because we are only looking for accredited U.S. investors.   Quote from: tippytoes on May 02, 2018, 01:35:25 AM So far, what stage are you in terms of the development of your software? And how much would it be? How can we use your software if we are just a regular crypto user/trader, not really a big time one?  In terms of development of the software, we currently only working on the UI/UX. We are hoping to use the proceeds of the ICO to build our in-house team and hire the necessary staff to help us complete the project.  The costs of the project could vary significantly depending on the quality. Because we want to develop a very high-quality app (and exchange), we are predicting that the cost of each will be around $500,000-$1,000,000 USD.
