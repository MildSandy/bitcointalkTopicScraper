Instead of the answer they already have bought the land or rented, I have received the ban. They don't answer questions of people in telegrams. Start date of construction are constantly transferred. The counter on the website of the platform is nullified and started at first. The token price since March has fallen by 22 times. (From 0:06 cents to 0.0033 cents). At the exrates exchange the course is fake. The website of the platform is left unfinished. Some pages are completed by fish. The date of the beginning of collecting and construction of facilities are constantly postponed. Bitrent Hub in San Francisco will be ready at the end of 2019? Seriously? Recently it has been written in August, 2019. The token still isn't used in any way. Therefore the price falls. The actual distribution of tokens in roadmap doesn't correspond to real. 2 million tokens which have come on Bit-z as an award for vote aren't specified. Administrators of bitrent say that they have no to the relation to investment boxing on yobit. Investment on yobit exists already half a year. These are very serious figures. Who sponsors him? Who this generous person? There are practically no news. Only pictures and conferences on which any person can get. The actual price of a token 4 times lower than is specified coinmarketcap. Exrates gives the price 900% higher than at other exchanges. Real capitalization of a token at the price of $0.0033 below 3 million dollars. For this and last year they have written out to themselves salary more than 3 million dollars. Next year there are more than 2 million dollars. There are no construction works on any object. There are no buildings, there is no earning money, from next year on roadmap they will spend more than 2 million dollars. How can be such project in the near future ?

You will never see unbelievable rate jumps for the week or  two again, since every transaction is in the legal field, where we were  originally. - Projects team is very big and consists of professionals, for the summer it has doubled.  Now concerning  the items you sent:: 1. The first project (test) on the platform is the Unity Tower. This is a large and capacious project, with a total area of 120'000 m2. We are not aware about your experience in construction, but we have to notice, that such project takes time and a lot of resources. We collected 3,000,000 dollars for the project, which is not final cost of the project, but it is probably a lot for a young and developing company, like Bitrent. The construction company was preparing all the documentation, about what was the constant declaration on our info resources, also the company was invested by fiat funds from the real sector of economy for the beginning of the construction. Currently all the issues are solved, and this Friday we start pile-hole boring. Which is proving the fact that the first of our projects has begun and everything is going according to the plan, we are deeply thankful to our inventors, to those who had trusted in our goal and continue to support us along our path. Concerning Bitrent Hub, we really have not started the fees yet, due to the fact that US legislation is indeed complicated and Crypto-currency market has significantly decreased lately, all as a result of non-valid tokens, which have been manipulating  on the token market and real volumes of trades, to the date this fraud activity has fallen apart and everything has returned to the actual volumes. Therefore we solved the problem of the Hub and together with the partner company we developed an absolutely new and unique conception with smaller investments, which includes 150 Habs, with space of 3000 m2, which will be announced on the nearest days. 2. Replenishment of our investment box is done by our Chinese partners, who are the key strategic partners of Bitrent, they have invested on the first stages of the project and have a biggest number of primary bonus tokens. In any ICO project, there are such partners. From 10-25% of the net profit of the object from investment done via the Bitrent platform, will go to the purchase and burning of the RNTB tokens. Coincidentally with every other project and months of their work, the number of tokens will decrease. Do you understand what will happen to the rate? 3. You are right about the Exrates exchange. We have written to them a great number of letter about exclusion of our token from their exchange. And only today we have got a response. Concerning the rate we will repeat ourselves and notice that we are not taking any advantage of populism and pamps. If business works, the rate will increase and it goes without saying. Further on we will discuss the question of business and how it works. 4. Over the year a massive job has been done. And as you might know pioneers always have difficulties. We have been around half of the world, doubled our team, opened a number of representative offices and we signed numerous partnership agreements.  Success of any business, it's a number of total users and if the proposed product is good and on the market, and that exactly what we have got as a  result.   That is why expanding our community was so important in such countries as: India, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, China, Malaysia, Philippines, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia,Turkey, Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, France, Germany,Italy, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman , USA, Canada. How do you think? Is it a small amount of job by Bitrent team to: fly over all of these countries several times, hold negotiations, sign all the necessary contracts and finally to prepare and present speeches and   public presentations for dozens of times before the community  of all this countries. Is it fast for 8/9 months? For the creation of any kind of million dollar business, you need years of hard work. And you want to have the same result in 5 months after the completion of the ICO and have it ready for 100%, but it does not actually happen like a miracle! In the application, we provided a full report on the business of the company for the third quarter of 2018 and you can compare it with other projects, if you feel any sort of necessity in it. At this time, the Bitrent community is close to 150'000 people. The number of partner companies is close to 100, on our info resources (11) we have posted around 1000 news articles, video and photo reports from presentations and meetings. Representatives of the Bitrent company have taken a part and hosted presentations on more than 50 global Blockchain conferences.There are close to 40 publications about Bitrent, and also Bitrent Hub , on such resources as Merkle, Huffington Post, BTC-Echo, BuzzFeed, CoinSpeaker, CoinTelegraph, Forexcrunch … Or do you think that we need to post new projects infinitely and they will certainly wait for time until we grow community with the potential to gather all the necessary resources within three months. Any project posted on our platform should be able to collect the needed summ three or four month before the launch, in other words, if we do not collect the estimated sum, we must return it  to investors. 5.   Bitrent team invites you on a construction site in Odessa at Friday, where you can personally  witness  the process of pile-hole boring. 6. Concerning  the work of the company, we propose to arrange webinar in order to explain and discuss what amount work was done and on what stage Bitrent currently is. 7. Lottery,  is just one of the hundred marketing steps done by our company. It is completely voluntary and you are not obligated to do it. 8. We do not completely understand why you posted this item, everything is distributed as it was announced. If there are errors for 1 billion tokens which is 2%. And this is so  important for you, we will solve this by checking second time. 9. Answered above. 10. Everything is very simple. - The main Bitrent token - RNTB, and we do not have any other. - Each object on the platform has its own token for sq.m binded to this very object. This is security token. - Any kind of partnership is connected with people. Of course Decenturion, Cryptonomics, Chinese Blockchain Alliance and other, are our  acquaintances. We meet on various events, since it is common for cryptoworld, and that is how this business works. Probably when the capitalization will reach $ 10 million, this will not be the same kind of conversation because of new numerous employees! 11. As we described above in our answer to this question. These salaries are connected to the project fees, if there are no fees,  there are no salaries. In a case when we have fees this is  % for the team. 12. We are not ICO project. This is already an active business for the investment in construction and creation of passive income for our investors. The USA does not have a prohibition on tokens, but only if they are registered with SEC ( The United States Securities and Exchange Commission, Securities Commission) and focused on investment into the countrie. 13. We will figure out who was banned and for what reason. It is democratic channel, where any person can express themself on the any topic they like, but in a case of obscene language you of course be banned. In other cases, you can express any sort of opinion that can be clearly  be seen on our channel, even if it is said frankly. What rudeness, these are our competitors spoil our reputation.  We ask to respect else's work the same as we respect yours!",False

The BitRent platform provides data visualization of objects under construction in 3D format for every, without exception, client. As it has been mentioned before, to reach this goal our top management involved SIXENSE company.  SIXENSE is a group of world-class excellence in digital services and solutions for:  - Construction project management : solutions for planning, monitoring and controlling construction sites - Asset management : solutions for managing, controlling and maintaining assets - Risk management : universal solutions for all types of risks  For more than 20 years SIXENSE has been actively creating and offering solutions within poles of expertise — engineering, technologies and digital space. SIXENSE’s principal mission is to provide support to designers, builders, operators to successfully achieve set goals.  During the meeting with SIXENSE Digital, the company professionals held the presentation of the software product. At the same time SIXENSE representatives offered out-of-the-box solutions to support designers and builders of BitRent platform, which are all about managing construction projects by applying specific RFID tags to effectively monitor construction processes. This software allows to mark accurate locations of RFID tags, which will then be displayed in 3D model. Program operators will be responsible for status change of these tags: planned, mounted, signal received and so on.  By following this approach, our team will be able to not only control risks, but also, even more importantly, manage them effectively.  At this time, we’re waiting for a demo-version of the software so that BitRent developers may analyze it and define which components require further configuration to meet the functionality of the platform and then actively use it.  For the convenience of our investors, all the mentioned above information will be presented in a visually understandable form.

In the light of hot speculations about Facebook and Google decisions to ban ads connected to bitcoin, Blockchain, cryptocurrencies and ICO, BitRent Team aims to find genuine motives behind the decision of mega corporations.  In January 2018, Facebook together with Google and also Twitter made a decision to completely ban cryptocurrency advertising in their Social Networks.  Companies’ official representatives explained that they simply want to protect all consumers of their content from ICO scams, fraudulent token sales, Ponzi schemes and a lot more.  The reason is quite convincing, but interviews by companies’ founders and leaders suggest different.  Heads of Facebook, Google and Twitter have several times mentioned about their positive attitude toward Blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and even speculated on using these technologies in the architecture of their Social Networks.  We tend to believe more and more in analysts’ ideas that these Internet market leaders are taking a break only to “blow up” the market with their own cryptocurrencies.  BitRent Team suggests that very soon Facebook, Google, Twitter and other corporations will join the Blockchain industry. The only question is — when and how?  What do you think?  Are these leading Social Networks playing fair by banning crypto and Blockchain ads, and thus, getting a significant advantage on the way to join crypto space on their own “comfortable” terms?

The blockchain platform BitRent is not an initiative of a local character, but an undertaking of a global scale. The main goal of the project founders is to unite two global sectors — investment and real estate. It is all meant to create a single secure network for financial transactions in the real estate area and, thus, maintain vital functions of the whole economy sector.  Today BitRent reminds Hyperledger — the blockchain platform that is still on the way to the cryptocurrency Olympus. Both platforms are focused on filling their niches in the international blockchain and cryptocurrency community. Like Hyperledger, the BitRent team is absolutely enthusiastic about working on the unique combination of RFID, Smart Contracts and BIM technologies.  BitRent builds a platform in the form of a network to facilitate cooperation between organisation in a single system. The main objective is to provide similar conditions for all users of the platform in the course of real estate operations powered by the distributed ledger.  According to the BitRent CTO, the platform is meant to unite investors and developers with no intermediaries, which leads to significant reduction of developers’ expenses and provides a way for absolutely everyone to invest in construction projects at any stage in every country of the world.  Now we will describe the advantages that will undoubtedly give a breath of fresh air to the whole sector for years to come.  The first advantage refers to monitoring of quality and construction time. Applying RFID-tags and Smart Contracts, BitRent minimizes human factor in the course of construction control.  It is a well-known fact that minimization of the impact of human factor inevitably results in construction quality improvement.  The second advantage is all about investor protection. In simple terms, developers will not be able to get further financing unless the previous construction stage is completed.  And again the combination of Smart Contract and RFID-tag appears on the horizon. In order for the next stage financing to be unlocked, the aggregated information from RFID-tags needs first to be sent to specific Smart Contract. If all the data meets the information in the BIM model, then the construction works are completed with corresponding quality and within the time, frames set in advance. Only once the mentioned above steps are made, the next stage financial provision is sent to a developer.  Managing life cycle of a building with a help of BIM is our present, not a future. More and more developers start applying information modeling of building in the course of construction.  Shift to BIM is a conscious choice, with BitRent’s team already working together with Sixense to develop the first demo version of main functions and a set of configurations.  Right in the software one may easily mark the exact location of RFID-tags that later will be shown in the 3D model.  BitRent looks to the future, that’s why the company’s final goal is to tokenize the already constructed buildings and sell real estate objects with a help of Smart Contracts anywhere in the world.  https://medium.com/@bitrent/rntb-ranked-up-a0a055684ce9https://coinscap.org/coin/rntb  https://bitrent.uk  https://www.facebook.com/bitrentplatform/  https://medium.com/@bitrent  https://twitter.com/bit_rent  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2214811  https://t.me/bitrentio  https://www.instagram.com/bitrent_official/  https://www.reddit.com/r/bitrent/  https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitrent/",False

The main initiator of the event was an E-commerce Association of China.

The BitRent team received an official invitation to take part in the exhibition as a representative and leader of the blockchain platform in the field of real estate.  The topic of this blockchain event became “Uniting epochs, paths and the future.” In the course of 2 days the number of attendees reached more than 2 000 people — investors, blockchain enthusiasts and companies, representatives of government institutions, mass media and so on.  Blockchain is the heart of the third techno revolution of the Internet, with the Blockchain Expo of Wanguo to be the best platform to hold meetings for breakthrough members of the blockchain industry from the whole world.

The introduction of the BitRent platform will change the investment structure in the real estate and provide a unique future for the construction market.  While the market comes back to the positive condition, Blockchain Expo of Wanguo acts as a pacemaker for the sector. Moreover, the stable growth of Bitcoin and other popular currencies strengthens the whole industry.  It’s absolutely impossible to imagine how this event could go without the BitRent representatives — the blockchain platform providing the possibility to buy real estate.  The BitRent platform is an inevitable part of the blockchain application scenario. During this very event, apart from discussions with investors regarding details of blockchain usage and plans for further development, much attention was given to the promotion of “blockchain+application” model and creation of the standard approach for the blockchain sector.  https://bitrent.uk  https://www.facebook.com/bitrentplatform/  https://medium.com/@bitrent  https://twitter.com/bit_rent  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2214811  https://t.me/bitrentio  https://www.instagram.com/bitrent_official/  https://www.reddit.com/r/bitrent/  https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitrent/",False

RFID-solution for in-depth monitoring  Our technical experts conducted several meetings with manufacturing companies of RFID-tags. They found out tasks to be totally understandable and absolutely interesting. Following the meeting, we found out that tags vary — different types of different size — even in the form of stickers. In other words, such “stickers” can be easily mounted on windows, which opens a way to monitor not only carcassing process, but also finishing works to some extent. Moreover, these tags can be used to tie communication lines around and monitor them as well. We plan to use concrete tags BRIC for buildings on the BitRent platform. BRICs have stronger signals — they will be able to work their way through the high density materials with low data throughput.  Our scanners will read all tags mounted in a room only within several seconds — in other words, there’s no need to approach the location of each and every tag. The exact number of tags is entered in the system that constantly waits for signals to come in. In case if a certain tag is in range, the signal is successfully received; but if not, the tag is marked red in the system. Consequently, the BitRent system offers total monitoring and status report of the whole amount of tags.  We’ve already prepared a partnership agreement, which requires initial testing of tags at construction sites under real-life conditions.  Given the fact that BitRent is considered to be a pioneer in this area, we’re aimed at just the highest possible quality of tags.  Application with unique functionality  The main function of the application is sending data from scanners to the BitRent system to be later recorded in the blockchain. At this stage we plan to carry out a phased implementation of data transmission function. However, having finished working on this solution, our team will start working on “instant data transmission” feature. To achieve this, it will be necessary to propose changes in the application algorithm, which will later be put into operation by our Eastern European partners.  While talking this task, we will find the most simple and handy solution. In the meantime, our technical department is focused on building the function to receive coordinates to control locations of tags in positions defined by the plan within the BitRent system.  We designed specific criteria for that:  reliability: information is sent to the system with 100% probability without any miscommunication; simplicity: the less links we have, the less problems and breakdowns we face; independence: the application operates in any part of the world. Blockchain prototype operating at full capacity  Our platform has a totally operational prototype, which will be improved and finalized until it reaches the quality established by the needs of our clients and market realia.  Currently our blockchain records each and every action. No changes can be made without breaking the whole chain. In fact, once the change is made, the system records it and mark as an external interference with the aim to corrupt the integrity of chain operations on the BitRent platform.  In other words, the blockchain of the BitRent platform carries out the logging process — analysis of all actions in terms of both accounts of certain users and the whole blockchain system. The depth level of logging is to be configured further.  Next Generation Visualization  The BitRent platform provides data visualization of objects under construction in 3D format for every, without exception, client. As it has been mentioned before, to reach this goal our top management involved the Sixense company. At this time, we’re waiting for a demo-version of the software so that the BitRent developers may analyze it and define which components require further configuration to meet the functionality of the platform.  The program allows to mark exact locations of tags that will later be displayed in 3D model. Program operator will be responsible for changing the status of tags: planned; mounted; signal received and etc.  For the convenience of our investors, all the mentioned above information will be presented in a visually understandable form.  “China BLockchain Alliance Club” Conference  While our technical department was looking for solutions, the leaders of the BitRent platform took part in the international conference of the leading blockchain club in Asia — China Blockchain Alliance Club.  The BitRent team was presented by founder Dmitriy Starovoitov, co-founder Sergei Kyrylovskiy, business developer Igor Pavlov and Asian partner Mr. Dong.  The leader of the BitRent team presented the annual report and shared about successful ICO. The presentation was a true success, with Mr. Starovoitov to be invited for an interview.  Every representative of the BitRent team spoke about practical application of blockchain and presented the guidance for standardization of processes in the construction sector.

The founder of China Blockchain Alliance Club thanked all members of the organization for joint efforts toward goal-oriented development.  During the past year, China Blockchain Alliance Club pushed the idea of blockchain and held conferences across Asia, with lots of leading blockchain experts to have a chance to meet the progressive views of the BitRent platform in the construction area.  The BitRent team was represented by the following persons at the conference: Dmitriy Starovoitov, founder; Sergei Kyrylovskiy, co-founder; and Igor Pavlov, Chief Business Developer.  The leader of the BitRent team shared about recently finished ICO and successful launch of the BitRent.UK platform with active objects that are open for investments. The presentation of the project proved effective and practical to such an extent that the founder of the company — Dmitriy Starovoitov — was invited for an interview by one of tech TV channels.  The hosts of the event focused on building successful organizational culture of the China Blockchain Alliance Club and discussed three blocks of questions: - Blockchain and its application - Blockchain and us - Quick development?  Every BitRent representative shared practical experience of blockchain application and presented a guide for standardizing processes in the construction field.  Apart from the fact that all guests were enriched with practical blockchain use cases in the construction sector, they also received red envelopes with nice bonus — RNTB.  It is worth mentioning that the hosts of the conference carried out a lottery for guests: the luckiest ones — 31 persons in total — got prizes. 15 guests got 200 RNTB, another 15–500 RNTB and the winner — 5000 RNTB!

The central focus of the event was blockchain and its cross-industrial flexibility and adaptability.  The event was attended by CEOs of leading corporations across diverse sectors on the Chinese market. Thus, more than 800 entrepreneurs and businessmen could get to meet firsthand the multi-blockchain platform BitRent, its present and future goals as well as get to know with the unique nature of the first meaningful token RNTB.  According to one of BitRent speakers, the progressive approach of the platform lies in the fact that it opens the doors to the investment world to almost any human being on the Earth — the platform welcomes even small investment amounts. Investors at BitRent can start financing any project at any construction stage.  The platform completely digitizes all construction stages. Thanks to a private blockchain powered by Hyperledger, every construction stage is recorded and safely stored in informational blocks. All transactions are regulated by Smart Contracts, which, via RFID-tags, check the quality of work performed. Once Smart Contracts find confirmation that all conditions are met, it releases financing for the next stage. The platform sticks to a stage-to-stage pattern.  Meaningful token RNTB lays the foundation for structuring a new generation of tokens that preserve their value no matter what and provide their holders with real authority.  We’re confident that investment advantages provided by the BitRent platform will draw 1% from global real estate investments at the minimum.  BitRent is not just another service — it’s a lifestyle. We implant consistent structure and order in the construction industry.  Moving from stage to stage — 1% at first, and then, the whole world!

The development of the platform was conducted alongside the ICO stage, which gave investors a chance to see the first version of the platform long before the end of the ICO. This, again, confirms the fact that BitRent is a team of professionals.  Moreover, our IT department posted Smart Contracts and code on the GitHub repository. Thus, investors are empowered to check and monitor the development of technical aspects of the platform.  We invite every current or potential user to test the platform at the following URL bitrent.uk and later share your questions and comments.  The final release is expected in mid- or late- April, while the official application will be available as early as May.  First projects  Our developers have already finalized 13 Smart Contracts for the first construction object on the platform — Unity Towers. The project is open for fundraising. We’ve already begun working on the corresponding Smart Contracts for the second object — Klauzal Residence.  Security and Total control  Our founders aim to make sure that BitRent investors feel entirely secured and, at the same time, in total control of the construction process. To achieve that, BitRent entered into negotiations with Identity Mind Global from the USA — the company providing KYC/AML services. Besides, we will involve Sixense — one of the leaders on the monitoring market — to build the most efficient visualization system for construction monitoring.  Partnership  Moreover, our top management entered into a partnership with ICOBox, Cryptonomics Capital and blockchain expert from India — RadhaKrishna Thatavarti.  BitRent aims to implement technical means designed by ICOBox to automate a range of aspects regarding offering of tokens, which correspond to shares in construction objects within the platform, and integrate intelligent decisions for collateral issues of legal and marketing nature.  In this way, BitRent obtained more possibilities to expand its presence both on the territory of South Asia and Europe and across CIS nations.  Updated design and Private blockchain  The first days of April will be marked by the presentation of updated design of the BitRent platform.

Less than 5 days ago the first stage of our Global Roadshow came to a close. Summing up, we can confidently state that one more important step was made to unite the construction worldwide under the blockchain platform BitRent.  Our team of professionals gradually expands. Now mister Thatavarti, world-class blockchain leader, officially represents the interests of BitRent on the territory of India. He’s a chairman and leading blockchain expert in the Global Blockchain Pioneers Association. We’re sure that his more than 10-year experience will open a way for BitRent to dominate the market of real estate investments in the South Asia.  Two leading BitRent platform specialists — Igor Pavlov, BitRent Business Developer, and Dmitriy Kolesnik, CTO, shared the secrets of functionality and development of the platform.  Negotiations with Identity Mind Global from the US are on the finishing stage. This company is famous for providing quality connection to KYC/AML services. Moreover, we will most definitely make use of Sixense services — one of the monitoring market leaders that provide peak efficiency for construction process visualization. Our technical expert seized the moment to underline the unique application of RFID-tags in the construction and their important role — a linchpin inside of the distributed ledger chain of construction and financing phases.  Many people ask the question “Whether BitRent is capable of becoming a construction pattern of the future and complete substitution for the present conservative approach?”  Of course! Otherwise, what’s the point of launching the platform on this scale?!  Anyway, we invite you to take part and reflect on the platform on the discussion page of our partner across the South Asian region https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6382848394922156032/ and study for yourself available information and documents around our web resources: website — https://bitrent.io, code repository on GitHub — https://github.com/bitrent, social networks — Facebook https://www.facebook.com/bitrentplatform, Telegram https://t.me/bitrentio and blog — Medium https://medium.com/@bitrent  Ask questions and comment the news — our feedback helps us to make the BitRent product better.

Given that I am in the architecture business, I have a pretty good grasp on how building construction, investment, development, implementation, building systems and monitoring works. I would love Dev to provide insight on how they plan to address the implementation of the system.  Like with any new product, education is key to adoption. Without adoption you will have no working utility. How are you going to convince developers and builders alike to use your product and on that note, what is the product? Seems like this will be a centralized system used to develop, build and monitor the building and construction, am I right to assume this is ONLY to be used on projects your team will be building and investing in? Built building monitoring systems already exist and already have infrastructure and programs in place and it comes at a cost. You can NOT monitor mechanical system efficiency with RFID alone, you need sensors in the units, sensors in the spaces, you need to map out changes over time, and then implement the most efficient use of the system. I can see the use of blockchain to aid the monitoring of these systems, but how will you develop the programming and controls of it?  What will the cost to the developer and builder be? The most important aspect of any project is budget, so how do you rationalize the additional costs and in what way does it increase efficiency, is this what the utility of the token is? Most products are specified to be local or by trade so that the Contractors can get the lowest cost and the lowest labor possible, this business revolves around bottom lines. How do you track labor on blockchain? When you are tracking building material, how does that translate to tracking a wall being built? It has to be manual input because that technology does not exist yet. How do you track waste when a 4x8 piece of gypsum board is cut down to fit the wall? Does the blockchain tell the contractor exactly where to use that leftover piece? This creates inefficiency as trades know much better how to build the system with field conditions then any program can.There is no need for development of RFID if you are using local products, I can see the use for products that are shipped from overseas, but even then you are only tracking logistics and you cannot reduce manufacturing lead times.  Additionally, I feel like your introduction of BIM is misleading. BIM is of technical use in the generation of the project, design and construction documents, BUT you still need people with the knowledge and know how to design and build the building. Efficiency of the BIM solely relys on the people working the model, you cannot prevent human mistake nor track them with the blockchain unless you are knowledgeable in the field. It is physically impossible to predict all outcomes of construction with a BIM model. I use BIM (Revit) on a daily basis and there has never been a large project without issues, I don't see the blockchain being able to help discern or resolve field issues and requests for information (RFI). Do you give the user control in making field decisions? How is this any different from already established investment pools?  It seems like this is basically a seed fund to development projects. I mean, how to you propose to have the blockchain resolve an failed Mechanical, Electrical, or Plumbing inspection? How would the blockchain resolve or assess existing site conditions? A concrete pour did not cure correctly due to weather, now you have to re-pour and it sets the project back a full week you have to pay for the new pour, this kind of cost is a standard and gets added on to the budget, how is that resolved? Does the blockchain help decide what items to 'value engineer' when issues arise and construction starts to exceed the budget? I guess my real issue with this is that there are factors in construction that require experienced people to make difficult decisions in order for projects to be successful and I don't see the utility of this token resolving those issues.  Hope this information helps those investing in this project.",False

Mister Zhang, BitRent’s advisor, presented the BitRent platform with more details. He told that the platform provides investors with high level of security through the use of Smart Contracts.

This means that the verification process within the BitRent platform won’t be easy to pass for each of them. Only those who have credible reputation and a record of accomplished projects with minimal budget, quality and time variances.

With BitRent, investors can sleep with a peaceful mind and never worry about market fluctuations or other force majeures. Why? Investment in BitRent is as solid and stable as structural units of buildings on the platform.

While building the platform, the founders focused on offering the world of real estate construction a completely decentralized approach and operational model. In order to achieve this BitRent created RNTB — a meaningful token. It’s a first-of-its-kind token that is backed by built real estate and real economy sector. Within the BitRent platform, RNTB acts as a means of payment of a wide range of services. If a user is willing to invest in a new object on the platform, with the funds already contributed to a different project, he/she can sell or exchange his shares even if the construction process is still on the go.  Those who want to get more information on the platform had to wait in line in front of the BitRent exhibition stand and take a chance to talk with BitRent representatives about the platform and the first construction object — Unity Towers.  Unity Towers is a unique project — the first tokenized building — that will definitely form the backbone for other similar objects.  We hasten to inform you that UNT tokens are already put on the market. Each UNT token stands for square meters in the building, so now you don’t have to buy a whole apartment. You’re free to buy whatever piece of the space that best meets your criteria.  Waiting for a huge excitement around the project in Israel and Shanghai!  #London #ICO #BitRent #bitcoin #conference #platform #token #medium #rntb #TokenSale #crypto #economics #coin #coins #utility #news",False

The event was named “BitRent Private Conference”.  Who Participated? Compacts of intent and commitment were signed by well-known developers of the UAE: Damac, Dubai Property, 22 carats, Kempinski, Virtue GI.  The conference was visited by investors, whose total wealth according to Forbes is in excess of more than 15 000 000 000 US dollars. The event was attended by Sheikh Saif Al Mansoori, Sheikh Sultan Al Nuaimi, investors Mahendra Patel. The invited guests included:  • Abdulkarim Safwan, Vice President of Damac;  • Mohamed Mahgoub, Chamber of Commerce and Industry;  • Saif Al Mansouri, Ben Mansuri Company;  • Abdulhakim Mahmood, Director, Dubai Properties Group;  • Alexander Pushilin, a private investor;  • Mohamed Fawad Akber CEO of AIP;  • Mahendra Patel, GEAP group member;  • Maria Marchenko, founder of Capric Media; • Saif Al Mansouri Partner — Bin Mansouri Company  • Pradeep Padmanabahan, director of the OBS group;  The Purpose of BitRent Private Conference The main goal of the presentation, set by the creators of the project Dmitry Starovoitov, Igor Pavlov and Vadim Dashut, was to gather the leaders of crypto clubs, blockchain funds and leading specialists in the construction industry, as well as to create favorable conditions for establishing business ties. The presentation of the unique constructional blockchain-platform and the first tokenized facility allowed us to uncover the potential of BitRent for the development of the construction industry and to demonstrate the real estate sector’s and crypto economy’s points of convergence.  The platform will help solve the main issues of the construction market such as closedness and conservatism. It will give investors the opportunity not only to invest resources, but also to fully control the construction of any facilities.  Platform’s Advantages One of the key advantages of BitRent is the low entry threshold. This allows to attract almost unlimited number of participants to any construction projects. The security of operations on the platform is guaranteed by Blockchain, Smart Contracts, BIM and RFID technologies.  Participants of the system get full access to the database of objects under construction, they can select an object for the parameters of interest, vote for the priority of projects, monitor the stages of a construction process in real time. BitRent does not have geo-references. Anyone can invest in projects around the world.  Investors not only receive up to 30% of the profit from investments, but also become the share owners of the abuilding objects. Financial resources invested in platform projects are protected from exchange fluctuations. And the exact procedure of investing funds and of construction control are extremely simple and transparent.  Construction companies can join the system at any stage of construction. They get access to the participants’ database and the right to present themselves to the platform participants and thereby attract investments.  What was Presented? BitRent’s founders presented the functionality of the platform, and representatives of its strategic partner the construction giant Megaline presented the very first facility — Unity Towers.  Unity Towers is a complex of three skyscrapers that combine the functions of a residential complex, a hotel, a modern business co-working center, an IT-Hub with an adjacent infrastructure with a separate parking building for 450 cars. The complex will be located in the resort area with a direct access to the Black Sea. This will be one of the key advantages for investors while choosing an investment object.  About BitRent Platform participants, known as owners of RNTB-tokens (BitRent crypto currency), have the right to directly influence the speed of construction of selected constructional objects. They can manage shares in projects at their discretion, buy and sell square meters.  Details on the features of BitRent can be found on the official site https://bitrent.uk/.",False

Thus, the platform will open the doors to the field of investment for an increasing number of people, ready to change the outdated and unprofitable construction formula. We follow a well-established and reliable model: we divide building objects into shares, which are then introduced into the blockchain system.

We were engaged in the development of the platform, and spoke at the blockchain conferences and summits in New York, Dubai, Hong Kong and other blockchain capitals. Then, we successfully conducted the Pre-sale and went to ICO, and the RNTB token is already taking part in trading on crypto-exchanges.  Presentation in Dubai  Following the official launch of the platform, we have already planned to organize the BitRent Blockchain Conference in March in order to present our product to a narrow circle of investors, as well as to potential BitRent community users.  Preparing for Incredible RoadShow since mid-February  This whole week our team dedicated to the preparation for a large-scale RoadShow, during which the BitRent team will present the platform, the first construction object and plans for the coming year in all corners of the world — the USA, Great Britain, Belarus, Germany, Dubai, Russia, China and Israel.

We made a small trip on a yacht from Dubai Marina to World Islands and all present participants had an amazing opportunity to discuss topical business issues and share relevant experience.  The BitRent team also received an invitation and we managed to hold several important meetings.  Simultaneously with this event, our representatives in the UAE carried a successful presentation of the BitRent platform at the Radisson Blu Hotel in Dubai Media City during the Crypto conference hosted by Planet Blockchain. This event was devoted to the review of the “top” ICOs, which were launched in the February-March period. The BitRent project was the first to be introduced — a PropTech platform from construction market professionals built with the use of the most cutting-edge blockchain technologies. Here’s what the hosts said about BitRent:  “It is the first blockchain platform meant to attract commercial and residential property investments at an early stage of construction in order to gain maximum profit by selling and renting out the acquired property.” After the presentation, our team provided all participants with a detailed report about the innovative advantages of the platform, which in the near future will inevitably lead to efficiency and transparency rise at all levels of construction.",False

The real catalyst for the increased focus on the BitRent platform and its construction challenges was the speech by BitRent’s CTO — Dmitriy Kolesnik.  Dmitry made a brief journey into the main problems of the construction and real estate market, shared about the unique blockchain platform for organizing investments in construction, and was quite confident to answer all points of interest raised by the audience. Such a complex and exhaustive presentation allowed nobody to stay indifferent — the audience applauded vigorously and did not want to let the BitRent’s CTO go.  In fact, the presentation simply moved to the stands, where Dmitriy gave interviews to several local TV channels.  Links to the interviews on our channels are to come out soon!  Right now, the other part of our team is in Berlin 100% ready for tomorrow’s presentation of the platform. Today, at the BitRent brand stand, we introduced the most prominent platform features to participants in the course of a series of workshops.

This year was extremely active, but we aim to outachieve it in the upcoming months of 2018.  In January, we will visit Finwise Summit in Macau aimed to encourage interaction among global fintech industry participants and to advocate global fintech developments. The event will feature the latest blockchain technologies, the best fintech enterprises, future financial blockchain applications, trends and progresses.  Besides, we’re to go to Dubai once again and attend Dubai International Blockchain Summit — the largest gathering of Blockchain in Middle East.

Once the global audience believed that there’s a chance not only to to enter this market, but also withdraw from it — not empty-handed, but with considerable dividends — the liquidity increased exponentially, cryptocurrencies went sky-high and the number of ICO launches moved beyond a hundred per month.  Apart from the fact that a shift to digital format brings about the increase in speed, security and usability for handling operations, it also leads to decrease in need for middlemen.  Changes to take place  Such changes in the infrastructure are meant to bring about numerous positive shifts:      Functionality: there will be new plugin modules created — business logic and Smart Contracts;     Security: the opportunity to conduct transparent audit in real-time mode with a complete access to current results for all parties, and also a bulletproof data synchronization among traders;     Management: collective asset management that does not require mutual trust;     Speed: calculations take several seconds, not days;     Usability: web-interface that eliminates the use of software and offers intuitive navigation. For instance, today assets are sold by undivided parts, as specified by the building plan (apartment/office). In real life, it means that an apartment may have a very few joint owners (usually this is due to incremental costs like papers processing). If an investor believes in growth of square meters in a specific apartment block, he/she has to buy a specific apartment with both its advantages and disadvantages. Plus, he/she is obliged to pay total cost of the apartment and not the cost they are ready to invest.  Tokenization allows to release tokens corresponding to micro shares in an apartment block. For instance, tokens may equal to square meters. In such a case, certain construction company acts as an emitent of tokens, while investors are able to get their shares in the apartment block without buying specific apartments. They can buy more tokens directly from a developer and expand their share or sell any amount of residential area on the exchange. Thanks to this opportunity, they are able to pay up the area step by step without the need to save up the money, which may lead to financial losses due to inflation pressure. Later, if wished, investors can exchange the necessary amount of tokens for a specific apartment/office. Once investors hold all tokens and trade them, the emitent company rents these assets out and distributes profits among all token holders.  Interesting is the fact that if all buildings in a district are tokenized, there may be a specific token created that will represent an average share of real estate in the district.  Thus, investors are able to invest in cost growth of the real estate of the whole district. For instance, they can follow this pattern if a new Google office or metro station is about to be built in that area. In fact, we may create indexes assigned to cities and countries. All this will empower investors to choose investment strategies that best meet their needs — they can start from a single building to a whole country.  Simply said, tokenization is a process of transformation, storage and management of assets, when each and every asset has its corresponding digital duplicate.  Construction Market Realities  By 2050, about 75% of global population will be living in metropolitan cities and they will need some 3 billion homes built. It is obvious that in order to complete such work volumes, it might take ages, if migrant workers are used. The construction universe is in the need of a brand new approach. Moreover, it’s important to keep in mind natural disasters, since when they occur, buildings constructed in a traditional way are magically transformed into vertical coffins. In this case, self-sustainable buildings are a must.  Talking about government contracts, they are only good for huge volumes of apartment blocks, which are completely impractical for contemporary life.  There’s a need in a platform that will enable the community to vote for construction projects, empowering each and every user to monitor construction stages and make transparent payments with minimal sums.  We believe that building boom is not gonna happen in the West, but in the following parts of the world that are characterized by both high population density and urbanization — Africa, Asia and South America. These are dynamically developing countries which population is thought to actively shift to cryptocurrency due to the tendency of water supplies shortage and massive urbanization.  It is suggested that once the global population reaches 9 billion people, the capitalization of construction market — currently amounts to $100 trillion — will dramatically increase and be rated in cryptocurrency, with Asia, Africa and China to head the list — 70–80% urbanization.  In the light of the above, even now construction market tokenization and cryptoinvesting platform may change outdated dogmas in this industry and offer a brand new niche.  Solution  BitRent is that very solution we need for tokenizing the construction industry.  BitRent platform aims to dominate the construction industry in the next few years by dividing buildings into small construction elements and tokenizing them. Thus, the platform will open the way for more and more people to become investors and change the outdated and unprofitable construction formula. We follow a well-established and trustworthy model — construction objects are divided into shares, and these shares are tokenized.  We have already started development on the Ethereum network due to the fact that it is the most advanced Smart Contract Blockchain today. Smart Contracts are meant to ensure the safety of the mentioned above shares and fulfillment of all contacts clauses. As for the proof-of-asset token, it will be an ERC20 token.  All in all, BitRent is currently creating the environment where all sensitive construction & investor data will be secured and all contract terms fulfilled, without the need to involve third parties.  Right now, construction tokenization offers a new set of investment and profit-making opportunities for millions of people. In fact, this technological advancement brings about a completely fresh way for people to interact with construction objects and draw significant profits.

Placement logic of construction objects on BitRent platform https://medium.com/@bitrent/placement-logic-of-construction-objects-on-bitrent-platform-ffe5c785ce1e  BIM models to visualize construction progress  https://medium.com/@bitrent/bim-models-to-visualize-construction-progress-7888c4f6d4a9  Real-time construction monitoring with RFID tags https://medium.com/@bitrent/real-time-construction-monitoring-with-rfid-tags-c423d0f715c2  Smart contracts in the Bitrent https://medium.com/@bitrent/smart-contracts-in-the-bitrent-4810f2da5eaf  We will start our journey with launching Bitrent platform MVP in April 2018. Our MVP will be represented by web-interface which links all system components and allows users to easily interact with the platform functionality. In other words, seed capital necessary to start a construction process could be found without looking for fund sources, with early-stage investors to be able to get excess profit even from small inputs.  The functionality is divided into 3 main parts:  Investment  The users are able to invest even small amounts of money in projects. It’s possible by the application of Smart Contracts. They record and track each backer’s investments and calculate their benefits. In this way, the use of Smart Contracts guarantees that a project backer will get his/her coins according to the Smart Contract conditions. As for the web interface, the idea is implemented by introducing building catalog so that each user is able to browse and find a project to back.  Design samples          Construction Verified BitRent developers and constructors build and sign Smart Contracts that define each party’s responsibilities, deadlines, rewards, and penalty costs. When adding a project to the system, it’s creators should upload all project documents which are added to the project node in the BitRent Blockchain. Once the project is added, BitRent platform analyzes the received data and checks if it complies with the specified criteria. Then, the BitRent team checks and verifies the project, its legality, budget, construction details and only then the project gets the final rating and is marked ‘Verified’. Analyzing project’s BIM model, BitRent experts define building units and generate ID for RFID tags or barcodes that are to be integrated into building units. Each tag/barcode is entered into the digital progress statement and has 4 statuses (1. In the system 2. Integrated 3. Implemented 4. Approved ). The platform will have an integration with construction management tools that would catch every action that is performed during the project construction process. When the action is captured, the platform triggers Smart Contract and if this action leads to a milestone completion, the Bitrent platform makes financial transaction according to Smart Contract terms and conditions. Then after adding the action to the project node, the platform changes the project Roadmap section of the Project Profile page so that investors may monitor construction progress and get notified of project changes. All in all, our aim is to develop a forward-thinking solution that will allow developer companies to attract investments without fund sources and omit third party audit service. It means that developers save budget sources and are able to implement equipment and techniques to correspond to “green standards” like Active house, LEED, BREEAM, and etc. without expanding initial budget. In the nearest time we will launch a website for this platform. Currently, this website-platform is in the development stage, with corresponding Smart Contracts being written. Soon you will see and experience it all. Site: https://platform.bitrent.io/ GitHub: https://github.com/bitrent/Bitrent-Platform Join to our Telegram community https://t.me/bitrentio",False

Dig a little deeper and you’ll find yourself learning what Blockchain Technology is and how it works. But then what, what is the next important concept that one should begin brushing up on?  Smart Contracts.  So what are they?  Well, visually, they look like this:   Simply put, Smart Contracts are self fulfilling, contracts, completely automated and secured. And they have several immediate benefits to being implemented, such as:  Eliminating Third Parties Allowing Strangers To Conduct Business w/o Risk Speeds Up Business Transactions Health Care Few records are as private as Medical Records. With Smart Contracts, Medical Records can be encoded and saved on blockchain technology. And it’s with this same technology that allows the records to be HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) endorsed, ensuring data privacy and security provisions for all our private medical data. The very same private keys we use to access our cryptocurrency wallets, would be the same blueprint for how our doctors would be able to access our private medical files, updating them in real time keeping them secured. Prescriptions, therapy, surgeries would all be kept track of on smart contracts and could also be accessed by our insurance companies as needed, by the very same private keys that our doctor(s) would use.  Auto Self Driving Cars are here and have been in our streets for awhile now. Google broke ground years back with their Google Maps cars, giving us the wonderful visual access to any street in the country. Now Elon Musk and his powerhouse company, Tesla, have promised us fully autonomous cars capabilities in their vehicles in the near future - appropriately called the Autopilot feature. And with the streets filling up with more and more driverless cars, you can count on a transitional phase of more complex accident scenarios.  Smart Contracts will be able to manage an almost infinite amount of variables that factor in after an accident has taken place. This would make it things much easier when determining who was at fault, the car with no driver or the car with a human driver. And insurance companies would be able to also integrate smart contracts to update, track and monitor policies, anywhere at anytime.  Construction | Real Estate From the construction aspect to the investing sector, the Real Estate Industry will completely be revolutionized by smart contracts.  On the construction side, RFID Chips allow for open monitoring by all necessary parties, in real time. From the investment side, anyone from anywhere can invest into commercial or residential properties with no minimum entry threshold. So essentially, you can now own a fraction or small piece of real estate, across the globe. This makes investing easy, profitable and most importantly, transparent. Smart contracts will play a big role, as they are self-executed and self-governing, controlling both the construction flow and return on everyone’s investments.  But it doesn’t stop there. We can expect dozens more industries to join the future of business transactions and embrace the use of smart contracts; including the Cyber Security, Banking/Payment and Supply Chain Management Industries.  Construction Foreman, Dmitri Starovoitov, also feels that Blockchain Technology and Smart Contracts are the future of how business will be conducted. Starovoitov says that “Blockchain offers a transparent, simultaneous and shared database for all parties to view. Information is embedded in code and protected from deletion, change and tampering, eliminating any risk from the transaction. Businesses that function on contracts with a blockchain transaction have multiple verifications occurring simultaneously across the internet. If one computer in the system goes down, there are an unlimited number more that were working on the same verification and will confirm. Middlemen like brokers, agents, contract lawyers, and bankers would no longer be of need as the blockchain ensures that all parties meet all terms of the agreement.  Dmitri also has encouragement for the next generation of students to begin paying attention to blockchain technology and smart contracts, stating “Smart Contract technology is a must-know in the days to come, as it will definitely change each and every industry all over the globe. So, students should learn things in advance to be able to respond to potential new changes in the most profitable way.”  Whether you’re in business or a student trying to stay ahead of the curve, you certainly should become more familiar with Smart Contracts as they will undoubtedly shape the way all facets of business is conducted from here on out.",False

Nowadays, construction processes are mostly monitored manually. Manual labor slows down the processes and increase the working costs. Recently, blockchain platform Bitrent came with a solution for this problem: the usage of modules and structures chipping to control construction processes in real time. The blockchain-based company offers users the opportunity to control their construction processes and reduce costs of investing in shared-equity construction. Now, BitRent has announced its token sale.  Disclosure: This is a Sponsored Article  BitRent has given itself a mission: to make real estate investing easy, transparent and profitable all over the world. The platform uses a combination of techniques that will allow its users to control construction processes. These techniques include BIM open modeling and computer aided monitoring using RFID chips, to make investing in commercial and residential shared-equity construction more transparent and predictable. On the platform, investors can invest in real estate, without a minimum entry threshold. The online mode allows them to control construction processes and receive dividends when the construction has been completed. Moreover, users can receive data on free area or items of commercial property.  The BIM (Building Information Modeling) technology that the platform uses, allows all users of the platform to monitor a project at any stage. This way, all steps in constructing a new project can be followed. The technology collects information on the architecture, engineering, technology and economics of the construction. Users will get a 3D model, which is easily accessible on a smartphone. This means that investors can already check on a construction from the very first sketches onwards and decide if a building will be profitable within a shared-equity construction. BIM technology will prevent investors of making bad investments, by keeping track of safety requirements of real estate items. BitRent will seek finance though ICO crowdfunding. The platform will release its RNT tokens, based on Ethereum. The token sale will start on the 1st of December 2017, 11:00 UTC and will last till March 1, 2018. With the RNT tokens, you can participate in activities on the platform and invest in projects. 1 billion tokens will be issued, of which 699 million will be for sale on the ICO. During the pre-sale, which will start on November 24th at 11:00 UTC, 200 million tokens will already be released. 100 million tokens are reserved within BitRent and will not be on sale. During the presale, purchase of tokens is only possible with ETH. At the ICO stage, BTC is also accepted. The price of the tokens is not fixed, but will vary depending on the situation. The minimum purchase price will be 0.01 ETH.  Smart contracts play a big role within the platform’s distributed ledger. A smart contract is not a ‘real’ contract, but an algorithm that is self-executed and self-governing. Smart contracts can control both the construction flow and return on investments. The smart contract will make sure that all investors will receive dividends when the construction is finished for example. Smart contracts are saved to the project’s blockchain node and will act in accordance with its terms and conditions.

However, words alone may sometimes confuse, that’s why today we use a perfect mix of simple words and short video to give you an amazing chance to grab practical explanation on how BIM operates within BitRent platform.  On this short, but enormously informative video, one may see the perfect application of BIM approach that is focused on reproduction of an actual building in a virtual way, with all smallest details taken into consideration. There is a common misconception that BIM means 3D design. Actually, it's much more. BIM is a process for creating and managing all of the information on a project – before, during and after construction. BitRent takes care of a complete life cycle of a building to ensure its operation at full capacity within each and every stage.  Using this approach, BitRent makes sure that all structural elements of a building are carefully put in the right place to avoid potential construction mistakes that often lead to yet another price rise.  Using Lavina Mall as an example, BitRent shows that BIM helps to maintain maximum design coordination and improved constructibility. As you see, all objects in the model are completely interrelated, so that the owner or facility manager may receive a complete and accurate set of information. All model details are linked to related information including manuals, specifications, commissioning data, photos, and warranty details. Due to the fact that the owner or facility manager is equipped with all data, they can manage the asset in the most efficient and accurate way.  Lavina Mall is a shopping and entertainment center, the largest Ukrainian ‘megamall’, with an area of 170,280 sq.m. Lavina Mall features the widest selection of fashion brands, the largest indoor GALAXY family entertainment park in Europe (20,000 sq.m.), and the country’s largest MULTIPLEX cinema with 13 screens. Lavina Mall is the first mall in a network of 7 megamalls, including Ocean Mall and Blockbuster Mall. The total network’s area will be over 2 million.

A Radio Frequency Identification Tag (or chip) is an electronic tag which sends (some models even receive and process) data to a RFID reader through radio waves.  Before the construction starts Bitrant platform analyzes the project BIM Model generating an id for RFID tags and points (construction elements) where they must be implemented.  Also, Bitrent platform constructors will implement barcodes as to mark divers building units. Such a solution digitize the construction elements and enables to follow and check the construction process. How it works: When the construction is started, manufacturers implement RFID tags into construction elements and activate them.  As, we use distributed ledger to introduce roles in Bitrent platform (see Smart contracts in the Bitrent). After deployment, verified Bitrent users must scan tags and make a record in the blockchain.  Then, to confirm that the element is really implemented, other participants of the project how can make entries into the project node will confirm the record by scanning it.  So, each tag/barcode is entered into the digital progress statement and has 4 statuses:      In the system     Attached     Implemented     Approved  Bitrent platform smart contracts triggered when tags/barcodes statuses are changed. All participants (investors, developers, constructors) are notified and can see changes in the project Roadmap sections.

BitRent is the first platform for crypto-investing in commercial and residential real estate at early stages of construction for newcomer investors and large investment funds. In other words, we welcome just everyone to join global real estate construction market community and get profits in a simple and predictable way. 2. We use a wide range of modern technologies to facilitate the best operation of the platform: RFID technology requires using special tags that are placed on all building objects, thus, providing maximum control over all, without exception, processes and construction elements. Each investor is able to monitor construction process remotely from a smartphone or computer in online mode. BIM technology allows to see not-yet-completed building in a finished digital format, edge all curves and improve construction processes and supply logistics. Moreover, this technology represents a uniquely simply idea — one digital model of a building that can be used by an architect, client, supplier, builder and environment engineer. With the help of BIM, one may obtain 3D building models that can be used for optimizing operating performance, pricing control as well as getting realistic rendering and animated sketches of buildings. Smart Contracts allow to forget about middleman services, thus, reducing human factor impact to zero. The mentioned technology plays a role of a legal adviser, who tracks 100% fulfillment of conditions. In case if those are not met, no financial transactions are available. Using Smart Contracts, all construction participants (investors, developers and etc.) will be confident that all processes are under control including quality working performance and timely payments. Investors transfer funds only on a condition that developers do not only follow the contractual provisions in a formal way, but also maintain maximum quality of operations.

Thank you for question. When creating a project inside the platform, automatically created a pool of smart contracts what will monitor all processes, from monitoring construction, to financial management. A separate smart contract will be created under each structural element and for each type of work. After installing such structural elements, data from RFID chips and sensors (for example in concrete) will be transferred to the database. This information will be checked against the data of the BIM-model of the building. With the correct installation and compliance with all technical parameters, the smart contract confirms this stage of work. When the smart contract confirms the stage of work, then the following actions take place: - the digital model of the building, which is responsible for monitoring the erection and technical standards, receives confirmation of the installation of a new element. Further it is visualized to investors and auditors information about the implementation of this stage of work. - the financial component of this stage of work is fulfilled. Starting from the formation of accounts for materials, and before the calculation of payments. If necessary (if provided by a smart contract), funds are transferred to the account of the developer. This is briefly about the essence. For the ultimate investor, on his interface he will see the progress of construction, the implementation of step-by-step smart contracts, reports on the funds used, the growth of the capitalization of the construction site, compliance with the construction schedule and many other parameters necessary to assess the progress of its facility. We are limited in the dissemination of data by the non-disclosure agreement according to Oracle construction & engineering.",False

Actually, the code isn’t a contract in traditional legal sense. In Bitrent platform it’s a self-executed and self-governing algorithm that replaces the need for a wider contracts or checks and balances.  In Bitrent smart contracts area of responsibility is divided into 2 parts: Investment and Construction. Once agreed smart contracts control the construction flow and regulate financial tranches.  In Investment after terms and conditions were settled smart contracts are responsible for return on investments. It means that when a construction is over and a building starts earning profit, all investors will get their dividends according to the smart contract conventions.  In Construction, for MVP we’ve chosen the following smart contract strategy:  The system would include one smart contract with diverse methods to which will call the platform backend while operating. In other words, each project will have it’s owns smart contract methods suit which is registered in the platform backend.   In the UI it will be represented by smart contract constructor. Participants choose optional methods that are marked in the backend and saved to the project blockchain node and when conditions change statuses backend calls to the chosen method to act in accordance with its terms and conditions.  Smart contract usage simplifies construction process by omitting 3d party audit service, developer saves budget sources to implement equipment as to correspond to “green standards” like Active house, LEED, BREEAM, and etc.  GitHub: https://github.com/bitrent/Bitrent-Platform",False

Investor will track all construction stages online based on data taken from RFID tags with maximum transparency.  Smart Contracts are only confirmed when each and every stage is successfully completed. Then, and only then, funds are transferred to a developer.

OR Why is now the time to set up new rules?  The Real Estate market has drastically changed in the 21st century. It is not booming as it used to in the first part of the 20th century. For instance, the productivity in construction and also in building business has dropped more than by 50% since 1960. The huge expansion seen in such cities as New York, London, Toronto, Tokyo had become less active. Just so you know, contruction commerce brings to GDP of each country approximately 13% of overall national profit. This is the one big number and very often the development of one country depends on the construction commerce among other factors. There are many reasons why this process takes place. New political regulations would be the main factor which influenced the development of construction commerce. Also, real estate agencies and construction companies had old-fashioned understanding of running the business of real estate. E-commerce, which is now a vital part of almost every business, has not fully penetrated the construction business yet. Also, the changes in construction world were so poor and scarce they were not enough to really set the difference. One of the most vivid examples of when the changes had actually taken place are such construction projects as Tyrian in Kiev and Opera in Hamburg. They are considered to be highly technological and they are expected to set the new mode of building very soon. If there were more of such projects in our environment, construction commerce would surely bring more profit to GDP. Another problem which Real Estate market faces today is management coordination, or, it would be better to say, lack of it thereof. How many times had the construction project been postponed due to poor management coordination? Countless of times, we dare say. How many deadlines had been pushed to the point of impossible and how many projects had been frozen in the middle? Technology which is now rapidly developing had not fully reached its potential in the Real Estate market. Also, ecological issue needs to be taken into account as now the houses should be built according to all ecological rules so that environment is not disturbed in any way. As we can see, there are many problems that exist in the construction business today but they can all be fought with new approach and also technologies which would return it its former beauty.  https://medium.com/@bitrent/the-real-estate-market-from-last-century-or-why-is-now-the-time-to-set-up-new-rules-89b31a35c7f1",False

This is one of the most promising business technologies, which is expected to bring many positive changes into the world of real estate. Blockchain is most useful when making transactions during the purchase of real estate. So, let's see what arguments show the biggest benefits of this technology:  Security. Blockchain allows you to fully control and monitor the database of all transactions in the world of currencies and also bitcoin. You can be sure that money transactions will always be conducted reliably and efficiently. Also, the database will always be 100% protected, so you can be sure that your confidential information will not be stolen or used to your advantage. Transparency of transactions. Since it is literally impossible to steal someone else's information from this database, you can be sure that your rights as the owner will not be violated. Reliability. The system is fully equipped with cryptographic algorithms that can not be forged. Also, these algorithms are programmed in such a way that they will not allow any technical distortion of the data, so they will continue to work even if there is some kind of computer failure. Smart contracts. These are the deals that are concluded between the parties digitally. They are created by special computer protocols. With the help of such contracts, you will be able to fully monitor the purchase and construction of your house, knowing that the transaction is 100% legal and that it follows all the rules and regulations. Such a smart contract simply can not be concluded if the established requirements are not met. Saving money. Using blockchain, you will save money on banking transactions and also on waiting time. Transactions have never been so simple and easy.  As you can see, the blockchain technology is in fact created in such a way as to bring the greatest benefit to all those people who use it.",False
