Let’s talk about why BitSchool is built upon Blockchain.  When people say ‘Blockchain’, ‘decentralization’ comes to mind. By this decentralization, Blockchain allows the ideal way to make transactions as the booking of transactions is decentralized and not governed by a sole system operator, making it transparent and trustable.  Although this transparent transaction feature is one important reason BitSchool adopted this technology, the Blockchain allows much more. For example, through the Blockchain smart-contract system, BitSchool can issue tokens and receive the essential startup fund to launch and develop cutting-edge technologies that will significantly advance our current education address.  In addition, these tokens can be used to establish and expand BitSchool’s business by allowing the implementation of various token reward programs such as rewarding referrals or high-quality service reviews, or implementing competitive token-pricing schemes (like our 50% discount of AI products when using tokens).  The benefits do not end here and the blockchain token generation permits doing unbelievable positive activities to provide equal learning opportunities through our GoGreenFund which endows token scholarships to low-income students so that they can use these tokens to purchase tutoring services or AI products on our platform.  Also the fund encourages tutor volunteer activities by rewarding transaction-fee exemption coupons for the tutors’ volunteer tutoring to low-income students.  Although there are still areas where the Blockchain technology should be tested and improved (like any other new technology), the benefit discussed were enough for us to decide to go along with Blockchain.",False

However, BitSchool is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered eLearning platform combined with online tutoring to provide the most ideal personalized learning environment. So 'education-based course' is not the main feature and an Adaptive AI Assessment to accurately evaluate the students' or learners' true proficiency levels as per subjects is one main feature and providing instant feedback that meet the students' or learners' individualized learning needs and styles through Adaptive Feedbacks and On-Demand Tutoring is the other main feature. Apart from these main features, we plan to create contents-based Adaptive Video Technology that will provide the most fitting educational videos to learners matching their individual preferences and interest areas. So this will perfect the personalized learning experience. Hope this helped increase your understanding of our platform.  Also don't forget our $1,500,000 referral campaign that will be launched soon.

So let me explain. First of all, we are not a MOOC. We are and will be developing AI-algorithm based assessment and intelligent feedback generation applications (this our Dynamic Marking System). And our team with our course admins, who we are in the process of recruiting and expanding to cover different topics and education systems, have significant years of teaching and tutoring experiences, and will provide the required questions, answers, and feedbacks that will be put into our AI database to power the aforementioned Adaptive AI Assessment and Dynamic Marking System so that our AI system will help teachers and tutors accurately assess the learner's proficiency levels and provide appropriate feedbacks for the learners to work on their weaknesses. However, we will have a content-oriented product that is called Adaptive Video Technology that we plan to develop within 2019. The Adaptive Video Technology is basically a library of educational videos that will have multiple videos teaching the same topic in different ways so that the AI machine will present educational videos that matches the learner's learning needs and style correctly. The contents of our Adaptive Video Technology will be built either internally, by license and/or through partnerships with contents creators. We already started contacting potential partners in this area and will announce them as they happen. I believe your company will most probably be an education content creator and provider, but our model is different from yours. So you can't compare.  The spams, I have no knowledge about them, but some might be truthful and yeah, some might be spams. However, public forums or chatting sites always have the problem of spams that the moderator cannot control, and it is a way of life these days I guess.  The years that you mentioned include the total years from when we ideated this project and is not confined to the years we actually started the prototype development or our prep for our ICO. Of course sometimes, an idea can just be formed over a relatively short period of time, but in our case, we've accumulated experience and expertise in teaching and tutoring, and while we were doing this, the BitSchool idea was hatched over a period of time (in my case I started to think about this platform from mid 2015 and tried various attempts). So the period you mentioned starts from the time we began hatching the concept currently underlying our BitSchool project. Our company - Smart Education Solutions, owner of the BitSchool project - was created in Jul 2015.  http://journalofinterest.com? I tried this address, but it won't work. I'm not sure what you are talking about therefore. Hope you'd clarify. Our smart contract codes are posted on github.  Lastly, just because you have doubts (without backed by firm evidence and without even asking us for clarification beforehand) about our project, naming it a 'scum' is not decent. Think about yourself: you believed in your idea and concept, met the right people, and really worked hard to achieve your and your team's goal, and imagine someone claiming you are a 'scum' without first trying to ask his questions, get his answers, and then basing his claim on them.

I don't want to blame you, but I don't want to give my money to a fraud project. And don't want that for other people here. So what I see: 1. You don't have enought good developers to implement your idea. Looks like you add one to each side (end, front, blockchain). But I don't see they are real experts regarding their profiles. I can actually talk with this guys and understand it fast. So your idea is great, but without strong dev team you will fail. 2. How do you want to sell your project. I'm in this area more than 10 years. I understand that your main customers are schools, college, universities. But they won't buy just a program for e-learning. They want to buy a e-learning content. You don't have it as well. 3. Let me believe that some university would start to work with your project and hire some content managers to fill it (which is unbelivable for me). But you didn't show an authority part of your project. So even if you project would be great but without usefull oportunity to fill it with a content you will fail. Few years ago (I think 5) I asked one person who is one of the smartest in this area, and he answered to me: If you want to sell some project in this area, just create a good authority tool and anyone would buy it even without the project. 4. Our student result table in DB is 2.3 Tb (yes,yes, Tb). Could you imagine a content size? Where do you store it? In a blockchain? I don't think it is possible. But you don't think about it as well. 5. What is the essence of decentralized?  So, I'm sure your idea is great. But you still didn't think about some areas which is the most important in your project. And still didn't meet some people (I would like to see one dev with strong e-learning experience that 3 without). May be you will create what you want, but to sell it you need to do tremendous count of work what you didn't expect. That is why I wrote 'scum'. I don't believe in your project and it is not just because I don't believe. It is because I'm an expert in this area.  I wish you good luck, but try to think about my opinon and start to move in this direction before ICO.",False

I would like to immediately address the overarching theme of your statement, that our project is fraudulent. By definition – fraud would assume that we are not planning on delivering the project in which we say we are attempting to construct. With that definition in mind – I would like to put that to rest immediately and showcase that we fully intend to deliver the product that we’ve conceptualized and outlined in our whitepaper. That being said, the followup points seem to focus less on fraud and more on “whether or Bitschool will be a sustainable and successful business, and do we have the capacity and experience to deliver on this model”. This is a great question and I will be happy to address this – as per your points below.  Quote 1. You don't have enought good developers to implement your idea. Looks like you add one to each side (end, front, blockchain). But I don't see they are real experts regarding their profiles. I can actually talk with this guys and understand it fast. So your idea is great, but without strong dev team you will fail.  Before I start, I wanted to clarify your remark about “Also I look at your backend developer projects. E.g. http://journalofinterest.com/ It is awefull with huge count of errors and just one page. To be honest I'm not sure you really want to develop your project.” The website that you quoted, we have since clarified with Matthew, that this was merely a side project for him and one that was abandoned. The reason you still saw the ‘warning messages’ was that it was still in progress and therefore under development. Matthew has an outstanding work experience record including working at CERN and several years at GE oil and gas. CERN is where they built one of the most revolutionary pieces of technology to discover brand new particles that were only theorized.  We have an MVP and you can check it on our webpage – www.bitschool.io. This MVP has one topic (computer science) right now but, as I mentioned, will be expanded not only in the computer-science area, but also to other topics with the help of our members and our course admins. And if you try to use it, you will instantly know that our model is not about providing educational contents, but providing an application built upon adaptive formative AI algorithm to make an accurate proficiency assessment possible. Also, apart from our co-founder Phil, who created and is improving our MVP, we have Artificial Intelligence / Neuroscience experts with expertise in education as team members and advisors (and the list is and will be consistently growing). FYI, in AI projects, the most important assets are AI researchers and developers and they are hard to find and even harder to recruit - we started with 2 and now the list has grown to 5 within a month. These guys have done heavy research and development in their areas and will form the core brains in improving our MVP and developing our other AI-based products (you can get their information on our team and advisor section on our webpage and whitepaper). Honestly, Front/Back/Blockchain are even not the core technologies of our products, but we have very talented developers on our team who are cross-experts in these areas which is usually the case for powerful venture teams, and won’t have any trouble adapting these technologies for all of our model’s purposes. However, if you don’t trust the profiles in our team/advisor sections and can’t see the value of our MVP, you’re most likely not the investor we target.  Quote 2. How do you want to sell your project. I'm in this area more than 10 years. I understand that your main customers are schools, college, universities. But they won't buy just a program for e-learning. They want to buy a e-learning content. You don't have it as well.  3. Let me believe that some university would start to work with your project and hire some content managers to fill it (which is unbelivable for me). But you didn't show an authority part of your project. So even if you project would be great but without usefull oportunity to fill it with a content you will fail. Few years ago (I think 5) I asked one person who is one of the smartest in this area, and he answered to me: If you want to sell some project in this area, just create a good authority tool and anyone would buy it even without the project.  We’ve already started to sell our MVP to schools in the UK and will start implementing it even before our presale, and we will be able to provide potential investors with real user traffic data and feedbacks. So prospective investors will not only assess our concept and idea, but also a real product that is up and running. What’s better than experiencing the product before you buy it! About the contents, like I mentioned in my previous response, we are more concentrating on building the ideal AI infrastructure that would help teachers and tutors deliver personalized learning to their learners. Also our prospective client base is not confined to schools (university less) and will mostly be teachers, tutors, students and learners with various learning needs. But I agree, when we sell our Adaptive Video Contents (our main contents eLearning tool) to Schools and maybe Universities, we will need the authority part that you mentioned and that is included in our plan of course. But these parts will take place in the latter phase of our development as we will first have to build and perfect our AI products focusing on assessing the learners’ proficiency levels and providing them with instant, effective, and fitting educational feedbacks that match their learning needs, style and pathway. Also we are part of a network of over 3000 teachers, most of whom have known us for many years. We have been in contact with a few of them and every single one of them has been positive about providing us with content. In terms of ensuring high quality content, we plan on firstly hiring the highest quality teachers to help create this (with the help of our course admins). Secondly, all content will be quality checked between the network and rated by students and other teachers to ensure that only the highest quality content will get through. Lastly, using our AI expertise, we plan on creating an AI algorithm that is able to score newly created content based on quality, effectiveness and engagement to further maximize the efficiency of our validation process.  Quote 4. Our student result table in DB is 2.3 Tb (yes,yes, Tb). Could you imagine a content size? Where do you store it? In a blockchain? I don't think it is possible. But you don't think about it as well. 5. What is the essence of decentralized?  About the DB, of course we know that we would need immense space for data storage, we have factored this into our costings and we have plans to use amazon web services as our data warehousing provider. This provides us elasticity in both memory storage capacity and data processing. Just for preparing the data for our Adaptive AI Assessments and the intelligent feedback capabilities, the data requirement is enormous and of course we are aware of this aspect. This is why we have set aside 50% of our public fund distribution to the AI technology alone, and a huge database requirement is included in that sheer amount. And blockchain for AI data storage is totally out of question and doesn’t fit the purpose as you will be well aware of. We only use blockchain for our ICO, token utility/reward, and to drive our GoGreenFund; and the core of BitSchool is Artificial Intelligence. So our transactions will be decentralized but our AI database not.  Lastly, your concern of having not the right people or not having the right infrastructure on day one stems from your misunderstanding of the venture startup process. We have a small team of developers at this point, this is correct, however, they are all exceptionally talented and more than capable of creating this project in the timeframe. However, I would like to remind you that this is the reason start-up companies get investment (through the ICO in our case) in order to expand their operations and hire more professionals and develop the infrastructure. From what you said, you are most probably working for a very established entity like McGraw-Hill and the major difference between established entities and ventures is that ventures have to continuously evolve and this is why investing in ventures could be risky but at the same time, very lucrative. So again, totally agree to your point that investors should challenge their prospective investees as much as they can and make sure to cover every aspects that would help them mitigate their investment risk and thereby realize huge returns.  Hope this would address your concern and thanks for your interest and thoughtful advices. Hope we can continue this discussions as they will benefit both you and us.  Best, BitSchool",False

You should invest in BitSchool. First of all, we don't have private sales where we will give deeply discounted tokens or tokens with huge bonuses to pre-selected investors. Second, our tokens will be distributed after our ICO is complete, it's set forth in the whitepaper under the '6. BitSchool Token Sale' section. Third, the tokens distributed to the Founders, Team and Advisors have a mandatory holding period of 180 days. So I don't believe under this structure, the unfair situation you mentioned can occur. However, if you have any concerns with respect to this structure, do not hesitate and let us know.  Also I totally agree that you have to challenge and test the ICO teams. This, including the whitepaper, is the most effective way to check every unturned stones and mitigate your investment risk. In this regard, we are welcoming any concerns, questions, inquiries, or challenges you want to pose to us, and we will do our best to not only address them, but also convince you that BitSchool is the real deal^^  Best, BitSchool",False

He's still fine-tuning the MVP that will be released first to UK students, and we'll get real user testing feedbacks, which we plan to share with you guys. Also we have contacted schools already and they all expressed their interest in licensing our Adaptive AI Assessment. So the prototype MVP is already a working product but will have significant improvements in terms of its capabilities and functionalities once we start the BitSchool Platform development. Also as you can see the MVP has currently one course area which is IT but the course coverage will be broadened so that the app can be used for the assessment for all study subjects from science to math to literature.

The purpose of our token issuance is four-fold, let us try our best to explain: 1. We are using the ICO to raise our development fund. 2. By introducing our own token, we can create various token reward programs that will help develop, expand and improve our platform including but not limited to rewarding activities helping develop our AI Database or improving our platform, products and services on our platform. Also we can introduce various discount (like the 50%-off when purchasing our AI products) programs to not only promote our products, but also incentivize the usage of tokens on our platform. 3. By introducing our own token, we can set up the GoGreenFund which is endowing not cash-based scholarships, but our-token-based scholarships, and recipients who have financial difficulties can use them to buy products and services on our platform; hence contributing to equal learning chances. 4. We created an innovative Embedded Put Option through which we intend to incentivize the holding of our tokens and hence stabilize the value of our tokens. How this works? We will fix the value of our tokens when purchasing AI products at Max[token ICO end value, token current market value] So by this formula, the token value when purchasing AI products won't drop below the token ICO end value even if the token's market value drops below the ICO end value. This option combined with our 50% discount for token transactions of AI products will keep the token value when purchasing AI products always above twice as high as the token's market value. This is a bit complicated and for actual example, please visit our webpage's FAQ.  So as you can see these measures wouldn't have been possible without issuing our own token and that's why we chose blockchain and to leverage its token mechanism. Thanks for the great question^^  Best, BitSchool",False

But I think this is the same for any financial instruments. For instance, IPOs have the same movement issues and that's why people invest in stocks actually...to capture the upturn. And when the market turns the other way, people loose money. This is why companies adopt hedging mechanisms and that's how investment banks earn their fees. The same logic applies to coins (although whether to treat coin as securities or currency is uncertain in some countries and even those which implement some kind of regulations, they differ) and we will have to plan some hedging mechanisms so that a significant drop in our coin's market value would not negatively affect our development plans. However, as you mentioned, if our coin triples, it might be a possibility that we will have more fund than we need, but it would be better than having less. Also even in that case, like I mentioned, we have to prepare for any potential drop in the coin's value, again, so that it would not hamper our development roadmap. One aspect we implemented to help stabilize our coin value is our Embedded Put Option and the 50% discounts extended to our AI products. When we designed this measure we hoped it would help to keep our coin's value stable even during times when our token's market value drops significantly. FunnyAttitude, if you have any good ideas to stabilize the coin value, it would be real nice if you could share them with us^^; Would be an interesting discussion.  Best, BitSchool",False

But that's not controlled by the issuer, right? The opposite can happen too (and it does) and the issuer has to take that risk. Just one question though, 'exposed to dumping by presale', how can it be dumped after presale? The token distribution would be processed after the ICO is finished most probably....Also as we already have determined the tie between our token and ETH, the situation you mentioned should be taken into account when investors make their decisions, but do you have any good alternative ideas to price the altcoins?

I am always like to test on the structure to see how well prepared by the ico team. Especially a lot of them are very un-experience to the ico platform.  When i mean by dumping by the presale, it refer to being dumped by the pre-sale/private investors. Actually even now the pre-sale/private investors can sell the tokens at 50% below the usd price of crowdsale and they can still profit from it. In addition, if the ico sale has a huge portion (>75%) is sold to the pre-sale/private sale, in this way there is hardly any point to participate in the crowdsale and should just wait for the token to hit the open market.  There are already many ico that comes with plans to try to balance both the investors in both pre-sale and crowdsale. The plan has to really customize to the situation so that it will bring the max benefit to everyone.",False

We are reaching out to them using various channels and we have already received intentions to invest from a number of them.

Also 60% of the raised public fund is allocated to cover our R&D of our online tutoring platform (10%) and AI products (50%). The soft cap is basically 1% of the total token distribution which amounts to 4Mil BSCH which will only cover basic development costs of our tutoring platform and AI products. We have already begun the development of our Adaptive AI Assessment app and it's posted on our webpage as the MVP. So with this small amount of money, we will definitely not be able to develop such advanced features as the Adaptive Video Technology or Intelligent Marking System. However, in this case, we will continue our development nevertheless and will look for other funding options as well. Right from the start, we've decided to go with the ICO as it allows us the most ideal funding method for high-impact, high-potential ventures like BitSchool with the financial support of our community. Also we have so far received a number of love calls from private investors but did not pursue them because of this reason. So even if we are not successful and reach only the min cap, we're confident we will find interested investors willing to help us continue our development of our advanced technologies. But let's hope we won't reach this point ^^; If we hit the hard cap, then we won't get distracted by the R&D cost anymore and can fully dedicate our manpower and mental resources to design, develop and deploy our fully-equipped tutoring platform and comprehensive list of AI products as soon as possible so that users can gain fast access to these innovative service and product lines. So for this, the help from our community is really important and we look forward to your contribution to making personalized learning and equal affordability of high-quality education the entrenched practices of our future education.

But at the bottom line, I believe our principle and vision to positively change our global educational system so that every student can receive the personalized learning that they specifically require and hence no student will be left behind will form the bedrock of all of our decisions. Therefore, like you said, when we make our decision with respect to the details of our AI products (and others), this principle and vision will lead us to the best decision instead of a tilted decision that only benefits us. I personally believe it's always important to have firm sets of values and principles, and when you have them, the chance you make a better decision increases. So as you said, we at BitSchool have to consider the various situations (not only when a user cannot use our products temporarily) where we need to take the user's situation into account so that our decisions will be representing and in line with our principle, values and vision, and these discussions really make us think ahead. Please let's keep these discussions going so that we could perfect the business, technological, and operational guidelines that will lead our project so that all users will feel that it's useful, user friendly, thoughtful, and innovative. Thanks to you all^^  Best, BitSchool",False

A classroom in Korea, teachers and students using our platform in their English classes, getting to know the student's exact language proficiency level, teacher's trying their best to meet each student's needs, and students reaching out to English-speaking tutors in Indonesia spontaneously for anything they weren't able to tackle in class or even while they are in class. And as tutors in Indonesia are much cheaper than those in Korea, students can get help at minimum price, alleviating the financial burden of their parents (in Korea, the after-school education cost is a huge social financial burden). Also an English tutor in Indonesia who has previously just served learners in Indonesia or adjacent countries, using our AI assessment Korean version to evaluate the learner's exact English proficiency level and weaknesses which also accurately reflects Korea's peculiar education system, effectively planning her tutoring sessions and deliver the right fitting tutoring to her client's content.

So our token - aka BSCH - is tied to Ether, as our platform is based on ethereum, and the exchange is 1ETH = 6000BSCH. So what will be the token price? Last i checked it was approximately $0.15 but really who knows where BTC or ETH will go in the next days or weeks or months? However, based on my knowledge of how the financial markets work, my believe is that BTC and ETH will continue fluctuating forever but overall wouldn't it show a steady increase at least during mid-year or even at the end of this year (which I strongly hope it would ^^) Especially among other factors, the crypto is increasingly adopted or expected to be adopted by mainstream outfits and the regulations are also slowly taking shapes, and this might positively influence the crypto price movements. So my projection is that at the time of our presale and especially crowdsale, our BSCH price will be more than the current 15 cents. However, this is only my personal projection and hope, and forms in no way a fact, promise or guarantee. Guess everybody, including me, have to use our own knowledge, expertise and intuition to estimate the right price for the moment we want a prediction for. Sorry for being vague, but that's I guess what's called 'life' ^^;  Another thing I want to emphasize is our Embedded Put Option which will give confidence to investors and token holders, as by this option and the 50% discount we'll offer for our fixed-price products (all AI products and the Interactive Web Solutions which will be our online lecturing app) token purchases, the token value on our platform will always be at least twice as high as the token's current market value. So this will help boost confidence in and incentivize holding of our token and it should be an important consideration for prospective investors. If you want to learn more about our innovative Embedded Put Option, please check our website (especially the FAQ section) or whitepaper.  Best, BitSchool",False

However, that doesn’t mean there won’t be any benchmark prices. First of all, the bid prices may serve as good benchmarks themselves as this is the advantage of a bidding system. And of course, there could be a chance that tutors might collude to increase the prices, but in this case, there will be a high chance that one will undercut the others (or he’s not involved in the collusion) and take advantage by offering a lower price. Anyway we believe the global nature of our platform and the active participation of tutors will thwart this possibility significantly. Apart from the price benchmark through the bidding system, we have plans to provide the tutors’ prices they charged for their past services, and customers can refer to them to form a reasonable-price bidding strategy in their minds. Also tutors can open bids and this will provide another source for setting an initial price on the customer side.  Best, BitSchool",False

Hope you’ll be our tutor #1!^^ For tutor quality, we will definitely implement an internal background-check process for the submitted information and also, as discussed before, will provide an innovative service review/rating system that includes token rewards for high-quality reviews; thus will incent the supply of such reviews. As for the tutor qualifications, even a high school student who excels in her class and wants to peer-tutor her classmates or other students will be welcome to our platform. What we intend is that with a thorough background check, we want to prevent any falsified information so that the users can trust the data they review and based their decisions on, and through the review/rating system combined with the bidding system, the natural demand/supply dynamics (high demand for high quality tutors) would determine whether a tutor can get a job and at what price. Based on the review results, the tutor’s transaction fee will either go down (continuously positive reviews) or up (vice versa). I also discussed it before but we have great measures for newbie tutors who can build up their reputation by participating in our tutor volunteer activities or on-demand tutoring services. However, this is our original plan and it would most definitely be fine-tuned on the way, and if you, as a competent and seasoned tutor, have any ideas or suggestions that you might think would be good for us to know, please let us know. That’s the kind of insight we’re fighting for^^  Best, BitSchool",False

Both our tutoring platform and AI products will focus on the language areas (literature included), and as for our tutoring platform, this area will be one major target as we can leverage the global nature of our platform and also the bidding system that will allow tutors and customers to reach the best price regardless of their locations. Also once our AI products are provided more and more in different languages and increasingly reflecting the different education systems, they will be very helpful for not only teachers and students in various countries, but also tutors in organizing targeted tutoring sessions tailored to the different education systems of different countries which is a must for tutors delivering language tutoring services. If we may add one more aspect with regard to the subject areas we plan to offer, adult learning, business, and technology would also be important targets. Hotcoin1234, if you have any great suggestions on top of these, would you kindly share them with us? Would really appreciate getting some genuine insights from potential users^^ Thanks for your question and we look forward to more^^  Best, BitSchool",False

Once BitSchool launches, apart from our adaptive assessment product, we will provide adaptive learning resources such as adaptive feedbacks or videos that accurately match the learner’s learning needs, style and pathway. While our AI technologies and products are getting increasingly perfected and gain recognition as the most effective student assessments and learning applications, there might be a possibility that the education community will accept completing our AI driven education cycle and the generated performance results, and we might be able to provide certificates to learners who complete our AI education cycle. Another aspect is that our target market includes every education participant, from teachers to students to parents; the subject areas we aim to provide our products and services for have no limits; and we will have comprehensive coverage of all eLearning areas from self-paced to corporate (albeit later). Due to these broad reach of our business model, we are already in communication with potential partners who offer online courses and provide certificates upon course completion. These partnerships, if realized, will allows us to issue certificates for course completions. So certificates are totally possible and we will definitely consider them!

Also an important consideration might be the already established widely recognized certificates and how we differentiate our certificate compared to them. In this regard, we think we will have an advantage as our AI platform provides a very effective and systematic approach for learners to perfect their knowledge and skills per stages with producing concrete performance assessments on the way, and as our AI attempt is a rising new area where we plan to become the early leader so we will not compete but pioneer the creation of certificates that help learners know what they have and what they need, and for educational authorities or employers to assess whether the learner is ready to move to the next learning cycle or for the job in the most efficient, transparent and realistic ways.

I personally agree that the bitdegree model is innovative and if it can secure the corporate supports, it might contribute significantly to enhancing the skill development and job search of employees, and the talent hiring of companies. But you will know that it is a very different model from us and we don't think a direct comparison is possible. Most of the BitSchool leadership and team have significant professional teaching, tutoring and education experiences, and when you combine the years of just teaching, it amounts to over 50 years. Also our Course Admins are teaching experts who will help us design, develop and deploy our AI products that will accurately reflect the different education systems. Our partnership is also growing and we will announce new ones soon. For the current partnerships, you can refer to our partnership sections on our webpage.

The beneficiaries of our GoGreenFund will be low-income students and to select qualified candidates, we will receive recommendations from schools, verify the candidates, and determine the final scholarship recipients. Therefore, in this process the school’s recommendations will play a key role in our evaluation. As we gain more experience with operating our GoGreenFund activities, we will find other ways as well to spot and verify students or learners requiring financial help to continue their studies and integrate them into our GoGreenFund requirements. In addition, the GoGreenFund is a proactive charity concept, meaning that we not only endow scholarships, but also encourage tutors to contribute their tutoring talents to low-income students by rewarding their activities with transaction-fee exemption coupons. For this reward, the only requirement for tutors will be their will to help and sacrifice for their community.  Best, BitSchool",False

However, the fear of 'abuse' would not hinder us from helping students who need attention and care.

Also BitSchool provides token rewards for any activities that help improve our platform and one such activity includes helping us with our verification for example the tutor's background veracity and etc. This aspect may further help us settle a fair and free-of-abuse GoGreenFund process.

First of all, we wanted to let you know that one of our major strengths is that the leadership and team of BitSchool is extremely diverse in terms of nationality, professional experience, and knowledge of countries and their education systems. One of our co-founders Tom spent his younger years in Germany (and was educated), went to college and accumulated professional experience in South Korea, and also worked in New York after getting his Columbia MBA. So he knows better than anyone else how education systems differ per countries. The other co-founder Phil is British and has accumulated significant teaching experience there. Therefore we’re ready for taking up the globalization challenges.  For tutoring, we plan to globalize once our platform development is finished and within this broad guideline, we will set up our necessary organization, such as customer services or marketing/sales, which could either cover multiple countries or specific countries depending on the needs and our cost/benefit analysis, to provide geographical coverage. However, as for our AI products, two factors should mainly be considered: language and our Course Admins (who are teaching experts responsible for helping us develop our AI Database and products). So at the beginning, our AI products will definitely be provided in English (as is already our MVP) and some other languages like Korean. As we develop our AI products, we will try our best to provide the other language versions as fast as possible. The Course Admins will be responsible for feeding our AI Database with the required study items and these items will reflect the different education system environment of different countries. For this, we will secure Course Admins of the countries we’re targeting. So taking a realistic approach, our first target market for our AI products will be English speaking countries for which we have sufficiently reflected the educational environment of those countries. Although the education system differs per countries more or less, there are still common areas they share and in these areas, if the language is properly set up, we will enter and provide our products for the common areas in the different education systems (like Math or science). Also we plan to launch our Adaptive AI Assessment MVP in the UK before our presale, so we’re actually starting our globalization^^ Stay tuned.  Best, BitSchool",False

Our platform will consider and integrate the different educational environments per countries and their education systems. And how we do this? We have implemented and will expand our Course Admins who are educational experts with substantial expertise in teaching across various study topics, and they will be responsible for expanding our AI Database and design courses and contents to be integrated in our AI products. They will not only contribute with their own teaching knowledge and experience, but also manage inputs and ideas from the global education community by encouraging the participation of teachers and tutors to dedicate their knowledge to expanding our AI knowledge base (tokens rewards are set up to facilitate this process). These Course Admins and their created community of willing educators will come from various nationalities and possess knowledge of diverse education systems, and this would be a very effective way to customize our AI products to different countries and their different education system. The integration of diverse education system will be very instrumental for our tutors as well since they can leverage our AI tools to effectively tutor customers in different countries they have never served before, so it is considered a great marketing tool and teaching assistant for tutors when they want to serve customers in unfamiliar regions and education systems.

My understanding is that Ntok is an online tutoring platform leveraging blockchain to make the tutor review/rating process transparent. So Ntok is similar in a sense that it is a tutoring platform based on blockchain. However, our main theme is integrating an Artificial Intelligence based eLearning infrastructure with the tutoring platform so that the On-Demand Tutors (or thru other tutoring products) can assist the personalized learning experience powered by AI. That is not saying that our platform won’t offer traditional online tutoring services, of course this will be a big part of our business and we will come up with more innovative services such as our planned Location-Based Tutoring Services and etc. Concluding the differentiation, BitSchool will provide the most ideal path toward personalized learning and it does it by creating seamless connection and synergy betwen AI and online tutoring. Another point I want to raise is that our online tutoring platform will be based on a two-way bidding system, have a well-thought-out escrow mechanism, and provides help to low-income or underprivileged  students by giving them token scholarships and also rewarding tutor volunteers for their volunteer tutoring to these students. Furthermore, we leverage the blockchain and the tokens it allows us to generate for various ingenious purposes from perfecting our AI database to rewarding platform improvement activities or helping us expanding our tutor/customer base. I believe even if we speak just about our online tutoring platform alone, these features make it unique and hence highly differentiated.  Hope this clearly addresses your questions and thanks for your continuous interest and support in BitSchool, it’s really important and encourages our team! ^^  Best, BitSchool",False

However the reason we will have the PayPal-style centralized fiat payment system is the larger population's unfamiliarity or discomfort with making transactions using tokens. So we will introduce a two-layer payment mechanism comprising decentralized token transactions and centralized fiat currency payment so that the latter group who needs time and more usage experience to get familiar and comfortable with token transaction can have enough time to do so. We believe in the near future, tokens will become the majority transaction methods due to its greater advantages including but not limited to decentralization, transparency, and ease to make transactions.

At BitSchool, we define Artificial Intelligence as an advanced computer technology that builds its intelligence by capturing and analyzing the knowledge that we have accumulated so far, and learning the attitudes, patterns, and trends of human. This enables the computer to act and make decisions intelligently to the point that it’s actually much smarter than us, human, cause it has a much broader knowledge base and much deeper understanding of how human think, act, and make decisions.  Then how does BitSchool applies AI to personalize learning? The AI will learn the student’s knowledge, their movements such every click and mouse movements, or their learning style or pattern. Based on this accumulated information, it will be able to make an accurate assessment of the student’s learning needs, style and most ideal learning pathway. Based on the assessment result, the AI will intelligently generate the most appropriate learning resources and materials, adaptive videos for one instance, for the students and provide the most fitting feedbacks that are required of the students to improve their weaknesses or learn new things. While the AI iterates this process, it will become so intelligent that it’ll be able to generate feedbacks to more complicated and creative tasks such as essays or artistic activities.  Thx for the great question and hope our response addressed it fully, if not, you know where to find us^^  Best, BitSchool",False

When you see it from the tutor side, of course, an instant payment will be preferred, however, if you see it from the customer side, she wants to have a dispute mechanism by which she can raise any issues she might have regarding the tutor’s service quality. And just because a transaction entered a dispute, it doesn’t mean that the tutor won’t get his service fees. The tutor has to understand the customer’s reason of discontent and address it. I believe this is true for every service-oriented businesses as mostly ‘determining quality’ is a subjective process and there is the possibility that how one part perceives the quality could be different from the other party, hence the dispute resolution. And we will also implement a dispute resolution system by which we will assist the resolution process and if any other user can provide us with information that will be useful for resolving the dispute, the user will be rewarded by our Tokening process.

So basically customers will make the decision based on the evaluation materials we provide them with in the bidding process (I already mentioned about this materials in my earlier thread). Therefore, the issue will be for newbie tutors who doesn’t have stellar reviews/ratings or just have a few. But our platform actually provides a very effective way for them to gain good reputation by using our on-demand tutoring or acting as tutor volunteers. On-Demand Tutoring is spontaneous and will be performed over a very short timeframe like 10 minutes or an hour, and customers will feel less picky as they won’t lose much in monetary terms in case the tutor’s quality is below expectation. By using this on-demand service, newbie tutors can build up their reputation and may get a chance to get offered more formal longer-period tutoring requests. Also newbie tutors or tutors lacking sufficient reputation could volunteer their tutoring services to low-income students and at the same time, build up their reputation. Our platform will also differentiate the fee structure between high-quality tutors and low-quality tutors where the former will pay less transaction fees whereas the latter will pay more. This will incentivize tutors to improve and maintain their good reputation.  Hope this address your question. Thx for your comments^^  Best, BitSchool",False

Let me explain. BitSchool is basically providing the best infrastructure for assessing the learners' progress by its Adaptive AI Assessment (which you can test by our MVP^^) and the Personalized Learning Checklist that contains the assessment results generated through the assessment process. The tracking is actually performed by our platform's users who would definitely be teachers and tutors and even students or their parents. And one innovative thing about this assessment process is that these users would most probably implement mini-Assessments on needs basis in-between the sessions so that they can continuously check not only the learners' study progress, but also find improvement areas in their Lesson Plans or teaching methods or directions. For teachers, this aspect will allow them to deliver the personalized learning they so much want to create, and from the tutors and tutoring customer's point of view, on top of the personalized learning aspect, it adds additional advantages. The tutors can use the assessment results to pitch additional lesson sessions to the customers while customers can use the assessment results to evaluate the tutor's quality and take actions accordingly such as asking for additional free revisions sessions (solid ground for dispute) or finding a more fitting tutor.  So your question is very important and we hope our response addresses your inquiry accurately. If not, let us know and keep your enthusiastic support for BitSchool^^  Best Regards,  BitSchool",False

As you're well aware, the blockchain technology is mostly associated with decentralization and how this creates the best transparent transaction mechanism.

Actually working with our partners, we're aware that they have some pretty solid ideas too on creatively and innovatively using the blockchain technology to benefit as much people as possible like us. So our guess is that we will see more and more platforms that will use the blockchain technology in extremely innovative ways like BitSchool and provide unthinkable products and services to the benefits of users. But you're definitely hitting the right mark here. Our crypto programs (actually called Tokening) allows to do so many great things that will help not only launch our platform successfully, but expand our customer base (teachers, tutors, students, learners, parents etc) rapidly, offer huge discounts for token purchases, constantly improve every aspect of our platform including but not limited to the service qualities of tutors, perfecting our AI database, working on airtight platform security and so on and so forth.

It is a great project'. I always believe that when a product is really innovative and worthy, people ultimately take notice of it and that's how good products begin to gain popularity. However, just because a product is good, it doesn't mean that communicating the product’s features and advantages is not necessary. It's even more important to talk and communicate with potential users so that they have a clear understanding of the benefits and utilities this product would provide to them and only when this is achieved, they will start paying attention and might purchase and use it. So definitely we have to explore our communication channels more aggressively so that there will be more and more people like you. Thx for your constructive feedbacks! Please give us more ^^;  As for BitDegree, I'm not an expert of their business model. However, I understand that it's a MOOC providing technology courses being paid by their tokens issued like scholarships. So we are very different:  1. First of all, the Learning Topics we provide are not confined to technology courses and our products and services will span every subject area such as Math, Literature, Science, IT and so on and so forth. Especially as our model integrates the tutoring platform, the subjects will actually depend on what customers are looking for and what our tutors can provide. The insights on subjects will be integrated in our AI product as well.  2. Our platform is built upon Artificial Intelligence technology (AI) and will address the whole cycle of educational process from assessing the student's current proficiency level to providing the most appropriate learning resources that matches the student's learning needs, style and learning pathway. So in this regard, our platform is unique and we haven't seen either an eLearning or online education platform that offers AI to resolve the current education problems – FYI, (a) Difficulty to track the student's progress or improvements as frequently as required; (b) Education is tailored to the average student rather than the individual; (c) it's hard to provide personalized feedback timely and in a focused way.  3. Our scholarship issued by our GoGreenFund targets low-income students or students with financial difficulty and will contribute to enhancing the equal affordability of high-quality education as these scholarship recipients can use the tokens to purchase tutoring services or AI products on our platform. Also the GoGreenFund rewards tutor volunteers who sacrifice their time and effort to provide good education to underprivileged students by transaction-fee exemption coupons (they use this coupons to get their transaction fees exempted). As portion of our transaction fee will be contributed to the GoGreenFund to fund its operations, users are actually contributing to equal learning opportunities while making every purchase on our platform. And this is what we truly like about the fund's structure.  4. Our AI platform is perfectly integrated with our online tutoring platform. Although our AI applications will be crucial in realizing the ideal personalized learning eco system, we concluded that without connecting it to on-demand tutors, it's not perfect. So this is how it works. A student in a class made his assessment and begin working on his weakness. There is one question he doesn't quite get, but due to the many students comprising a class, he lost his chance to ask his teacher. No worries because he simply has to connect using his tablet to our on-demand tutor network, find the right tutor, and get instant lesson or feedback regarding the specific question. Also the teacher has to create a lesson plan that would benefit all students and this is not easy, she also has a lot of marking to do. Don't worry, she can easily utilize BitSchool's Dynamic Marking System that would partly or fully conduct the marking process on behalf of the teacher or she can connect with an on-demand tutor who is capable of helping her with the marking. As you can see, this connection will create the perfect education environment where the teacher is able to teach effectively and every student is able to get smart.  5. Every high-tech project has strong business experts and technologists. However, what differentiates us in terms of people is that we have dedicated teachers and student team members who are united around the same goal to create the best education environment where teachers can teach effectively and where no student is left behind. These teachers and students team members are the main sources that allow us to breathe educational reality into our design, development and deployment of our products and services, and ultimately build systems and services that are truly matching the needs of all education participants such as teachers, tutors, students and parents.  Um…you raised a very good question and it allowed me to think profoundly. Thanks a lot as I know this kind of question can only be raised out of serious interest, and we appreciate you for that. Please keep continuing your interest, passion and support for BitSchool! ^^  Best, BitSchool",False

My guess is you’re not talking about our transaction fee, but the tutoring service fees. So I’ll base my answer on the latter. The service fee is actually one of our important differentiation factors. Our tutoring platform will have a two-way bidding system through which both the tutors and learners can open a bid. This bidding system will allow a price agreement that is not unilateral and does not involve uncertainty cause you don’t know what the other’s pricing position is, and will enable a price determination based on demand and supply in the tutoring market. We believe that this process will allow learners and tutors to reach a reasonable price level. It could be possible that competent tutors in low-income countries might gain a price advantage over equivalently competent tutors in high-income countries who receives higher fees because of the higher income level (of course this assumes the tutors in low-income countries are able to provide their services because they know the local language of the different country). However, our platform will provide these tutors living in high-income countries with a much bigger global market and this may compensate their lost income due to the competition with tutors from low-income countries who may have a price edge over them. Also our AI products will help tutors to deliver their services more effectively across borders (for example, a tutor who wants to enter a new market can use our Adaptive AI Assessment which will be provided in that country’s language and quickly understand the learner’s learning needs despite the tutor’s unfamiliarity with that country’s education system)  As to our quality assurance, when the tutor or learner enter or participate in the bid, they will be provided with various materials that would help them assess the tutor’s quality including but not limited to past service reviews and ratings on our platform, tutor resume (including expertise areas), and syllabus. Our customer service reps will conduct necessary background checks of the tutor’s submitted materials and we will also have token rewards for those who help us with our verification process.

Tutoring Service: The payment to tutors will follow an escrow mechanism and the money will be held in the customer escrow until the tutor delivers her service and both agree that her service was successfully completed. Then the money will be moved to the tutor’s escrow and will be paid. Of course we will also have a dispute period during which the customer can raise any issues he might have with his tutor and once a dispute is raised, the money in the customer’s escrow will not be transferred to the tutor’s escrow until the dispute is resolved. 2.   AI Products and other Fixed-Price Products: For these products, we won’t offer the escrow service as these are products and not services. Also the fee will be formed as a licensing fee for the usage of our AI and other fixed-price products (FYI, other fixed-price product is like our Integrated Web Solution which will be an effective online lecturing application).

(A) Yep you’re partly right, however, it’s not only AI tech, but also tutoring. Like I envisaged in my earlier response, the on-demand tutoring service will form a crucial part in realizing personalized learning. We actually also have plans to integrate location-based tutoring which will allow instant meetups to resolve spontaneous learning needs on an one-on-one basis. But the bottom line is the AI integration into education is the greatest theme of BitSchool.  (Q) However, how do you draw a clear line between automation and individualization.  (A) I think there’s a misunderstanding. Our Adaptive AI Assessment or the Personalized Learning Checklist (PLC) is not automation but individualization. The Assessment tool will accurately evaluate the student’s proficiency level per topics and sub topics, and the PLC will present the results i.e strength and weaknesses. However, our Dynamic Marking System, which will help teachers with their marking process, will be initially an Automation, but as the computer learns the teachers’ marking habits, patterns, behavior and etc, it’ll get sufficiently intelligent so that it could actually conduct the marking by itself on behalf of the teacher. So the Dynamic Marking is more targeting to make the teacher’s job more effective but it also has an individualization aspect by its ability to generate appropriate feedbacks to students. However, this part will not be available initially and will be developed by our AI technologists. And our goal is to train the computer to the point that it could actually mark and provide feedbacks to very complicated and creative tasks such as essays. Also our Adaptive Video Technology will be used for personalizing learning as it will be able to present learning videos that matches the student’s learning needs and style. So as you can see, to us, actually the automation and individualization is quite clearly divided.  (Q) Overall, school is more about teaching as a group and it is quite hard to craft individual materials. That is why some families got tutors to help the students to learn better. However, it is very expensive to purely hire tutors for all the subjects. So how do you differentiate the different ability of the students and how to offer more assistance to those who had greater studies needs. (A) Great point! This is actually explaining the background of our integration of AI with tutoring. We envisage to individualize the learning of students by the collaboration between AI and tutoring. So as I mentioned above, the AI will reach a point where it can provide appropriate learning resources and feedbacks that meet the student’s specific learning needs and style. Maybe this could be enough for certain students but not enough for some. For the latter, by using our on-demand tutoring service which will provide not general but spontaneous and targeted lessons for specific tasks or questions, these students will be able to supplement their learning with the AI. And these on-demand sessions in terms of service fees will be much cheaper than formal tutoring services that are usually performed over a length of time. However, there is still a chance that the learning needs of some students might not be handled through this process and in this case, they would be better off getting formal tutoring services. However, we believe that our system and the personalized learning environment we will create will cover the learning needs of most students.  Hope I addressed your questions and feel free to let me know if you have any other or if I was not accurate in some aspects. Thx again for your serious interest in BitSchool.  Best, BitSchool",False

The AI then calculates a prediction of how that student should perform in future assessments and thus adjusts the difficulty of each question to ensure the student is both challenged and motivated throughout the course. This process is constantly re-calculated as the student progresses ensuring that the difficulty of the questions increases as the students knowledge also increases.  In the future we hope to utilise Natural Language Processing and machine learning along with CAFA's Automatic Item Generation (Our main partner currently) to spontaneously adapt a particular questions phrasing and answers in order to finely adjust the difficulty of that question. There is also plans to utilise all of the big data we will generate for exam answers in order to train a Deep Neural Network to be able to mark exam answers. However, there are lots of steps along the way towards this such as first training such a DNN to first identify trends in answers and to inform human assessors of these trends in order to speed up the marking process.  This is merely one of the areas that we are planning to use AI to improve education but there are many others which are all identified in the whitepaper.  I hope this has elaborated more on our end goals of the AI platform.",False

There won't be any geographical or subject limits for our tutor clients and the global market is our tutor source. And tutors who are specializing or having experience in helping learners with disabilities will definitely be interested in joining our network and using our on-demand tutoring service to extend spontaneous help and also leveraging our AI product lines for these learners. And like you noticed, the principal purpose of our on-demand service is to provide instant learning lessons that occur on the spot whether in the classroom or in a business meeting, or when a developer is stuck with a particular code generation, and of course when a learner with special care needs requires additional educational help. So I totally agree that the on-demand combined with our AI product lines will have significant positive impact on improving the learning environment for learners who need special care. Also one of our core members comes from a family business background that has provided educational programs tailored to learners with disabilities for many years.  Hope this addressed your inquiry and let me know if you have any other questions!",False

Thx for your kind and effective tips! We don't have any private investors behind our back and everything has been done by and within my team including the AI prototype. One of the main reasons we were dragged to the blockchain tech, apart from its huge utility in setting up token scholarships and implementing innovative reward programs, is that it allows us to avoid the traditional 'professional investment sources' and get the help of people who are truly interested in the betterment of education by integrating developed or developing high technologies and who wants to be part of realizing the ideal personalized learning eco system with as much contribution as they are able to make. So this is why the blockchain is so important for BitSchool and its missions. So your question about 'how much already invested?' the answer is 'nil'     Also we will have our Adaptive AI Assessment MVP ready before our presale and be available to anyone who is interested in BitSchool and its Adaptive AI Technology soon. Devvie and anybody else who's eager to see our concept in work can try it at that time for sure! In addition to our AI prototype, we also forged a serious partnership with CAFA which has worked for years in perfecting the Computer Adaptive Formative Assessment Technology and has some great plans to revolutionize the test-data collection processes (this is still confidential at this point so I can't divulge any more details without their consent...sorry for that) and BitSchool will benefit hugely by gaining access to their developed and developing technologies. The BitSchool and CAFA partnership is symbiotic and BitSchool plans to provide various new marketing channels to them and also our technological prowess for their development efforts as well. We are also planning to co-organize or participate in global eLearning or high-tech forums together.  Stay tuned! You can find more information about our partnership and what CAFA does and how accomplished they are on our website and whitepaper. In the meantime, if you have any other questions or suggestions, PLEASE let us know",False

One of the greatest assets of the BitSchool Team is that they know the current education system and their limits as well as problems accurately based on their own substantial teaching experiences. This is why BitSchool is able to suggest a realistic and hopefully most ideal solutions to realizing personalized learning so that no one will be left behind and even those who are ahead may make their studies more effective. Oh btw we are getting also very invaluable inputs and feedbacks from our student teams. These are very important in creating 360-degree evaluations on our plans and technologies Hope for your continuous interest in BitSchool and if you have any opinions or questions of BitSchool or us, pls let us know any time!",False
