Don't you think this gives stability to the concept for the 1 year and based on the concept of supply vs demand more adoption brings on stability for an estimated increase on the value of the token ? Compare to most stable tokens which are pegged to USD and it goes +/- 2-5% fluctuations.  And also true basis of stable coin format is those assets that it is pegged to must be available for audit in a custodian party, til date I see none and if that concept can be term stable concept I believe our concept could be termed as stable too for the first year and the natural price increase comes in form the natural adoption.

The reason for the 12 months lock up is to give the team ample time to grow the business and push out for adoption.  We do not offer bounty and no free tokens given out for marketing. This stops bounty hunters from dumping when the token is listed on exchange after ICO which is what most ICOs are facing even if they launch a successful product  Our focus on our project is making digital assets spendable. The lack of such focus in the industry have made cryptocurrency as a speculative trading tool in the market. Almost USD600 billion have gone out from the total market cap of the industry which is bad.  The token and project is focused more on utility propositions which is lacking in cryptocurrencies. Our job is to build intrinsic value so that our token holds for its value to be used as payment for goods and services.  Lynpay payment solution focuses making digital assets spendable thru our debit card and P.O.S terminals which accepts BTC/ETH/LYN as mode of payments. We are providing 2-3 tiers of exclusive metal debit cards and 1-2 tiers of plastic cards. The metal debit cards comes with a lot of benefits like airport lounge access, Invites to exclusive events and parties worldwide, tailored made concierge service and many more.  For anyone to apply our debit card, they have to pay a subscription fee with LYN tokens only or they can hold a certain number of tokens for 6 months before being issued with the card. We will also be launching an affiliate program where we will pay up to usd100 in tokens for every new member recommended. VIP metal debit cards will be issued to outstanding affiliate as a reward.  The POS machines will serve as a payment gateway using cryptocurrencies directly which ultimately has a total lower transaction cost. As you can see worldwide especially in china, it shows you how effective just with the phone and an app you are able to make payments for goods and services.  We have also partnered with Gobuybid.com where you can use your tokens to make purchases for premium products on the website. Every month there will be a black Friday sale on the website where the previous month’s stock can go up to 80% discount from normal price.
