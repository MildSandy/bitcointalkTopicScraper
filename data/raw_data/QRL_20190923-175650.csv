The transaction costs are called ""gas"" and are measured in the units of ""gwei"", you will have to have some ETH in your wallet for whatever transaction you do on the Ethereum blockchain, weather it is sending ERC20 tokens (such as QRL currently is) or sending ETH around, it all needs ETH (gas) to be processed.  What I dont understand is why you are saying that you are moving away from the ledger nano S. I understand why people dont like MEW and see a security risk in it (although this also depends on the security measures one conducts, it actually can be used very safely, if done the right way), but the Ledger Nano S is the safest way to store ETH and ERC20 tokens that are laying on your ETH wallet, because the private key cant leave the device and therefore never is exposed to attacks, no matter how much viruses and malware there is on your computer.

I did not say it can be done. The question if a blockchain can be made quantum proof by forking is a different discussion, but is not relevant. Why? Because it would be useless even if it COULD be done. The point is this, and I will try to explain again below: ALL existing crypto with coins or tokens out (ERC20 or the final product), can NEVER quantum-secure all their existing coins/ tokens and will therefore be at risk of having coins hacked and mass sold when quantum computers are in full function. So let me rephrase that for clarity: even if they could upgrade their blockchain to a quantum secure blockchain, they can’t automatically secure the coins people own. These coins can still be hacked after a quantum proof update.  I’ll try to explain again but I’ll have to start at the beginning, so don’t blame me if it sounds basic: A crypto has coins (or tokens). These coins are stored in wallets or on an exchange. As an owner of these coins, you want to be the only one to be able to access the coins and move them if you wish. So to protect your property, your coins are stored on an address: your public key. Your private key gives you the authorization to move them to another address (on an exchange it’s different because you don’t have the private key there yourself, but the result is the same: if someone cracks the main private key, they can steal your coins). Your public key can be known by others and is public, but your private key obviously not. If anybody gets your private key, they can get access and steal your coins. Now how do you get these public and private keys? If you get a public key (address), the blockchain gives you the private key that comes with that public key. If you lose the private key, you will be locked out of the public key (the address) and you will never be able to get your coins out of there ever again. Blockchains can’t just email you a new private key, because the only way a blockchain knows you’re the owner, is if you show the private key. So if you lose it, you can’t prove anything, and your locked out for good. That is why blockchains are so secure. So the only access to your coins that are stored on your public key, is through your private key. Private keys can not be hacked by normal computers. But quantum computers can hack the normal private keys. Now if a blockchain is quantum proof, they give you a public key with a quantum proof private key. So this private key can not be hacked by a quantum computer, and your coins are safe in that case. Now you think “ok, so if a blockchain upgrades to a quantum proof blockchain, the problem is solved”. But the problem is, if a blockchain already exists, there are millions of coins out there that NEED to be accessible by their owners after the fork or upgrade.  To understand why that is a problem, and why that can’t be solved, we need to understand how a fork works: so how can a blockchain be upgraded and still give the owners of the coins access to their coins. After the fork, everybody needs to have the exact same amount of coins they had before the fork. So there will be a 1:1 tokenswap. Everyone who owns an amount of tokens of the old blockchain, will own that same amount of tokens of the new blockchain. To accomplish that, you will NEED to keep the old private keys active until the owner moves it’s coins to a new address: a public key that is accessible only through a new quantum proof private key. (Maybe another option would be that you wouldn’t need to move your coins to a new address, but the old private key would be de-activated after you claimed your new quantum proof private key. I don’t know if this last option is even possible, but if it would be possible, it would still mean that your old private key needs to be active after the fork until the owner uses it and actively de-activates it.) So:   - The blockchain ""knows"" the amount of tokens you have at that specific time, and thus the amount of tokens you are entitled to, by looking at your public key. (Like for example etherscan does.)  - They can only send these tokens to its rightful owner, by sending them to that exact public key (address). That way it is guaranteed that only the rightful owner can access them, because only he has access to that address (The old private key and old public key). So then the new coins are on you old address, that is still accessible through your old private key. Now, even if it would technically possible, the blockchain can't erase the old private key or replace it with a new one, because then the owner would not be able to access his coins. Remember: he doesn’t HAVE the new private key. It’s not like you can get your new private key by email. So the blockchain needs to allow you to enter with your old private key, even if they just upgraded itself to a quantum proof blockchain. So your coins are NOT protected by that blockchains new and improved quantum proof private keys. Not until you have accessed your coins through your old private key. Then you would need to move them, or de-activate the old private key to lock your coins up in a way that it’s only accessible with a quantum proof private key.  So what you need to understand is this: after a blockchain is upgraded to a quantum secure blockchain, ALL coins are still accessible through the old private keys, and therefore still hackable by quantum computers. So even though this blockchain can claim to be quantum proof, their coins are NOT until the owner accesses them and takes action.  Now we come to the next point I wrote before, where you will see why a big amount of the coins of an upgraded blockchain will never become quantum secure:  - Not all owners of coins will take the necessary action. That’s just human nature. (People don't read, or read half, don't understand, postpone, don't care, don't know how or don't see the point in any other way)  - There are a lot of coins without an actual active owner: the owners lost their private key, their password or got locked out in another way. It happens a lot. So especially with coins that exist for a while like BTC and ETH, there are a lot of coins that nobody even CAN move to a new wallet. Don’t underestimate the total amount of these coins. All these coins will still be accessible through the old private key after ""quantum proving"" the blockchain because the owners need to move them, or de-activate the old private key to lock your coins up with a quantum proof private key.  So lots of new quantum proof coins, will not be moved away from the old private key and be accessible through both their old private key and their new quantum proof private key. It’s like when your house has a cardboard front door anybody can walk through. And to fix that, your make an new unbreakable door and install that as your backdoor, while leaving your front door as it was. As long as you don’t build a brick wall where your cardboard door is, people can still walk in your house and steal your stuff. So the only conclusion can be: Even if you could upgrade an existing blockchain to a quantum proof blockchain (and wether or not that is possible is still open for discussion), then still, a big part of their circulating supply can be hacked. Is that a problem? Yes, even if you move and secure your own coins, if others are stolen and sold, your coins will drop in value dramatically, and panic sales would be all around.",False

Will it be like bitcoin (which is pretty high right now) or will the QRL team be able to have it more like Litecoin? If any Developers (or experienced guessers) in this thread this would be very interesting to know.",False

We can sign transactions and encrypt communication between browsers and nodes. Actually this is already a possibility in QRL, but it will take time while users, companies etc. see the potential of this. Let's say for example post quantum encryption between your browser and your bank and any such situations where you need the highest security in communications. I think this is going to be huge area for QRL!  and other features in the pipeline will surely raise transaction volumes on QRL once they are implemented. I am personally not worried about transaction costs I am ready to pay fair value for the highest security as should everyone!  I don't see QRL as a competitor in the microtransaction space where you want the cheapest transactions some other chain can do that. QRL is where you move and store heavy value and communications, signatures, identification etc. stuff that really matters that calls for highest security.",False

However most people won't like high TX costs (even for storage) since all will not have large investment and the TX cost will ""feel"" like loosing money if it is too high. But this should not stop the larger investors from seeing the value of having a safe place for their money. But for this QRL must also show a stable price over the long term before larger investor will be willing to store their cash/information there.  This is not something bad for QRL it is just important to understand what market QRL will be applicable for to be able to predict a possible future market cap.

About the timeline the teams current priority is to get QRL's unique POS code locked. It is already very stable from what I can tell on testnet and after that heavy security testing and external auditing towards the mainnet launch by year end. Smart contract integration is scheduled for 2018. The main developer has shared some thoughts on smart contracts in general and currently there is no perfect implementation of smart contracts on any chain not even Ethereum. QRL could also change that. They have not yet revealed all their plans.  Also remember that Ethereum is still depending on POW and is trying to move to POS on some distant schedule.  QRL will be fully quantum resistant and it's not optional it's forced on every address and on POS from launch so QRL will be ways ahead of Ethereum in terms of security and scalability.  Quote from: WilderX on September 28, 2017, 04:57:29 AM Quote from: EnViRoNmEnT on September 28, 2017, 01:29:09 AM I still dont get it what QRL makes unique. There are already quantum resistant coins out there and it seems to be no big problem to integrate quantum resistant mechanism in existing coins in the future. So can anyone explain me what QRL makes special? I really dont understand it but i want  No there is no quantum resistant crypto out there other than IOTA, but IOTA is a DAG (+ last time I checked the consensus in IOTA is centralized it's not even decentralized). I know there have been a few cryptos to make this claim because they use really long keys or whatever, but they still use Elliptic-curve cryptography. Quantum computer can use shor's algorithm to break this kind of cryptography which is used basicly in all crypto's today.  Yes it is a big problem to integrate real quantum resistance or they would have done it already and most of them don't even have any plans to do it. Ethereum is saying they will do it, but the way Vitalik is saying now that they plan to do it is to implement one time keys scheme and it will be optional. One time key scheme will simply not be enough it's more like a marketing stunt and Vitalik can't implement any real quantum resistant solution because that would bottleneck he's already struggling network. He wants the network to scale or the idea of Ethereum dies and what is even worse is that it will be optional that leaves a lot of addresses compromised and will be devastating in a post QC event.  What is unique in QRL you ask?  1) Use of stateful XMSS signatures to secure addresses. 2) Custom hash-based POS algorithm generating randomness using hash-based PRF and iterative keyed hash-chains. 3) Ephemeral messaging layer with anonymous completely private post-quantum secure end-end data channels.  I would also add that the team is unique. They even have a post-quantum cryptography researcher in the team (which there are only a few in the whole World) who is also working on a post-quantum protection project funded by the European Commission. The lead dev is really a genius and most friendly person I have met in crypto and they are not greedy. They could have have collected 10's or 100's of millions for this project like many others have done, but they capped crowdfund at 4M$ because anything more would just be greed. They really believe in their vision and that this is important for the World. Rest of the team is just as awesome they have really delivered these past months. You can see this on Github and if you join the alpha testers.  As some wise man once said. Invest in people, not ideas.",False

I quote for you couple of my earlier posts in this thread to save time and they also explain why implementing real quantum resistance on existing chains is a no go. Look how many years it has taken and still debate is ongoing about BTC scaling it's a nightmare to implement anything on existing chains.  Quote from: WilderX on September 28, 2017, 04:57:29 AM Quote from: EnViRoNmEnT on September 28, 2017, 01:29:09 AM I still dont get it what QRL makes unique. There are already quantum resistant coins out there and it seems to be no big problem to integrate quantum resistant mechanism in existing coins in the future. So can anyone explain me what QRL makes special? I really dont understand it but i want  No there is no quantum resistant crypto out there other than IOTA, but IOTA is a DAG (+ last time I checked the consensus in IOTA is centralized it's not even decentralized). I know there have been a few cryptos to make this claim because they use really long keys or whatever, but they still use Elliptic-curve cryptography. Quantum computer can use shor's algorithm to break this kind of cryptography which is used basicly in all crypto's today.  Yes it is a big problem to integrate real quantum resistance or they would have done it already and most of them don't even have any plans to do it. Ethereum is saying they will do it, but the way Vitalik is saying now that they plan to do it is to implement one time keys scheme and it will be optional. One time key scheme will simply not be enough it's more like a marketing stunt and Vitalik can't implement any real quantum resistant solution because that would bottleneck he's already struggling network. He wants the network to scale or the idea of Ethereum dies and what is even worse is that it will be optional that leaves a lot of addresses compromised and will be devastating in a post QC event.  What is unique in QRL you ask?  1) Use of stateful XMSS signatures to secure addresses. 2) Custom hash-based POS algorithm generating randomness using hash-based PRF and iterative keyed hash-chains. 3) Ephemeral messaging layer with anonymous completely private post-quantum secure end-end data channels.  I would also add that the team is unique. They even have a post-quantum cryptography researcher in the team (which there are only a few in the whole World) who is also working on a post-quantum protection project funded by the European Commission. The lead dev is really a genius and most friendly person I have met in crypto and they are not greedy. They could have have collected 10's or 100's of millions for this project like many others have done, but they capped crowdfund at 4M$ because anything more would just be greed. They really believe in their vision and that this is important for the World. Rest of the team is just as awesome they have really delivered these past months. You can see this on Github and if you join the alpha testers.  As some wise man once said. Invest in people, not ideas.

First of all this is no coin. This is a ledger. The most secure ledger to be precise. Which goes far beyond of just store of value adding features like Ephemeral, Digital Identification, PQ secure data channels, PQ secure comms, PQ secure messenger services, PQ secure VOIP, PQ secure VPN. PQ secure provenance and proof-of-existence services. Smart contracts...  I guess problems what you are referring to was with the former community manager Jomari Peterson who started spreading FUD about the project, because the founders didn't hand over the control of the project to him and didn't agree to he's growing demands for he's compensation etc. basicly he's greed led to the situation where the team had no choice but to remove him.  He was no key member of the project. The development team (coders) has been very hard at work as they demonstrated when they pushed the codebase to github and everyone can participate in the testnet.

If you don’t trust their coding skills or progress, you just show you don’t even try to do some research on them. QRL is so easy to follow. You can even join the testnet and see for yourself if you have the skills that you try to downtalk for QRL. At what project is joining the testnet so easy as with QRL? In a few days its even easier to join if your skills are not good in that field, because they will have their web-wallet up in their testnet. Just go tho their discord which you obviously have not done yet. Ask for directions and you will be guided to Github. Also check their coin gecko score for development activity. Shit, I can’t believe I need to explain this to you. You really shouldn’t have such a big mouth for someone with so little knowledge. You just bitching or trying to create a dip to buy more.

First off: selling your own stake to fund the project? This is the most stupid thing I have heard of...anywhere in stocks insider trading is good when officials buy more of their own company and bad when they sell. I don't know what idiot was the first to believe an owner would sell their own coins to fund the project let alone how they convinced so many others to believe this nonsense. Insider trading is a good way to judge a companies strengths and weaknesses.  Second: everyone seems to think that if you are a doctor or lawyer that you have a reputation to uphold. Well you know how many piece of shit doctors I have met? Also accepting the information of a ""personal relationship"" generally results in a biased opinion. Not saying this is the case.  Third: I am a holder of QRL who believes this project has potential, but am also starting to wonder if Jomari was right...I'm sure a lot goes on behind the scenes, and before all this FUD, Jomari was one of the most active supporters of QRL through the Slack and other channels. He held a great conversation and had good information in regards to QRL. Probably the best information in the slack early on. Not taking sides on who was right or wrong, but I am gaining reason to believe Jomari did receive the short stick somewhere along the lines. Again, hodling and don't plan on selling anytime soon.  Honestly just wanted to throw in my 2 cents, but I stand neutral on the whole thing, Hopefully the delays are just that and we see great success with QRL, but this is the wild west, so don't get butthurt if QRL flops and you lose your investment. I think QRL has great potential, but let's be ready for a community takeover if we need to.",False

And my compliments, it takes a great deal of self knowledge to make your own diagnose. You are convinced the QRL team is shit and lie, yet you don't sell your QRL. Classic case of cognitive dissonance. All you need to do now is tell everybody you didn’t want to sell your QRL anyway.  I don’t know if any dev sold some of his coins or how much or when. Don’t care either. Putting your own money in your own project? Maybe he did. If he did, he must have great faith in the success of his own project. The delay is a fact and it won’t be the last one, get used to it. Happens to a lot of projects as mentioned above. This is the closest you will get to actual rocket science level tech. It’s hard, it takes time and needs to be thorough. If you got money in this thing, be glad they don’t just goof around and release prematurely. The biggest indicator of the success of this project is the actual product they working on. So unless all we do here is discussing a soap about doctors and self reviewing psychology and people being bummed out they're still no millionaire because of some delay, maybe we can focus on the technical side of QRL and the development.

The lead dev sold small portition of he's own personal QRL holdings exactly because of the Jomari drama to fund the development of the project. This is no secret he said so himself on slack. How many devs you know who fund their project from their own pocket? There's 15 people on the team now!! This should make you trust the dev more not less! 2. Talking about trusting Peter Waterland first of all he is a Doctor, a surgeon and has reputation to maintain outside of crypto. Secondly I have personal experience with him in a non QRL related matter he could have conned me and take 100k$ of my money and run he literally had that chance, but he didnt which makes me trust him 100%. 3. It is in fact Jomari's behaviour that was questionable from the start he made claims of high profile people to be supporting QRL when in fact they were not and put QRL in a bad light. He was making lies before he even started the drama that got him kicked out from the team. So anything he says has zero weight.  But then again you are Jomari aren't you.

I know there have been a few cryptos to make this claim because they use really long keys or whatever, but they still use Elliptic-curve cryptography. Quantum computer can use shor's algorithm to break this kind of cryptography which is used basicly in all crypto's today.  Yes it is a big problem to integrate real quantum resistance or they would have done it already and most of them don't even have any plans to do it. Ethereum is saying they will do it, but the way Vitalik is saying now that they plan to do it is to implement one time keys scheme and it will be optional. One time key scheme will simply not be enough it's more like a marketing stunt and Vitalik can't implement any real quantum resistant solution because that would bottleneck he's already struggling network. He wants the network to scale or the idea of Ethereum dies and what is even worse is that it will be optional that leaves a lot of addresses compromised and will be devastating in a post QC event.  What is unique in QRL you ask?  1) Use of stateful XMSS signatures to secure addresses. 2) Custom hash-based POS algorithm generating randomness using hash-based PRF and iterative keyed hash-chains. 3) Ephemeral messaging layer with anonymous completely private post-quantum secure end-end data channels.  I would also add that the team is unique. They even have a post-quantum cryptography researcher in the team (which there are only a few in the whole World) who is also working on a post-quantum protection project funded by the European Commission. The lead dev is really a genius and most friendly person I have met in crypto and they are not greedy. They could have have collected 10's or 100's of millions for this project like many others have done, but they capped crowdfund at 4M$ because anything more would just be greed. They really believe in their vision and that this is important for the World. Rest of the team is just as awesome they have really delivered these past months. You can see this on Github and if you join the alpha testers.  As some wise man once said. Invest in people, not ideas.",False

We obtained our pre-sale Bitcoin and Ethereum in a private raise using very clear terms just two months ago. Our mainnet launch is penciled just two/three months away. Since our pre-sale we have in just ~60 days had to professionalize the team, look for additional talent in a crowded space, personally deploy ERC20 tokens to hundreds of people (with associated tech support) and continue to develop our codebase at breakneck speed to hit our targets. Our roadmap offers no margin for delay whatsoever because we want the QRL to be the first truly post-quantum secure blockchain in the world. But we have to do it properly. Up to now the entire project from inception (hosting, VPS, AWS, salaries, travel costs, legal, licensing, third party services etc) have been covered entirely by myself. Our plan remains to set up a legal Foundation entity and use the funds from the pre-sale to facilitate the project but securing the optimum jurisdiction and form for this body is complex and time-consuming. Our roadmap does now allow for such delays and so I have paid for everything myself on an interim basis. After the pre-sale participants petitioned us to issue ERC20 tokens I made the decision to sell a portion of my own personal coins to cover costs, especially as these will grow with every new team member recruited going forward. I recognize that selling these coins could be interpreted as ‘lead dev doesn’t have confidence in the project’ but that is categorically not the case. I would like to offer my apology to those who feel we should have gone about this differently and give my word that no further coins will be sold before the vesting period ends. No other core team members have received their allocation. Transparency and openness is very important and we will therefore publish the addresses of all core team members when they receive their Quanta at mainnet launch. Additionally, the Foundation address is custodian to the 65% of team funds allocated for ongoing development.",False

He wanted quick buck so asked for ridiculous salary and not deserved a ""founder"" position, but as just a boy hired to do paper job he didn't get rich quick enough again.  As Peter said on medium   he demanded the following: 480K QRL (his original agreed allocation), a further 19% of all remaining team funds = 1.5M QRL, a salary of 6700$ a month and discretionary control of 33% of the entire pre-sale funds.  Too much for a paper job guy which joined project month before ICO and all he did is bullshitting in slack and retweeting own tweets. Very cool that such a rotten fruit filtered out of QRL project. There are tons of talented people around to do promotions and so called ""business development"".   However, after we successfully raised over $4.1 Million worth of BTC/ETH based on what the three of us had told the investing community about what and how we would do things, Peter and JP changed course and started breaking the promises they made to you as well as to me.

It's none of your fucking business what people do with their coins. AFAIK there was no any agreement for how many years everyone must hold their stash.

And add in some realities: This was his idea, he's a bright person. But even very, very smart people struggle greatly with rapidly-growing ""startup"" company formation, it's the real killer of most new companies, regardless of how good an idea or how competent the founding people involved are. It doesn't mean it's a ""scam"", just that lessons are being learned on the job.  Company formation takes experience -- usually hard-earned since you don't have the resources to hire someone that's already done it -- and mistakes are made. For instance, not defining roles well (lead developer retains password authority for all accounts and delegates use permissions down from there, basic inheritance), not giving percentages of the company for commodity jobs (for instance, social media manager as there are millions of highly qualified people available to do this, almost all willing to work remotely as self-employed-and-taxed individuals) that can be easily and inexpensively acquired. Starting your company, it's hard to resist rewarding people that work for you in the early days with obscenely huge percentages that would cost the typical investor huge sums to match.  Two key areas oft overlooked: An arbitration clause for all disputes, and setting terms for time-based vesting of shares. And that time should be over a year -- either a year of development work before the ICO, or a year of service to vest 20%. Then 30% after two, and the potential to final 50% after three years of continual service. Nobody but the founding devs get a (small percentage) lump at the ICO if it's a first round of funding. That said, what the devs (and any angel investors) do with their vested shares is entirely fair game.  Publicly setting time-lines for vesting and having a third-party trustee administer share allocation would alleviate much of the ICO/crypto community's fears of scams.  There's always hugely egotistical people that want large percentages of startups even though they came on board after formation and didn't contribute to what is, after the fact, an obviously good idea. It's like being friends with the guy who invented the wheel -- you're lumping 50 kilos on your back, and she comes rolling by with twice that weight on a lovely wheeled cart and you're like ""well duh, I could've done that"". But you didn't, did you? The wheel wasn't obvious until some creative thinker did the hard part of dreaming it up. The core team needs to know how to protect themselves (and their investors' funds) before hiring. Know that you need to resist being ""nice guys"" and handing out obscene percentages to valued friends and employees -- it's a disservice to the both the brilliance of the idea and the hard-earned money investors give you. Grasping that once you take money, it's not your company anymore, it's a mutually beneficial arrangement for you and your new partners, whose individual importance is clearly defined with ownership percentages. As in investor, seeing that nearly a half million shares were give out for a few months of low fiat currency value work doesn't make me very happy.  Which brings us to setting non-competed and termination clauses -- another overlooked area, and a glaring flaw in new companies. In this case, ""social media manager"" job title is to spew the company line. Violating that is grounds for termination, loss of access to passwords for social media accounts, and forfeiture of non-vested shares. Failure to do that cost a lot of people a lot of value. Hopefully short-term.  Note that staffing firms and many companies set disputes resolution as an arbiter of their choosing, and your expense. Which is pretty lame, ICO companies can and should treat people better.  Lastly, global company formation is complicated, and a PITA. Still assuming QRL intends to deliver on their promises, it's very magnanimous of the dev to sell his personal shares to fund ongoing costs verses touching the ICO funds, which he shouldn't until the company or foundation is set up to control them.  /* ENDS SOAPBOX */  Apologies for the lengthy diatribe. If you assumed I learned all the above the hard way, that I lost a lot of relative value with the posting of a seemingly (hopefully!) ego-driven and useless view, and that I like this project and want to see it carry on, you were correct. ;-)  If you assumed I know or have ever spoken to anyone on the QRL team, you're wrong.

The idea was to keep the GitHub as clean as possible until MainNet to avoid scams like this for both QRL investors AND people getting fooled by Droplex.  Now due to the ego of one social community manager who had disagreements with the dev team (who wants to be a founder but isn't), the dev team was being questioned about being a scam with little GitHub commits so Peter decided to release it to ease the nerves of investors and people freaking out.  So if he doesn't release, it's a scam.  If he does release, it's totally suspicious.  I guess he loses either way.

Towards the end of last year after discussion with prominent post-quantum cryptographers I sole authored the QRL whitepaper (and it’s mistakes), created the website, fired up the slack and announced my project to the world. Many enthusiastic members joined the team of which most are happily still involved. In our early testnet run before our final POS algorithm updates and whitepaper release we had a small army of loyal alpha-testers and a fantastic community has grown around the slack and the promise of the QRL. Jomari joined the team one month prior to our presale in March. We got on very well and he was tasked with managing social media, evangelising on the slack but he also did some back end email answering and gave himself a job title—chief of strategy. In short he was a trusted, bubbly member of the growing team. Like many projects in the space I decided to allocate QRL to the team and friendly group of alpha- testers to be received after mainnet launch. The community asked for ERC20’s and so I deployed the ethereum contract (with a manual transaction for each pre-sale participant!) and every single member of the team (~12 people) agreed to their allocation—Jomari included (logs retained). Since the successful crowd sourcing of Bitcoin and Ethereum, agreements on roles, responsibilities and remuneration going forward were individually agreed between myself and every single member of the team except for Jomari Peterson. Around 5 weeks ago Jomari started causing some foment in the team, arguing that he wasn’t happy with the direction the project was taking. He wanted to create a US legal entity and replicate our development efforts in the US. I am always open to discussion within the team but as I am based in the UK and ultimately as this is my project to oversee I chose not to agree to his plan or wild budgetary suggestions. During negotiations over his future role in the project (as tensions began to appear) he demanded the following: 480K QRL (his original agreed allocation), a further 19% of all remaining team funds = 1.5M QRL, a salary of 6700$ a month and discretionary control of 33% of the entire pre-sale funds. I patiently continued to ‘negotiate’ with him with another team member sat in on the discussion for four long weeks. After that time he had not moved his position one iota claiming he was a co- founder of the project and entitled to a huge share of the project (to be paid in full whether he was in the team or not!). The next thing I know last week myself and another member of the team received a letter from an attorney in NY suggesting we communicate through him with further discussions about Jomari’s future involvement in the project. Now this is a development project with coders working towards shipping code—this was a massive distraction and I honestly had begun to lose trust in Jomari. How can you work with someone who is threatening legal action for some perceived slight, against not just you but other members of the team? So, I asked him to relinquish the team social media profiles, contacted a solicitor to continue our discussions formally as requested, and waited. But Jomari failed to give up the social media accounts (which he still controls by the way) and so I was left with no option but to temporarily remove him from the team slack. And we are here today. Jomari has attacked this project and so far cut the market value of the QRL in half by libelling me through the official social media channels of my own project. He asserts that I have sold my own share of QRL because I don’t believe in the project that I have spent hundreds (thousands?) of hours working on. No one who has communicated with me by any medium will recognise the picture he is painting because it doesnt exist. The reality is that crypto startups are a grey area legally and it takes time to create a legal structure to facilitate this. I have funded this entire project myself from scratch—hosting, our VPS cluster, all other associated costs including remunerating developers. Some of the QRL I allocated myself has been sold on bittrex to fund the project whilst the above legal arrangements are completed and you will see if you look at our crypto btc and ethereum holdings that not a single Satoshi has moved since I raised it. Now I love this project and I am bitterly dissappointed that Jomari has attacked the project in this manner, with libellous commentary about me personally and has also damaged the project very obviously in terms of current market cap (although I’m sure that will recover). I won’t make any more statements as I seek a formal legal opinion except to say that despite his intervention we are progressing well and were about to start AWS scale testing of our updated test code today. I will be happy to speak to any of you on our slack, as always. I am enormously grateful for the ongoing support of the rest of team who have worked tirelessly to try and keep us on the roadmap we set out despite this frustrating distraction.

Let's say for example I own $10,000 worth of stocks.  I may very well take a $1,000 (10%) position in gold to offset my market risk.  It doesn't matter if the current PE ratio is 5 or 25, my gold hedge will react the same - with a negative correlation to the stock market assuming a black swan event.  This is how I view QRL - as both a hedge and as insurance.  So, therefore If I own $10,000 of crypto, and I want to diversify and protect against risk, what do I do?  I can't control government regulations or whales manipulating markets.  Those risks will always exist.  But the ultimate risk is quantum computing hacking (and thereby undermining the confidence of) the entire crypto space.  Once confidence is lost, it can take years or longer to be regained (assuming other cryptos adapt and become quantum resistant).  So if/when quantum hacking becomes an imminent risk, and hacks begin, and funds are lost, QRL will act with a negative correlation to all the other non-QP crypto.  So my crypto $10,000 might turn into $1,000 in a week, but my 10% QRL hedge position might go from $1,000 to $9,000 thereby netting me zero, but allowing me not to lose my shorts in the overall quantum hacking panic.  QRL is the hedge that any serious crypto believer ought to take seriously.  I believe investors are both smart and have a desire to protect their crypto investments to the greatest extent possible within their control.  And if others learn about QRL, and learn about the real quantum threats that currently exist and that are on the horizon, why would they not take a position in it?  What is the downside?  Being the first Quantum secure and most secure crypto is worthy of a top 30 coin (or better) from my foxhole.",False

This was the least marketed token that I can recall.  They capped the raised funds at $4 million.  There is little dedicated marketing as the team focuses on MainNet launch in late September.  A conference attendance, a podcast or two - that is hardly ""hype"".  Is it wrong for users/investors to be excited about a token that is bringing a new unique product to market, to become the most secure crypto asset in this space?    The best time to have a crypto that is quantum computing resistant is BEFORE the risk is actually realized (which won't be advertised).  One needs to buy flood insurance before your house is filled with water, not after the fact.  So one can either get the token today (cheaper) or after it is necessary (much more expensive).

Both BTC and ETH were accepted for the initial crowdsale. This post (April 26) explains how, as well as announcing how you can join the hundreds of people on their email list to receive notification about the crowdsale: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1730273.msg18760865#msg18760865  According to the slackbot in the QRL slack, there were 52 million QRL tokens sold in the early crowdsale for a little over $4M USD total. The price at close was 8 cents USD.  Here's where they describe their seed investment strategy: https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/seed-investment-strategy-pos-algorithm-updates-3b3854e83a4a  According to this post (May 9) 300 people had already participated by the time the first $1M was raised: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1730273.msg18942234#msg18942234  This post (May 22 - two days before the public ICO was set to start) announces that they reached the $4M cap, therefore the public ICO was cancelled: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1730273.msg19146660#msg19146660 Refreshing to see that they passed up the opportunity to raise more funds rather than oversell themselves at the beginning like so many ICOs.  I saw someone mention on the slack that about 600-650 people participated in total, but I haven't confirmed that. Based on how many people are in the slack, I'd say distribution is far greater by now.  I missed the initial crowdsale. But unlike altcoiner555 I chose not to whine about it and instead bought in after doing due diligence. I could have timed it better though, given the current price!

I noticed QRL on coinmarketcap a few days ago when every crypto was in a slump except for this, which was gaining rapidly. Its name got me curios, since quantum computing is kind of the boogieman of blockchain security. After doing a little research on the tech and the team I decided to put a decent chunk of my crypto funds into QRL, thinking that if this does gain enough traction to hit the top 20 on coinmarketcap, there will be a lot of crypto investers thinking that if it gets big, everyone else is going to want to have a percentage of their portfolio in it as a hedge against advances in quantum computing, and they'll also be thinking it's a good idea to get in ahead of the crowd. This is the kind of project that could really snowball into a huge network effect just due to the problem it's addressing and the focus of its vision, but only if it gets large enough to develop that momentum. Fear of loosing is a much more powerful psychological motivator than the opportunity to gain (that's why insurance is such a huge business), and everyone knows that everyone else is going to want to have at least some degree of quantum security, and that knowledge becomes a powerful motivator to jump in as long as you think it's moving in the right direction.  Here's an interesting thread echoing these thoughts: http://bullionstacker.com/viewtopic.php?t=28136  So now I'm holding QRL. At this point it's still a risky investment, and I was beginning to have doubts about it today, especially since I bought near the current all-time high, but after some digging around I've decided to stick it out and hold most of my QRL for the long term.  I'm just an average crypto-interested guy, certainly not an expert, so I often base my decisions to a large degree on what is happening in the community and what others who are much smarter and more involved than me think, rather than forming a complete understanding of the tech myself. Here are some things that encourage me to hold my position.  I don't understand cryptography and quantum computing well enough to form my own opinion of the QRL tech, so I have to trust what other known quantum cryptography players think (barring any who might feel threatened by QRL). What do other experts think of QRL?  - Two former NSA cryptographers who are actively researching quantum computing cryptography solutions hosted a huge reddit discussion last month, in which they endorsed QRL as an example of ""well understood hash-based solutions"": and linked to an article about them. Read the first post where they introduce themselves, and then do a search for ""Quantum Resistant Ledger"": https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/67wsur/we_are_exnsa_cryptomathematicians_working_to_help/ They also recommended this video as an intro explanation of quantum computing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrbJYsep45E  - Someone pointed out a couple pages ago that SuperNET (creators of Komodo and other crazy blockchain tech) recently bought more than 200 BTC-worth of QRL. Their lead developer JL777 is somewhat legendary in the alt-crypto world, going back to the days when NXT was the only innovative altcoin, and he has a very strong grasp of the crypto-space. He also has a knack for picking winners to invest in, so I like to check up on the SuperNET NAV from time to time (http://old.supernet.org/nav.php). They got into Stratis, IOTA, ZCash and Waves before they went big. I know he has dabbled in quantum resistant cryptography himself (http://www.crypto777.com/), so he has enough of a grasp of the field to judge whether QRL's approach is legit. Seeing that they've acquired a decent holding of QRL makes me feel good about my own instincts.  A few things I gleaned from hanging around the QRL slack today: - It's an active and growing community, the devs are present and responsive, and they know their stuff. They are focusing on tech before promotions, which I like. - QRL testnet is up and running, with active alpha-testers, and the public testnet will likely launch next week. So this is not just a whitepaper and some promises, it's actually working tech. - There is a potential partnership in the works, which will likely be announced later next week. I'm just guessing here, but it might be somehow related to the last-minute invitation QRL recieved to attend the exclusive BluYard & Google Quantum AI Labs conference in Munich (Details on the conference here: https://medium.com/@BlueYard/join-us-on-june-22nd-for-a-quantum-leap-fa7b5aa61cc6). - The latest word is that the mainnet will launch in late September.  A few more thoughts for people who bought QRL on the rise and are wondering what's holding it back. It's still extremely early, most crypto investors haven't heard of it. It's also still only in alpha testing. I think only traders and people who are actively looking for promising (and risky) new projects in the early stages of development have heard about it. I wish I found out a few days earlier, but I'm not getting out any time soon because I think it has huge potential for growth. It's a great team with tech that seems solid, and a clear vision that tackles a very big fear in the crypto world. It's early days, so it's high risk. Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose. If you have a long-term perspective, it's easier to weather the rocky short-term rollercoaster.  Here are some good articles I found from Peter Waterland about QRL:  Good intro article presenting the need for quantum resistant ledger, and a bit about the cryptography: https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/blockchain-is-here-to-stay-but-for-how-long-536336a02b03 Another good article on why retro-fitting Bitcoin and Etherium with quantum resistant signatures will still likely not be enough to protect the value of the network: https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/peter-waterland-2deed7bdbf65 An article from about how QRL's PoS algorithm is made quantum resistant. I know it's in active development and testing right now, so some details may differ: https://medium.com/the-quantum-resistant-ledger/seed-investment-strategy-pos-algorithm-updates-3b3854e83a4a",False

""I can't pay 10 times ICO price!""  First, there was no ICO, as the pre-sale sold out the max cap ($4 million) before the ICO ever got off (see page 7 of this thread).  Second, 10 times $4 million is still only $40 million.  At the time of this writing though it is at $32 million.  You've got coins like Library Credits with a higher market cap than this coin.  Think about it.  If this coin can solve the quantum computing problem, it can literally save crypto.  Should it really have such a low value?  Or the better question is, should one really disregard it because someone who invested first is making ""too much"" of a profit at 8 or 10 times?  If you didn't buy ETH or many other coins for the same reason, it would be your own personal loss, not the initial investors.  Or you could just go buy dogecoin ($386 million market cap) - I hear the fundamentals on that coin are super awesome; it has 10 times the ""value"" of QRL right now   Now the MainNet isn't launching until August or so (subject to change or delays of course) so if somebody wants to wait for that I get it.

The technology creates special blocks which are signed by quantum keys rather than the traditional digital signatures. These quantum keys are generated by a QKD network, which guarantees the privacy of the key using the laws of physics."" - Peter  ""Summary of my understanding, while theoretically feasible, it is not economically or practically feasible at this time. There are a number of limitations that would not make this solution something ""we the people"" could us any time soon. QKD has been around a while, but as @peterwaterland said, it is specialized hardware. It has been around a while though. I believe China has been trying to test a satellite with it.  Also, after rereading the study. Because they require pair communication/entanglement, security against dishonest nodes requires that less than 33% of the network be dishonest. That is a very low threshold.  "" -Jomari   https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/the-current-state-of-quantum-cryptography-qkd-and-the-future-of-information-security""  ```QKD Commercialisation  Research is being done at present to extend the range and increase the data rate of QKD systems, and to integrate these systems with existing information security solutions. One of the reasons for the range limitation of QKD is because quantum repeaters don’t currently exist. Quantum repeaters should be able to improve the signal to noise ratio of the communication medium to ensure that the signal can travel much larger distances, but quantum computation principles are required to construct a quantum repeater. Furthermore, the possibility of using satellites as part of the QKD infrastructure to extend the range of QKD networks significantly is being investigated. Initial results are promising, the point-to-point range of fibre optic lines is 400 km at present for research systems while satellite communications could make this intercontinental.  There are a number of companies that offer QKD hardware at present; these include ID Quantique, MagiQ Technologies, SeQureNet, and QinetiQ. In addition, Quintessence Labs is in the process of developing a second generation QKD network that relies on continuous variable QKD to increase the secure channel data rate. The systems offered by these companies rely on communication on standard fibre optic lines and in many cases use a different frequency band for quantum communications to ensure simultaneous data and QKD connections on the same line. Therefore, QKD works by using existing fibre optic infrastructure.``` -https://labs.mwrinfosecurity.com/blog/the-current-state-of-quantum-cryptography-qkd-and-the-future-of-information-security""",False

That, coupled with the transparency and quick reply from Peter makes me 100% certain I'm gonna bet on this one. This particular concept for blockchain application seems to have no competition currently and therefore first to market (which judging by presale it will successfully hit market).  Just because a dev is transparent does not mean a project will be financially successful (which denotes success of the project ideally, because in capitalism the value will increase with its utility) but you add everything up, most important of all that feeling in your gut, and I really think we have a winner here. one of the next to be 'known' by the bigger community like ether and bitcoin.  eth after all was just another stupid alt coin to many people...many fools I should say!

If for example a cap of 2 mil is reached, those investors will get 30% extra in comparison to the ones buying in after the 24th of may. If 3.9 mil is reached, only the last 0.1 mil investors will get less. So basicly presale participants should hope on not reaching the cap of 4 mil before the 24th of may.  In my opinion it should be considered to close the sale if the 24th of may is reached and the Tier 2 cap of 2 mil is reached. This would mean not only presale investors will get double the amount of coins, but also the foundation. If the cap of 4 mil is reached, I can see this project start with a marketcap at coinmarketcap around 4 or 5 mil. If the cap of 2 mil is reached and there won't be an additional ico, I think the project will still start with a marketcap at coinmarketcap around 4 mil. This would mean the foundation will hold the same value ad they would when the ico continues till a 4 mil cap, but makes the coin/token much more scarce and I think it can grow much faster. As someone who missed the presale or ico, I'd rather step in a project with a llow cap set for primairy funding than a project with a high cap.",False

The hash is actually the last hash in a iterative hash chain of length 10,000 (the length of each stake cycle). Each block/stake cycle is signed by the staker with a reveal hash going backwards in their respective chain.  After the (block-time-x) seconds every full node sorts their transaction pools by timestamps then txhash and generates a list of merkle root hashes. All nodes should have almost identical pools but due to variance and network latency there may be minor disparities, hence usage of a list rather than a single hash. Stakers broadcast their merkle root hash lists and the POS selector publishes the block. The staker selected to construct the block is chosen via a PRF (HMAC_DRBG) from the stake list. The stake list is updated from new POS tx during the epoch and the next sequence of staker selection is taken from historic chain data.  To prevent a MITM spam attack a commit-reveal scheme is used for both stakers publishing merkle root hash lists of acceptable blocks and before the final signed block is published. i.e. in further detail  1. staker nodes publish a commit stake message which includes a stake address, merkle hash list of tx pool contents and a commit hash of the merkle hash list + previous hash in hash chain. 2. staker nodes collect stake data for a time period and then broadcast a reveal stake message. each node uses these to validate the previous messages. Since all nodes have this information (including the stake block selector) the merkle root tx pool hash which is most frequent is known by all nodes - thus the stakers actually choose the block - the selector merely selects and constructs it correctly. 3. the stake selector publishes a commit block creation message which includes the chosen merkle tx hash, their stake address and a commit hash (blockheader hash or merkle tx hash + prev hash in hash chain). 4. The selector then publishes the block which contains the blockheader and merkle tx hash contained in the commit stake layer message but also the reveal hash which is used to validate the block by the network.  The commit-reveal element could be removed if each stake message is simply signed by the stake address, but in a stateful sig scheme like XMSS this means a huge number of signatures which are expensive to compute, store and decrypt, especially with a short block time like 15-20 seconds, hence the hash chain scheme.",False

Very exciting to see once the nodes got going smoothly. Three nodes scattered across the world with block-times (with ~1s variance) of around 23seconds.  A few changes need to be made to the main node to simplify the code slightly.  A major decision is how to deal with absent stakers from the stake list and whether to punish them and also how to restart the network when it breaks.

I like the idea of bitcoin balance importation but may ditch it as it reveals the bitcoin public keys of those who do, something i'm obviously not in favour of.  The current plan is for an initial release of the coin supply to allow proof-of-stake to function correctly. Whilst I like the idea of a 21 million upper cap (after 200 years) the exact size is up for debate as is the initial release methodology. New coins generated through p-o-s block creation will tail down with an exponential decline to a hard ceiling - that i can say for sure.  Why do you say the supply seems massive? Ethereum released over 70 million coins, no?!? :-) A release of 2-5 million coins seems reasonable to me in comparison.  Peer review is an interesting and important point. The post-quantum hash-based signature scheme (xmss) has been peer reviewed in the literature. To my knowledge there are only two working implementations of the signature scheme in existence which are open source - mine in python (http://github.com/surg0r/lamport) and a C version by A Hulsing. The QRL is open source and accessible on github (http://github.com/surg0r/QRL with the sig scheme contained entirely in QRL/merkle.py). All peer review very welcome indeed!",False

The current algo uses a pseudorandom number function (HMAC_DRBG) and the closest hash of stake validator reveal hashes within signed hash chains is used as a block selector mechanism. It cannot be easily gamed because signed hash chains are written to the chain in advance of the PRF seed being generated. As each hash chain reveal hash is unknown until block voting and funds are locked for the epoch (10000 blocks) the capacity to gain block reward by moving funds and colluding is neutered. Sybil attack with lots of stake validators is countered by weighting block reward by address balance. Additionally, a flexible rule to limit block selection to the top x stake validators each round is designed to prevent a block witholding or transaction witholding attack from low value Sybil stake addresses.

The QRL is the first decentralized cryptocurrency which has implemented from the outset to be resistant to both classical and quantum computing attack.  It uses a different system of cryptography to Bitcoin (and all other altcoins) known as XMSS, which is a hash-based digital signature scheme, and provably quantum-resistant.  The ledger will be the first to use quantum-resistant signatures on a blockchain, which provides an ultra secure store of value in the event of a sudden advance in quantum computing (rendering bitcoin, ethereum etc vulnerable to attack). The initial aim of the project is to establish a functional and secure blockchain on which more technology can be built, such as the Ephemeral post-quantum secure data channels.  The project has grown significantly over the course of 2017 and 2018, led by myself, a core dev team, ancillary devs and a post-quantum cryptographer. We have added to that a marketing manager and small communications team.  Our current featureset:  1. Multi-platform qrlcore node release. 2. Multi-platform binary wallets (Mac, Windows, and Linux) 3.User friendly Webwallet (https://wallet.theqrl.org) and Explorer (https://explorer.theqrl.org) 4. 100% PQ-secure address space for the QRL (XMSS) 5. Cryptonight POW algorithm, 1 minute block-time interval, ability to mine in existing pools, using existing mining software. 6. Completely separated wallet and node functionality with all wallet-based requests passing through the node by our universal grpc api. 7. Use of slave XMSS tree signing capability to allow secure mining (and later, staking) keeping private keys offline. 8. PQ-token capability out of the box — creating tokens on the QRL chain is now functional. 9. PQ-secure data stamping functionality out of the box. 10. Two audits covering 100% of our codebase. 11. Full API (https://api.theqrl.org) and Documentation (https://docs.theqrl.org) 12. Offline-wallet-generator: (https://github.com/theQRL/offline-wallet-generator) 13. Hardware wallet support through Ledger Nano S/X  Upcoming hard fork featureset:  1. Multisig addresses 2. Deterministic address support 3. Extended message transaction functionality 4. Decentralised on-chain poll support 5. Backwards incompatible state upgrades and optimisations  Features anticipated for 2019/2020 hard forks include:  1. Smart Contracts (Project Silicon) 2. Ephemeral messaging 3. Consensus mechanism change (PoS, dPoS)  Anyone who wishes to get involved can join our Discord server below. The best way to find out QRL related news would be to keep an eye on Twitter, Reddit, Medium, and/or Discord.  The QRL is currently trading on Bittrex and related international sites.  Genesis Block = 65M coins. Final distribution in 200 years is 105M (exponential decay in emission). Blocktime will initially be 60s.  When PoS Comes: No minimum staking limit.

But you are correct that at this time the project is to be similar to BTC, featuring a capped upper supply limit, with very limited scripting and an emphasis upon security over scalability (the signatures / transactions are necessarily much bigger than any other crypto ledger thus far).  We are at quite an early stage so some design parameters may change but i am keen to allow bitcoin users to directly import their balances into the chain for a time after the main net goes live.  Thanks for the interest.",False

First priority is to complete the node.  The project is still seeking python developers who want to join up. Anyone interested in the benefits that go with joining a project this early PM me.

I have also created deterministic addresses within giant XMSS trees from a single recoverable hexSEED / 32 word mnemonic using a provably secure pseudo random number function (HMAC_DRBG).  The QRL test node currently supports 3 types of post-quantum transaction types: 1) Lamport-Diffie one time signatures below a many time merkle tree signature scheme (MSS), 2) Winternitz-OTS signatures with a many time MSS and now 3) XMSS - a recommended post-quantum signature scheme incorporating W-OTS+ and XMSS many time trees. I may remove the support for the first two and focus upon a single tx type with longer keys.  What is interesting is that the signatures with XMSS are roughly 12kb hexlified (~6kb binary). Internode compression of transmitted transactions and blocks may be something to look into as they are currently communicated as plaintext JSON. Creating an XMSS tree which can provide 4096 signatures/transactions safely generates a wallet file size of ~50mb! There are around 330,000 256 bit keys generated (bitmasks, secret/public key fragments etc) for just this single tree. I was perplexed by this as most people like quite a few addresses and this would generate absolutely huge wallet files. But I have discovered a neat way of generating hundreds of addresses within the XMSS tree by simply contracting the merkle tree and recalculating the root value+PK..and voila a new address. New addresses can be added with minimal additional calculation (just need to keep the tree differences) as they share bitmasks and OTS keys with the original.  Releases: A collaborator has created a blockchain explorer for the QRL (testnet) and we will be making that public once it looks pretty enough - probably later this week.  Whilst I work on the node he is now working on a client side JS web wallet similar to mymonero which will communicate with a custom node via an API. The general idea is that user supplies a seed word mnemonic and the JS wallet obtains state information from the node. Transactions can be created client side and sent fully formed+signed to the node. It is only as secure as the browser but should suffice for less technical users.  Todo: There is still plenty of work to be done. The next stage is to declutter some of the code, tidy up the protocol, simplify and better partition the state code, finally sort the currency units and improve reliability of the node - in particular the chain following behaviour.  PoS: Recently I have had some ideas about implementing a Proof of stake system. I like the idea of using proof of stake in the longer term. I will experiment with introducing a PoS system for the QRL which is very simple but secure. I have been writing my ideas for a protocol in a second whitepaper which I will release after some testing!  More updates as they come..Volunteers welcome as always.  Inca",False

We already know what is susceptible: RSA, ECDSA etc. We know that the digital signature scheme backing bitcoin and ethereum etc are vulnerable.  There are several classes of 'quantum safe' signatures of which hash based signatures used in the QRL are the most promising.  Based upon existing mathematics if a sufficiently powerful quantum computer were created by a government then bitcoin (and everything else) would insecure but the QRL would not. But you are right that it is of course theoretical resistance because no such computer exists publicly to attack either chain and test out the hypothesis!  The idea with the QRL is to get crypto ready for this computer advance so we are ahead of the curve. ",False
