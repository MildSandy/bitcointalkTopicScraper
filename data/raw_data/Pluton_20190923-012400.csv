Development Update  DEX Version 2.0 Over the last fortnight, the team has successfully deployed DEX Version 2.0 to production, tested it internally, and released it to our pilot programme users. We are currently taking live feedback from our dedicated test users to smoothen out any remaining minor bugs.  The update includes ETH and PLU trading pairs using MetaMask for an incredibly simple user experience. The tech team has also encompassed crypto transaction monitoring so users can track both their fiat and crypto transaction history on the web application.  Both Plutus web and mobile is almost ready for public rollout. Over the next few weeks, we will be going through our final compliance audits with our banking partner to assess if our product meets all the necessary compliance and feature requirements. Plutus is fully ready and the devs hard work is soon to be appreciated by the wider crypto community.  Mobile App To help integrate the Plutus Debit Card into more users’ payment flows, we are pleased to let you know that our card will be available on two popular mobile payment platforms (i.e. Google Pay and Samsung Pay). This will empower users to unleash their cryptocurrencies true potential and make everyday purchases on watches, tablets, and more tech devices.  Marketing Update  Website Design The design team has created the first drafts of two sub-pages for our corporate website. This includes an ‘About us’ page which summarises our services and values for new visitors, and a ‘Card’ page which goes into detail on what is unique about our debit cards.  Card Arrival The first batch of slick Plutus Debit Cards arrived at the warehouse and the team got to see the physical cards in the flesh for the first time. This marks a monumental milestone in the development of Plutus; from concept, to design, to a fully functioning Plutus Debit Card tied to a seamless backend banking system.

Development Update  PlutusDEX Feedback Last week the team successfully released the new and improved PlutusDEX to the pilot programme users for further stress testing. The peer-to-peer trading platform works smoothly, and the team received little to no bug reports from our community members. With both the PlutusDEX and mobile app working proficiently, we can open up the doors to more users after a final audit from our banking provider. The gold-foiled VISA debit cards are sitting in the warehouse awaiting personalisation with your name, expiry dates and a unique 16-digit card number.  Finer Details The development team has made numerous small but necessary additions to the platform. This includes completing download functionality of our T&C’s, privacy and cookie policies; improvements to DEX admin search functionality; and analysis of a feedback survey from our test users.  Marketing Update  Website Design The team has been progressively working through a number of sub-pages over the last few weeks and the design for our new ‘About’ page is complete, this will provide new users with information on our available custom-built features and corporate values.  Illustrated Video Script The team are in motion to create a 1-minute illustrated video that will easily and professionally break down the Plutus features visually. We have prepared a first-draft script ready for production.  Announcements The team is preparing a press release in conjunction with our award-winning banking partner to announce the landmark partnership. It will be coupled with other exciting news related to the product release.  Emails Design & Research Although the platform is currently limited to community members only, we have a huge mailing list of people who signed up to join Plutus during the 2.0 release; we’ll be using a targeted email campaign to convert these into subscribers and accompanying this with a referral programme to help grow the Plutus ecosystem. The team has also undergone a deep dive into the analytics provided by our highly reputable emailing platform so we can make more informed decisions based on the preferences of our audience.  General Update  Going Monthly With our MVP nearly public, we will be transitioning from a bi-monthly report to a monthly report. Plutus is dedicated to delivering consistent and transparent reports and we will continue to do so in a more in-depth but less frequent manner; the next report will be available in October.  Contis Audit We have received a final audit date from our banking provider in early September and we expect to see the results imminently after. From here we can kick-start Plutus’ journey as a life-changing finance app and ship out official Plutus Debit Cards to our cherished community.

The sheer volume of possibilities makes a private key incredibly difficult to crack, however, stealing the private keys is a much easier task and centralised exchanges who store vast amounts of pooled assets are the prime targets.

Development Update  Alpha App Rollout Having tested the mobile app internally, the team has rolled out the minimum viable product (MVP) to a small sub-group of the Plutus community. Members of our Pilot Programme across both the UK and EU have downloaded the alpha app and they are currently supplying feedback to the tech team for further improvements.  The early responses have been overwhelmingly positive so far and we thank everyone for their continued support. The team are streamlining some transition states when navigating from one feature to another and a ‘change password’ bug, however, the rest of the features have proven robust. There is at least one round of iteration left before we go live publicly.  Current features included:  - Access balance - Deposit funds to current account - Transfer funds between accounts - View transactions - Edit personal details  Additional features will be rolled out consistently and incrementally until we have delivered a well-rounded and superior crypto finance application.  If you are part of the Pilot Programme and you are yet to download the alpha app, please reach out to our resident Community Manager, David, on Discord for details on how to participate.  Database Migration The team has completed our transition to a new and improved database management platform which proved a challenging and time-consuming task. As we approach public release, scalability and high availability become a greater priority, and our previous database software did not meet the required standards.  The server move will cut costs by up to 40% and improve logging, metrics, HA, autoscaling, and more. The tech team were able to implement the changeover safely with minimal downtime.  Marketing Update  Received Full Samples The team has reached an exciting point where physical samples of all our hard work are coming through the post. The team received mock-up cards alongside the complete packaging (card-holder and mailer) and we are pleased with the aesthetic quality.  Stickers The marketing team has sourced a high-quality and cost-effective sticker manufacturer and created several potential sticker designs. After both an internal and community vote, we have narrowed down the decision to just two designs which we plan to mail to our users alongside the Plutus Debit Cards.  User Acquisition The team is currently building a detailed customer acquisition plan and then breaking it down into actionable chunks. This contains a heavy load of information including our target audience, key geographical locations, messaging, design, optimal marketing channels, budget allocation, ROI and more.  General Update  Compliance In order to be compliant with our payment provider, we are implementing a Transaction Monitoring system which allows us to more efficiently screen transactions. We have carefully selected a compliance partner after some cautious considerations, and they will assist in reducing the costs of investigating and reacting to unnecessary alerts through automatic transaction monitoring.

Pinned Announcements  - Access to features is available to team accounts and members of our Pilot Programme. - The aim of the Pilot is to gather feedback from our community in order to provide an improved platform for the wider audience. - Our site and a new app will be available to the wider public once the pilot ends, unveiling our new live features.  Development Update  Mobile App Fixes Plutus recently rolled out the Plutus alpha app to our pilot programme users in order to identify any potential bugs before public rollout. The pilot release was successful, and the team received a wealth of constructive feedback from which we can work upon. The tech team has fixed two bugs relating to the monthly statements tab and the display issue for the card settings page.  Web Progress The team has been testing functionality of fiat withdrawals for the web application in a dev environment. We have simultaneously been progressing with the functionality of our DEX and its handling of various edge cases. After stress testing internally, we can open the new and improved web features to our pilot users for further iteration.  Rewards Phase 1 Plutus has identified our first rewards partner and we will be implementing this into the mobile app pre-release. The tech team has scoped out the implementation requirements for an upcoming sprint which will commence upon completion of our current web testing.  Marketing Update  Rewards Phase 2 In order to guarantee our rewards programme is superior to competitors, Plutus aims to integrate a second rewards partner at a later stage. The marketing team has entered further discussions with a number of leading rewards providers that can offer real incentives to our user base. We are now narrowing down the selection based on several requirements including their offerings, ease of implementation, and the end user experience.  Website Script Whilst our homepage has been updated to the new royal blue design, our sub-pages remain in the old format. We are currently writing fresh content and re-designing the sub-pages so consumers can easily digest information on our products and services. Working through the website will be an ongoing task — last week we drafted the ‘Card’ page which will detail all the unique features that showcase our superior Plutus Debit Card.  Exploring Innovative Acquisition Strategies Plutus has also been exploring some out-of-the-box marketing strategies that could provide the best possible cost per acquisition; these vary from viral campaign ideas to innovative ad targeting software’s. Improving margins in areas that aren’t detrimental to the product or user experience will greatly improve the longevity of Plutus.  Social Posts The team has also prepared a timeline of relevant dates to centre our social posts around. The marketing team will be increasing all social activity over the coming weeks in preparation for our next release.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Fact: Global debt has reached $246.5 trillion. Cryptocurrencies make it harder to operate in a credit and debt based system due to the limited supply, and the restrictive protocol that prevents participants from lending more than their wallet contains.  Plutus aims to support financial independence by providing a user-friendly mobile app that encompasses both fiat and crypto. Users can effortlessly exchange between fiat and crypto, and utilise alternative payment methods.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Join us on Discord and read the full update on our Medium page.",False

Having tackled several obstacles, the team’s sentiment is high.  Pinned Announcements  - Access to features is available to team accounts and members of our Pilot Programme. - The aim of the Pilot is to gather feedback from our community in order to provide an improved platform for the wider audience. - Our site and a new app will be available to the wider public once the pilot ends, unveiling our new live features.  Development Update  Mobile — Fiat Withdrawal The tech team has successfully completed ‘fiat withdrawal’ functionality which will be rolled out to the pilot programme users prior to public release. This function enables users to withdraw funds from the platform to any external bank account in the UK and EU, as long as that account is owned by the user. Cryptocurrency can be notoriously difficult to exit from, frequently involving multiple transaction fees and wait times. We have streamlined this process and greatly increased the liquidity of our users’ personal funds.  Mobile — Transitions Having gathered feedback from our pilot users, the team are now exploring alternative state transitions that offer a more user-friendly experience. The task has been listed but we are prioritising other functional requirements before working towards this objective.  Marketing Update  12-Week Social Timeline The marketing team has mapped out the next three months of social activity, placing extra attention on Twitter and Instagram. Social posts will be centred around relevant dates on our calendar.  Website Script The team are continuing work on the content and design of our website, specifically the sub-pages that are yet to be updated to our new royal blue palette. We recently completed the copy for the ‘About Us’ section which details what we do, our values, and customer testimonials; this is currently in the design phase.  Card Our card packaging, and mailers, are both in the warehouse awaiting the completion of our Plutus Debit Cards. We have been reliably informed that card delivery is imminent, and we will update you upon their arrival. We have also received some additional bonus items to include in the post.  General Update  Compliance Training There is still a great deal of uncertainty as to how regulation will unfold within the cryptocurrency sector and we plan to be ahead of the curve in every possible area to guarantee our longevity in the market. The Plutus team has embarked on training modules surrounding AML, Risk-Assessment, Anti-Corruption, Anti-Fraud, and more. Our team of professionals will be vigilantly trained as part of our dedication to regulation and compliance.  Compliance AML Continuing on with our mission, we are planning to integrate a renowned Crypto AML provider who will increase our enhanced due diligence and evidence-based compliance procedures to ensure we are compliant when dealing with cryptocurrencies.  Rewards Phase 2 Over the last month, the team has been researching a vast number of potential reward partners for phase 2 of our programme. We have narrowed down the selection, and Plutus is now in further discussions with a small handful of suppliers; the team are happy with the options and their rewards. More will be revealed once we have confirmed a supplier and developed a concrete understanding of implementation.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Fact: There are 2²⁵⁶ different Bitcoin private keys, that is more than a 10 followed by 77 zeroes.

We are currently awaiting some high-end micro-animations for the mobile app to heighten the user experience. We are using Lottie by Airbnb, a well-known animation tool that exports files in JSON format and renders them natively on various device types.  Approaching Pilot Rollout With the MVP — users will be able to log in, view their balances, transfer fiat, view transactions, perform all card activities (freeze, unfreeze, etc.), and log out. Other features will be rolled out incrementally in line with our sprint schedule. We will also be releasing our crypto DEX to pilot users shortly for rigorous testing. Please keep an eye out on our Discord channel for further updates regarding release windows.  Marketing Update  Card Mailer With the Plutus Debit Cards and packaging in production, the team has been sourcing a luxury mailer to send our product in. The team has been looking at various high-quality padded parcels that protect our product whilst meeting our strict brand requirements (dimensions, texture, colour, etc.). We have identified a slick mailer that houses the packaging snuggly and we are finalising a bulk purchase.

Development Update  Crypto Buy/Sell The tech team demonstrated the new and improved PlutusDEX internally last week and it received overwhelmingly positive responses. We have designed an incredibly intuitive trading platform with a slick frontend interface that even technical newbies will be able to use.  We are currently testing the crypto buy/sell feature internally and we will shortly be rolling it out to our pilot programme users. The team are excited to reveal the progress that’s been made.  Marketing Update  Award Nominations Plutus has received two nominations for the PayTech Awards 2019, which strengthens our position as a truly innovative brand within the finance sector. Nominations include ‘Best Consumer Payments Initiative’ and ‘Top Paytech Innovation’. You can view the rest of the categories and nominations here. The results will be announced on July 5th.  Press Announcement Schedule The marketing team has put together a schedule of potential press announcements to release over the coming weeks and first drafts of several announcements have already been written up. With the product quickly coming together, the team can begin to unveil partnerships, new features, marketing and more.  USP’s The marketing team has been evaluating our messaging in order to clarify our unique selling proposition (USP). We have identified several features that are yet to be achieved by anyone else and we aim to engrain these in the minds of consumers. Most prominently, that Plutus is the most secure crypto finance app in the world.  Discord Rewards Our Discord channel has quickly become the central hub for all Plutus related discussions. We have ordered and received several Plutus-branded prizes to give away to active members of our Discord community at the end of each month. Our first winner was announced this week, join us here and engage in conversations for a chance to win.  General Update  Card Production & Packaging The Plutus Debit Cards are officially in production! All elements have been confirmed (design, layout, weight, etc.) and we are now awaiting the manufacturers to deliver. The card packaging and mailer have also been finalised and the team are now negotiating prices before entering development.  PLU Rewards The team has been discussing ways to add further utility to PLU so users can get the most out of their earned rewards. After considering all eventualities including costs, longevity, PLU price, scalability and more, the team identified an appropriate solution. The team are in discussions with a 3rd party rewards partner and we are preparing for front-end integration; the backend functionality of our Rebate Programme is ready.  Enhanced Due Diligence Plutus is in the planning phase of implementing an enhanced due diligence process where applicable, such as dealing with Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs). Our long-term plan is to automate the process as much as possible and ensure its user-friendly as well as highly secure. We have the procedures in place but upgrading the system to combine automated processes and manual oversight will offer the best user experience from a compliance perspective.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Fact: Less than 3% of Bitcoin addresses contain one Bitcoin or more — the percentage of Bitcoin users may be slightly higher as the figure doesn’t take into account those who leave their crypto-assets on centralised exchanges.

Great question.  Why should I choose Plutus over the new Coinbase card? Or Wirex for instance?  The Coinbase card has notoriously high fees (2.5%) for their crypto conversion service (crypto to fiat). Additionally, both Wirex and Coinbase operate using a centralised system. They hold your crypto which, as we have seen recently with the Binance hack, does not always bode well for the typical user.  Plutus and the PlutusDEX operate on a decentralised system, meaning we never hold your cryptocurrency so you are always in control of your own funds.  Another aspect which makes Plutus a superior choice is our rebate system, which is operated via smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. When users top up their Plutus Account, with fiat or crypto, they receive up to 3% cashback in our native rewards token, Pluton (PLU).  In the coming weeks we'll be releasing our fee schedule and preparing for a full public roll out of Plutus 2.0.

Pinned Announcements  - Access to features is available to team accounts and members of our Pilot Programme. - The aim of the Pilot is to gather feedback from our community in order to provide an improved platform for the wider audience. - Our site and a new app will be available to the wider public once the pilot ends, unveiling our new live features.  Development Update  Crypto Buy/Sell A large section of the development resources has been dedicated to refining the crypto buy/sell and crypto-to-card top-up features to make available for our Pilot users — we have included expandable trading graphs according to time frame and integrated our 3rd party wallets into the web application also. Some components are currently undergoing rigorous regression testing so it’s as robust as possible upon public rollout.  Mobile App The tech team is currently in the second round of testing our sign-up, KYC, and financial features to deliver in the next update of our mobile app. We have resolved some validation bugs on the input email field and auto-focus on ‘view pin’ functionality.  We’re also adding some CSS micro-animations into our application to strengthen the user experience. We strongly believe that design is more than a point of aesthetic, but an attribute that greatly elevates usability and customer satisfaction.  Marketing Update  Award Applications The marketing team has been scheduling meetings and interviews with web media and relevant FinTech awards that would highlight Plutus’ stance as an innovative FinTech company whilst generating helpful press coverage of our services. The ongoing discussions with event organisers have been promising and we look forward to inviting you to our busy calendar of events planned for this summer and beyond.  Coverage This week, Plutus featured in an article on Hacked.com called “The Rise of Cryptocurrency Mobile Banking” linked here. Having released our Plutus 2.0 Web Pilot in March and now approaching the release of our latest mobile app version — the community can expect plenty more reputable press coverage.  Discord Competition Our new Discord channel has quickly become the centre of all Plutus related discussions and we are keen to grow this. At the beginning of June, our monthly Discord competition will commence and members of the channel who actively engage in conversations will be in with a chance of winning various high-quality Plutus branded prizes — the first prize being a premium VR headset.

We're happy to say that you should have access to the whole range of Plutus services in the coming weeks   I'm not sure if users necessarily have to forego a great UX when using P2P exchanges and services. At Plutus, we're aiming to deliver an incredibly secure decentralised exchange which is paired with an equally incredible user experience. As well as our decentralised exchange, we're excited to offer a number of other features - such as the upcoming Plutus Card which will allow you to convert your crypto instantly and then send your fiat at any brick and store merchant with a POS terminal.  Excited to hear your feedback!  When you get your hands on our services, we'd love to hear your feedback over on our Plutus Discord server here. In the meantime - we'd love to have you join and become a part of the Plutus Community ",False

The Plutus team relished the lengthy weekend and have now rapidly returned to work mode to deliver on the next stages of Plutus.  Pinned Announcements  - Access to features is available to team accounts and members of our Pilot Programme. - The aim of the Pilot is to gather feedback from our community in order to provide an improved platform for the wider audience. - Our site and a new app will be available to the wider public once the pilot ends, unveiling our new live features.  Development Update  Bug Fixes & Improvements As always, the tech team has been fixing multiple bugs for an improved user experience, especially relating to the synchronisation of data between us and our banking partners. Alongside this, the team has made additional improvements on session management and general user-interface fixes.  Wallet Integration The tech team has also been upgrading the crypto flows of our application. This includes the cryptocurrency dashboard and integration of a well-known 3rd party decentralised wallet provider. The aim is to integrate them into a familiar mobile-banking style user interface with incredibly simple functionality to encourage everyday shoppers into the crypto ecosystem.  Marketing Update  Investigating Additional Perks Pluton will be redeemable for additional services offered by Plutus and exchangeable for regular fiat. The marketing team has been investigating potential partners that can add additional value to our loyalty programme. We are proud to be introducing one of the best loyalty rewards systems on the market and we will continue to identify perks that improve your shopping experience.  Discord We have implemented our new Discord levels system, AmariBot. By engaging in conversations and actively participating in our Discord channel, you can earn experience points (XP), level up, and rise through the ranks. We hope this encourages more discussions and a stronger Plutus community. In the future, we will be rewarding active members with cool Plutus swag. If you are yet to join our new Discord channel then take a look here and join in.  Influencers The marketing team has conducted a cost-benefit analysis of potential influencers and we are now reaching out to a select few YouTubers to review our project. After trialling a video we will determine the best course of action with our YouTube influencer campaign.  Networking The marketing department has started attending cryptocurrency meet-ups once a week in order to meet reputable members of the crypto ecosystem, improve our presence, and build a network of enthusiasts for our very own Plutus meet-ups planned this Summer.  Card Design The designers have been finalising the Pantone colour of our Plutus Debit Card — finding a true match to our custom new electric blue colour palette has been challenging due to the different print materials available but we look forward to sharing the final outcome.  General Update  Validation System The team are building system validation to ensure only one account can be permitted per user (as dictated by financial rules and compliance). The back-end team is building sensible identity and validation checks.  Test Cards All of the designated test cards have been successfully activated and trialled. The majority of the bugs have been found and resolved leading to a much more polished user experience. The banking dashboard is functional and we are now focusing on crypto top-ups and the crypto buy/sell user experience, optimising for speed of trade execution whilst minimising spread.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Fact: Our company name, Plutus, originated from the god of wealth.

Pinned Announcements  - Currently, our system is in pilot testing mode, site and app access is limited to pilot test users for the coming weeks. - Our site and a new app will be available to the wider public once the pilot ends, unveiling our new live features.  Development Update  Tool Upgrades The development team has updated our tool for container orchestration to a new version, this empowers our team with numerous new functionalities resulting in a more stable and maintained environment. On top of this, the team has built and tested a bespoke backup procedure.  We’ve upgraded our CI/CD tool which now allows us to implement required builds using a built-in scheduler. This will allow us to deploy changes at times of low activity which are less disruptive to our customers.  Squashing Bugs The tech team has spent a large portion of their time handling and prioritising bugs reported through our pilot programme for both our web app and our microservices; these have been segregated into level 1 or level 2 tickets and fixed according to their impact and severity on our users. The bugs are flaws that cause the web app to behave in unintended ways and some were present after both unit and functional testing. Circa 80% of the bugs have now been resolved, new versions of the code have been updated and tested.  Marketing Update  Digital Campaigns The marketing team has been working on new digital campaigns to be displayed across key marketing channels once our pilot ends, the new designs are aligned with our Plutus 2.0 overhaul and updated with our current feature set. The aim is to showcase our wide array of financial services in a simple and easily digestible manner whilst remaining slick and minimalist.  PR Coverage The team are continually working on securing tier 1 press coverage for our product announcements, we are currently in talks with numerous media outlets and discussing various campaigns to help spread awareness of Plutus to a wider audience.  Community Competitions The team is planning for numerous community competitions to be hosted over the coming weeks. This is a sign of our gratitude for the communities endless support and encouragement, stay tuned for further announcements and an opportunity to win cool Plutus swag.  Evergreen Content The team has written multiple evergreen articles centred around interesting and applicable topics to be released at optimal times across various platforms to help boost our exposure amongst the crypto community.  Social Influencer Campaigns The marketing team has continued with the planning of our influencer campaign. We previously reached out to potential influencers and performed background checks on their channels. We are now conducting a cost-benefit analysis to determine who will prove the most beneficial to Plutus. We are considering demographic, geographical location, price, presentation style, audience type (e.g. traders, miners, investors) and more.  Press Kit The marketing team has put together a press kit to give to media outlets and influencers so they can rapidly accustom themselves with our products and services. This includes our updated Plutus imagery, a breakdown of our USP’s and feature sets, and a brief overview of the company’s history.  General Update  Data Processing We’re gradually building our data science discipline at the product level. We have selected tools and begun building data pipelines for processing information in near real time so we can make informed data-driven product decisions.  Currently, we are optimising for low-event latency which means we can query recent user events within minutes of it happening and react accordingly. Other requirements, such as interactive querying, monitoring or scalability, will be optimised at a later stage.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Fact: In 1990, the first web page was served on the open internet.

Pinned Announcements  - You can buy BTC, ETH & PLU on our BETA PlutusDEX platform with 0% fees.  - Our BETA Plutus Tap & Pay mobile app is available on Android and iOS. It lets you sell crypto for fiat and withdraw to your bank account via SEPA transfers.  - We have released our vision of Plutus 2.0, the upgrade will be arriving in Q1 2019.  Development Update  Cards In order to accelerate the timeline of issuing cards, we have been diligently working with our universal card issuing partner to align our card designs within their technical tolerances. We are in agreement with the final card format and we are pleased with the current standings and delivery timeline.  Mobile Designs We have redesigned the mobile on-boarding flow with the goal of moving a user as rapidly through the process as possible. The user story has been tested rigorously to build a seamless experience from login to payment.  Virtual Cards The workflow for enabling virtual cards has been outlined and executed, they will be available on your account dashboard after we ship your physical card. Both physical and virtual cards are tied to your Plutus account, however, as an added security measure the fiat balance in your Plutus account is not tied to the balance in your debit card. You can manage your daily spending and transfer funds between your physical/virtual card and your current account directly from your Plutus app.  New Plutus 2.0 Landing Page The average user spends just seconds on a webpage before clicking further or abandoning the site. Our new 2.0 web page will encourage users to quickly discover new features, evaluate pricing, set up accounts and trade crypto. Multi-language functionality is also a webpage feature we are looking to offer over the coming months.  Marketing Update  Implementing Weekly Plan The marketing team prepared their weekly plan running up to the Plutus 2.0 upgrade and beyond. We are sticking to community-based organic marketing which includes company announcements via blogs, educational videos, social posts, content, company emails, press community events and more. This plan is well underway.  Press Networking The team are also busy growing their press network by meeting with numerous journalist and leading finance publishers in order to provide premium coverage and awareness for our product upgrade. We have secured some exciting coverage and we believe this organic growth from genuinely impressive product developments is the key to long-term success.  Exchange  Pluton (PLU) is listed on third-party services such as Hitbtc, IDEX & other decentralised (ERC20) exchanges. If you would like to test our service, you can obtain Pluton from other users externally or from users of the Plutus platform using our built-in PlutusDEX.  We are continuing our research into exchanges for our reward token that we believe bring fair benefits to the usage and customer adoption of our platform.  Plutus Vacancies  We are in the process of hiring for two new roles: Senior Frontend Developer and Head of Blockchain. We are seeking top-end talent to contribute to our platform in order to accommodate the progress being made. If you believe you have the skill set required to add value to our company or know of someone who does, then please refer to our applications listed here.  Plutus 2.0  Last week our CEO, Danial Daychopan, announced our future vision of the company. The approaching upgrade will transform Plutus into a next-generation finance platform that incorporates both fiat and crypto.  Users will be able to hold GBP/EUR in a Plutus current account and access their personal integrated cryptocurrency wallet from the same interface as opposed to only crypto deposits available on the current version. We are also converging our current services so that both buy and sell functionality is available on desktop and mobile. The ability to access and manage your crypto/fiat within a single app, and freely exchange between the two asset types, is a development that will bring simplicity to a tech-heavy market.  Danial, says, “Our team is thoughtfully developing a finance app with a blockchain-based rewards system that will inadvertently increase real-world adoption of cryptocurrencies. This is part of our contribution to the ecosystem in enabling mass adoption.”  Every time you makes a purchase using the card, you will receive up to 3% back in the form of Pluton (PLU), our native utility token. PLU can be sent to friends, redeemed for additional Plutus services and those offered by our mainstream partners, or converted from within the platform to fiat and added to your card balance. More on this will be revealed in the coming weeks.  To read the full announcement, head over to our CEO, Danial Daychopan’s most recent blog post here, where he shares the future vision for Plutus. If you have any questions on the upgrade please post them on our Reddit thread or join him and our other team members live, we will be hosting an AMA session, on Monday 25th at 2PM GMT.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Fact: Bitcoin has gone from 2 wallet addresses to nearly 32 million in just 10 years without any marketing.  People are realising the true potential of cryptocurrencies. The app features we are developing alongside our blockchain-backed rewards will inadvertently increase real-world adoption of cryptocurrencies.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Join us on Telegram and read the full update on our Medium page.",False

Mobile Development We have switched from using native languages to the React Native framework for the mobile application build. We are reconfiguring and including all reusable components, these are re-designed to meet our brand guidelines.  Analytics We have built our Plutus 2.0 analytics stack which will provide seamless product feedback loops, this will allow us to deliver constant improvements to our platform.

We would like to thank everyone who joined us, this was a great opportunity to interact with the community and we hope you found it productive. Below is a link to the thread where this commenced, if you have any other questions that were not covered during the session, please reach out on our Telegram channel here.  New Hires  Plutus has made a series of new hires that we believe will elevate the development of our platform. As you may know, we believe a strong team to be one of the fundamentals of building a professional and successful product and we are very selective of our applicants as a result.  Baris Cicek has joined us as a Senior Backend Developer with an MSc in Computer Engineering and over 10 years of professional experience as a software developer. Baris has a wealth of expertise within his field and has helped build complex marketplaces in the past; we believe his skills will be invaluable to our team.  Lyubomir Budakov has joined us as our new Mobile App Developer. He has a bachelor’s degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the Technical University of Sofia and he has gained extensive experience as a professional software developer over the last six years from both frontend and backend perspective. Lyubo has focused his efforts on mobile app development for the last three years which will prove helpful for our cause.  Ivaylo Ivanov has also joined us to empower the QA team.

We are integrating digital currencies into everyday living practices. The ability to access and manage both crypto and fiat from the same user interface, freely exchange between the two, and spend at over 400 million merchants using NFC technology is revolutionary. There is not a single player on the market who is achieving this in a non-custodial and secure manner like Plutus. — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Join us on Telegram and read the full update on our Medium page.",False

Tomas Rastenis has taken the Senior Frontend Developer role at Plutus. He has delivered visually demanding and responsive products for big-name brands in the past and has implemented connection to the single Euro payment area using the Bank of Lithuania as a gateway.

Daniel graduated from the University of Applied Informatics and BTM Management in Warsaw and worked as an IT administrator for numerous years before joining an advanced software R&D company.  General News  Test Card Pilot The Plutus staff will be testing our Plutus Pilot Cards next week to ensure they are robust enough for our community; the team will run various scenarios across six subcategories and adjust the build accordingly if necessary.  We are rolling out a small batch of cards to selective community members for further verification. You can join our Telegram channel for more info on applying.  KPI Development We have slowly and carefully selected team KPIs and we are now putting in place a data pipeline infrastructure that we can use to generate monthly reports for the senior managers to analyse. This will help us determine if the actions we are taking on a daily basis are moving us towards our business goals, and also enables a thorough assessment of our products and services. Compliance and Customer Service KPIs are locked down and implemented; Marketing and Product & Operations KPIs are next on the list.  Listings Awareness of Plutus is growing, and our utility token (PLU) has been listed on various websites, wallets and exchanges over the last fortnight.  - Pluton is now available on Atomic Wallet, a universal multi-asset wallet with a built-in decentralised exchange. - Pluton has been verified on Blockspot.io, a blockchain data platform that can be used to track and analyse our native utility token. - You can now trade PLU/BTC and PLU/ETH pairings on CoinExchange.io.  May we remind you to look out for phishing scams when using any platform or services that refer to Plutus. Security is of paramount importance to us and we will always ensure our users and their assets are safe. Please conduct your own due diligence for instances outside of our control when using any third party services, these are not partners of Plutus and they have added PLU due to its decentralised nature and use cases provided by Plutus.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Fact: The decentralised nature of Bitcoin means it cannot be banned, only regulated.  The UK Treasury Committee is investigating ways to regulate cryptocurrencies. Plutus has taken every precautious possible since its inception to ensure we are 100% regulatory compliant in every area. Regulations could heavily impact a large number of crypto start-ups, however, our foresight into such trends will ensure our longevity in the market.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Join us on Telegram and read the full update on our Medium page.",False

Development Update  Plutus 2.0 Unveiled The tech team has been working tirelessly over the last fortnight and delivered on Plutus 2.0! The frontend and backend are connected, and the development team has squashed countless bugs to ensure the system functions properly.  The aim is to streamline as many processes as possible on the user’s end for a quick and easy user experience. Account set-up takes as little as two minutes and the KYC verification process is incredibly efficient.  Our feature set is available to staff accounts and members of our community who are part of the Pilot Programme to assess the robustness of our system. Once we have rigorously tested the platform, we will roll it out to the rest of the community and the wider public.  Database Upgrades The tech team has also made further upgrades to our database management system in a production environment.  Marketing Update  Website Revealed As part of Plutus 2.0, we are pleased to unveil our new and improved corporate website. The site breaks down some of our newer features and navigation is laid out simply. As mentioned earlier, full access is available to selected members of the community who are testing our services.  Brand Identity The marketing team has updated all imagery across our social media platforms to match the Plutus 2.0 design overhaul. Consistency is a core element of strengthening a brand’s identity and one we aim to deliver on.  Events The marketing team has made contact with the organisers of fintech events to demo our Plutus 2.0 platform and applied for award nominations to boost our presence within the industry. We have also collated a list of relevant events, podcasts, awards, etc. occurring throughout the year that will help in identifying potential marketing opportunities.  Delta Direct We recently announced we are active on Blockfolio Signal, and we can now confirm our arrival to Delta Direct; a platform that connects us with existing and future community members. This is part of our continued effort to improve communications with our valued customers. Join us here.  General Update  Card Pilot Programme The Plutus Test Cards preloaded with £25/€25 have been shipped to selected members of our community within the UK and Europe to test their functionality and robustness. A handful of early supporters have already received their test cards and are now providing us with valued feedback.  The feedback from these users has been overwhelmingly positive so far and the tech team are working efficiently to reconcile any errors found on the front end. We are rigorously testing all our partner’s card services endpoints and ensuring we map the responses to a state in our microservices so we have the appropriate, user-friendly and helpful error messages in place.  Errors are frustrating for any consumer, and they can be a make or break situation for any customer relationship. We are thoughtfully approaching our error messages to deliver useful and practical solutions when you experience such issues — user experience is incredibly important to us.  Test Card Scenarios We are testing our cards in the real world across six major test categories…  ATM withdrawal Contactless Chip & Pin POS E-commerce Card Settings (Freeze, Unblock, Suspend Card, etc.)  We can proudly report that most use cases have passed exceptionally smoothly with the exception of some minor reports in ‘Transaction Table’ and ‘Card Setting’ responses — the team is already working on fixing this.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Fact: The total money supply M2 in the UK alone is almost £2.5T, and it is down to the government and our banking institutions to control this supply.  Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin replace the possibility of erroneous human decision making with maths, preventing the circulating supply from ever topping 21M coins. Plutus has built a crypto-fiat gateway known as the PlutusDEX that enables free movement of money between these two assets in a secure fashion.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Join us on Telegram and read the full update on our Medium page.",False

This makes it impossible for company hacks, corruption or downtime to have any impact on the user’s funds. Given over 980,000 Bitcoins have been stolen, largely as a result of the lax security of centralized exchanges, we believe our decentralized exchange approach to be a big selling point. Security is of paramount importance to us.  Secure cryptocurrency projects can take time to develop but we have live beta services available to use right now. You can buy and sell cryptocurrencies at zero fees via our PlutusDEX platform, and our ‘Plutus Tap & Pay’ app is now available on Android/iOS. In 2019 we will be announcing new integrated features and our fully functional debit card.  If you have any other questions, please let us know  Plutus",False

Our aim is to deliver a crypto payment platform that is unmatchable in terms of user safety and usability. As a result, the dev team have been working on a few changes this week to deliver on this.  What has the development team been working on this week?  This week we have released a new version of our iOS app in the App Store.  - We have added additional screens with further instructions regarding payment information, making the customer experience simpler and more efficient.  - Ironed out issues with getting real-time updates during matching and tracking of the order processes, and resolved technical issues with our Redis infrastructure.   - Currently, we are working on account transfer functionality for selling crypto and linking to the card account.

Filip joined the team at its infancy in 2015 to help with public communications and community support. His professionalism and expertise in the crypto space have helped shape the company line for future communications.  Martin was contracted to join in an interim management role to help Plutus establish a team of international developers, ensuring architectural security and overseeing third-party API integration.  We are incredibly grateful for their work at Plutus and we wish them the best of luck in their next career pursuits. They have left us in a strong position for future growth and we thank them for their contributions. We pride ourselves in sourcing only top-tier talent in order to achieve our ambitious goals and this will be continuing.  As sad as we are to see Martin go, we are also very excited to shortly be announcing our new permanent tech lead. A fintech and crypto veteran in his own right who will be coming in for the next stage of Plutus, helping with scaling our development team for both the UK and offshore. He will steer the company through the final stages of development and oversee the product growth of the ambitious Plutus 2.0 platform planned for an early 2019 release.  We have also hired a new Social Media & Content Marketer who will be covering a large portion of the writing from here forward. A well-rounded young professional who is hungry to grow Plutus’ online presence, with a track record in generating views.  This week the marketing team have been looking at Q1 plans, card mock-ups and EU Partnership Programmes.  Currently, the marketing team are planning for upcoming Q1 events. In order to maximise coverage, a media plan is being put together for the announcement of our card programme and high-profile press launch.  The designers are also putting together some mock-ups of the much-anticipated cards, this includes both the physical cards themselves and all the entailed packaging.  Preparation of our EU Partnership Programme is also in progress. We are identifying businesses that already accept crypto who we can develop mutual interests with through a corporate rewards programme. We believe this could provide an inflow of institutional wealth alongside our daily payment users.  We will also soon be introducing you to an adjusted 2019 roadmap now that we have discussed some major product developments that we think are best for Plutus’ future. We are incredibly excited as to the changes decided and believe these will transform usability and adoption of the app. The new roadmap will be arriving Jan 2019.  Our bounty hacker programme which has proven extremely successful and helpful is still in progress.  We have so far awarded over $6,000 worth of PLU to individuals stress-testing our services which has greatly fortified the security of our platforms.  Security researchers who successfully identify any major bugs with either our PlutusDEX or ‘Plutus Tap & Pay’ mobile app, will be rewarded with $500 worth of PLU.

The team are working hard on an assortment of jobs necessary for a complete package launch in Q1.  What have the Development Team been up to?  This week the development team have made some adjustments to our existing ‘Plutus Tap & Pay’ app and discussed a proposal for future developments.  - Our employees have made a couple of infrastructure improvements and corrected some bugs relating to our Redis configuration.  - We are taking every precaution necessary to make our service the most secure out of any brand in the crypto payments sector.

We plan to release short educational videos that feature some of our key staff members, the purpose is to simply explain our Plutus services in a way that a mass market can understand.  - With this in mind, we will also be adding an ‘About Us’ section to our corporate website that clarifies our company’s story, purpose and product breakdown. This should not only be useful for the newcomers in understanding how Plutus works, but it also aims to improve transparency as to what stages of development we are at.  Our Hacker Bounty Programme is Still Active  As you will know by now, user security is a number one priority which is why we embarked on a Hacker Bounty Programme. This has been ongoing for several months and we are continuing our efforts to fortify the platforms security levels.

Here is our weekly report summarising the events that have occurred…  What has the Development Team achieved this week?  This week the Development Team has improved the session management functionality of our PlutusDEX web version. The changes are currently in quality assurance and will be rolled out later this week to production.  We urgently updated our infrastructure after information in the news revealed vulnerabilities in the event-stream package.  The team added health check functionality to our microservices in clusters and were also updated to a new and improved format that is more scalable which will help ensure the service runs properly.  Development progress with our new providers for the Plutus card integration is moving quickly and the team is already able to pass the whole flow from the backend perspective in sandbox.  Updates from the Marketing Department  This week the Marketing Team have signed up for FinTech Connect, the UK’s largest fintech conference and trade show. This will be a great opportunity to gain insight into innovative financial products and to network with leading figures in the space.  The team has also engaged in a range of research activities into both economic and cryptocurrency trends. On top of this, we have investigated social media tracking products to help better understand our higher performing activities and areas of improvement, such as our weekly update, entering the new year we hope to have a fresh layout that makes our content more visually appealing to readers.  We are continuing to add evergreen content to our Plutus Publications page and want to provide insightful content to the community that helps establish our position as opinion leaders in the field. Read our latest addition here.  Bi-Monthly Reminder  We would like to remind you that from now on, our Plutus reporting will be released on a bi-monthly basis. You can expect our next and final Plutus report of the year to be available by 19th December.  We still remain the only crypto payments company to reveal such regular and detailed commentary on the behind-the-scenes work. We also believe that going bi-monthly will help document more concise and insightful reporting on our company as at times some parts of the development take longer than a single week to formulate or implement.  We want to be as transparent as possible but also deliver acutely accurate information.  New Product Owner  Over the last couple of months, the team have been sourcing the addition of a new Product Owner. Plutus always strives to hire only the best employees for the project in order to deliver excellence. With this in mind, we are happy to announce our latest hire, Minyi Soon.  Minyi has a diverse background across asset management, blockchain, product and tech. She has previously worked as an investment analyst within Legacy Financial Services, with a focus on research, asset allocation and trading. She then transitioned into building both VC and non-VC products.  She carries experience building tech products at various stages of growth, across multiple sectors, with an intense focus on aligning behavioural data and design with business goals.  Her last role was Senior Product Owner at London-based Crypto Digital Asset Exchange, BlockexMarkets, where she was responsible for building their blockchain-based tokenization product and user acquisition.  Her first foray into bitcoin was in February 2014 when it was just £203, making her an early adopter in the field by today’s standards.  She graduated with an Economics degree and is an alumni of the Blockchain Strategy Programme at Oxford University. We are excited to have her on board and look forward to the progress we can make with her added contributions.

It’s also worth checking out our other platforms…  Reddit Twitter Facebook Instagram Steemit  About Plutus  For the first time readers, here is a brief explanation of how our project works and why we believe it is so revolutionary.  The aim is to be the most secure and reliable cryptocurrency payments platform globally. This will be achieved by combining a payments system with a decentralized exchange.  Before an in-store purchase is made, the users’ cryptocurrency holdings are converted into spendable fiat through our peer-to-peer exchange known as the PlutusDEX. The user can convert only the amount of crypto necessary for a purchase and pay via a Plutus debit card or mobile ‘Plutus Tap & Pay’ app. This overcomes the slow process of merchant adoption and makes crypto instantly usable at over 40 million stores worldwide.  A beta version of our PlutusDEX trading platform is available now and is quite possibly the fastest way to convert your cryptocurrency into a useable European bank balance. Whilst in beta we are offering the buying and selling of cryptocurrencies with zero fees attached, take a look here.  Unlike any of our competitors, we never store the funds of a user. Given the rising number of exchange breaches and constant advances in hacking techniques, we believe storing user assets a jeopardy to everyone involved. Instead, our users are in possession of their crypto and fiat at all times, making their funds immune to company hacks, corruption, downtime, closures etc. impacting their money in any way.  We are on target for a complete product release in Q1 2019, the Plutus 2.0 will include an intuitive user interface backed by the Plutus debit card, mobile ‘Plutus Tap & Pay’ app and PlutusDEX trading platform.",False

This article will cover our year’s achievements, blockers and developments.  Challenges  Before delving into the positives accomplished this year, let’s go through the challenges faced by the team and how these have been overcome.  Card Issuing  At the start of this year, our MasterCard services were available to the general public and customers were able to seamlessly spend their converted crypto. Unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond the control of Plutus, we were forced to terminate the cards issued to our customers as a result of policy changes by third-party service providers. The news was a disappointing setback and stunted Plutus’ progress, the rest of the crypto-payments sector experienced similar setbacks as a result of constantly changing corporate opinions on cryptocurrencies.  The team shifted their focus towards releasing the new Plutus cards, and have since prepared to release them in early 2019 by re-building the appropriate partnerships and by aquiring new service providers.  Red Tapes  Since Plutus taps into the legacy payment infrastructure it faces similar legal challenges experienced by any regulated financial institution, especially by the FCA and FSA in the United Kindgom. Having forecasted future regulations, we have taken every precaution necessary from the inception of our token sale to the building of an e-banking app that works with crypto. It requires extensive due diligence of the token model (Pluton), the application workflow, and the business model in the interest of the company’s longevity. We have achieved this with the continuous help of our legal partners Bird & Bird. You can read more about the legal standpoint of Pluton here - https://medium.com/@PlutusIT/legal-opinion-on-pluton-e945a224627  Landmark Achievements  The team have dedicated a lot of hours to bring you the most proficient and secure crypto payments platform possible. We have built from the ground up, a non-custodial way to convert crypto to fiat via our PlutusDEX and a mobile Plutus Tap & Pay app for payments. There has been a lot ongoing behind the scenes to put us in the position we are at today, here are some of the most notable highlights…  Partnerships  After the unavoidable red tape mentioned earlier, arrangements were immediately put in place to acquire a new card provider. This year we developed a new and improved partnership with an award-winning payment solutions provider to deliver the soon arriving Plutus debit cards in Q1 2019, they will also be facilitating the in-store fiat transactions from Pound Sterling and Euro accounts.  However, this is not the only partnership that’s been put in place. There are further unmentioned partnerships with services that will prove hugely advantageous for the future of Plutus, these developments will greatly speed up Plutus’ progress towards a worldwide crypto payment service and it extends the potentials far beyond that.  SEPA Integration  This relationship has also enabled us to integrate Europe’s fastest payment processing system, SEPA, an advance that offers real usability to our customers. The new cross-border Euro bank transfer format is used in 34 different countries and guarantees payments are received in full, on time, and without bank deductions. Users can withdraw their converted crypto into their personal bank account balance in minutes as a result. Our platform is potentially the fastest way to get from cryptocurrencies to a bank account balance.   Plutus Tap & Pay App  This September we successfully released the BETA version of our ‘Plutus Tap & Pay’ app. The mobile app enables users to exchange their crypto into a virtual fiat balance which can instantly be withdrawn, the team are preparing additional payment functionalities that will be arriving in early 2019. We are seeing an increasing number of app users daily with 7,000+ downloads so far. The application is available on both Android and iOS and can be downloaded here.  PlutusDEX  We also successfully launched a live BETA version of our PlutusDEX platform, a decentralised P2P exchange necessary for converting crypto to EUR/GBP for the soon arriving Plutus payment features. Pluton became instantly and securely tradeable across the platform and this was expanded soon after to facilitate Bitcoin and Ether transactions also; you can now trade all three cryptocurrencies using the service. These two core functionalities, the buying and selling of crypto, are offered with zero fees attached whilst in BETA. To experience fee-free trading, please visit: PlutusDEX   Reward System  Our loyalty reward system is now set up and ready to deploy, as soon as fees are attached to our service we will implement our rewards programme, expected to be released in our next major update in Q1 2019.  Users will receive up to 3% of their crypto deposits back in the form of Pluton (PLU) which can instantly be exchanged to fiat and withdrawn using our service, or utilized for spending. We have by far the most rewarding structure in place out of any crypto payments platform.  App Survey  In order to improve every aspect of our app and deliver an unrivalled service, we sent out a user experience survey this October. We take user satisfaction very seriously and the results highlighted some major product design changes to be incorporated into our next app version. The developers have been working on significant improvements in preparation for a 2019 release which we are incredibly excited about.  Hacker Bounty Programme  We have additionally been running a hacker bounty programme throughout the year where we reward security researchers who identify any bugs or security issues with our service. The programme aims to assist in delivering an incredibly secure trading platform. Security is of paramount importance which is the primary reason we opted for a decentralized P2P exchange in the first place, this bounty process has helped us deliver on that. In total, our bounty hunters have contributed 30 successful improvements that have been approved and implemented, in return, we have awarded over $6,000 worth of PLU for their efforts.  Next Year  We have some game-changing developments to be released early next year, the Plutus 2.0 platform will have several e-banking features, as well as an intuitive user interface, for ease of use on both the app and desktop. More details on these updates and the complete list of features will be announced in the coming month.  Thank You  We would like to give a warm thank you to everyone involved in the Plutus project.  Our Media partners have done a great job and we are truly humbled by the positive media responses we have received. We thank the security researchers for their assistance in fortifying the strength of our platform and we are also incredibly grateful to the community, both the veterans and the newbies, for their continued support of our project. We could not be able to work without knowing there is a loyal user base excited to use our services.

If you miss this deadline you will forfeit your unclaimed PLU and this will be used for bounty payouts.",False

Our upgrade is only a few months away and we are in the midst of integrating some seriously big developments that will be made public in the following week.  This report will be covering the progress made across the December period.  Pinned Announcements  You can trade BTC, ETH & PLU on our BETA PlutusDEX platform with 0% fees.  Our BETA Plutus Tap & Pay mobile app is available on Android and iOS.  We aim for a complete product upgrade (cards, DEX & app) in Q1 2019.   Recap In the last month of 2018, we released a summary document of our entire year’s developments. This detailed all the major blockers, product achievements and notable highlights experienced by Plutus across the 12-month period. If you are yet to read the report, please take a look here.  We also made several key hires who have proven to be great additions to the team. Our newly acquired CTO, Patryk Rzadzinski, as well as our experienced Product Owner, Minyi Soon, are greatly streamlining the processes required to hit our product goals.  Development Update  We have also upgraded our ticketing system. We are now using JIRA, an issue and project tracking software which we believe will improve the efficiency and management of any problematic matters that may arise, both on the customer and company side. All our previous data from Trello has been migrated across.  The department has been analyzing and improving the configuration of our kubernetes cluster in the cloud to identify areas of improvement to our high availability (HA) capabilities.  For safety purposes, we want to be aware of any activities that could be perceived as dangerous to our users or company. We have made several infrastructure improvements to our alarm and monitoring system to ensure the prevention of such activities.  The team has also been preparing for updates to the cluster of our latest software version. The rest of the time has been spent on deploying changes that will fix bugs relating to our corporate website and PlutusDEX.  The Plutus 2.0 platform is greatly focused on the feedback from our customer satisfaction survey and we look forward to the feedback and responses of our upcoming version release.  Marketing Update  The marketing team attended FinTech Connect 2018 last month which was a great networking opportunity and helped identify potential partners we could use to integrate additional product features into our platform with.  Some final changes have been made to our first corporate video which we will use to educate the general public on our purpose and current product. This will be going live in the coming months followed by a series of additional educational how-to videos.  You may also have noticed our new report layout; we aim to deliver more engaging reports, both aesthetically and content-wise, to encourage user engagement.  The marketing team has been working rigorously through December to plan the next 12 months of activities and we have some very exciting developments to announce over the course of 2019. Last year we generated some great press coverage with leading media outlets and we expect this year to be much bigger.  Over the course of 2019, our digital marketing is being ramped up in line with our card release and new product versions, we are also planning to expand our customer reach to new territories over the course of the year.  Plutus 2.0  Please stay tuned for our Plutus 2.0 update to be released in the following week, we have made some monumental changes that we believe are revolutionary to our platform. Our focus has so far been on security, however, our previous research has made us aware of the need to improve our product user experience. We are not only overcoming this, but we are also introducing a range of additional product features that transition us from a mere payment’s provider into something much greater. Please stay tuned for an upcoming announcement to be released in the following days.  ___________________________________________________________________  Fact: Approximately 850,000 Bitcoins disappeared from the Mt. Gox exchange, the coins belonged to both the customers and the company. It is unclear whether the disappearance was a result of theft, fraud, mismanagement or a combination of these.  Unlike any of the other digital currency payment platforms out there that require an exchange to facilitate the transactions, this type of event could never happen to Plutus. Our model is designed to be non-custodial, meaning we at no point store the funds of a user, instead, users are in complete control of their assets all times which makes their assets immune from company hacks, corruption, downtime etc.  To keep up to date with all things Plutus, join our Telegram groups, and read this weeks update in full - visit our Medium blog -https://medium.com/@PlutusIT",False

Pinned Announcements  - You can buy BTC, ETH & PLU on our BETA PlutusDEX platform with 0% fees.  - Our BETA Plutus Tap & Pay mobile app is available on Android and iOS. It lets you sell crypto for fiat and withdraw to your bank account via SEPA transfers.  - We aim for a complete product overhaul including the card release to be completed in the coming months.  Development Update  Payment Provider Integration  We have been working on system integration, setting up connectivity with our payment solutions provider — this includes staging, documentation, regression testing and resolved KYC errors. The tech team ran a high-level audit and discovered 5 findings which we aim to completely address.  The development team are now planning our upcoming priorities with engineers for 2019, this includes some infrastructure and security audit workflow preparations — all this is to ensure your transactions are safe and secure.  Card Issuance  We have been working with a third-party card service provider to roll out cards, this includes working on API integrations. We have been through this procedure previously and the experience should ensure a faster and more efficient process.  We’ll let everyone know as soon as we have firmer updates on card release — this is our top priority for the near-term and we are very excited to reveal what the team have been working on.  Audit Preparation  Additionally, in order to make sure we are compliant with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), we’re auditing our features and user-facing UI to ensure we pass FCA’s Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) litmus test. We have always ensured we remain compliant in every way and we welcome the UK Treasury Committee’s pending regulation in the space; we are prepping and aligning ourselves ahead of time.  Marketing Update  The marketing team has revised all customer-facing content in order to guarantee the language used stays in line with regulatory recommendations, this has been done to ensure our intended partnerships go ahead as planned.  The team has also been consolidating the brand’s identity, Plutus is a high-quality brand and we want all related imagery, design and branding to reflect this.  Our upcoming Plutus cards will be delivered by a premium packaging company for a brand new user experience. It is at the forefront of our consideration that we bring you a pleasant user experience with minimum packaging wastage in mind.  The social media activities for Q1 and beyond have been prepared well in advance to ensure consistency across all platforms and to help prioritise larger scale marketing activities. Join us on Instagram and Twitter to see this in action.  Plutus 2.0  Our Plutus 2.0 announcement is currently on pause, the development team are continuing to work on the exciting upgrades as planned and this has no effect on the actual delivery, however, the marketing team cannot discuss our upgrades to the public at this moment in time for various reasons.  We hope you understand, we were very excited to reveal what we have been working on but unfortunately, we cannot share this with you just yet.  — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— — — — — —  Fact: If you don’t own your private keys, you are not in possession of your assets.

Development Update  KYC & UX  We have been refining our AML and KYC policies with an established next-generation screening and monitoring tool in order to ensure our regulatory measures meet the strict traditional banking and payments standards. This was a lengthy process, but we are on track.  Enhancements have also been made to the UX of the KYC process from a user’s perspective on both web and mobile applications. We have additionally set up learning procedures and analytics around KYC interactions so we can learn and iterate rapidly from our users for future amendments.  Security Audits  We passed our security audit. We were required to undergo a full manual security penetration test of our DEX application for our card provider, to prove the robustness of our security features. The renowned software audit company accepted our approach and the process enabled us to implement some small changes that will further increase our security.  We also completed the implementation of a service side antivirus, this was a hard requirement for our worldwide card provider — another box checked off.  Other progress includes optimisation of the KYC function (no longer writes data to disk, faster, less IO); implementation of EFK for improved log aggregation and monitoring; analysis (and rejection) of EKS for Kubernetes management.  Marketing Update  The marketing team held an internal meeting to discuss the aesthetics of our upcoming Plutus Debit Cards; evaluating the textures, colours and how we can differentiate ourselves from the rest of the market. We also engaged with two leading card manufacturers, who supply most household name cards, to discuss what is possible with regards to finishes and special effects.  The team has been working avidly on our content video strategy in line with our anticipated card release due over the coming months. We have outlined and created a schedule of titles and formats of 11 how-to videos, these will be supported by additional content and digital promotions.  With our Plutus 2.0 upgrade approaching, the team has laid out the designs for of a new website — more specifically the written content side and not the imagery. This includes the sub-pages, our products, feature descriptions and navigations.  On top of this, we continue to prepare for our large scale marketing activities; this includes ongoing press networking, identifying potential strategic brand partners for our launch, narrowing down potential speaker events, and finalising of our blogger/influencer activities.  The team has upped their regular posting across various social media platforms and this will be continued over the coming weeks.  Plutus Vacancies  In order to accommodate the progress being made, we have decided to further expand our impressive workforce. We are looking for four new talented individuals to join our team and grow Plutus to its full potential.

From here, we went on to develop and release several products such as our advanced decentralised P2P technology for crypto-to-fiat transactions (PlutusDEX) and a mobile app for fiat-to-crypto conversions.  Last year we faced some major obstacles, mainly due to red tapes imposed on the industry by our partners and regulators, but we have over come those challenges and also achieved many of our intended goals. To see a complete list of our achievements over 2018, please read our company blog post detailing the entire year’s developments here.  The Current Model  Our current platform is in open public beta and allows users to exchange between crypto and fiat. The selling feature is only available on the mobile app whereas the buying feature can be accessed via the PlutusDEX web platform. This was deliberate as the mobile app was intended to act strictly as a tool for money management and payments, enabling the sale of crypto in return for fiat which can then be used for everyday purchases via the app or Plutus Debit Card. Meanwhile, the web platform (PlutusDEX) was designed to provide liquidity for the app users, acting as fuel for the payment network as outlined in the Plutus white paper.  Since the release of our beta products last year, we have gathered useful feedback and data through user surveys and extensive research in order to improve our platform. We have used this information to understand the obstacles in the user journey and remove any points of friction, the result is a complete overhaul of the user flow on both mobile and web interfaces as well as a range of additional features.  Plutus 2.0  Financial Services Plutus will no longer be restricted to just crypto deposits. Plutus 2.0 will be provide a range of new financial service features including the ability to initiate direct EUR and GBP deposits to load your Plutus debit card. You will be able to open a Plutus account from anywhere within the UK and over 30 European countries (EEA region) to send and receive Euros or Pound Sterlings as you wish; the set-up is done instantly without the need for credit checks. You will have complete control over your assets to manage as you please, making seamless payments, transfers and withdrawals worldwide.  Plutus 2.0 will promise same-day EUR settlements using SEPA transfers. This will enable you to rapidly move funds directly between your Plutus account and alternative bank accounts (yours or others). Deposits are instant and withdrawals completed within hours.  Pluton Reward System Our platform comes complete with our own native loyalty rewards token, Pluton (PLU). Every time you load your virtual or physical debit balance with EUR or GBP, you will receive up to 3% back in the form of PLU (Pluton Yellow Paper). You can redeem the earned PLU for fiat using our built-in conversion tool (PlutusDEX) to load your account balance. Pluton is a great mechanism to increase adoption. It's emitted to users of the Plutus debit card which will be available to millions of customers in both the UK and in Europe. These essential features will inadvertently introduce cryptocurrencies into the real world and help accelerate mass adoption.  Additionally, we are adding further value to our rewards programme by creating a higher use case for PLU; such as the ability to redeem PLU for additional services offered by Plutus and our mainstream partners. Moving forward, our loyal customers will experience numerous benefits through their PLU rewards. More on this will be revealed in the coming weeks.  Revenue Model Previously, users were able to avoid the fees incurred for loading their spending balance with Bitcoin and Ether by using Pluton. Plutus 2.0 no longer plans to charge fees for deposits of any kind, instead, we are moving to a tiered fee subscription model. Your earned PLU can also be redeemed for free subscriptions to our premium services and many other upcoming features.  Product Convergence Plutus provides a complete non-custodial way of exchanging crypto and fiat using its built-in peer-to-peer decentralised technology, the PlutusDEX. On the current version, both the selling of crypto to fiat and withdrawal is done via the mobile app, and the buying is done via the web interface.  We are now making buy and sell functionality available on both device types (desktop and mobile). The PlutusDEX will be merged with our app into one place to produce an all-encompassing product, combining the two will greatly improve the user experience of our platform and provide a multi-functional application.  User Journey Improving the user journey has been the highest priority for myself and the team while working on this update. As a non-custodial application, Plutus cannot provide its own crypto wallet to users; in order to create a seamless in-app experience, we are integrating a well-known decentralised third-party wallet to allow an easier user interface for the buying and selling of crypto.  Research & Development We are currently looking into tools that will bring greater liquidity to the platform. We want to ensure all buy and sell orders fill instantly at the market spot rate in order to provide users with on-the-go trading options. The PlutusDEX uses a weighted average of rates from all the top exchanges to execute trades at spot rate and our next aim is faster conversions for all our available assets. This will not be part of the approaching upgrade but it will be added to the feature set at a later date.  In Summary  We have some impressive developments arriving in 2019 and over the next few months, we look forward to releasing our extensive feature sets mentioned in this article. This has been a great journey so far for the Plutus team and we are excited to embark on the next stages of development.  We are proud to be one of the rare start-ups out of several thousand ICO’s and crowd sales to have gone from a white paper to a functioning product, and we have done so at a fraction of the funding compared to industry standards whilst also acquiring a strong team of professionals along the way.  In the upcoming Plutus 2.0 release (due by 31st March 2019), we are committed to improving our platform and delivering on the promise of an easy to use digital financial service and payments platform.  I will be holding an AMA with the Plutus team on Reddit at 2pm GMT on Monday 25th Feb to answer your questions on any of the above. In the meantime, you can join our official Telegram channel to speak with a Plutus team member.",False

Head over to http://plutus.it and download the Plutus Tap & Pay for Android or iOS.  New to crypto, and looking to buy Pluton, Bitcoin, or Ethereum?  Choose the safest way to buy cryptocurrencies, and take our decentralised exchange for a test drive: http://dexbeta.plutus.it  What makes Plutus unique?  Plutus has learned from the past mistakes of other cryptocurrency services, namely the mantra: “If you store your coins on an exchange, they aren’t YOUR coins.”  This is why Plutus is quite possibly the only crypto-fiat and fiat-crypto gateway where your cryptocurrency balance is NEVER stored on any exchange or centralised server.  Instead, all coins travel directly to the user’s cryptocurrency address (or your own address, depending on whether you are buying or selling cryptocurrencies).  At the same time, our handling of fiat deposits is managed by 3rd parties (and is directly tied to a blockchain-based verification mechanism).  This makes events like the “Mt.Gox Disaster” impossible by design, because there are no user cryptocurrency balances whatsoever.  Legal Status of Pluton (PLU)  Several of our users have inquired about the legal status of Pluton (PLU) and how this affects the future of Plutus.  Quick summary: We have confirmation from our legal counsel that Plutus is best defined as a utility token, loyalty point, and in-app reward that exists for use inside the Plutus ecosystem.  Exchange Updates  You can currently buy Pluton on the PlutusDEX from other users as outlined in our white paper. However, as a community initiative, and to speed up the process, you can utilise the social media by posting and tagging any of the top three cryptocurrency exchanges, along with @Plutusit, #PLU and #Cryptoanywhere.

This is why we would like to know your vision for using Plutus Tap & Pay for Android/iOS.  As you may well be aware, Plutus is first and foremost an app made for Bitcoiners, digital nomads, as well as a growing group of people who otherwise benefit from or enjoy using cryptocurrencies.  This is why we have now drafted a U/X (user experience) survey to better address the needs of the cryptocurrency community.  As a gesture of gratitude, every participant who completes the survey will receive 5 PLU.  Head over to our survey: https://plutusit.typeform.com/to/qBYDmL  Centralised vs. Peer-to-Peer  Are you still using a centralised exchange or service to store your coins?  We think that’s a bad idea. Services that rely on a central vault can go offline, get hacked, become insolvent, or shut down. Furthermore, you have to manually withdraw your coins, wait, and hope that the transfer clears.  What’s the alternative?  Start using a service that respects your cryptocurrencies as your own property, and does not store them on its server. (Because if you don’t hold your own coins, they don’t actually belong to you).  This is one of the main reasons we designed Plutus the way we did, as a peer-to-peer gateway for cryptocurrencies to pass through.  For example, using the PlutusDEX you can receive Pluton, Bitcoin, or Ethereum directly to your own custom cold storage wallet, or any valid cryptocurrency address for that matter.

Our marketing is well underway now. Our marketing manager and myself have contacted Youtubers and other social media influencers directly - some of these have grown into digital meetings and some of those have flourished into a promising partnership.  Along with this, we're currently waiting for Facebook and Twitter to green light our social media adverts which should happen sometime soon. Additionally, we have a number of articles written up and awaiting release.  As for the cards, if all goes to plan we expect to have an official and complete release by the end of this year/start of next. We're incrementally rolling out our services until that day comes so it is likely we'll release the card prior to the complete release as part of our roll out.

We've had several articles published already with many more to come!   Bitcoin Can Stabilise Britain after Brexit  According to BusinessCloud, Daniel Daychopan, the CEO of FinTech firm Plutus has spoken out about Bitcoin, discussing how mainstream adoption will be important for the progression of the currency and that importantly, it could potentially have a big impact during Brexit too. Daychopan says:  “Currencies like the Pound and the Euro are interdependent and struggle in the face of global instability, while cryptocurrencies are decentralised and present a viable and stable alternative for businesses and consumers.”  Our latest editorial can be read on the following websites:  Cryptodaily - https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2018/08/bitcoin-can-stabilise-britain-after-brexit/#!

However, this isn’t just reserved for undeveloped areas: South Africa’s first cryptocurrency ATM opened in Johannesburg in early May, showing the extent to which it has become part of daily life in the nation’s largest city.

Travelling can be stressful - right? Whether you're on a business trip or you're on your way to sun, sea, and sand.  Now imagine the following: You’re on the last page of your booking process, only to see that your favourite payment method isn’t supported.  If you have your mind set on using Bitcoin or Ethereum to travel, you will have to face additional challenges along the way.  Bali - Indonesia In 2014, the Indonesian island of Bali was already well on its way to becoming the number one destination for any bitcoiner. Aided by initiatives such as BitIslands, it quickly turned into a great place to spend your crypto.  Unfortunately, in 2018 the government of Indonesia decided that cryptocurrencies are not legal tender in their country, forcing merchants to stop accepting Bitcoin altogether.  Strange actually, since the idea of travel pretty much goes hand in hand with Bitcoin. What better way to travel than a currency without borders?  Brick and Mortar... and Bitcoin Whether you are at home or traveling the world, you will eventually have to rely on local shops or restaurants to make sure you have enough supplies and energy for the week.  If you only have Bitcoin on you, this can be quite a challenge.  “It’s too complicated for our staff to use.”  “We stopped accepting bitcoin after some customers tried to reverse their transactions.”  It’s common to hear such answers when cryptocurrency merchant adoption is at stake. But it makes sense.  What's the Solution?  The solution is not to force them to accept this payment method it’s to facilitate it in a manner that puts control into the hands of the customer.  Plutus is going to provide the answer. The first feature to be rolled out in August 2018 will be instant SEPA transfers. This means that you will be able to convert your Pluton, Bitcoin, or Ethereum and transfer the resulting balance to your bank account almost instantly.  Upcoming features will give you the ability to spend through many different ways including Plutus Debit Cards, Android/iOS, online, and more.

Apologies that the team haven't been quite so engaged on this thread but now we're committed to changing this.  Here's a quick update:  What is Plutus? Plutus consists of two interconnected applications:  Plutus Tap & Pay is an Android and iOS app for paying with Bitcoin & Ethereum at any contactless-enabled debit card terminal already in use today. Additionally, every deposit you make rewards you in Pluton, a loyalty rebate token which can then be used to make further purchases without fees.  The PlutusDEX is a one-way peer-to-peer exchange (smart contract) that provides liquidity for the Tap & Pay app. The way this works is that PlutusDEX traders can escrow fiat currency such as GBP or EUR to purchase Bitcoin and Ethereum from the users of Tap & Pay mentioned above.  Our favorite aspect, however, is that the Bitcoin and Ethereum can be bought by other users with zero fees through the PlutusDEX. Our person-to-person system makes it much easier to add new currencies (both fiat and digital) depending on demand, and a 0% fee trading experience encourages exchanges and blockchain enterprises to use our API as well.  Why chose Plutus vs other competitors? Our main difference from competitors is that we don’t store your cryptocurrency whilst we provide a decentralised platform.  We have one of the best incentives to use our service, where you will receive a Pluton Rebate of up to 3% for each deposit you make.  When will Plutus end the beta, and launch to the public? We don't have a precise date on when we will fully launch, we are currently working on integrating our banking API into the application and PlutusDEX.  At this time the expected launch is December 2018-April 2019.  Where can I use Plutus for shopping? At any store or point-of-sale which supports regular debit cards and/or contactless payments. In many countries, these are practically everywhere.  Keep up to date with Plutus:  Our official Telegram channel - https://t.me/plutus_group  Our official blog - https://medium.com/@PlutusIT  Our website - https://plutus.it/  You can access our full FAQ here - https://support.plutus.it/  Any queries regarding user support should be sent to support@plutus.it   Each week we'll be posting an update on our blog which will be summarised here.   This weeks update includes:  Another look at our recently launched bounty program:  Our bounty program is running full force ahead, and we have already received the first security reports from our community. When they arrived, our dev team was already on the spot to investigate and resolve them as soon as possible.  Security is of paramount importance, which means that we will investigate all reported bugs and potential breaches. If you would like to join our bounty program and earn up to $500 in PLU for every actionable exploit, please visit us at: https://plutus.it/bounty  National Press Coverage:  Our bounty program and crypto jackpot generated great media coverage, please see the links to the articles below. We see this as a strong move towards spreading the word of Plutus globally, while only being a smaller part of our overall marketing and outreach strategy. These steps form the foundation that will let us reach a wide audience when we go live.  The Plutus UK influencer program put together by our Marketing team has already caught the first influencers, and brought them on board the Plutus train.  Development Updates:  It’s been another busy week in development. Here’s the latest in Plutus tech:  -We have finished testing our new flow related to payouts and virtual bank accounts in a sandbox environment  -We have developed several new screens related to the flow mentioned above, on Android and iOS.  -Next week, we will be able to initiate production environment testing of these new features. This means that they will be live for internal team testing for the first time.  If you want to read our update in more detail visit our blog at https://medium.com/@PlutusIT",False

So it's a great base for PLU to launch from.  I would argue though that the stronger the valuation & volume of PLU within the crypto market, the more liquidity and support PLU will have on their internal market which is important during the initial adoption phase when internal demand & growth might take some months to ramp up. MAID, GNT, REP, BAT etc. All have >$200 million speculative pre-customer valuations and high volume, there is nothing wrong with this and in PLU's case will be very synergistic in terms of bootstrapping PLU and also creating greater brand awareness among the crypto demographic which is probably the lowest hanging fruit in terms of an initial customer base.",False

Leveraging the public beta launch with such a high profile competition can only be positive imo. There will be a lot of excitement in the market if Plutus will be launching in less than a week from then & therefore a lot more buzz about & interest in Plutus at the event. (Even a few days left for attendees to buy some pre-launch...)  Quote The European FinTech Awards & Conference will bring together over 500 entrepreneurs, bankers, investors and experts.  The market will also respond positively to having the beta launch co-incide with a high profile event as it will get the marketing momentum of a fairly quiet project to date off to a strong start. So win-win, with perhaps a literal award win too",False

Allow me to clear a few things up.  Both business and software development are proceeding as planned. We are also looking to expand our team with new hires that will assist us in social media, technical support, organic marketing and community engagement.  A testable release is very close to completion, and the private BETA will launch immediately it is greenlit by Martin, our CTO. During the BETA process we will collect feedback on UI/UX, as well as other aspects of the PlutusDEX. After this, suggestions will be documented, and evaluated, and implemented. The purpose is to tailor the product to the requirements of our community. Once this is completed, and the mobile app(s) is finalized, Plutus Tap & Pay and the PlutusDEX will both be ready for a full launch.  I also wanted to clarify that it is our position that we are not actively pursuing PLU being added to exchanges because we believe that it would be counterproductive to expose a substantial, large new audience to our project before we have a production-ready release that is ready to scale.The purpose of PLU is to create a priority lane for usage of the Plutus app, and we are committed to making it as valuable for shopping as possible. This means that once the use-cases are in place, a substantial marketing and exchange adoption effort via the PlutusDEX can begin. At this point we expect Plutus to become quite interesting to exchanges and cryptoservices, because they can purchase BTC/ETH at 0% fees through the API as well.  Regarding PLU payout issues  The previous website has been made by our previous team, which has been entirely replaced by our new team and new CTO due to not meeting our technical standards. It is by all definitions a difficult software to deal with. Login issues have been resolved numerous times, and have remained resolved for the majority of users, but new ones have surfaced for other users. We are processing requests manually, and the old page will be entirely retired and removed once that is completed. Keep in mind that it was developed with minimal bootstrap funding, in a short amount of time.  With strict procedures, plans and documentation, all software developed by our new 8-dev team has to pass strict, and stringent safety, compliance, and testing procedures ensured by our QA.  What's next for Plutus?  Our devs are working full-time to ensure that milestones are met and that the project is moving forward at full speed. We are also currently looking to hire both support and community staff, as it is becoming more challenging as our community steadily grows. More AMAs and FAQs are scheduled for the near future as well, and we are looking into additional ways to improve communication with the community. If you have not yet joined our slack, please go to http://slack.plutus.it  Thank you to everyone for supporting our project. Let us know if you have any more questions. Although we recommend reaching out to us through Slack, private inquiries can be directed to info@plutus.it as well.",False

Considering buying some PAY token as soon as they are available.  If world economic forum is predicting that 10% of global GDP ($7.8 trillion in today's money) will be on blockchain within 10 years and, if TenX and COMIT are the fabric connecting blockchains and providing payments, then I think it's important to carefully answer these questions as openly and clearly as possible, so that every single person can decide whether PAY is a good opportunity before them.  10 questions.  1. Do you need a TenX card in order to use the Andriod/iOS app for making payments where Visa/Mastercard is accepted?  Can the app be used on its own for such purchases?  2. If card is needed, then does the card details get ""sucked"" into the andriod app and you don't need to bother brining you card to the shop?  Or do you need them both?  3. COMIT charges no commissions, how can this be?  If it works like you say it does, then it seems a tiny fee like this could be a big profit maker for decentralized trades between cryptocurrencies.  Is there a future plan for COMIT to take small profit 0.04%?  4. Are there any other planned future revenue streams for PAY token holders?  5. What happens if/when cryptoC is ubiquitously adopted and no more Visa/Mastercard?  People the world over start paying and receiving payment directly in cryptocurrency.  Do PAY tokens receive any incentive to be held or do they become worthless at this point?  6. Can TenX wallet be used anonymously?  Or does it always require centralized registration?  7. Does the TenX wallet actually hold the private keys or are they stored on your servers?  8. When making a Visa/Mastercard transaction does the TenX wallet interact with the payment terminal using NFC and send TenX card details propagating back trough the payment terminal network, eventually reaching COMIT and then over the internet to the mobile device and finally to the TenX wallet?  If so, that seems to imply that you need to have a working internet connection on your mobile device in order to pay with TenX, which is fine.  Just want to understand in simple terms how it works.  9. Will TenX be making partnerships, deals and acquisitions with/of other payment processors and competitors?  If so, would PAY holders, either directly or indirectly, benefit from such strategic deals?  10.  Are other payment systems able to leverage COMIT?  If so, what benefit would TenX PAY holder have?  If this is the case, what would serve to protect PAY holder investment from being undercut by other competitors riding on top of COMIT?  OK, so it was slightly more than 10 questions because I snuck in subquestions.  My decision whether to buy PAY as soon as it's on exchanges will be largely impacted on your answers.

If you had a PLU debit card would you use PLU or would you use BTC and get up to 3% back in free PLU instead and sell the free PLU? (Unless the PLU funded transaction cost is 3% cheaper than using BTC on PLU. But if the BTC transaction cost is 3%+ then wouldn't customers rather use TKN/Other card that only has a 1% additional transaction fee?)    Every alt that has given away their tokens in an attempt to bootstrap have seen losses of up to 95%+ of the share price during the actual process. Stellar/Lumens halted their losses by dropping their give away from $10 to each new user to under $0.5 very rapidly and then they also changed it to an invite only process, with a discretionary geographic + demographic combo, that made it hard to track where the new STR were going. (I personally think they stopped giving much away at that point once they saw the effect.) On Aug 11th 2014 before the give away started really kicking in, STR were $0.006 each, it's taken them nearly 3 years to reach/pass that value again which they did 3 weeks ago and that was due to XRP rise.  The problem with PLU is you will be giving away in perpetuity.  Having said that when PLU releases it will probably pump so there's a trade there, but as soon as it kicks in, and customers get PLU this will drop like a stone.",False

Do not sell your plutons for less than $50 per PLU    [5:20]  $50 million market capital is very small in cryptomarket.  [5:20]  There are cryptocurrencies that are worth over $30mil market cap with no actual use or real world application at the moment.  [5:21]  Plutus will contirbute to mass adoption of BTC/Ethereum.  [5:22]  Give it time, people will come around. Eventually it will make noises again once centralized exchanges starts accepting PLU, and once the platform & dex launches, it is definitely a sleeper. I have to say though, Plutus is one of the smartest investments I made in all my 6 years in cryptospace. I did not see it as a risk at all. At $1mil market cap? What can go wrong? Most cryptocurrencies are worth more than $1mil market cap, and yet all of them have ""NO"" real world application for regular people that can use in their daily activities. Hell, I am switching from iPhone to Android. Plutus will contribute to mass adoption of cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, etc), it is the only platform I can think of that can reach out to an average Joe. It has real world application for both average Joe's and your fellow crypto Joe's. Disclosure: I participated in Plutus ICO, the MOST money I have pledged on ICO and an iPhone fanboy since the 1st iPhone.  [5:22]  Plutus ICO did not get much attention (ICO came out of nowhere, was not marketed enough, etc) thus over $1mil USD was collected. Per Plutus team, this ICO fund that was collected is enough to launch both Platform and PlutusDEX and beyond. They have had VC funding offers but turned them down, and will result to it if necessary but per Plutus team, it is not looking necessary at this moment. I believe in it's technology and will use the platform.  [5:23]  Another disclosure: My crypto portfolio is worth 6 figure USD (BTC, ETH, PLU, LISK).  ",False

The web interface is similar to a traditional exchange with the difference that you must specify your own payout address to receive Bitcoin or Pluton directly.  By placing the funds in escrow, traders guarantee that Plutus app users will have their (BTC/ETH/PLU) deposits requests filled immediately. And because the BTC is sent directly by the app user to the private Bitcoin address that you have provided for the trade, there is no need to store or escrow any Bitcoins on the platform itself for the trader. This means that Plutus operates entirely without holding any digital assets.  You can read more information on how the DEX works over here: https://medium.com/@PlutusIT/what-is-the-plutusdex-and-why-is-it-the-most-important-part-of-our-platform-b33ffae6f8c2#.knnxm0qt6",False

If your transaction has failed and unconfirmed on the blockchain then this is because sending ETH to this type of multi-sig wallet requires a fee of at least 85000 gas to be paid to the Ethereum network and its miners. We recommend you to restart your Ethereum wallet to have the funds returned to your account. The transaction amount hasn’t actually left your wallet and will be automatically released back by the network, and you will then be able to send the transaction again with a higher gas fee. We understand that this might be of an inconvenience to you especially if you participated during the early bonus phase. So therefore we are willing to work with you to resolve this to award the rightful bonus for early participation. You can simply resend the transaction with the same amount and email us the TX ID of the original failed transaction. The sender's address of the new transaction must match the details in the original failed transaction during the bonus stage. If you have questions about any of the above then please feel free to comment or join us in slack for a chat with the team and the growing community.

They are unique digital tokens with a real life use case.  There is only a small amount of Plutons available for initial distribution (rest is locked in a rebate smart contract), this helps the project and gives the crowdsale participants an opportunity to get Plutons to use on the app at 0 conversion fee.
