Now it becomes possible to make life much easier for drivers and much more efficient for fuel marketers around the globe.  WHITE PAPER (English) WHITE PAPER (Russian) WEBSITE  BOUNTY  The idea is to let any driver in any developed country fuel their car instantly without waiting in queues using their mobile device. The app will incorporate blockchain technology offering crypto payment among other traditional methods and will use wireless tricks of internet-of-things to create a perfect experience. Stations will now receive a most efficient channel for communicating with customers and also an analytic tool based on Big Data. It is important that the service will work worldwide to create a flawless long-distance travel for anyone.  VIDEO  A car will be automatically identified by the station via its driver’s phone GPS. Bluetooth will allow to automatically detect the adjacent fuel pump. Alternatively it can be chosen by scanning QR-code on it. Pre-ordering feature will allow timely purchase of snacks, merchandise or services before your arrival since the station will know when to expect you. This will make it possible to refuel and have your coffee / merchandise brought to you without you having to get out of your car.  The app will also have various payment methods (crypto, banking cards, Apple Pay, PayPal, etc.) linked to the app wallet. Motorists can be credited on the spot when short of funds. Proven customer will not have to wait for payment confirmation and drive on immediately after the pumping of fuel is completed.   FUELDApp – SOLUTIONS:  For drivers: 1.

An opportunity to eliminate queues and, as a result, reduce staff expenses due to automation and optimization of procedures. 4.   Boost in sales of merchandise and services thanks to pre-ordering app feature. 5.

It will offer financial benefits for those who use it over traditional payment means. 3.
