CTO Francisco Martin: Martin is the CTO at Subdream Studios and has worked as a game director at Virtual World Arcade. CSO Jaehyun Lee: Lee, the former CEO at Super Bee and Zen Software, is the current CEO at Hurbit, a cryptocurrency exchange. Advisors Koji Sakamoto: Sakamoto is the former managing director at Excite Japan, CEO at YJ America and a former corporate officer at Yahoo! Japan. He is currently the board director at TBM Co., Ltd. Partners VR Plus: The biggest VR arcade franchise in Korea will act as a distribution partner. Subdream Studios: A California-based game developer.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Yumerium.  Risks     Historically speaking, gaming platform ICOs do not have good ROI. (-1)     No to small marketing campaign so far, resulting in low community interest. (-2)  Growth Potential     Though gaming platform ICOs usually fail to meet expectations, they get a lot of interest from the crowd. (+1.5)     Aims to provide most of Steam‚Äôs and Kickstarter‚Äôs features with some additional ones. Allowing players to resell owned games is definitely a good move. (+2.5)     Allocating some tokens for Marketing Fund to incentivize developers to use Yumerium might create great interest in the project. (+1.5)     A good blockchain gaming platform is much needed. (+1)  Disposition Yumerium is essentially a gaming platform, sharing many features with Steam and Kickstarter. Although gaming platform ICOs historically do not do well, Yumerium still might attain serious attraction from both gamers and developers if they execute a great marketing campaign.

The platform runs on a native token called YUM, which can be earned by playing, sharing, and reviewing games. By supporting transactions made in YUM, Yumerium provides an easier and more efficient way for game developers and studios to create and market games. This allows them to more easily grow their active users and overall brand. Gamers also benefit from lower costs and the ability to earn while playing the games they love.  The world‚Äôs media and entertainment market is worth an estimated 1.7 trillion dollars. With consistent double-digit growth year on year for the past decade or so, this market is expected to hit a value of 2.2 trillion dollars over the next three years.  Gaming is an integral segment of the global entertainment market and it currently has a value of roughly 110 billion dollars. The world‚Äôs largest gaming regions are Asia Pacific and North America, and these two regions account for over 75 percent of global gaming revenues. Within general gaming, online gaming has seen particularly explosive growth, as can be inferred from the fact that digital gaming sales outperform physical game sales by a factor of 3. With a global gamer population of over one billion (with 70% of them playing online games), these statistics prove one thing: online gaming is, to put it very simply, a market with immeasurable potential....",False

Participants receive income, participate in lotteries for the distribution of ‚Äúlegendary stones‚Äù with special value. In future, each developer will be able to post their games on the Yumerium platform.  Each game will be initially placed with ‚Äúseeding funds‚Äù in the form of YUM currency, which developers can spend on marketing, in order to attract players to a new game. In the future, gamers will be able to earn (or ‚Äúget‚Äù) YUM tokens playing, inviting other players or posting reviews about the game.  YUM tokens will be accepted in all games on the Yumerium platform. The authors of the project expect that with the passage of time the number of games will increase significantly.
