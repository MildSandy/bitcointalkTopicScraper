It is an upgrade to their existing, award-winning software, used within Cosmetic Surgery and Medical Aesthetic businesses globally. This system uses blockchain technology and smart contracts to create a reward-based ecosystem. The software aims to connect, record, protect and reward patients and practitioners alike.  Sounds confusing, doesn’t it? Let me break it down for you.  The Cosmecoin ecosystem can be split into two parts: the practitioner software and the patient portal.  The practitioner software (Clinic OS) provides aesthetic businesses with a market-leading CRM system to help manage the day-to-day running of their clinic. Clinic OS provides a digitalised and comprehensive consultation process, including treatment specific forms, which ensures that all important data is recorded fully and securely. Detailed records allow for clinic audits to be carried out quickly and easily, saving time and money. Once the appropriate information is collected, it is encrypted and placed on a cloud-based database, which ensures the secure and trustworthy storage of data.  The patient portal (Cosmecoin) combines a whole hoard of services in one app. It will provide consumers with an extensive database of practitioners, clinics and treatments. This comes with unbiased, genuine patient feedback, allowing individuals to make informed decisions before treatments. The Cosmecoin blog will supply consumers with up-to-date industry news and educational articles.  Patients have the choice to log in to the app to get easy access to their own medical data. This includes their treatment history, photos, consent forms, and aftercare information. The system also allows personal data to be securely transmitted between clinics if a patient chooses to receive different treatments in different practices. Treatment bookings and payment can be easily carried out through the app.  These two sections of the ecosystem are combined together by the Cosmecoin reward-token (COSX). Like a supermarket loyalty point, COSX tokens are allocated to patients, for practitioner feedback and platform engagement, and practitioners, for best practice behaviours. Within the patient portal on the Cosmecoin app, consumers will be able to view a digital ‘wallet’. This will detail the number of COSX reward-tokens they have and their token transaction history.  COSX reward-tokens can be redeemed for discounts on further treatments booked through the Cosmecoin app. Alternatively, consumers can head over to the ‘Cosmecoin shop’ within the app and use tokens to purchase (or part-purchase) aesthetic products (e.g. skincare, etc.).  In short, the Cosmecoin app and accompanying Clinic OS software will work together to provide the Cosmetic Surgery and Medical Aesthetics industries will an all-in-one ecosystem. This will provide solutions to industry problems and revolutionise aesthetics forever.",False
