But I preffer a KYC. It's opens the way to exchanges and makes the crowdsale campaign more legitimate. And those who do not want or will not be able to pass KYC, they will create demand on the exchange.  As example, the korean ICON literally in a few days before ICO decided to require KYC and now they will require KYC after the crowdsale. This is the right decision.  About KYC and DOC.AI from recent letter:  Quote The CIVIC app makes the process more “investor friendly”. It will be possible to register with email address (without the Civic app) during pre-registration on September 25-26th. When the crowdsale starts on September 28th it will only be possible to register with the Civic app. Accordingly, if for some reason you are unable to use the Civic app (for example, you use Android version earlier than 6.0) please pre-register on September 25-26th in order to be able to participate.

We do not believe that these ideas put us outside of the law, certainly not in the USA.  But I will tell you what we do believe.  The biological profile of the near-future will be consumer-controlled, AI-powered and data-centric.  It will be algorithmic rather than symptomatic, bottom up rather than top down, consumer facing rather than doctor facing, quantitative rather than qualitative. It would be wrong to think that the Blockchain revolution that is now going on is only about technology, or storage, or about computing power or about consensus mechanisms.

I see how patient need to have own data. I see app can gather data from corporation/doctor. I think you have problem with big data storage and big data processing...but this problem you can fix in future.  I think big problem today is you try to replace doctor. This problem have 2 reasons:  Reason 1: Still legal problem. Machine learning algorithm all new. It make mistake and patient get hurt or die. Remember tesla car crash from machine learning failure. This 100% happen. Patient will die and doc.ai have lawsuit and maybe this hurt doc.ai future a lot. Be careful not to hurt patient with too big confidence in algorithm.  Reason 2: Doctor mainly control patient data today. If you say too much you try to replace doctor, doctor will not agree too much work with you. Like we agree, you only import data and you rely on corporation/doctor for data. Doc.ai need many many MANY partnership to gather data. You must be nice to doctor so they allow app to import data.  Solution: Work WITH doctor. Patient see doctor and get answer and then doc.ai see same data and give answer. Maybe 5 years doc.ai have time to learn and then it legal to replace doctor. But will not happen without doctor agreeing to share data. This why I tell you partner with MedCredits (MEDX). They doctors who can help you get data and teach algorithm to work and compare answers with real doctor. They want patient to have data and they help to connect patient to doctor/corporation to generate data. Now you tell me you have doctor on team...this not same thing. Doc.ai need agreement from 1000s doctor around world to give data. This what Medcredits can help you to do.  Healthcare very complicated. If you make war against doctors and no cooperate with doctors I think you have big problem to make doc.ai success. Good advice? ",False

I not expert in AI but understand problem like this: we have AI algorithms and algorithm need large data and large computing power to solve problem that human not find easily  I have many question  1) why can average person help with provide large data. average person maybe provide data like calories, walking, heart beat, maybe glucose test. But this very small data and not making many predictions from it. In Radius example - I think giving diary of seizures is not helpful data to cure epilepsy. I see we generate useless data. So I say Selfie2BMI app not very useful. Maybe just for fun but not make business money or help solve medical problem.  We still need private company/hospital/doctor to give data. Genomic test company or brain doctor for Radius. Even blood test like in ""robo-profile"" you need private lab to do test.  Robo-profile/robo-genomics/hematology it look like it take data and make prediction. Nice app but will need I think doctors and medical devices to help patients put data to app. Now you have problem to make partnership with blood lab in every countries, with EMRs in whole world, with genomic companies across world. Very hard to get all data to the patient in doc.ai app.  Summary: nice to say patient ""own data"", but I think really they ""buy data"". Patient cant make helpful data on own. Recommendation: look to Medcredits (MEDX) ICO. They making 100% decentralized platform for patient to make own data. Maybe you partner with MEDX and this solve problem #1.  2) large data storage and computing power: what your plan to store data? iphone not going to store 100TB genomic data. then, how AI algorithm use computing power of iphone. Iphone not strong. Maybe you must make partnership but technology not exist right now for decentralized computing. Golem still take 5-10 year to help doc.ai. Maybe you store data decentralized but so far no iphone app to do this.  3) Legal problems. Doc.ai very new and now making medical recommendation. If patient have heart attack because doc.ai get confused and change patient medications how this work? I think still many years before we have good laws to allow this. So far doc.ai maybe help doctor but medical decision must come from doctor. I think doc.ai have many problems today if it bypass doctor.  Summary: reason 2) + 3) why I say before that technology not work yet. I think doc.ai have good company but I no buy ICO because I think still 5-10 year for doc.ai to make me money  Recommendation: ICO maybe bad model for funding big complex project. Or maybe bad for small ICO investor like me  4) Neuron token. Who it incentivize? I not understand (maybe this part I am wrong and I need explanation) Patient - I see they pay money to do many tests and get data from private company (they do this now already if they want genomic test or blood test) then they sell data for neuron token? Doctor/research - they pay patient in neuron to get the data from patient? so doc.ai hurting research because now they lose money to patient?  Blockchain token important for consensus or trust payment. So what neuron token really do? No summary/recommendation - maybe explain to me more.",False

Approximately $10 million has been raised. Thank you for your support!        Join Us On Social Media TELEGRAM | BITCOINTALK | REDDIT      What is NEURON?  We are entering a world where artificial intelligence, natural language understanding and the tokenized economy have the potential to bring unmatched benefits to healthcare.  We have been working on converging these three in one infrastructure (NEURON) and one currency: the NRN (neuron).  We are using our doc.ai conversational AI-powered platform for on-demand, quantified biology. This advanced natural language dialog system was designed for vertical medical domains, and can generate and communicate insights on genomic and pharmacogenomic, exposomic and anatomical data as well as sensor-based wellness features and hematology.  With the help of this technology layer we are launching NEURON, a decentralized artificial intelligence platform which allows anyone to connect to the network and train their own AI, by pushing deep learning to edge devices (smartphones).  The Neuron (NRN) tokens give access to the AI network and reward the users (individuals or when the unite they become research organizations) who train their AI with tokens. With these tokens they can broadcast a competition on NEURON and create a bounty (prize) for data scientists. When these succeed in building a prediction model that provides unique insights into the proposed personal quantified biology profile, they win the prize.  The convergent collection of health data, the subsequent classification and the prediction models can be the first step to a documented preventive way of life where health is no longer a discrete but becomes a continuous function and the medical information chain shifts from a seller’s to a buyer’s market.
