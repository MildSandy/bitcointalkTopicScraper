The thing that has not been seen is the certainty that we cannot provide a benchmark. Like your post above, you are sure that this ICO will succeed. So far the sale of ICO tokens is still running, so we cannot confirm whether they are successful or not. We never know what will happen later and in the future.  Quote from: Tactical Genius on August 27, 2018, 03:36:55 AM I'm sitting half-way around the world and wishes to invest in this project,what is the guarantee that if i buy these tokens i will really have emeralds sitting somewhere in the world that are mine?

You use the tokens you have to redeem emeralds from the Marketplace.  The emeralds are priced in tokens.  You can check out the Marketplace here: https://market.gemera.io/  The project has established an alliance with major Colombian emerald producers who provided emeralds that are already certified and stored in Malca-Amit facilities in Hong Kong.
