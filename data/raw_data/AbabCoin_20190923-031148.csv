1,msg39236415,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2004423.0,,7753,Announcements (Altcoins),2018-06-02 20:07:58,SkyN,Newbie,6,0,,[PRE-ICO] Abab.io – Decentralised marketplace for accommodation rentals,"Dear AbabCoin (AAA) Token Holders!  Abab project.io faced certain limitations at the stage of implementation:  For successful implementation the platform that is a fundamental part of the project should provide high speed and minimum cost of transactions (or no costs). Abab.io Project, like other competing projects, was developed on the Ethereum platform, as the most progressive and allowing to build the necessary business architecture. However, if we consider Ethereum in its current state, it is clear that this blockchain does not meet the goals of the project: Maximum Ethereum capacity achieved in January, 2018 is of 1.3 mln transactions per day in total for the entire network and for all the projects based on the Ethereum platform (this capacity would not be enough for operation of a single marketplace that have transaction volumes comparable to booking.com); The cost of transactions at such a load was $ 3-5 per transaction. Each booking requires from 4 to 10 transactions, i.e. one booking could cost from $20 to $50 Two interrelated elements are necessary for the success of the project: high client traffic and large base of apartments and hotels. It is important for a traveler to have an access to a marketplace, where almost all the hotels of the world are presented in one place, so that he could quickly find suitable apartments or hotels in any part of the globe. Without a global base of hotels the marketplace is useless - no one will use the platform. Organic growth is not suitable for this case. A clear and feasible mechanism of ""explosive growth"" is needed. To resolve the issue, the Abab.io project resources was not enough, as such a project can only be successful with very high investments for the rapid development of the client traffic and hotel base. However, I did not give up and continued to look for ways to develop the Abab.io project. So I met a team of the Chalk Fund and Nomad.space project.  Now I have good news for you – the project goes ahead!  At the end of 2017 Abab.io was acquired by the Chalk Fund for the further development within a new Nomad.space project.  The Nomad.space project sets an ambitious and attractive goal - to create a global wide Blockchain platform on hotel online booking eliminating middleman commissions and covering 20% of the hospitality market that will double by 2030 exceeding $1 bln in volume and thus outperform major rival OTAs.  The NOMAD.project has the following features and strengths:  Lowest transaction cost No payments for servers. No commissions for miners, platform owners and currencies exchange;  Financial infrastructure Internal currency (NSP) and instruments to reduce volatility and increase liquidity via market maker smart-contract (MMSC);  Blockchain platform Deliberate choice of suitable blockchain platform from three testing platforms (Ethereum / EOS / Plazma);  Big client and hotel base Ensuring the flow of orders right after launching the project through focused M&A of aggregators and PMS;  Technical infrastructure Own blockchain-nodes installed by the hoteliers;  DAICO Token holders control how much funding the team has access to;  DAO of hoteliers The members of the network manage its development and solve internal issues of the touristic industry using a joint consolidated development budget from all of the participants;  Honest reviews Transparent system of ratings of hotels and rooms by real travelers in blockchain;  Non-staff hotel Rapid deployment of a non-staff hotel concept (IoT) that reduces hotel costs.  As of may 2018, the project team has signed two key strategic partnership agreements. One of the agreements is intended to ensure instant access to a large base of the hotel rooms (more than 120,000 rooms) via a PMS software developed by eZee Technosys Pvt. Ltd. The second agreement provides access to the hotel online booking traffic - a partnership with one of the metasearch engines. The second agreement provides access to the client traffic - a partnership with one of the metasearch engines. Another words the Nomad.space project from its very beginning has both an access to the hotel room inventory that can be quickly integrated into the blockchain platform and certain client traffic to start commercialization and growth of turnover.  More details on the project you can find at the website www.nomad.space.  One of the key conditions for the merger of the Abab.io project with the Nomad.space project is the conversion of AbabCoin (AAA) tokens into Nomad.space tokens (NSP) within the ICO at the rate of one to one in dollar equivalent.  Currently the Nomad. space project is preparing for pre-ICO. If the pre-ICO round is successful, the project will go for the ICO.  After the Nomad.space project is started AbabCoin Token Holders can exchange them for NSP tokens at the rate of one to one (since the starting cost of AAA and NSP tokens is the same – $0.10 (10 US cents) per token.  The Nomad.space project offers AAA Token Holders to participate in the NSP token ICO and jointly change the hospitality industry for the better!   Founder Abab.io Alexei Nebotov",False

Pre-sale date: July 13th 13:13:13 UTC Crowdsale date: August 15th. Project Summary Abab.io is a decentralized marketspace for accommodation rentals where a blockchain solves the issue of trust between the host and the guest. Our team implements on the blockchain a single database of guests and hosts comprising information about all the postings by the hosts, all the relationships between the guests with the hosts, and the system of booking and settlements between the guest, the host and the partner. Partners are third-party developers of services and interfaces for both hosts and guests. ABAB.DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization used for developing projects (primarily helping partners in the formation of their products) based on Abab.io technology. The main differences from the traditional solutions, for example, Airbnb, are the following: •   the interaction between the guest and the host based on a smart contract; •   an open technology for partners who, using the database of all hosts, can create the best offer for the guest (language/currency/site/mobile application/support service); •   access to the entire host database without the need to request from abab.io permissions and accesses, without worrying about any changes in the rules of the game or the dictatorship from the ""big brother"", and without the need to be burdened by legal interactions with thousands of counterparties. Always there are two main risks – the platform and counterparty in traditional alternatives.  It you’re a guest, something may go wrong with the platform and with the host, and it you’re a host – the same goes to platform and guest. We’ll remove the platform risk through DAO and decrease counterparty risk through smart-contracts.  Problems We Solve Guest issues Average accomodation rental agregators commission is about 9-35%. Terms of use are usually the same for all of the users of the system and you can't refuse using insurance or, maybe, phone support etc. You can’t change one booking system to another because it’s database and reputation system have no access for other market participants.  Small market participants issues If a company by itself wants to enter the rental market, it needs rather a huge amount of investment in real estate (to offer for rent) or to form a pool of hosts to earn commission from deals it provides to hosts (AirBnB business model). First option needs capital investments, second option needs a lot of time and marketing costs. Among “sharing” companies there’re a few leaders of the market who owns a big amount of data about guests and hosts. These databases are unavailable to use by third party developers because often it has no API. In case if there is an API third party developers become dependent from an owner. The owner dictates its terms and is able to change commission size and seize markets warmed by partners.  Benefits Guests: •   A huge database of the hosts’ offers; •   Price: the blockchain allows lowering the cost of transactions and simplify the interaction of many hosts, guests, and partners; •   Flexible channels of interaction provided by the network of partner services (websites, mobile applications, travel agencies); •   A variety of options for the service: different partners provide different levels of service; some provide telephone support, others leave the client alone with the website while reducing the price; some communicate in English only while others can provide support in Rachasap; •   Trust: the rules are written in the form of smart contracts and cannot be breached by either the host or the guest.
