Organizations and institution are able to outlive their creators when built on solid principles and mutual benefits.   I found this within cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The fundamental service they provide is a medium of consensus among disparate communities with monetary incentives.  However, while a lot of focus is being put on the technology, there is not enough focus on how this can empower the most disadvantaged communities and the economic systems that bind them. That is what the Digital Reserve is about. We are creating a sustainable system that mitigates discrimination in lending and provides a elective economic system. This is designed to be maximize the win-win scenario for those willing to join together in a common enterprise to empower themselves and others.  We are working on creating a sustainable decentralized financial institution that values financial inclusion.   This is a really ambitious project and it requires help from those who believe in the mission: the creation of an economic system that empowers people regardless of location.  The document I shared below is a technical outline of the system. If you want to read a high level business plan for operational details, please message me.

As the CEO of the Digital Reserve, I am focused on being part of the establishment of new financial institutions. Our team is developing a decentralized financial services network built around Denarii - a specialized cryptocurrency designed for the needs of everyday people. We have already started onboarding partners, including a United Nations Capital Development Fund sponsored credit union in Liberia. We are currently in the early stage investment phase as we continue to build the network and our client base.  We are excited about our continual progress. Check out our most recent Youtube video: Meet Luke which introduces the simplified process for borrowing we are introducing. https://imgur.com/a/qYWHX  We also have released a simplified primer to provide a lower barrier of entry and more direct introduction to the Digital Reserve Network's Denarii.  https://www.slideshare.net/JomariPeterson/the-digital-reserve-denarii-primer   Also, watch the Medium Blog for new details on network design, partnerships, operational reports and thought pieces.

The Company will use the proceeds of the offering to develop the first debt-based cryptocurrency network - the Digital Reserve Network (DRN). The DRN is a peer-to-peer payment system that relies on sustainable lending, collateral-free borrowing and a responsive monetary policy.  The DRN is the brainchild of seasoned blockchain entrepreneur Jomari Peterson who started the Company with Joshua Rittenberg a former V100 lawyer.  The mission is to build a system that could provide financial accessibility for the $2 Trillion dollars in unmet financing need, while creating an equitable playing field for disadvantaged and disenfranchised communities..  The proposed DRN design is informed by a few significant design principles: The establishment of a system where doing good is profitable A sustainable economically sound system Minimization of environmental impact through proof of stake Long term security through integration of Quantum Resistance Global Access The result is a peer-to-peer payment system that relies on sustainable lending, collateral free borrowing and a responsive monetary policy to stabilize value. https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3rPK-l_luo  I believe The mainstream consumer and individual is eager for a solution to better returns or financial accessibility, while currently trying a variety of risky and costly projects and solutions. We've designed the Digital Reserve Network to be easily accessible with an easy to understand interface with a focus on developing easy on-ramps and off-ramps. For the first time, users, lenders and borrowers alike can participate in an innovative solution that empowers them and each other. They can create a healthier economic system, develop layered solutions upon the platform and create a global community that is beneficial to everyone. After intense development and review, we can't wait to share with the global community and have them nurture this unique solution with us.  The Company will be leveraging the newly minted Token DPA to conduct its debt offering: ""The Token DPA is an innovative financial instrument developed by the team over at Republic Crypto. It's debt-based, just like our system and was designed to be far more investor friendly than the ubiquitous SAFT agreement,"" notes Joshua Rittenberg, my Co-founder.  The Digital Reserve, P.B C. Is conducting this debt offering, with principal plus 50% interest payable by Tokens (Denarii) in lieu of cash.  The launch of the Digital Reserve Network (DRN) will generate an initial supply of 6 Billion DRN Tokens, called Denarii. 300 Million Denarii will be allotted for purchasers of the Token DPA (Debt Payable by Asset). The offering of the Token DPA on July 23rd, is an alternative to the SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens), which offers limited to nil protections if the project is never completed  ""With the Digital Reserve Network, borrowers will be empowered to determine their own interest rates and repayment periods in the process of developing their financial literacy"" -CEO, Jomari Peterson  https://www.youtube.com/embed/jmbs6tRx_ag  The Token DPA is a debt instrument, which is in alignment with the network protocols. By lending money, the offering participants take priority in the case of bankruptcy or dissolution over equity and SAFT holders, in most cases. In addition, the loan gains interest. This allows early supporters to receive all the benefits of supporting the work with more downside protections.
