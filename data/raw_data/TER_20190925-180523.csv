At the same time, EcoStart’s marketplace provides traffic, it is responsible for the convenience of using the platform, provides communication tools, technical and marketing support, and payment functionality.  The platform is not just a tool that binds users. The main thing it does is #KYC, the principle of ""Know your customer."" After identifying the user, determining his risk profile and rating, the platform reports who has registered.  The marketplace we are thinking of is a one-stop solution with an open #API. It has several innovations. One of them is the “plug and play” principle, when responsibility is shared between our company, which creates the #platform, and developers, who will create applications on this platform in the form of user interaction interfaces. If the platform itself is a big capital expenditure, a hard decision, because it requires reliability, speed, and security, then the interfaces can be created by students, and small software companies and individual entrepreneurs.  For investors, Marketplace promotes efficient #investment and cooperation and provides: - Access to contacts of all project initiators - Service to create a cryptographic wallet - Access to detailed project information - Informing about new projects - Individual search and project selection - Verification of the reliability of the authors of the project - Getting a real project rating - Placing your investment proposal - Attendance of the presentation sessions organized by the #EcoStart platform  For initiators of environmental projects, Marketplace helps to pack your project, prepare the necessary documents for investors (Whitepaper, Pitch deck, One pager, Business Plan) and provides the ability to: - By placing your project on the platform - By creating your own project tokens and conducting #TGE - Individual investment search - The possibility of obtaining a loan or grant in an investment environmental fund - Create a cryptographic wallet - Obtaining an objective rating of the project - Selection of advisers - PR-promotion of projects in the media - Attracting volunteers  Volunteers can register on the Marketplace, which will allow them to find a worthy application of their forces anywhere in our planet. This is a unique experience, as applicants have the opportunity not only to immerse themselves in an unfamiliar culture, meet new people and learn how to work in a team, but also make a small step towards saving the nature.  To provide volunteers with incentives to do work that usually does not make money, but is crucial for the environment, we plan to create a single time bank, meaning that it records the work performed by the volunteer expressed in hours. Thanks to the use of #blockchain technology and the decentralization of those who get the opportunity to update the database, such a time bank will serve as an objective assessment of volunteers.

Although there is a whole industry of rating agencies, including investment banks that issue recommendations, audit companies that certify the truth of certain results or the reality of the work done, mistrust remains, both to specific borrowers and to expert gurus. In addition, the problem is exacerbated by negative PR activity: the publication of unverified ""experts"" in the media, fabricated fake news, and so on.  In our case, it is important to trust the initiators of ecological projects and #EcoStart experts, the reputation and the number of hours worked by volunteers (time bank).  Our goal is to build an independent objective rating of EcoStart users and become a bridge between environmental projects and investors, so that promising teams find a way to investors.  We propose the solution of this problem with the help of a quantitative reputation system for data collection and confidence ratings for initiators of ecological projects and experts based on #blockchain technology. All actions that are significant for their reputation will be recorded in the distributed register of the EcoStart platform and, in the long term, they can confirm the accumulated reputation and form a real rating of all participants.  Our team believes that the reputation system will not only help to collect investments for projects, but also optimizes business and other social processes. In short, the reasons for this optimization are as follows:   First, everyone will not only think about how much money to raise, but also about how to spend it effectively. Restoring your reputation is more difficult than earning;  Secondly, global access will allow everyone, even the smallest investor / participant, to evaluate a project of any complexity and thereby minimize risks and build forecasts through the ratio of three perfectly understandable criteria - subjective, temporary and quantitative. The interaction of the latter generates the most important thing - the quality of service;  Thirdly, the existing rating systems are mostly purchased, which means they are biased. The blockchain technology is in principle not about money (in its modern sense), and most importantly its quality is transparency and objectivity. The reputation system built on this technology generates trust and, accordingly, increases the level of business interaction.

Although aerospace monitoring on our platform does not lie on the blockage, we believe that the task of identifying, mapping, monitoring the storage sites for various types of waste is one of the most urgent in the field of ecological protection. Therefore, aerospace monitoring will be an application application platform EcoStart with automated and visual interpretation of different space images using selective aerial photography, field and statistical information.  Firstly, this is due to the serious negative impact of landfills on all components of the landscape due to physical, chemical, biological pollution, as well as deterioration of the quality of life of the population due to a sharp decline in the aesthetic value of natural complexes and an increase in man-made risks.  Secondly, space monitoring data from outer space are practically the only source of information, giving a complete, timely, operational picture of the problem of landfills and at the same time minimizing the financial, time and labor costs for solving this problem.  Space images are used for monitoring. The opto-electronic complexes installed on space vehicles allow to shoot ultra-high spatial resolution (0.7-1 m), the detail and geometric accuracy of which allows for confidently decoding dumps, measuring (linear dimensions, area), determining coordinates and types of dumps. With the help of space monitoring, you can identify a landfill with an area of 10 m2.  To clarify the coordinates of landfills, aerial photography from unmanned aerial vehicles (BPL) and field survey, which may be carried out by municipal authorities in the territory of which such landfills or ecological societies and activists are located, with subsequent correction of cartographic materials, will be used.  The recognition of objects in aerospace imagery will be automated with the construction of neural networks with a recognition method based on frequency representations. A promising method of intellectual interpretation of monitoring information is neural networks, which is related to the possibility of their learning, the choice of the topology of construction and minimizing the influence of ""noise"" in the structure of the multizone snapshot.  At the heart of the neural network, represented by a system of interconnected simple processors, the principle of the functioning of the human nervous system is laid. Neurons of a neural network are grouped into layers so that the output signal of the previous layer is fed to the inputs of all neurons of the subsequent layer.  The network is trained by introducing the original rasters (input channels), the source of the labels, the topology of the neural network, and the learning parameters into the program. Optimal is the use of ""learning with the teacher,"" in which the types of landscape-ecological systems are assigned areas of a space image with similar spectral characteristics. The result of the learning process is a trained neural network, which is stored in a file and used for subsequent classification of the satellite image.   The results of the interpretation of the images will be placed on the interactive geoportal map with the tools: • automatic generation of generalized statistical information on certain criteria (type of landfill, date of detection, category, territorial affiliation, etc.); • possibility of entering information (clarifying information on field data, as well as putting new objects on trusted users); • automatic generation of the object's passport (technical characteristics, location, ownership of the land plot is indicated and damage is calculated according to approved methods).  The geoportal map will be publicly available on the EcoStart platform website. Changes to the interactive map can only be made by the system administrator or trusted users. A separate topic is the identification of garbage ""islands"" in the world's oceans and the organization of actions to eliminate them with the appropriate collection of funds needed to finance this event. Financing of the functioning of aerospace monitoring will be carried out at the expense of the environmental fund. #EcoStart #ICO #environment #ecology #investment #cryptocurrentcy #tokenlase #TECO",False

Users will directly communicate with each other via a P2P connection. If there is no immediate connection, the messages will be written to the distributed data store (IPFS). This will ensure that all information is protected from interference.  To ensure confidentiality, the encryption algorithm MTProto, which was developed by the creators of Telegram, will be used.

Perhaps nature is not our mother, but our creditor, and under the law of commodity-money relations, she will demand to repay the debt. And the time for repayment of loans has already come. Intense forest fires indicate that Mother Nature is raging.  Significant cost savings on the environment led to the fact that the environment has become dangerous to our health. If we do not invest into environmental protection now, then, according to scientists, we are inevitably waiting for a global planetary collapse, which will simply force the inhabitants of the planet to throw all the funds at the restoration of nature or leave the planet and move, for example, to Mars. Will there be an opportunity for all of us to fly away?  The laws by which nature operates have always been, and only now people have practically realized the scale of the disaster, they are trying to do something to resurrect the almost lost, to correct the spoiled, to prevent the further destruction of nature. And only we, all together, must and can preserve our planet and build a safer world for our and future generations.  How much can we afford to invest into ecology? Particle ""eco"" in the word ""ecology"" in translation from ancient Greek means ""home"". How much money does it take to spend on building up your household? A good owner spends much more than 1-2% of the family budget to keep the house clean and beautiful. But if it comes to the fact that our home is the whole Earth, then we bring too little money into the care of our global home; we assign ourselves much more than we give in return.  How much should you invest in ecology? According to environmental experts, to stabilize the environmental situation at the current level, it is required to spend at least 3% of GDP, to improve it – at least 4% of GDP, for a radical change – at least 5% of GDP. Currently, investments in ecology make up only 1% of GDP.  Who will give money to improve the environment? Those who are always, that is, we are all together. One thing must be taken into account: money is dispersed among us unevenly and not everyone likes to share with the environment. As a result, money, as always, is not enough.  But now there is another source of assets – the Cryptocurrency. Our team is developing the startup Ecostart, which will make its modest contribution to the preservation of our planet using a fundraising platform and an ecological lottery. Part of the money from the lottery will be used to finance environmental projects. The main core of the EcoStart platform will be a new crypto currency – TerraEcocoin. Part of the commission from the transactions of this cryptocurrency will be transferred to the Investment Environmental Fund (IEF) for the subsequent financing of environmental (green) projects.
