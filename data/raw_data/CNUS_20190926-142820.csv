I've added an analysis of the coin to my book which is available here : https://leanpub.com/coinspectre_2018_12 - the book will contain information on 31 coins in total when it is done, but you can go ahead and buy it in its current state and you will receive free updates as it gets more complete. (you can also get a refund within 45 days if you don't like the book). In particular it would help if someone could go over the CNUS section and see if I got things right - let me know through the email on the above leanpub site on any changes that you'd like and i'd be happy to make them. (send the email to that site instead of replying to this thread, as I am unlikely to check back here, due to time constraints). thanks.",False
