We, the LanceChain Team, would like to express our gratitude to all of the community members who embraced our project. Herewith, we would like to announce the end of the first round of our bounty program. It was a huge success and stakes are being calculated, so we ask for a little bit of patience from all the participants. What is more important, we sincerely thank you for spreading the word about our project and supporting us faithfully within these 8 weeks. We saw great traction and fruitful cooperation being established between us and the community and cannot be more satisfied with it.  We want to use the opportunity to announce that there will be a second round of bounty program before our actual ICO starts. Dates will be announced together with the ICO sales rounds announcement which is due in the following weeks. The bounty will be managed by the same team and we can ensure the participants will be treated in the same supreme manner.  Why do we need two rounds?  We are delaying the ICO start date because of the current market crash and mutual insecurity. We, at LanceChain, believe crypto is the future and we are sure the market will be back to normal, but we follow the trends and see that it will take time. On top, we are actively working on our prototype, ensuring that investors will have a tangible MVP securing their funds. These is a crucial milestone for all of us and we will make sure we deliver a top class product.",False
