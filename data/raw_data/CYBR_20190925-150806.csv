CYBR is a holistic security solution that will endeavor to secure wallets, smart contract transactions and related activities that take place in the blockchain space.   https://i.imgur.com/zDyeG5N.png?1   BlindSpot is a proprietary software that powers a potentially borderless landscape of threat identification. BlindSpot not only detects, “bad actor,” associated illicit file activities and APTs, they are disrupted. The three primary tenets of risk management in relation to CTI and ensuring data are as follows:  1. Confidentiality 2. Integrity 3. Availability  BlindSpot captures attack signatures by deploying a combination of machine learning in concert with artificial intelligence. Whence identified, this information is distributed to the protected community via the blockchain. To augment the supporting data that runs concurrently with BlindSpot, one of the CYBR’s token initiatives is to reward community members for identifying suspicious activities.  The CYBR Web Portal serves as the CYBR Community User Interface (UI) for the Ecosystem solution. It offers a holistic solution that ensures the cyber security of smart contract associated transactions and its threat intelligence can be used to contribute to the security of the blockchain. There are numerous features and capabilities associated with the CYBR Web Portal.  At a high level, they include: Threat Intelligence Verification Token Sending/Receiving Capability Downloads Support Page  CYBR Wallet which incorporates a Token Name Service (“TNS”). The unique TNS feature resolves and reduces public addresses to common names. This provides users the ability to send tokens to known, vetted persons and entities without the concern of sending to incorrect or bogus addresses. The wallet also includes a facial recognition and biometric (fingerprint) capability, which allows smart contract transactions (send/receive) to occur without the need to enter the private key or the incorporation of a mask (e.g. Metamask). Private keys are NEVER compromised when executed in this fashion.  This capability is exclusive to the CYBR Ecosystem.   https://i.imgur.com/ir4l7iq.png?1   CYBR has existing, world-class partnerships in cyber security and blockchain. The company currently holds over $6M in task orders for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) DOMino program, a $1.115B Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract as a subcontract to Raytheon Corporation.  CYBR’s past and current clients/partners include but are not limited to: Partners Raytheon General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) Lockheed Martin Federal Systems (LMFS) Dell Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ManTech Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) UNICOM (formerly GTSI) DEI EdgeSource American Systems 21CT Paragon Channel Systems Trigent Solutions Stratford University Eastern Michigan University Western Kentucky University MKM Global Cognizant Campbell and Company (Abu Dhabi) Customers Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Department of Defense (DoD) Department of Transportation (DoT) Department of Energy (DoE) Department of Interior (DoI) Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) Internal Revenue Service (IRS) U.S. Mint Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Federal Reserve Board (FRB) Federal Reserve Bank (FRb) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Accenture DMR BioMerieux CareFirst Blue Cross and Blue Shield Stratford University Resultant to these relationships, CYBR is able to submit for grants and funding which are not insubstantial; often into the millions. Such funding would allow CYBR to create and update a word class cyber security solution that can transcend the blockchain and potentially disrupt the entire cyber security industry.   TOKEN SALE INFORMATION  Start Date: October 15, 2018 End Date: November 30, 2018  https://i.imgur.com/dPj0BCC.png?1  CYBR Tokens are designed to incentivize and provide functionality for the three-pronged CYBR solution. Subscription services and the provision of blockchain related services will be solely transacted utilizing CYBR Tokens. Rewards for CYBR Community members will be a determined allocation of CYBR Tokens. CYBR is a standard ERC20 smart contract-based token running on the Ethereum network and is implemented within the business logic set forth by the Company’s developers.
