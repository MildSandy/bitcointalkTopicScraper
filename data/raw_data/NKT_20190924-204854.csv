As you can see from the website and whitepaper, I have estimated a 50% of budget allocation on the graphics of the game. In fact, I will hire somebody to work on that for sure. Plus, as you can see from my LinkedIn profile, I have some first-hand experience about the video game industry and I know people who have already expressed interest in helping me out with the coding, but they do not want to be mentioned as members of the ICO. This is in fact a great opportunity for them to contribute to something without being ""guided"" by the market or by other authority.  I'm doing this for passion...I don't plan on becoming rich with this ICO. My ultimate goal is to create the game, and I'll definitely do all I can to bring it to life.  But, since ""I believe in Unicorns"", if this project goes well, I'll definitely develop the project further with DLCs and eventually with new video games! I really think that the industry is not putting enough energies in developing this genre of video games, that have a great potential. They prefer to do other stuffs. But think about how many people is using MAME to play arcade games from the eighties...they deserve the chance to play to those kind of games enriched by innovative concepts and developed with todays technology....without the need to pay 50$ to do that.

These last ones will get a 1% bonus (the bonus decreases 1% point every 5 donors). After that, all contributors will get NKT based on the exchange rate.

Note that Nuka Tokens are ERC20 and I have created them compliant to that standard just for this reason. Additionally, the price I set for the Nuka Tokens is very cheap (less than 0,01$) so their value can practically only increase.  I'm thinking of selling redeem codes for DLC contents in exchange of a fixed amount of Nuka Tokens. This way, one who get the tokens at early stage will have a bonus number of tokens that will gain value, especially if the game will be successful. For example, one could sell Nuka Tokens to somebody willing to buy a DLC.",False

I have also worked to some video games but I was not mentioned in the credits as my contribution was not as relevant as I wanted. But that was surely a valuable experience. Indeed, I had the chance to have a glance of how video games are designed and how the necessary tasks are planned in advance. For what concerns your absolutely right curiosity, I will publish some artworks hoping that they will give you an idea of the final result.",False

The tokens could also be used to buy DLC contents such as, new gears, characters, and maybe levels (that depends on how much contents I'll be able to create, and the ICO result).  On top of that, those type of games are missing a lot from todays video game landscape.

Meaning the value dropped to nothing. Additionally, the cost to list on exchanges varies from 25k to near 1m, which is a high percentage of what you are asking for development fees.  Are you saying the DLC you are developing will require the purchase of Nuka tokens and vice versa?",False
