MetaMask Security  One of Bloom's advisors, Brandon Arvanaghi, put together a great website to illustrate possible attack vectors against MetaMask, a very popular Ethereum wallet client. While enhancing the Bloom dApp user experience is very important for us, so is ensuring that our users know how to keep themselves safe. We highly encourage you to read the Medium post to gain an understanding of the different attack vectors available, and explore the interactive site to learn more about how the attacks look in practice.  Medium post EthWalletSecurity.com  3. SpringRole partnership!  The quick version of this partnership is that BloomID users will be able to use SpringRole to attest (verify) their past employment! It will be one way to help validate that you are who you say you are, in addition to verifying your phone number, government-issued ID, and all the other ways the Phase 2 launch will allow you to build up your BloomID and BloomScore.

Why lowering the hard cap when they are raising money so quickly and they will probably reach the hard cap without lowering it. Bloom already raised almost half of hard cap in 4 days of main sale and there are 26 days left! Their big advantage is that the team is from the USA and Bloom is accepting American investors.

I remember those freecreditreport.com commercials were insanely popular for a while lol.  We're working with a number of lending partners. https://blog.hellobloom.io/tagged/partnership These lenders already have streams of borrowers. In addition to this, we're going to invest a portion of our funds in go-to-market, this is described here. https://blog.hellobloom.io/how-bloom-will-use-funds-6c0c9eb4b738  > Will you support decentralized identity such as uPort or Civic? ie, how will this work with my governmental identity?  I don't think our attestation marketplace rules out the possibility of something like Civic or uPort hooking into our system and providing their services in a way that fits into the Bloom protocol as well. Owning the identity layer means it can mesh more tightly with other design considerations of the protocol. For example, right now the design includes providing your birthday, encrypting it, and attaching it to your BloomID. The Bloom protocol then uses this as a simple check when doing an peer stake (is John's birthday actually January 1, 1990?) and we can also require it be provided during an attestation that includes date of birth using the birth you provided on signup.  So while Civic and uPort could probably be mixed into our system without much pain, I don't think it would make sense to say ""the identity layer is handled by X protocol we don't own"" because identity is a broad concept.  > I don't think they have a bounty program here on the forum since they are focussing on different reward program like referral/contributors being rewarded.  This is right.  Thanks guys!",False

We will be integrating Fundary’s loans into the Bloom ecosystem, enabling borrowers to access new lines of credit.    Founded in 2016, Fundary is peer to peer lending platform that hopes to bring financial inclusion to the underbanked, allowing all people fair access to credit. They support the mission of leveraging core technologies, like blockchain, to eliminate banking inefficiencies.  We very much support their vision of addressing the underbanked, who have little to no access to institutional credit. They hope to build an ecosystem that allows the world’s population - regardless of their socio-economic status - access to financial services without inefficient costs.  Fundary’s Move to a Better Solution  In Mexico, Fundary found that the back-end costs of accessing an individual’s credit score contributed to high interest rates. Existing credit scoring services charge a fixed fee per credit check, regardless of the length of the applicant’s credit history. They shared that this data is so incomplete for applicants that microloan companies need to make 15-20 credit checks to get one approved loan. For microloans, this was prohibitively costly as most loans were for $200 or less.     They were not happy to settle with charging exorbitantly high interests on micro-loans, which prompted them to turn to other avenues for solutions such as smart contracts and blockchain. They introduce two mechanisms. The first, the Fundary Ambassador is a key actor in originating and insuring loans for borrowers without a credit history, allowing for exponential growth in adoption. The second is the Fundary ecosystem which helps train all actors to receive, spend and invest in their stablecoin, Samas.    Fundary and Bloom  Bloom doesn’t lend funds directly. Rather, Bloom creates a global protocol that brings together lenders, borrowers, identity providers, and data vendors, providing a core infrastructure for global credit. This vision would not be possible without key lenders joining the Bloom ecosystem, which is why partnerships with supportive lenders like Fundary are important.  On Bloom, lenders work directly with borrowers. There are no middlemen. Fees are reduced and clear, with transparent terms that are presented upfront. Bloom introduces new methods for federating identities and assessing risk with BloomID, BloomIQ, and BloomScore. This means borrowers and lenders have enhanced opportunity to align, dramatically increasing the speed of accessing credit and reducing friction.  Fundary shares the Bloom mission and is a clear solution for the many individuals struggling to build credit. We are honored to integrate Fundary’s loans into the Bloom ecosystem and excited about the prospects of this partnership.

This includes key advisors, lenders, partners building on Bloom, bounties, and community incentives.  No new BLT tokens will be created after the crowdsale?—?the total supply will be fixed.    Two days prior to the fundraiser we will announce the BLT fundraiser address       About the Bloom Protocol    The Bloom protocol is a new standard for global credit.  Built on Ethereum and IPFS, Bloom brings credit to the modern age with an end-to-end protocol for identity attestation, risk assessment and credit scoring.  Bloom is not a lender, but a platform.  Bloom offers solutions to cross-border credit scoring and identity fraud while at the same time expanding credit globally to 3 billion new individuals and improving scoring methodology for all 7 billion people.    How BLT Works    Bloom is a global credit and identity ecosystem.  The token provides an added layer of security to the network by mitigating fraudulent identity creation. Additionally, the token ensures the network remains free of influence from states, banks, and central actors. This is achieved by gradually turning over control elements to BLT token holders. Lastly, the token serves as a payment and settlement mechanism for the network.    To recap, Bloom’s token, also known as BLT, is useful in the following ways:  Security While the network is in its infancy without a wide array of attesters, it is more susceptible to attack. In order to increase the immediate resilience of the network, users will be required to put up a small amount of BLT as collateral for users who they invite. This collateral serves as protection against a mass-scale network of malicious accounts.  Scoring Proposals Our token is ultimately the voting mechanism for the BloomScore. Token-based voting allows us to root out bad actors and keep the system stable and provide influence to those who are contributing most to the network. This is also the primary mechanism of defining future changes to the BloomScore.  Payment Our token serves as a network currency for verifying identity and assessing creditworthiness with independent vendors.    Roadmap & Timeline     The Bloom Protocol will be developed in 5 major phases.   Bloom Invitation System & Voting  Phase 1 will allow for users to use BLT to invite their friends and colleagues to seed the initial network securely. Users with BLT will be able to vote on early development-related proposals for the future of the network.   Bloom Identity Matching  Phase 2 will deploy an application allowing users to verify their identity and get matched with their BloomID. During this phase, users will be able to confirm identity information and connect data for BloomIQ.   Credit Staking  Peer to Peer staking modules will be built first, followed by organizational staking.   Creditworthiness Assessment  Phase 4 will allow users to check their score, as well as open up a developer ecosystem to lenders to check a given user's BloomScore, providing sufficient privileges are granted from the loan recipient.   Bloom Credit Protocol Launch + BloomCard  Once the risk assessment and scoring protocol is complete, Bloom will launch the BloomCard. The BloomCard will serve as a brand new way for individuals to display creditworthiness and improve their BloomScore.
