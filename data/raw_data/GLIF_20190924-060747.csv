What are we doing?  Global ICO Fund is an investment fund that specializes in ICOs and blockchain. This is a fantastic investment opportunity for anyone who wants exposure to crypto while spreading their risks through a fund. In contrast to many other ICOs, Global ICO Fund has a very low management fee of 1.5% annually and an impressive 98.5% token allocation. The token launch is February 1st and everyone is invited to contribute.  Global ICO Fund wants to position themselves as a modern day patron; on the one hand seeking out reliable, resourceful and promising ICOs, while at the same time acting as an intermediary for those interested parties who have the innovative sense, but not the individual expertise, to enter this challenging yet promising new cryptocurrency market. Together with a strong team Global ICO Fund will spearhead an operation that defines business success in terms of a collaborative, co-creational and commercially viable effort.  In addition to the investments in ICOs, the fund also plans to keep some exposure to cryptocurrencies. The fund distribution has been preliminarily set with the following percentages: 60% on ICOs, 20% on cryptocurrencies, 13% reserved for alternative blockchain investments, and 7% saved in cash reserves.  By applying the expertise of the fund, together with the input of the token holders, Global ICO Fund will locate and furthermore advise the most promising companies in the blockchain sphere. The fund will be a way to expose oneself to the world of ICOs and cryptocurrencies, of which we have just seen the beginning.

So, the Global ICO Fund is not your average ICO. We don’t offer bonuses, airdrops or affiliate sign ups. We don’t spend millions on marketing to build up hype. We are not reaching for $100M in 10 days. This means that we don’t attract the average investor. Then who do we attract?  Our investors understand that blockchain is a long term play. They are not looking for the next coin to go “to the moon” tomorrow just to hope to be one of the lucky few who manage to sell before it all comes crumbling down again. They buy with the intent of holding on the their investment. If they did not believe we could make the money grow over time they would not have invested in the first place.  Our investors understand that all kind of bonuses attracts short term investors. “Bonus hunters” that will sell their holdings the minute the token hits the market just to make a profit equal to the early bird bonus. The profit from a token should not come from the late investors pockets but from the company building turnover, user base and a strong brand.  Our investors understand that it’s impossible to make money if fees are too high. They realise that in the world of crypto everything, they are not getting back from their investment, is a fee. Even if this is yearly and just a one time like - token distribution. Our investors would never invest in a company giving themselves too much token distribution because that will hurt their investment and will hurt the decentralisation of the asset.  Our investors understand that diversification is the key to low volatility and risk. Since the cryptoworld is moving 20%+ certain days they want something to lower the risk. Assets that have a very low covariance to the biggest coins.  Our investors realise that it’s easy to develop a bias in the world of cryto. Something that makes it hard to make the right decision at the right time. They see the Global ICO Fund as a team that has been around for a long time and know how to avoid these mental traps.  We at the Global ICO Fund are glad to have you all on board. We see you investors as our extended team and together we will make the future bright.",False
