It was announced in bounty conditions   AFTER BOUNTY CAMPAIGN  Ingrida Willems DESICO Community Manager: Dear participants of DESICO bounty,  As you all know DESICO was aiming to carry out an ICO followed by all its components, including Bounty campaigns. The crypto markets in 2018 clearly showed that ICOs have failed their mission. The ICO process is full of fake identities and scamming. The biggest majority of utility tokens never bring profit to investors after the listing. Companies used ICOs as a fund-raising mechanism, not because their tokenomics needed a utility token. That’s why most of the utility tokens issued are below their initial capitalization.  Anticipating the situation of fake promises in ICO model, DESICO made a decision to switch from ICO to Security token offering (STO). STO is a strictly regulated offering that provides investors with ability to invest in tokenized securities. Investors need to pass KYC and AML procedures along with provision of proof of their identity, residence address as well as indication of their income source. Current regulation across the globe does not provide possibility to issue and/or distribute security tokens if they were not paid for.  DESICO decided to be fair to people who participated in its bounty campaigns by admitting the failure of ICO process. DESI token is a security token. Therefore, DESI security tokens cannot and will be not distributed to bounty participants. We will also not issue and distribute utility tokens that will have no value in the market.  We are grateful to each of you who took part in campaigns and spread  the message about benefits of security tokens. We express our sincere apologies to all participants. We believe that the efforts that all of you and DESICO put into spreading the word will still contribute positively to stabilization of overall crypto market.  DESICO team",True

The crypto markets in 2018 clearly showed that ICOs have failed their mission. The ICO process is full of fake identities and scamming. The biggest majority of utility tokens never bring profit to investors after the listing. Companies used ICOs as a fund-raising mechanism, not because their tokenomics needed a utility token. That’s why most of the utility tokens issued are below their initial capitalization.  Anticipating the situation of fake promises in ICO model, DESICO made a decision to switch from ICO to Security token offering (STO). STO is a strictly regulated offering that provides investors with ability to invest in tokenized securities. Investors need to pass KYC and AML procedures along with provision of proof of their identity, residence address as well as indication of their income source. Current regulation across the globe does not provide possibility to issue and/or distribute security tokens if they were not paid for.  DESICO decided to be fair to people who participated in its bounty campaigns by admitting the failure of ICO process. DESI token is a security token. Therefore, DESI security tokens cannot and will be not distributed to bounty participants. We will also not issue and distribute utility tokens that will have no value in the market.  We are grateful to each of you who took part in campaigns and spread  the message about benefits of security tokens. We express our sincere apologies to all participants. We believe that the efforts that all of you and DESICO put into spreading the word will still contribute positively to stabilization of overall crypto market.  DESICO team  It is high time will reject injustice from all team manipulating bounty hunters   Link to above post on the forum https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5092272.new#new",True

It could be me, but if I understand correctly, your assuming that in 5 years they may buy back your tokens for what you paid? I think that could be the problem. What they are saying is that they reserve the right to buy back the tokens from token holders (only those willing to sell as you own them) at the current value at that time, plus 12.5% per year, plus the 3 year audited revenue. So you could have a token you buy today for 1 Euro that down the road is worth 10.72 Euros each! So more than a 10x increase in value per token. That to me says it is a great investment and a wonderful asset. In no scenario are they saying they will buy them back at today's prices. They just cannot predict the future growth so they do not know exactly what they will be worth. But, they expect the value to increase along with revenue and the 12.5% revenue  sharing. It's similar to a stock buyback from a company, plus they are going to add to its value above and beyond what it is worth that day. You can't lose!",True

Every single ico has crashed on listing. Some of them deserve it, but some good projects have also been affected and may never recover. From my quick read of the article, it makes sense to get all the licences in order, so that by the time the crowd sale starts, they will have not only the MVP but also the legal requirements will be taken care of. A three month ico sale may seem long, but if the market turns around and all legal things are fulfilled, I can see the tokens selling out pretty fast. All the same, shame that they feel they had to push things back. It will be five months now before this thing is trading. Seems like forever in crypto, but it's nothing in reality.",True
