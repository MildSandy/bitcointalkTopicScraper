But I think it might be quite clear that the decrease in price does not relate to the project itself. Most people bought the project for some profits and with the market sentiment right now. It doesn´t seem like it is changing soon. Therefore it is a long term hold but still could be wise to sell in the short term. But that is something every investor hast to decide.

And is good that the TRAXIA Team responded in a very clever way read their pinned massage on the telegram:    "" Hi everyone, again another day where price manipulators decided to put their bots to work. I would like to REMIND that the only two exchanges that TRAXIA agreed to be listed on are KUCOIN and GATECOIN. All the others have listed us without consent. Not surprisingly, the volumes and price movements on those non-official exchanges (hotbit, IDAX, OCX, etc) are shady and I would guess wash trades are happening.  About the question: What is Traxia team doing about this?  1) we asked Hotbit, for example, to delist us. They refused. 2) we hired a ""market making"" company to improve liquidity on Kucoin and Gatecoin. What they do is place buy & sell orders with very close spreads to avoid price volatility and make it more difficult for someone to manipulate the price. This is completely legal and also exists in the regulated stock market.  Note, we can not control the TMT price as  exchanges can ""say"" trades are happening. We can only assure you that there is nothing wrong with the project, the team, the legal framework, etc.  I recommend those of you who don't know what is going on to read this article:  ""  https://steemit.com/traxia/@coolershade/why-it-is-stupid-to-sell-tmt-at-usd0-026-usd",False

You are comparing oranges with apples so of course, the math doesn't add up. The whitepaper mentions that we are going to issue 1 billion TMT (1,000,000,000). We will sell 400,000,000 TMT during the first phase (started 25th February and will end 2nd June 2018), 200,000,000 TMT on a second phase (that will only happen if necessary and never before 2021).  During the first phase, we have 4 rounds. Each round has a maximum amount of tokens available (max 220 mill, max 180 mill, max 180, max 180 mill). So you can't sum them because it is cumulative.  UNSOLD TOKENS WILL BE BURNED.  Traxia is not a copycat of Populous. They both try to solve the liquidity problem for SMEs but Populous uses a P2P solution selling securities to average Joe, Traxia only works with institutional investors as the liquidity providers. Populus sets the price by themselves, Traxia let the market find the right price i.e. investors bid on an auction system. Populus focus on invoices, Traxia envisions multiple trade finance products in its platform, etc...  We have not been investing in paid ads, paid ICO listings, Youtube Ads, etc. We are working on partnerships to grow the channels organically mainly in China, Korea and Japan. We are also going to launch our beta version at the end of March, have more use cases. Only then, we will invest in paid ads and sponsored content to make more noise while we have community and many use cases to support our claim.  You can either wait to see all this out there and enter in Traxia at 0.15 USD  OR buy now with -40% discount at $0.09. It is your choice.",False

Page 22 says ""tokens will be distributed 30%, 30% (presale, sale), and 5%, 5% it’s for the investors, and bounty program."" 2. Table on Page 23:     2.1 Percentages here for first and second token sales is 40-20, as opposed to 30-30. What will be sold on each round?     2.2 Will unsold TMT for second round also be burned, or only those from first sale? 3. Page 24 - the Total Discounts during Pre-sale and Sale shows TMT amount for sale in pre-sale, and the 3 weeks of sales to follows. By summing all the TMT’s for sale listed in table, it looks there’s total 760.000.000 for sale – again, inconsistent with the previous numbers; is it either 70%, 60%, or 76% of total TMT amounts (1bil) available for sale?   To all other forum members:  I looked at the contributions sent so far for the ETH and ADA addresses. 6,276,219.13 TMT have been distributed for ETH contributions, and 323,258.00 for ADA contributions (total 6.599,477.13 times 0.09$/TMT =  $593.952.9417 raised).  What are the chances to even raise $5mil based on the progress so far? I do believe in this project, even though it's a Popoulus copycat - I think there's room for both since none of them have market dominance and both are still under development, and are targeting different geographies. Should this raise concerns on the team's ability to raise decent amount of funds, to proceed with their planned roadmap? How does this compares to other ICOs, that are now successful, fund raise progress?  Thanks, sand90",False
