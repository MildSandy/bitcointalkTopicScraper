A platform where you won’t be bombarded by ads. Where you’re in control of your own data. Where transactions take days, not months. A platform that pays you to participate.  Rex Token Sale  Hello REX Community! We are pleased to announce that the REX contribution period will kick off on Monday, July 31st at 4:00pm UTC. Read More   Demo   Features Include   The 4 Phase Approach   Token utility: REX tokens achieve the following:  Listing Rewards (Incentive/Scaling): In order to scale the database, we require an independent token to payout listing rewards and redistribute fee's.  Data exchange, advertising: Users can exchange data (ie selling inspection reports), charge third party advertisers to market on their page (they own the page and data).  Transactions: REX token plays an integral role in escrow and settlement services.  Spam/Comparable Property Feeds: Users have the ability to create their own spam/comparable property feeds and accrue a following. If the user gains a large enough following, they can monetize their feed through promotion and advertising. We’re crowdsourcing good local data and the contributors get paid.    Broker Profiles/Market Sponsorships: Users pay REX to create professional profiles and sponsor local markets (ie New York City). REX collected through Broker Profiles/Market Sponsorships will be redistributed into the listing rewards contract.  Visual coming soon  Join the Global Real Estate Revolution  REX is disrupting the property industry, in the same way Netflix, Amazon and Uber have irreversibly transformed their respective markets.

You mention that tokens are used by individuals who want to list, and provided to ""verified users"". What determines the magnitude of token payouts? What constitutes a verified user in this process - the entire user pool? 2. What measures are taken to confirm that said listings are genuine? This seems initially like a decentralized method of enforcement, but unsure how well this will work at the very early stages. 3. Are there specific real estate MLS markets that you are looking to target initially? Consideration obviously has to be made re. legal barriers, existing supply/demand dynamics of said marketplaces, etc. 4. You mentioned the barriers to tokenized ownership especially in most US/Western markets. Building on above, what markets have you identified that might be more amenable to tokenized ownership / ""colored coins"" models?  Thanks in advance. Regardless, at least something different.",False

We’re finalizing but amount but it will be around 15 REX per listing. Token payouts are distributed through the Listing Rewards contract. At launch, 20% of the total supply will sit in this contract. The contract will be supplied by fee’s collected from users that participate in certain platform features (REX professional profile, market sponsorships, etc.) The funds are redistributed to incentivize listee’s and continue to populate the platform.  2.Each listing has a 2 week payout period. When the user submits the listing it’s posted right away however the listing reward is delayed two weeks. The listing is sent to a verification page where other local users in that market can view/flag the property as spam. If the listing is flagged, the listing enters an arbitration period. We’ll have the listees and the flaggers account name. In the beginning, we’ll make the determination if the listing is indeed spam. If it’s not, the listee gets the reward and the flagger’s credibility rating drops. If it is spam, the flagger receives the reward and listed credibility rating drops.  3. Independent listees can list (it’s their data) anywhere in the world. Locally, in the US and Australia were structuring partnerships.  4. Tokenized ownership is complicated but we’re making progress on feasibility in the US and AUS. By the time we hit that stage, we will have proved transactions work and are sustainable on REX. We’re building the software tools where major firms can use the REX foundation as a boilerplate and engage in transactions themselves. We will start with a small use case like a 10,000/SF office lease. Once proven, we intend to promote third party firms/developers to build on top of the REX engine.",False
