Only the name and involved companies are enough to have more confidence in investing in this project.  Volume is steady low and there is nothing special in Hdac so far.  Is there any product? Is Hdac already implemented somewhere? What is the use case for Hdac? Why people should buy it? What for they need it?  I don't see any value in Hdac coin if there is no real use for this in real life.,False

Hdac Technology is a tech company under blockchain project 'Hdac'. Hdac is a hybrid blockchain platform integrating public and private blockchains and is designed as enterprise architecture to process diverse needs in the industry.  Hdac Technology announced its plan to complete the development of SDK and API in the first quarter to build an enterprise solution developing environment and the framework. Specifically, Hdac will use the DevOps approach to enable fast and easy development, establishment, test, and distribution of Hdac-based blockchain infrastructure.  CTO Moon-Ok Cho said, ""We aim to help companies to establish and operate their own blockchain-based services with ease by providing BaaS(Blockchain-as-a-Service) solution. We are currently reviewing cooperation with a world-renowned cloud service provider to provide top quality enterprise blockchain services and to acquire a competitive edge in the global market.""  ""Hdac Enterprise Blockchain Solution can be applied to various fields including construction, real estate, manufacturing, finance, and retail. We have completed two PoC(Proof-of-Concept) projects so far besides HERIOT, a blockchain-IoT converged smart home solution that we have already launched, and expect to win more than four actual projects during the first half of the year,"" he explained.  Hdac Technology's FinTech business is driven under the initiative of HYUNDAI PAY, aiming to provide convenient daily cryptocurrency payment services. HYUNDAI PAY is a Korean corporation that has Hdac Technology CEO Michael Yoon and CTO Moon-Ok Cho as the CEO and the CSO respectively.  The core of the FinTech business is Prepaid Point Payment Service. With the service, customers can purchase prepaid e-money called 'H Point'(tentative) with 'Hdac Coin' and use it for transfer, electronic payment at online/offline franchise stores, QR-code payment at retail stores, and utility bill payment on smart home service. CTO Moon-Ok Cho's further plan is to evolve 'H Point' into a stablecoin in the future.  Real Estate P2P Service carefully selects investment-worthy real assets and provides investors with profits. In particular, it aims to provide a blockchain-based P2P platform that links with the Prepaid Point Service, enabling convenient real asset management and reinvestment to various forms of assets. It plans to expand the service into a total P2P Finance Service by broadening the spectrum of assets to cryptocurrency and more.  In regards to the public blockchain sector, the development of Bridge Node that connects Hdac MainNet and a DApp partner's mainnet has been completed. It will be released by the end of March at earliest, after internal integration test and verification.

Moreover, our own cryptocurrency, Hdac coin, has drawn keen attention in the global cryptocurrency market after being listed on Bithumb, one of the top global exchange.  As we are approaching the time for Hdac to internationally show off the genuine value of its technology, we applied for PCT international patent for ‘Cryptographic Communication Method and System Between Devices Using Blockchain System (PCT-KR2019–002065),’ with which we can protect our patent right in 152 different countries. Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)  Not like the ordinary ‘1 Country 1 Patent’ rule, which makes the business to get patents in every individual country that is in business territory, Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) helps business to get patent priority protected internationally; the application of PCT international patent allows Hdac to get this benefit in 152 countries including the U.S. and Europe.    As unnecessary processes for the patent application can be omitted, we can react to global issues promptly and settle into the global market more rapidly.  Hdac Technology to the Global Leader in the Era of 4th Industry Revolution  The ‘Cryptographic Communication Method and System Between Devices Using Blockchain System’ is a technology to help IoT based Hdac platform to be applied in Smart Home. This technology allows us to enjoy a smarter life through the connection between IoT devices. This technology is about cryptographic communication method and system between devices within an authorized group, based on the system’s stability. On the blockchain systems currently, one could only share information that is opened; on the other hand, this technology allows encrypted P2P communication available on a blockchain system. Because the blockchain systems currently are formed in an open network, every connected device can access to information throughout the blockchain; therefore confidentiality between specific devices cannot be secured, and the integrity of transaction cannot be guaranteed when using SSL(Secure Socket Layer). With our new patent-applied technology, these problems are expected to be solved. When applied to a Smart Home environment, a certain family and their home can be set as a blockchain group — and their personal devices like smartphone, the built-in wall pad, and other IoT devices in the home are registered as constituents of the group. Then, the family member can control other IoT devices via blockchain based authentification with superior security, while others not registered to the group cannot control the devices.    Recently, the security and reliability issues of Smart Home system are being raised more often. The Blockchain based Smart Home system of Hdac Technology is expected to be the clear and definite solution.",False

Greetings everyone!   Today, I would like to introduce you to Hyundai Digital Asset Currency (HDAC), also known as “Hyundai Coin,” which has been quite controversial yet not without great potential. HDAC has been issued by Hdac Technology, located in Zug, Switzerland, and was founded by Dae-Sun Chung,the 3rd generation of the Hyundai dynasty in Korea1. Hyundai BS&C set up Hdac Technology under its provisions, and Hyundai Pay aids in the commercialization of HDAC by developing subsidiary technology and preparing infrastructure as its partnering company.   HDAC aims to solve the security of internet of things (IoT), allow machine to machine (M2M) data transfers and HDAC transactions, and ultimately act as payment currency in the pay industry3. Currently, it is mined via the ePoW algorithm, an analogue of the PoW made more equitable and eco-friendly, uses SkunkHash, and plans to switch to a new hybrid algorithm that uses both ePoW and either PoS and dPoS (date undecided as of now).   The past year, HDAC had been under a lot of fire,but exceptional changes have taken place in October 2018, and HDAC has become a“hot cryptocurrency” in Korea after its listing in GDAC exchange5. The reasons behind why HDAC is garnering more attention and is regarded to have great potential in the future are delineated in the following seven points:   1. First reason. HDAC cryptocurrency has been issued to be 100% commercialized as a utility coin that also intends to be used as a payment coin. It will be put into practical use in Heriot Apartment,located in Samsong, Goyang City in Korea, which is under construction by Hyundai BS&C. Last June, President Dae-Sun Chung of Hyundai BS&C announced that HDAC’s platform will be applied in “front door sensor,electricity, water, gas, and other IoT devices” in Heriot Apartment6. In the same interview, he explained that HDAC will act as a currency by which payment bills can be made, showing that Hdac Technology will also continually produce profit through such business models. For further information, Heriot Apartment is displayed in the official website7 of HDAC and the blueprint of HDAC8.    The following photos from Naver Map show theHeriot Apartment complex under construction:      2. Second reason. Hdac Technology received “NoAction Letter,” the highest level of clearance, from the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) of Switzerland on October 22, 201810.Such recognition corresponds to the FDA approval status in the cryptocurrency world, demonstrating that HDAC has credibility and backing authority11. With the approval from FINMA, HDAC stands on top of many other cryptocurrencies, and will especially shine when SEC or other governmental institutions begin to majorly regulate cryptocurrencies. HDAC received thefinal approval after a long due process extending eight long months, and the approval that HDAC, with its own main net, received is clearly superior to those of the ERC20-based tokens based in Switzerland, allowing them to merely begin their projects12. The administrator of Hdac Technology explained as follows:     The following is a photo of the “No Action Letter” that Hdac Technology AG has received from FINMA:    3. Third reason. Hdac has recently announced that it will radically reduce both the block rewards and the total supply13. Such measures will resolve the hyperinflation due to excessive mining rewards,let Hdac stand out even amidst the reduced cryptocurrency market cap, and meet the requests the Hdac community has hitherto been proposing. Hdac’s block rewards will be reduced 90%, from 5,000 per block to 500 per block, and the total supply will be reduced 76.25%, from 12 billion to 2.85 billion14. As a result, the relative value of HDAC has increased 5-10 fold, and its potential to increase in value in the future has also greatly improved.    4. Fourth reason. As much as the founder of Hdac Technology is Dae-Sun Chung, the 3rd generation of the Hyundai dynasty, Hdac has been continually making contact with the big Hyundaic orporations, whose owners are his direct families and relatives. In other words, HDAC has great potential to be adopted by the Hyundai dynasty as their main cryptocurrency. In a recent interview by Michael Yun, the general manager of the Hdac Technology AG Korea Office, he revealed that Hdac has indeed been talking to the big Hyundai corporations regarding partnership in the blockchain realm15. A recent news article stated as follows16:   “Michael Yun, the general manager of Hdac Technology, in his interview with Newsis on November 30, 2018 in the Hdac Technology office located in Jung-gu, Seoul, proclaimed that Hdac Technology had been ‘undergoing PoC with three big Hyundai corporations.’  Yun did not mention the specific names of the Hyundai corporations, but he was confident in that Hdac will show the world an epitome of commercialized blockchain technology in the first quarter of 2019.”  In addition, one of the investors who went toHdac’s meet-up once stated that he heard “Hdac Technology is preparing partnership with Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Asan Medical Center, and Kumkang Coryo Chemicals (KCC)17.” Furthermore, Hdac’s blueprint also displays “Smart Ship in Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI)” and “Smart Factory in Mando18.”A related article states, “Hdac is using IoT sensors in enterprise solution systems to tract supplies and resources on the Hdac blockchain and is PoC testings mart factories that utilize blockchain-based electronic contract solution systems that span from contracts and warehousing to settlement of payments and receipt issuance19.”    5. Fifth reason. Hdac Technology has recently scouted a globally renowned star Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) through Korn Ferry20,the world-famed professional recruiting company listed in NYSE. The CMO willsoon be announced21, and the upcoming marketing movements will be noteworthy. Hdac Technology also promised the community that it will implement aggressive marketing strategies22 after the final FINMA approval,and the future looks bright23.    6. Sixth reason. Hdac Technology announced thatit is accelerating its fintech business by promoting payment solutions using HDAC transaction services. According to recent news media, “in order to expand and commercialize its own HDAC blockchain platform, Hdac Technology is targeting the 120 million dollar industry of prepaid point market, and is also focusing on account settlement within smart homes, franchise store point markets, real estate P2P services, and other cryptocurrency-based fintech markets24.”Insofar as HDAC has been recognized by FINMA as a “utility coin that directs toward payment services,” much attention is given to Hdac for its hopeful future in fintech and the payment businesses.  7. Seventh reason. Numerous ICO projects that have underwent crowdfunding with Ethereum (ETH) have been inflicted with devastating losses due to the recent collapse of ETH value, causing their projects to face major financial problems. However, Hdac was the cryptocurrency with the number one highest crowdfund in the year 2017, and it collected Bitcoin (BTC), whose price declined relatively less than the others major cryptocurrencies, and also led to the free acquisition of BCH, BSV, BTG, and BCD via hardforks25. Just in the recent two months, ETCDEV, the major developer of Ethereum Classic (ETC), proclaimed that it cease all its developments and public activities because of lack of funds26; Steemit announced that it will layoff 70% of its employees due to financial crisis27; and Consensys also laid off 13% of its employees because of the financial burden caused by the collapse of ETH price28. An expert in the field exclaimed as follows29:   “Many crypto start-ups expected the crypto market cap to recover by the end of 2018 and did not sell most of their ETH. However, as the market cap hit new lows and the price of ETH did not recover, they are now facing a critical financial crisis… Some even have bought more ETH in the hopes that the price of ETH will recover soon. One manager of an ICO project said, ‘Because of the financial crisis, our project is also considering laying off team members,’ and a personnel of another project appealed, ‘Our project cannot continue and provide promised services unless we receive another massive investment because we sold none of our collected ETH when the price was much higher.’’  As shown by the above report, many cryptocurrency enterprises current face bankruptcy. Start-ups that crowdfunded using ETH especially suffered great losses because the value of ETH ended up less than 1/20th of that in the beginning of this year. If these start-ups run out of their collected ETH, they may have to sell (or dump) the developers’ or the team’s share of their tokens, but since the price of their tokens have also collapsed after hitting exchanges, this may not be an option, and will especially be frowned upon by the investors and hodlers.   Crypto start-ups may have excellent developers, but without funds, projects cannot proceed in this competitive market under the realm of capitalism. Ultimately, those projects with ample funding or financial backing will persist and attract the developers from other projects.In fact, just this month, a member of Ethereum Classic developer team joined Tron30. Therefore, it is critical that investors be more sensitive to the financial state of crypto projects in the current bearish market.   Fortunately, Hdac Technology collected the highest fund in the year 2017 and is backed by Hyundai BS&C and Dae-Sun Chung, the 3rd generation of the Hyundai dynasty. As mentioned earlier, Hdac also raised its funds with BTC, which had less losses and also brought about free BCH, BSV, BTG, and BCD. In the long run, especially in this bearish market, HDAC has a great potential to shine and succeed.   Although a lot of controversies brewed behind Hdac, if one analyzes deeply, he or she will indeed acknowledge that Hdac has great potential and deserves consideration in cryptocurrency investment portfolios. Moreover, HDAC has not been introduced into top exchanges yet, so its value reserves much capacity to increase even in the short term.   So is HDAC worth investing? The final decision rests on you, but with the consideration of the aforementioned seven reasons, HDAC seems much closer to the bullish side than the bearish side.   Merry Christmas and Happy New Years to everyone,and happy HODLing!

Among all of those contents, the IoT contract prototype for the smart factory is attracting everyone's attention!  For those who can't participate in the Hackathon, let's check out the clip. https://youtu.be/N0eEoEGEz-4  This is the PoC (Proof of concept) prototype of smart factory that introduces Hdac blockchain-based IoT contract. You might be curious about what is the advantage of driving all these devices through blockchain. The main concept of this prototype is that instead of a centralized control system, each unit of the process makes their own decision spontaneously to complete the whole process.  In other words, there is a smart contract in each step.  What we can see through this prototype is that units in every step make the decision locally and communicate with each other to reach agreements. That means we can make use of this concept to figure out and overcome the disadvantages of the centralized control system, which is also the main purpose of this prototype. Manufacturing units can be operated in an optimized way locally and all task indications can be offered by corresponding token value of Hdac, thus achieve the process optimization.  We believe this will bring you a whole new idea about the smart factory PoC, doesn’t it?",False

I guess he is referring to the rumors which were spread a few weeks ago regarding the private pool of Hdac. In that case, Hdac announced, there's nothing to do with them. ① Private Mining Pool It seems that some of the TGE participants were hacked by a private mining pool that impersonated Hdac.

The only 'private mining pool' would be a pool run by the developers or their marketing team, anything else would be a 'public mining pool' and utilised for the good of decentralisation.  basically, the marketing and development of this coin is all 'arse-about-tit' if they had wanted it to be centralised, they should have kept it closed-source, but no, the whining about 'private pools' and 'unofficial' miners is a total smoke-screen.  yes, HDAC have fuck-all to do with public mining of the coin, we get that, but that is far from the explanations that the community are asking for.  Basically, it's advertised as a IoT, when the base of the wallet and the blockchain are not IoT, they are (and I will admit - very good code) but based on bitcoin core and not really anything very new or technologically advanced.  Here's my take on it:  HDAC need a blockchain to power their products and the coin is just a by-product. IMHO The public mining of it should be supported, not shunned by the marketing team and the developers should embrace this community and encourage the growth of their blockchain in a decentralised manner.  regardless, the 'this is not an official stance' has become boring and tedious and as far as mining is concerned, i've moved on to other projects because of this.  good luck keeping that blockchain powered when all the public miners decide that they too are fed up of the bs.",False

Clearly there is not a great experience in crypto here.I've been involved since 2009 and to be quite honest, eithere the developers, or the marketing team have make huge mistakes here.  The ICO was sensible at 14% and the investment was huge. Huge enough to afford a prime-time television advert. The initiative is great, the product looks fabulous and it looks like it could be a market leader.  here's my concern:  it's time the marketing team and the developers started looking after the miners of the blockchain and stop with the 'that's not official' statements, because at the end of the day, the blockchain does not exist without miners keeping it running.

And most likely the distribution is delayed by the HDAC team itself, not by the bounty managers.  It is very sad that the price of the coin has already sunk by almost 50%, from the beginning of the auction.

Not paid tokens should be divided among all other participants of bounty campaign which are eligible for payout. Nobody will say that they don't pay or give only a few days of time to change addresses because the team wanted to steal our tokens.  If the bounty is delayed so long then there is hard to talk about such fast additional checkup requirements. People provided their BTC wallets long time ago and few of them could forget about this bounty because of this all delays. Not their fault that now this changed into another form of confirmation.  Crypto world is a very fast living place, one week in the crypto is a month in real life. Bounty hunters waited for so long that they moved forward and some of them come back here every two weeks or even month to check their bounty. I have done this by myself in different bounty campaign which was postponed for 6 months. There will be a lot of hunters too late with their claim before the end date. Just my 2 satoshis.",False

(1) Mining  ① Private Mining Pool It seems that some of the TGE participants were hacked by a private mining pool that impersonated Hdac. Please note that our mining pool is a decentralized network, so Hdac Technology has no legal liability.  ② Hdac Technology Self-Mining We have not operated any mining pools since the MainNet launch. This is in accordance with Swiss law and FINMA. Hdac Technology does not operate any mining pools and will not operate any mining pools in the future.  ③ Mining Equipment for Sale We have never been involved in manufacturing or selling any mining equipment and do not plan on it in the future.    (2) Transaction-related entry (P2P, Listing)  ① P2P Our platform is designed based on the universal standards of P2P transactions. We have also built the Hdac Platform in accordance with the Swiss regulation authorities in the case that utility tokens evolve into payment tokens. Therefore, we do not intervene with any personal transactions and those kind of transactions are irrelevant to Hdac Technology.  ② Listing We do not review the DAC listings under the management of our company and we are not involved in listing by third parties. Trading and transaction fees from large-scale or multilateral exchanges have no relation to Hdac Technology.       (3) Betanet Testing  We have received a lot of positive feedback from users who mined on the Betanet. As we stated in the past, mined tokens on Betanet may not be used for actual use and we have decided to burn them.  - burnaddress: HJXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXVarS5i - With the cooperation from Betanet participants, the DAC that was mined from Betanet testing will be collected and burned. - In order to retrieve the remaining DAC, we will take any necessary measures. - We awarded Betanet test participants with DAC for electricity and equipment costs. - We will soon notify you on our progress.   (4) Founder’s Reward  The Founder’s Reward has been processed in accordance with local laws in Switzerland, including the review of the Swiss Legal Advisor and the approval of the Hdac Technology AG Board of Directors. In the cryptocurrency system, it is a trend to reward 10-20% (5-year spread at 8% for Hdac) to the early team members of the cryptocurrency.    However, Hdac Technology AG has decided not to give out the Founder’s Reward. (burnaddress: HJXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXVarS5i) For the past two years, our researchers and developers have worked extremely hard to create a competitive blockchain platform. We will continue to strive to develop the best blockchain solutions. In addition, we are in the process of being assessed under the FINMA guidelines. It is an extremely rigorous process and we are very proud to have come this far. The liquidity of DAC will lead to active mining which will then lead to a platform-based ecosystem. All of this will enrich the value of Hdac.   (5) Official Communication Channel  We noticed that users discussed Hdac on unofficial communities before the MainNet launch. With that, we have agreed that it is imperative for us to discuss and communicate with users about the roadmap and evolution of Hdac Technology.    (6) Wallet Information and Security Authentication  Hdac does not keep any personal information on file. DAC can be lost from leaking personal information. Please be sure to read the following points carefully to avoid any financial losses or risk being hacked.  A. Store your wordlist in a safe place. If your wordlist is exposed, you risk disclosing your account information.  (1) Make sure you are the only person who knows your wordlist. (2) Don’t save your wordlist on your computer or smartphone. (3) Do not take a picture of your wordlist. (4) Keep your wordlist in a safe place where there is no Internet access.  B. PIN management is important. C. Download an antivirus software on your computer and smartphone to protect yourself against hackers.    (7) Additional AMLA Procedure for TGE Participants  As have announced several times, we are still waiting for TGE participants to complete the additional AMLA procedure. We need all TGE participants to turn in the documents so we may be able to continue the AMLA(KYC) confirmation procedures. Currently, only 59% of participants have completed the process. We will continue to contact the participants who have yet to complete the process. In a short amount of time, we have done rigorous testing in preparation for the MainNet launch, to provide a complete and stable network for users. We will continue to research and develop more solutions. We have been striving to enhance the value of Hdac and establishing credibility by joining an SRO and receiving FINMA and VQF certifications. Hdac has taken its first step in this industry with the MainNet launch. As a growing eco-partner, Hdac will continue to work towards becoming an IoT-based blockchain platform that may apply to various industries. Finally, Hdac Technology AG will ensure quality assurance as we continue to work on the solutions from the Hdac Platform roadmap. We are very grateful to the supporters who have been with us from the beginning. We will continue to work hard and develop a blockchain solution that will be available for diverse industries.    Thank you, Hdac Technology AG",False

I am not so sure. You know why?  Because of the difference between pre-sale token prices and main token sale prices. Not only but this will be the main reason, there is also huge inflation rate and IOTA competition.  In other words; when the pre-sale token price is much cheaper than the main token sale, token prices usually fall after the ICO. We all know that presale bonus was 1000% and BTC price changed from 1000$ at the start of ICO to 11.000$ in the end. If you participated in the ICO, you paid around 15x the USD price paid by initial investors.  This will play out in one of two ways:  1. Token Prices Begin At $0.50/DAC On Exchanges  Pre-sale investors will see the ridiculously good returns they’ve achieved and immediately cash out. Token prices will then crash to well below the main ICO price  2. Token Prices Begin Well Below $0.50/DAC On Exchanges  Result: Token sale investors have already lost out. On top of this, the team has confirmed (via Telegram) that there is no lockup period for any of the early investors so there will be nothing in place to stop this from occurring either.  source http://cryptogurus.com/reviews/hdac-review/",False

KYC will be closed on January 15, 2018 at 22:00 (GMT/UTC+1) as announced before. Please proceed before the deadline since KYC will not be operational afterwards. Australia, Taiwan, and India will be added on the KYC list from January 9, 2018. The Hdac team tried everything to list other countries as well, but it was impossible to meet the deadline. We deeply express our apologies to many participants who were unable to participate in the Hdac TGE due to KYC. Therefore, we would proceed with full refund for those who could not participate due to their countries not being listed.  Hdac is planning to proceed with refund by January for those who could not complete KYC, could not proceed due to countries not listed, and transferred less than 0.1 BTC (the minimum amount).  Hdac will cover all transaction fees for refunds as trust and protecting rights of participants comes first.  We will make an official announcement on the refund procedure separately.  [Announcement on the long waiting time for KYC]  Currently, there is a long waiting time of 45~60 minutes when proceeding with step 4 (identification) of the KYC. There seems to be a delay and congestion due to numerous attempts by many participants. Hdac team is continuously communicating with IDnow (KYC company) and requesting development of the procedure.  Therefore, depending on the situation, it may take an hour due to long delays. Hanging up while waiting would result in “aborted” and you will need to proceed KYC certification again.  Again, we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused, and please complete the KYC certification within the deadline.  Thank you.  The Hdac Team  ※ All TGE participants must complete the KYC certification to complete the TGE participation. ※ If the KYC status is displayed ‘aborted’ in ‘My info’, please try KYC process again.

But the problems not star untill some guy on Telegram found out that their term say that it non-refunable if you fail the kyc and the team start using words like refund will be clarified or individually refund that make people worried a lot if they refund or not. Untill now there are no offical anoucment or fix of conditions about refund. One more think at first they promissed to fix kyc before dec22 then january 5 and now january 15. people don' trust them any more. because of this people want to refund because the team can't promised that they could fix kyc and btc is crashing so people not only want refund but also refund imediately before btc truly fail.,False

I understand your concerns. I'm sorry but I can't elaborate on your blocking from the Hdac channel since I'm not sure what happened. Regarding the KYC process, you need to understand except your case, there are others that do wish to participate and contribute to this project. For them, this is critical to have an extension to the process that increases their chances to pass it successfully (due to some technical issues). Because of the extension of the KYC process, Hdac team can't inquire the refund requests of the participants until the KYC process is complete. The team is aware of the fact that participants willing to be refunded and they want to use their money for other purposes. Hdac announced that the refund process will not be delayed after January 2018. In addition, According to the TGE terms, There are no refunds. That is exactly why the team has to inquire any refund request, and as I wrote above the team can conduct this process only after the KYC will be over. I'm sorry for your experience, I hope my answer addressed your concerns properly. And of course, I hope you will receive your money back soon.",False

I would like to both congratulate and thank you for the support during this TGE.  I've copied the Thank You message from the Hdac team below. It's a bit long, but worth the read.   Hdac has successfully completed its TGE on December 22nd. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all contributors in the world.  Both the presale and the TGE have successfully finished with a total fund of $ 258 million (About 15,200 BTC). Compared to the TGE (ICO) of all other cryptocurrencies, Hdac TGE has raised a staggering fund ranking the third highest in the world. Receiving such outstanding support from the global community, the Hdac team will be even more committed to accomplish milestones with integrity and responsibility.  During the TGE, the value of global cryptocurrencies skyrocketed, placing considerable difficulty on the TGE. Many investors reckoned direct trading superior to participating in the TGE, resulting in a downsize of the global TGE market as a whole. Nevertheless, considering that promising cryptocurrency platforms that raised $10-30 million were regarded as successful, we are confident in announcing that Hdac TGE has been successful, which raised a tremendous fund of $20 million.  In fact, the primary goal of Hdac TGE was to promote our blockchain-based IoT platform around the world and establish a touchstone for future IoT infrastructure rather than to secure funds. But, we sincerely apologize to the all TGE participants that during the Hdac TGE, since we have more focused on technical part, pre-marketing and TGE guidance has not been smoothly progressed.  Anyway, we take pride in our presales that sold out to the last token, and we have recently premiered to the global stage by proceeding with the last procedure, TGE, in accordance with international law norms.  From March 2017, the Hdac team has held technical seminars and attended road shows all around the world: Korea, Japan, China, and Thailand in spring and summer; London and Zurich in July; Johannesburg in September; Dubai and Gibraltar in October; and finally Paris, Slovenia, Romania, and KINTEX Seoul in November and December.  Hdac has developed a blockchain-based IoT platform specialized for the IoT environment, a feat which garnered a lot of attention and interest from both the cryptocurrency community and the IT industry. We have also worked with excellent advisors such as Mike Costache (Co-founder & managing partner at KrowdMentor), Eddy Travia (CEO & co-founder of Coinsilium), and Stuart Corby (founder of Authentag and Origin Tracker) to make Hdac known to the world and produce breakthroughs.  The Hdac team has also endeavored to interact with contributors and cryptocurrency communities by the means of various SNS channels: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Telegram, and Medium. For a month, we received more than 10,000 likes and about 5 million impressions in Facebook, and more than 3.5 million views, 25,000 visitors, and 3,000 followers in Twitter. In addition, more than 10,000 members are currently in the official Hdac messenger chat groups. We are sincerely grateful of people all over the world for their unyielding support of Hdac.  Below are the summary of Hdac crowdsales: - Presale (1st~ 3rd / March~ July, 2017): $238 million (About 14,000 BTC/ Dec.21 Current value) - TGE (November 27 ~ December 22, 2017): $20 million (About 1,200 BTC) · More detailed information on TGE contribution will be made on January 15, 2018  After the TGE participants finish their KYC formalities, Hdac will receive evaluation from multiple exchanges. With the termination of the TGE, the Hdac team will focus on listing and main-net development, so that Hdac can be traded conveniently in Korean and overseas exchanges starting from February or March 2018 (in the first-half of 2018, at the latest).  We also aim to globalize Hdac so that it stands out in the blockchain industry. Hdac will finally realize a practical IoT platform in the near future, not only as a means of transaction, but also as a modality which people can easily access in everyday life. With this goal in mind, the Hdac team will do its best to form partnerships and alliances with related companies.  The upcoming year of 2018 will be a year in which Hdac will leap forward. We would like you to stay tuned to Hdac which will actualize practical application and utilization. We are always grateful for your support of Hdac.  Thank you  The Hdac team",False

Their next generation platform is the world’s first IoT contract and payment protocol where devices are authenticatied, mapped and verified through the blockchain and can talk to each other and make or clear payments autonomously. Soon Everything that can be connected by adding internet access will expand the internet of things drastically to almost every device you can think of in the near future.  So Hdac runs on its own hybrid blockchain. This means that it can go from public, to private, back to public again. The hidden and private network has “safe tunnelling” between a user and their devices to combat hacks, privacy invasion and external attacks. Mutual authentication between devices is crucial to maintain a reliable private blockchain.. which to be practical in the real world needs to also interact with the public blockchain. The permissioned nature of the private blockchain means it cannot be accessed by nodes as freely as a public, however Hdac has created a Bridge Node which acts as an intermediary containing key configuration information to link the two.  Hdac’s blockchain does not use proof of work or proof of stake, but a new method called ePoW, or e proof of work, which eliminates the power inefficiencies and mining monopolies occurring in Bitcoin right now. Through a block window concept they can overcome common limitations in a more fair, distributed and decentralized network with the same level of security.""",False

Regarding the presales, Here is Hdac official announcement:  Official release of the Hdac Presale information.  We understand that there were certain issues regarding questions about the presale information and we thank you for your patience. We have had long discussions regarding this matter and came up with some conclusions:  We will disclose only the total amount and the exchange (discount) rates for the rounds during the presale. (Specific details, for example amount per round etc. will be fully disclosed after the TGE with the amount raised through the TGE).  Total amount raised during the presale is about 14,000 BTC  A brief background on the presale: The Hdac Digital Transformation Community (DTC) officially began on March, 2017. Unlike other Alt coins, which partly improves the functions, we started off the development by targeting the Mainnet in the IoT area. Currently, the key functions of the IoT Contract, Payment, ePoW etc. are being developed in the corresponding order.  From April 2017, in order to meet the value of the technical implementation for Hdac, we began our first and a limited presale at a rate, 1 BTC : 35,000 DAC. Afterwards, we proceeded by correspondingly modifying the exchange rate as the following: in May, 1 BTC : 32,000 DAC and in July, 1 BTC : 28,000 DAC. Changes in the exchange rate with time, has been adopted due to the increase in the level of technical implementation for Hdac.  Currently, we are in a position where we can provide the Mainnet Hdac token since the Hdac token development is completed. Regarding this value, we decided to come up with the rate, 1 BTC : 18,000 DAC. Unlike what the presale participants have received as an exchange proof of Hdac, TGE participants will receive the officially released Hdac Token. Also, since the TGE was postponed due to KYC & AML issues, we are planning an event (TBA on November 27) for the participants where they will receive an extra 4,000 DAC per 1 BTC (meaning, if you buy for 1 BTC, you will receive 22,000 DAC in total: 18,000 + 4,000, that is, 25% bonus). There is also a Lucky Draw Event which is currently ongoing (11/10 ~ 11/24).  It has been 8 months after the presale and the crypto world has rapidly changed which had many external effects. However, Hdac is continuously developing and working to not only function as a currency which is simply traded on the exchange, but also to become the world’s best IoT Contract & Payment Blockchain.  Thank you.  The Hdac Team   The target amount for the TGE is 6,000 BTC. Hdac will announce once the goal is reached.

We were recommended by PST, our lawfirm, that Germany's KYC company, Intrum (www.intrum.ch), is suitable for KYC and therefore we are proceeding KYC with Intrum.  Regarding all the current problems caused during the KYC process, the Hdac team and Intrum are cooperating to solve the problems. We will do everything to solve the problem as soon as possible.  For now, below are some notices on the KYC policy: 1. We have already announced about the KYC period which is due December 22. However, we will be extending the KYC period so that everyone who have invested can complete their KYC process successfully. 2. The KYC procedure operates for 200 people per day (average 10 people per hour).  Also, we have noticed that most of Asian countries are not on the list when proceeding with KYC. We are currently discussing regarding this matter and will make an announcement once we come up with a conclusion.  Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience caused during the KYC. We hope for your deep understanding and patience.  Thank you.  The Hdac Team.  *For further issues or inquiries about KYC, please contact us on: support@hdac.io with your Name/email/Ident ID/the problem.",False

Until then we shall wait for further details regarding this.      Hdac Private Blockchain [HdacT], a blockchain based smart transaction method on the Hdac platform, is designed to perform a given task under the various commanding conditions in the IoT environment. HdacT provides these M2M transaction functions and a simple transaction service environment, and with the rationality and efficiency that the Hdac platform pursues, it will be the platform of choice for use and control with IoT devices. In addition, Hdac will evolve into a hybrid blockchain platform by providing a hardware wallet for user security and transaction convenience in service of the aforementioned communication and transactions between IoT devices.",False

User-defined tokens can be assigned attributes to pay only for specific purposes in an IoT contract, and can prevent the user from being diverted to unwanted devices or uses. This plays a big role in providing transparency of using tokens while maintaining the security described above. For example, when parents transfer tokens to a minor, they may not want the child to buy alcohol or tobacco from a vending machine where the token is available. Tokens can carry attributes that prevent the purchase of particular goods such as alcohol or cigarettes sold via IoT devices, like vending machines, and therefore give parents more control over how the money they give their children will be spent.""",False

Here is the official statement regarding the pre-sale from Hdac: ---------------------------------------------------------- We understand that there were certain issues regarding questions about the presale information and we thank you for your patience. We have had long discussions regarding this matter and came up with some conclusions:  We will disclose only the total amount and the exchange (discount) rates for the rounds during the presale. (Specific details, for example amount per round etc. will be fully disclosed after the TGE with the amount raised through the TGE).  Total amount raised during the presale is about 14,000 BTC  A brief background on the presale: The Hdac Digital Transformation Community (DTC) officially began on March, 2017. Unlike other Alt coins, which partly improves the functions, we started off the development by targeting the Mainnet in the IoT area. Currently, the key functions of the IoT Contract, Payment, ePoW etc. are being developed in the corresponding order.  From April 2017, in order to meet the value of the technical implementation for Hdac, we began our first and a limited presale at a rate, 1 BTC : 35,000 DAC. Afterwards, we proceeded by correspondingly modifying the exchange rate as the following: in May, 1 BTC : 32,000 DAC and in July, 1 BTC : 28,000 DAC. Changes in the exchange rate with time, has been adopted due to the increase in the level of technical implementation for Hdac.  Currently, we are in a position where we can provide the Mainnet Hdac token since the Hdac token development is completed. Regarding this value, we decided to come up with the rate, 1 BTC : 18,000 DAC. Unlike what the presale participants have received as an exchange proof of Hdac, TGE participants will receive the officially released Hdac Token. Also, since the TGE was postponed due to KYC & AML issues, we are planning an event (TBA on November 27) for the participants where they will receive an extra 4,000 DAC per 1 BTC (meaning, if you buy for 1 BTC, you will receive 22,000 DAC in total: 18,000 + 4,000, that is, 25% bonus). There is also a Lucky Draw Event which is currently ongoing (11/10 ~ 11/24).  It has been 8 months after the presale and the crypto world has rapidly changed which had many external effects. However, Hdac is continuously developing and working to not only function as a currency which is simply traded on the exchange, but also to become the world’s best IoT Contract & Payment Blockchain.  Thank you.  The Hdac Team ----------------------------------------------------------  If Hdac fails to reach the target which is 6,000BTC, until the designated date Dec.22, the Hdac TGE will end as it is. and there won't be any additional token distribution such as 2nd TGE.",False

Quote from: bobq on November 19, 2017, 09:53:19 AM Which are the similarities and the differences of this project compared to Iota, which also aims to become the main vehicle of payments of the upcoming Internet Of Things?  Hi bobq. If i got it right, it seems that the main difference between Hdac and Iota is in the transactions validation method.  In Hdac every user can create is own private blockchain. In an environment such as a smart home or factory, various devices equipped with sensors, which are closely interconnected using a private blockchain, can be configured to operate more safely and reliably in accordance with each other’s conditions. A private blockchain is configured to perform not only user authentication but also mutual authentication between devices, generating and securely recording operation details and scenario-based IoT contracts. On the other hand, Iota is dealing with tokens and they choose another way to validate transactions. Which mean their technology is different and so is the solution they wish to provide to their clients. There are some similarities between the two project but i don't think they will produce the same product.",False

Hdace wants to equitably distribute the tokens to any investors and make it public-friendly. According to that, it will surely affect the project but it shouldn't stop it or make them unpay the bounty (i guess the bounty reward will be lower if Hdac won't reach the target). And also,  in this case there won't be any additional token distribution such as 2nd TGE.

I think some of team members should clarify the community questions asked by the people.  Hi coin_1122!  To clarify it- HDAC is created through the cooperation of Hyundai BS&C, DEXKO, Doublechain, and Hyundai-Pay. Hyundai BS&C is not affiliated to Hyundai Motors of Hyundai Group. Which means there is no connection between Hyundai motors and Hyundai BS&C (but in real life they are family related). We got that question a lot and i guess we will in the future,  and every time it will be asked we will gladly explain the relation to Hyundai motors (which are not exist of course).  ",False
