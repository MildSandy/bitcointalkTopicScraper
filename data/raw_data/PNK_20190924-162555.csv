It was the first one ever to be conducted with the Interactive Coin Offering protocol (IICO), a new mechanism advocated by Vitalik Buterin and Jason Teutsch to make token sales more fair and egalitarian.  Here are some key facts:  The sale ran for two months, from May 15th to July 15th. 160,000,000 PNK (16% of the total tokens) were sold to 218 contributors. The total amount contributed was 5794 ETH. 267 ETH were voluntarily withdrawn from the sale. 11 ETH were automatically refunded after the valuation of the project exceeded the personal cap selected by the contributor.  (We will soon publish a more detailed post with an analysis of user behavior in the first IICO ever).  Now that the sale is over, our immediate next step is Kleros’ launch into the mainnet and conducting our first cryptoeconomic experiment (details will be announced soon). Now that you’ve bought your PNK, you will be able to participate as a juror (if you want to keep updated with the launch, sign up here).  As we have explained, revenue from the sale will be used to move forward with our development roadmap, our research roadmap and the building of an ecosystem of companies and arbitrators that will leverage Kleros’ technology.  In this crazy world of ICOs, we are proud to have conducted our token sale with integrity and transparency.  We didn’t do any private pre-sale with deep discounts, we used a fair token sale strategy (to learn more, see this), and we presented a working MVP before the end of the sale (see this walkthrough by our dev Sam).  We hope our experience with the first IICO will also contribute to setting higher standards for all the ecosystem. The IICO contract was written by Clément Lesaege, Kleros’ CTO, and the team made the interface design and implementation (to learn more, go here). Other projects can use our code for their own token sales, should they choose the IICO route (Interested? Contact us).

A huge thanks to all of you who walked with us this first step and hopefully you’ll keep walking with us in the miles to come.",False

There are many more technical details in this project that haven’t been touched on. Its clear from their explanations that they know what they are talking about, have clear goals, and a manageable roadmap. The team’s inexperience does not seem like a problem, because this project isn’t trying to do too much.     “As the ecosystem matures, Kleros will prove that it can deliver fast, affordable and transparent justice in a growing number of use cases. More customers bring more entrepreneurs, more jurors, more developers and an increasing number of use cases. The community will build the ecosystem on top of an open protocol. And this is how decentralized justice takes over the world” (Federico Ast CEO)  Risks     It’s so early in the development of DApps that it makes it hard to visualize enough use cases to make this ecosystem run. -1     Lots of inflation – only 16% of the tokens will go to funders. The other tokens will be sold either in the future as the team achieves critical milestones or as an additional incentive for early jurors in the platform.-1     There is no hard cap, as IICO is a market-based method. This means that the revenue from the token sale will be determined by market forces. -1  Growth Potential     The CEO spoke at Consensus, which is a big deal. +2     They have an MVP you can learn more about here.  And here’s a video of it. +2     Early partnerships with top companies, including InkProtocol and Dether and Thomson Reuters Incubator.+2     Kleros could easily be integrated with existing platforms (decentralized or not) with users being taken to a dispute resolution screen where they may never know who was arbitrating their dispute. +2     One of the Telegram devs stated: “Actually, even Vitalik knows of Kleros quite well. He and our Cryptoeconomics researcher William had a very interesting discussion on  http://ethresear.ch/about Kleros and some of the functions of the protocol.” The link is private, so we cant confirm if this is true, but it seems true. +1  Disposition Although this isn’t the sexiest of projects, it is one of the most important. It provides a court system for DApp users when smart contracts are incapable of settling disputes, which will be often. No better solution has been presented.  6/10 is our rating.

Find out how the Greek model is making a comeback in the form of Kleros' juror selection system.  From the Ancient Greeks to the Decentralized Internet: How Random Selection Shaped Democracy.  Sortition, the use of random selection to allocate political decision making rights, plays a limited role in contemporary political systems. The most well known sortition mechanism in modern democracies is the selection of jurors in American trials.  Few people know that randomness was a key political technology throughout the history of democracy. In different times, thinkers and social reformers saw sortition as a way to avoid concentration of power and corruption by special interests. Australian political scientist John Burnheim called demarchy political systems based on randomness.  Kleros uses sortition for jury selection. While we frequently talk about it as an innovation in the legal field, it can also be interpreted as part of a wider movement of governance innovation: the revival of demarchy.

Kleros Token Sale: Frequently Asked Questions What is Kleros? Kleros is the blockchain dispute resolution layer that provides fast, secure and affordable arbitration for virtually everything. Watch this explainer video:   What are some use cases of Kleros? Kleros is a multipurpose arbitration system able to handle a large number of disputes:  ● Alice claims that the good she bought from Bob in an e-commerce platform is defective. The jury votes for Alice and she is reimbursed.  ● Alice raises money with a crowdfunding campaign. The jury votes that she failed to meet critical milestones. Buyers are reimbursed.  ● Alice flags Bob for an inappropriate comment in a decentralized social media platform. The jury decides that Bob violated the terms and conditions. He loses reputation points and the content is removed.  ● Alice flags Bob’s song for plagiarism on a decentralized music platform. The jury determines that the song was plagiarized. Revenue from the song is redirected to Alice.  ● Alice flags Bob for cheating in an online gaming tournament. The jury analyzes the recording of the game and votes that Bob is guilty. Bob is banned from the platform.   Kleros provides fast, secure and affordable arbitration for many different use cases.  Do you have a prototype? Yes, we have a prototype running on Kovan test net. Here you can see a contract creation interface for escrowed payments, and here you can see the interface where jurors rule disputes. In this video you can see an explainer of the proof of concept:   What’s the name of your token? The protocol token is named pinakion (PNK). The name comes from the bronze ID plaque used to select jurors for popular trials in Ancient Athens.   A pinakion, the bronze ID plaque used to select jurors for popular trials in Ancient Athens. Why do you need a token? PNK is required to protect the system against the sybil attack and to provide jurors an incentive to adjudicate disputes honestly. Users adjudicating disputes honestly will, on average, earn money. Users trying to game the system will, on average, lose money. PNK cannot be replaced by ETH as this would greatly increase the risk of a 51% attack on Kleros. To learn more about the token, read our white paper.  How many tokens will be created? 1 billion PNK will be created. We will sell 16% in a first token sale. Another 50% of the tokens will be kept in reserve for selling in future rounds tied to milestones and for incentivizing early jurors in the platform.  Which currency can I use for my contribution? We only accept contributions in Ether (ETH). If you hold any other currencies, you can convert them into Ether on an exchange.  Is there a minimum contribution for the KYC? There is no minimum contribution.  What is the KYC process? Please see the link here for full details.  What’s your token sale method? We’re using the Interactive Coin Offering (IICO), a new token sale protocol advocated by Vitalik Buterin, Jason Teutsch and Christopher Brown that seeks to make token sales more egalitarian for large and small buyers.  Why are you using the Interactive Coin Offering? In capped sales, a fixed amount of tokens is sold at a fixed price. Buyers know the valuation of the project. However, participation isn’t guaranteed. In uncapped sales, on the contrary, valuation is not fixed. The pro is that everyone can participate. However, buyers cannot be sure of the valuation at which they will buy the tokens and can be diluted more than what they would be comfortable with. By letting participants choose a personal cap, the IICO provides buyers of every size two desired properties: certainty of participation and certainty of valuation. To learn more about our token sale strategy, read this article.  How does the IICO work? When making your bid, you can choose a personal cap. This puts a ceiling on the valuation at which you will participate in the sale. Thanks to this, you can be certain that you won’t have to pay a higher price than the one you selected. If you want to be 100% sure to participate in the sale, the interface gives you the option not to select a personal cap. Find out exactly how the IICO works here.  Don’t you think it’s too risky to be the first to use an unproven token sale method? It’s clear that the current model of token sales is broken and the IICO is a step forward to fix it. Kleros is seeking to modernize justice and the IICO reinforces this principle in token sales. We think it’s the right thing to do.  Why are you running your token sale in more than one round? Instead of doing one large sale at the beginning of the project, when our product is in an early stage, we believe it’s more responsible to conduct our sale in a number of rounds, as we can prove our ability to deliver on our promises. We will sell 16% of the tokens in the first round and conduct other rounds as we achieve critical milestones. To learn more about our token sale strategy, read this article.  What will you do with the 50% of the tokens you are not selling in the first round? Part of these tokens will be sold in further rounds as we complete critical milestones. Another part will be used as an additional incentive for early jurors in the platform.  How much do you want to raise? IICO is a market based method. This means that the revenue from the token sale will be determined by market forces. We are not targeting a specific amount.  Can I participate in Kleros' presale? There is no presale.  Why didn’t you do a presale? While many teams do a presale before the public sale, we didn’t feel it was the right move for us. We wanted to have a working prototype before accepting outside resources. Moreover, presales usually have large discounts which favor large scale buyers. We wanted all buyers, big and small, to participate in equality of conditions during the public sale.  How was the project funded? The entire project was self-funded by the team.  How can I get a bonus in the token sale? In order to incentivize price formation, the Interactive Coin Offering rewards participants making their contribution early in the sale with a 20% bonus. The bonus decreases smoothly down to 10% at the beginning of the second stage of the IICO, and then down to 0% by the end. To have a larger bonus, you should make your contribution at an early stage in the sale.  What happens if you raise a big amount of money in the first round? Will you still do the others? The IICO allows buyers to select a personal maximum valuation and be reimbursed if it is exceeded. This is why it’s unlikely that Kleros token sale will generate a extremely high amount of money. Should that event happen, we would increase the tokens to allocate to the Juror Incentive Program.  How would that Juror Incentive Program work? Users have to stake PNK in order to be drawn as jurors in the platform. Jurors who vote coherently with the majority are transferred the PNK lost by jurors who vote incoherently. The Juror Incentive Program will reward jurors who vote coherently with extra PNK. It’s as if jurors who voted coherently would “mine” PNK with their honest vote.  How will people acquire PNK after the initial offering? Users will be able to buy tokens in the secondary market.  In which exchanges will PNK be listed? It’s likely that PNK will be listed on the decentralized exchanges. We expect to make some announcements about the listing of PNK on well known exchanges.  When will I receive my PNK? You will be able to withdraw your PNK immediately after the end of the token sale.  Why can’t I have my tokens right after I send my contribution? Because of the mechanics of the Interactive Coin Offering, you will not be sure whether you will actually get PNK before the end of the token sale. If you select a personal cap, there is a chance you will be refunded your ETH and not get any PNK. If you selected no Personal Cap, the amount of PNK you will receive will only be determined at the end of the sale. When the token sale ends, you will be able to redeem your PNK and have them transferred to your wallet.  Is there a lock up period for the tokens after the token sale is over? Buyers will be able to use and transfer the tokens as soon as the token sale ends.  What will be the price of PNK at the beginning of the sale? Because of the dynamics of the IICO, the price of the PNK will be defined during the sale.  How can I get a bonus? Since an IICO is designed to create price formation over time, early participants are incentivized with a bonus. This bonus starts at 20% and decreases linearly to 0 over the duration of the token sale. For a detailed look at how the IICO mechanics work, click here.  Who wrote the code for the token sale? We wrote the code ourselves.  Who audited the code? The code was audited by a bounty program and an external audit. At the time of this writing, the code was already reviewed by at least 21 people.  How will tokens be allocated?  Team Members: 18%  First Round of Token Sale: 16%  Airdrop: 4%  Subsequent Rounds and Juror Incentive Program: 50%  Kleros Cooperative Development Reserve: 12%  How will you spend the money raised in the token sale? Revenue from the token sale will be used for product development (45%), research (25%), ecosystem development (10%), communication (10%) and legal & operations (10%).  What are your product milestones? At this moment, we already have an MVP running on Kovan test net with escrow disputes. The next milestones in our product roadmap are the following.  July 2018: First Pilots. We will test the Kleros MVP with artificial disputes solved by traditional methods and see how results compare. This first version will have real economic incentives for jurors but not enforcement. In order to conduct this test, we have already started our Early Jurors Program with 5,000 jurors.  October 2018. First Version with Real Enforcement of disputes. We will use Kleros to adjudicate disputes with real enforcement on the Ethereum main net.  April 2019. Release of a version with multiple sub-courts. We will implement subcourt hierarchy to allow jurors to specialized in some particular kind of disputes.  How do I know you’re legit? You can take a look at the Kleros prototype, code, conference presentations, publications, and of course, the Kleros team. To see the achievements of Kleros’ team since the beginning of the project in April 2017, read this post.  Are American participants allowed in the sale? US non-accredited investors are not eligible to participate in the sale. Citizens of countries in the EU sanction list are not eligible. Buyers will be checked against lists of restricted individuals. If you’re an American accredited investor, you can contact us at contact@kleros.io.  What is Kleros’ legal entity? Kleros is incorporated as a Société Coopérative d’Intérêt Collectif (SCIC), a type of cooperative under French law. Governance is shared between three colleges: founders, producers (contractors and employees) and users (jurors, parties in disputes, partners). All revenue from the token sale will be kept as an unshareable reserve. Funds can only be used for project development and cannot be distributed as dividends. To learn more about Kleros’ legal entity, read this.  How can I learn more about the project? Visit our website at kleros.io. For an overview of the main achievements of the project, see this post.  I love the project. How can I help? There are different ways for you to contribute to the justice revolution. Are you a coder? Take a look at our Github.

The beneficiary will be a Gnosis MultiSigWallet that you can find here at commit e1b25e8.  This contract has up to 50 ETH of bug and vulnerabilities bounties attached.  Only vulnerabilities which can lead to real issues are covered by the bug bounty program. As an example, finding an addition which can overflow leading to someone else losing money is a vulnerability, but simply stating ""Not using SafeMath is bad"" isn't (in our case, we chose not to use SafeMath, as blocking the finalization would be a more critical failure mode than an overflow).    The vulnerability payout ranges from 1 ETH (display issue which is unlikely to lead to any significant loss of funds) to 50 ETH (vulnerabilities which would make someone likely to steal ETH from the bidders or the beneficiary).  The OWASP matrix is used to determine payouts: OWASP    Critical: Up to 50 ETH.  High: Up to 30 ETH.  Medium: Up to 20 ETH.  Low: Up to 4 ETH.  Note: Up to 1 ETH.  The final vulnerability classification belongs to the Kleros team, but we are obviously committed to ensure a fair remuneration for bounty hunters in order to improve the security of the Ethereum ecosystem.  Vulnerabilities should be disclosed to contact@kleros.io, please includes [BUG BOUNTY] in the subject. Note that only the first party to report a vulnerability is eligible to bounties. The last submissions are due for May 14 in order for us not to start the sale would a vulnerability be discovered. Later submission would still be eligible but at a reduce payout.",False

Bribing is prevented by: Jurors losing coins if they vote incoherently, so if they think the others are not gonna accept the bribe, the bribe must excess the loss of tokens for incoherence. Parties can appeal if they believe that the result of a ruling is the result of a bribe. With sufficient appeals, everyone gets (statistically to be a juror), if the majority of token holders accepts the bribe the value of their coins will dramatically drop as no one will ever want their contracts to be arbitrated by the corrupted court. This is a 51% attack quite similar to those in PoS systems. The value in the disputes of the attacker must exceed the loss of coin value. Moreover the attacker (or the attacking cartel) must have 51% of the tokens which is quite hard. Paying half the market price is not enough as it would increases the price in response due to market depth effects. Moreover, even if a 51% attack were to be successful, honest parties can fork, remove the attackers tokens in the new fork. New users would use the honest fork.

IICOs are designed to be more egalitarian than conventional  public sales, which aligns with the principles guiding the Kleros project.    Token Sale Mechanics We believe that the mechanisms generally used for public distribution of tokens are broken. The reasons were explained in this post.  Vitalik, Jason Teutsch, CEO of Truebit, and Christopher Brown, CEO of Modular, have proposed a new model for token sales called  Interactive Initial Coin Offering (IICO), which gives participants certainty about valuation and participation in the sale.  Kleros will be one of the first projects to conduct a token crowdsale with this method.  One of the guiding principles of the IICO model is that it eliminates favoritism and deep discounting. We have declined private sale offers, electing to proceed directly to a public sale in which everyone has an equal opportunity to acquire tokens at the same rate.  Instead of making one large sale in one round as most projects, the sale will be done through multiple rounds as we reach critical product milestones.     TOKEN ALLOCATION  Team Members: 15-20% Airdrop: 4% Kleros Cooperative Development Reserve: 10-15% First Round of Token Sale: 16% Subsequent Rounds and Juror Incentive Programs: 50%       https://i.imgur.com/cZ7NIbl.png  https://i.imgur.com/gl72jFj.png  https://i.imgur.com/GPlFOx6.png  https://i.imgur.com/kJQ8S81.png  https://i.imgur.com/syoDBnI.png  https://i.imgur.com/5oti9Oi.png  https://i.imgur.com/aGKBRWm.jpg     The Road Forward  Kleros is based on the fundamental principles of justice and democracy in ancient Greece, improved upon by the invention of blockchain, and applied to the modern global age of the internet.  Our core values of justice and fairness will be reflected in the methodology we have chosen for the token sale. We aim at setting a new standard of quality.  In demonstrating a working MVP(Try for yourself here), a clear roadmap and a fair token sale, our hope is to bring back some sort of sanity to a somewhat crazy ICO market and instill confidence in those that believe in what we’re doing.  We’re extremely proud of the work we have done in the past year, with a great team of nine people from all around the world. Kleros was entirely self funded from the outset and we have not created any FOMO incentives to drive engagement.  Ultimately, our goal is to bring justice and arbitration to millions of people who have otherwise been marginalized and priced out of doing so by the current systems.  Satoshi’s original vision was for the majority to be able to interact and take control over certain aspects of their lives which were hitherto inaccessible. As Bitcoin came with the promise of banking the unbanked, Kleros comes with the promise of bringing “justice to the unjusticed”.  Fast, transparent and inexpensive justice for all.

We want to be as clear and transparent about the project as possible. We're all very aware of how the token sale market in past months has been somewhat broken. We discussed at length the best way to show the community a stable and reasonable road forward tying in our milestones with our funding rounds.  Thanks again and look forward to keeping everyone up to date with developments.,False

There are a number of functions of the Pinakion (PNK Token) including mitigating such attacks. Fundamentally, it would be economically unfeasible to mount such attacks as the cost to do so will increase and become more than the potential winning outcome. Therefore, it's not really a worthwhile idea in that case.  PNK is also the incentive for the jurors to vote coherently using the Schelling point theory.  For more info on both points including a detailed analysis of the security offered by the token, take a look at our whitepaper",False
