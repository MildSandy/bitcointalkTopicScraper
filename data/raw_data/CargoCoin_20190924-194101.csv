I am not telling this because I want to convince you but I know how important to prevent delays for seaborne trade and transportation. I have worked in companies which receive chemical raw materials or liquid fuels through seaborne transport. Unfortunately I do not have any free fiat or crypto to get in. Therefore, I am participating to the bounty campaign to be invested in such a strong project.  I know that minutes count for a cargo ship. Global Trade and Transportation Industry is so technologically unimproved for decades that paper Bill of Ladings and Credit Letters are still being issued and carriers deliver those papers to be exchanged between parties. Carrier service is expensive and slow. Being within the allowed period of time, this process takes time as much as 2-4 days and brings opportunity of equipment loss. Moreover, existing payment system in global trade and transportation is slow taking 2-3 days.  Implementing smart contracts document issuing and exchanging, cryptocurrency payment via utility token together will provide savings of up to 4-7 days. This will provide humongous savings for the global Trading & Transportation Industry. Keeping in mind that the ultimate goal of the team is to increase demand for tokens and thus increase the value of token. Taking all these into account it becomes more more and more investable for me.  Go check their whitepaper to get your own idea of investment.  Kind regards,",False

Answer: Yes, this is stage 1 of our project as per the whitepaper there will be several other stages. CargoCoin is a really big project, that will cover cargo and transportation on a full scale basis.  Question: How do you think, how much of a boost the transportation industry can get out of CargoCoin? Answer: Our conservative estimates show that we could save 10-15% in costs for the transportation industry.

Answer: We have had this idea for several years, but with the development of blockchain technologies, we are not able to put it at work.  Question: Are you going to partner with the existing shiping companies? Answer: Yes, we are already partners with existing shipping and cargo transport companies. In a few days we will add our partners page to our website, where we will list our partners from the transport industry.  Question: Do you already have any sort of a prototype?

The value of freight rates is USD 380 Billion is 2017 (UNCTAD). Although the shipping industry is one of the largest economic sectors it is the least technologically advanced one. Today paper documents are issued for all shipped cargoes, no matter of the transport means. All original documents are being sent by couriers, taking time and money. All cargoes and freights are being paid for in traditional ways – via bank wire transfers or letter of credit. Those are expensive, slow and non-confidential methods. Increasingly more often USD and EUR transactions are being blocked for weeks by US correspondent banks. Anyone in the industry has encountered that problem. Original documents delivery delays and money transfer delays cause unaccounted extra costs, opportunity cost & depreciation of assets, while disturbing a long supply chain.   SOLUTIONS ______________   CargoCoin is designed to be a smart contract, crypto currency platform, decentralising global trade and transport. The platform target is to facilitate and optimise the interaction amongst traders, freight forwarders, shipping lines, booking agents as well as all other parties involved in the international trade and transport of commodities and cargoes. The platform users experience outlines well-balanced ecosystem based on cutting edge crypto security and frictionless interaction.  HOW IT WORKS ______________   The full scale scope of the project extends to all transport areas – shipping industry (containers, bulk, break bulk, liquid bulk), inland transportation (trucks, railways), air cargo (transportation by planes, drones, etc.), other types of transportation, including, but not limited to: pipeline transport, space cargo, intercity and outer city shared rides.  Transport platform: Dedicated platforms for the different types of transport in development will be interconnected, allowing for infinite transportation functionality. The objective is the creation of synergy between the commodities & cargo traders with all transport means on a global scale. The integration of all participants and tools delivers unique, one of a kind eco-system.  CargoCoin development has been set in the following stages:  .   1. Shipping platform – development of the global shipping platform, utilising Smart Contracts (Smart Bill of Lading, Smart Letter of Credit, etc.), referred to as the platform in this whitepaper. The platform connects importers, exporters, freight forwarders, booking agents, ship brokers, ship owners, etc. into a single unified marketplace. 2. Inland platform – development of the global inland transport platform, utilising Smart Contracts. The inland platform will cover all ground based transport, such as trucks, railroad, pipes, etc. 3. Cargo all-purpose platform – development of a marketplace, utilising Smart Contracts, allowing manufacturers to showcase their produce and connect them directly with customers, through an established link to the ship and inland transport platforms. 4. Air cargo platform – development of air cargo transport, utilising Smart Contracts, including cargo planes, cargo choppers and drones.  Smart Contracts: CargoCoin utilises the transport platform, as a secure transfer and storage method by the means of smart contracts, as well as a payment provider for transport services and cargoes. Fully unleashes the potential of crypto currencies to act as an interactive way of sending, receiving, approving, rejecting and signing documents through the process.  CargoCoin is flexible and allows the parties involved to easily select the terms that they choose to interact with. Options for standard or custom negotiated terms, conditions and forms will boost the user experience. Elimination of language barriers will further facilitate the eco-system participants.  Platform Services:    1. The Shipping Industry: The underlying asset of the Ecosystem;    2. Containers. (FCL, LCL, OOG);    3. Dry Bulk/Break Bulk;    4. Liquid Bulk (tankers, chemical carriers, LNG, LPG);    5. Liner Services;    6. Essential Services to the trade & transport;    7. Manning services (seafarers/crew for ships).   The CargoCoin blockchain technology delivers revolution to the trade & transport by fostering optimisation. CargoCoin solves a number of problems in the shipping industry:  .   REDUCING FRAUD CargoCoin minimises the risk of fraud and in many cases completely eliminates it, by not releasing any payments until the counter parties’ pre-set conditions are fully met.    LOWERING COSTS CargoCoin reduces costs, compared to high percentages, charged throughout the process by banks, brokers, agents, lines, ports, customs agents, couriers, insurers, etc.    MINIMISING DELAYS CargoCoin avoids the delays by providing instant exchange, review and approval of documents and payments between the parties involved in the Smart Contract  .   INCREASING TRUST CargoCoin relies on the public infrastructure of the Ethereum blockchain, backed by thousands of people in a peer-to-peer decentralised infrastructure.    SECURING INFORMATION CargoCoin is naturally secured. It relies on the blockchain’s proven hashing algorithm technology without the possibility of information leakage.    SAFE ARCHIVING CargoCoin, not just allows but fully relies for full historic storage of all transactions ever conducted, thus avoiding risks of physical loss or destruction of paper documents.    Introduction Video  ROADMAP ______________   The CargoCoin roadmap is based on its full cycle of preparation, development, implementation and marketing.
