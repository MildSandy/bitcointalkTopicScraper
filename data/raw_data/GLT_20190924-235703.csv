DiaEx And B2B Trade  Diamond B2B trading typically involves buyers and sellers with a better understanding about diamonds. Issues related to the authenticity of the stone, implications of a certified diamond, general market conditions, approximate market prices, the 4Cs of a specific diamond etc are well understood by participants. These participants on the GLITZKOIN DiaEx Diamond Exchange, would not need much handholding. Equipped with the superior environment that, the blockchain based diamond trading platform provides, B2B diamond traders can easily expand their business operations. These traders will best appreciate the use of the GTN token to settle payments. They realize that, the conventional banking system is hampering efficiency and market penetration. B2B participants on the GLITKZKOIN diamond exchange, will generate a steady and consistent demand for the GTN token.  DiaEx And B2C Trade  The entire structure of the DiaEx diamond exchange is designed to inspire confidence in both, B2B and B2C diamond traders. Buyers in this (B2C) category would consist of consumers, they would be buying the precious stone for themselves or for someone close to them. With little or no formal knowledge about diamonds, these buyers will best appreciate the process of limiting diamond listings to certified stones. Issues related to fake diamonds and the misrepresentation of the 4C parameters for a stone, will be eliminated through the certification process. Buyers in the B2C group could be spread all over the globe, they would not be confined to any specific diamond market. Challenges related to bank transfers, multiple currencies and conversions, will not be relevant – the GTN crypto token would save a lot of time and effort. Buyers can search the listed diamonds by entering the related parameters, with multiple choices to compare and pick from – the chances of being overcharged are highly reduced.   Read more here.

The difference that we bring to the table is that, our project is headed by a diamond veteran of 20 years. He has been running a publicly listed diamond company for the past two decades, and has spent his entire life in understanding the finer nuances of the diamond trade. He has an established global network of different stakeholders in the diamond supply chain. Unlike other tech startups, this is a disruption, not from the outside, but from the inside. An industry insider, has decided to take it upon himself to bring about changes in an industry in which, he himself is a second generation stakeholder. Glitzkoin is essentially trying to build a marketplace, called DiaEx, for trading diamonds. As most of you would know, any startup looking to develop a marketplace, is always faced with the chicken and egg problem. Buyers will only come when there are sellers, and vice versa. After long hours of explanation and endless sessions to present the concept of a comprehensive diamond blockchain configuration, GLITZKOIN CEO Navneet Goenka, has convinced leading diamond dealers to list their inventory on the blockchain. The list of certified diamonds ready to be listed on the DiaEx Diamond Exchange, now totals a little over $500 million. A significant increase in this list is expected by late October 2018, the same time when the exchange will be ready to run through a thorough testing phase. The project is poised to bring positive change to an industry that despite its multibillion dollar turnover, has begun to show clear signs of stagnation.
