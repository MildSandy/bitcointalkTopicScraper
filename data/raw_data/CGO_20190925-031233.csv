Clash & GO uses Blockchain in 2 different ways: 1. Clash & GO AR gameplay utilizes the CGO token as a balancing tool. Each player wants to manipulate the Augmented Reality world because the specific disposition of AR geoobjects  gives advantages. If we allow every player to make changes, it will jeopardize the whole gameplay. This is a balancing problem that we are solving by using the CGO token. We came to the conclusion that only engaged players should be able to influence the Augmented surroundings of Clash & GO. Engaged players are those who are willing to make a deposit. Compared to a deposit, the CGO token has a few benefits: token transactions are transparent and fair players can buy and sell tokens on external exchanges at any time 1. We allow players to manipulate the AR world without actually spending money. Since the changes are free, all players will be more interested in making them. This also ensures high demand for tokens on exchanges.  Ethereum smart contracts guarantee that the number of tokens from delayed emission for the in-game auction will not be altered. The token allocation is available for audit. Players can spend in-game currency to buy CGO tokens at the internal Auction. This makes the game more fair. To achieve this, 10.5% of tokens are generated with delayed emission controlled by a smart contract.

Clash & GO uses Blockchain in 2 different ways: 1. Clash & GO AR gameplay utilizes the CGO token as a balancing tool. Each player wants to manipulate the Augmented Reality world because the specific disposition of AR geoobjects gives advantages. If we allow every player to make changes, it will jeopardize the whole gameplay. This is a balancing problem that we are solving by using the CGO token. We came to the conclusion that only engaged players should be able to influence the Augmented surroundings of Clash & GO. Engaged players are those who are willing to make a deposit. Compared to a deposit, the CGO token has a few benefits: ● token transactions are transparent and fair ● players can buy and sell tokens on external exchanges at any time We allow players to manipulate the AR world without actually spending money. Since the changes are free, all players will be more interested in making them. This also ensures high demand for tokens on exchanges. 2. Ethereum smart contracts guarantee that the number of tokens from delayed emission for the in-game auction will not be altered. The token allocation is available for audit. Players can spend in-game currency to buy CGO tokens at the internal Auction. This makes the game more fair. To achieve this, 10.5% of tokens are generated with delayed emission controlled by a smart contract.",False

In addition to basic game resources such as titanium and helium-3, the game uses Antimatter as a in-game currency.  Intended uses of Antimatter: ● to accelerate game processes (construction and upgrading of buildings, units, nanorobots) ● to increase the number of engineers (builders) ● to speed up the extraction of basic resources in mines ● to buy modules to assemble artifacts ● to buy shields (which grant immunity from other players' attacks for a limited time) ● to buy CGO token at the in-game auction Players can obtain Antimatter (in-game currency) in the game, or by purchasing packs in the Play Market or App Store.

Due to in-app AR geo-targeting functionality, it seems more reasonable and useful to create clans with people who live nearby. This facilitates capturing objects on the GO-map. Clan chat for communication between clan members Clan members can write messages and send battle reports that only fellow clan members can read. Clan wars (available in a future addon) with valuable rewards Each clan consisting of 5 or more members can participate in Clan Wars, where they fight against an enemy clan with the same power and the same number of members chosen according to a complex algorithm. The war lasts 48 hours and consists of two stages: 1) 24 hours for preparation, receiving reinforcements from clan mates. 2) 24 hours for attacking the opponent’s clan. The clan war is a “team play” where the general results, and not the individual merits of each member, count. Clan Citadel The Clan Citadel is a special building on the player’s base. The reinforcements from clan mates are held in the Clan Citadel. The Clan Citadel also stores the resources acquired from victories during Clan Wars.",False

The app will have Antimatter (in-game currency) and Clash & GO Tokens (CGO tokens).  You can use Antimatter to do number of things which will bring you some benefits in the game, such as: accelerating game processes (construction and upgrading of buildings, units, nanorobots), increasing the number of engineers (builders), speeding up the extraction of basic resources in mines, buying modules to assemble artifacts, buying shields (which grant immunity from other players' attacks for a limited time).  Plus you can purchase CGO token at the in-game auction using antimatter. Tokens give players the superpower to manipulate the Augmented Reality world via a voting system. The more tokens you have, the more often you can vote to move geoobjects. CGO tokens can be stored in ETH wallets that support ERC20. In the game, each user will have their own ETH wallet, to which the user will be able to transfer their CGO tokens in order to use them in the system. Users can transfer their CGO tokens from their in-game wallet to any other ERC20 wallet. But in order to participate in the voting to manipulate the AR world, users must put some CGO tokens in their internal wallet. Thus users must put CGO tokens in their internal wallet before being able to perform any actions with CGO tokens in the system.  We're currently on our private presale stage, so if you wish to participate, let us know ",False

Clash & GO uses Blockchain in 2 different ways: 1. Clash & GO AR gameplay utilizes the CGO token as a balancing tool. Each player wants to manipulate the Augmented Reality world because the specific disposition of AR geoobjects gives advantages. If we allow every player to make changes, it will jeopardize the whole gameplay. This is a balancing problem that we are solving by using the CGO token. We came to the conclusion that only engaged players should be able to influence the Augmented surroundings of Clash & GO. Engaged players are those who are willing to make a deposit. Compared to a deposit, the CGO token has a few benefits: ● token transactions are transparent and fair ● players can buy and sell tokens on external exchanges at any time We allow players to manipulate the AR world without actually spending money. Since the changes are free, all players will be more interested in making them. This also ensures high demand for tokens on exchanges 2. Ethereum smart contracts guarantee that the number of tokens from delayed emission for the in-game auction will not be altered. The token allocation is available for audit. Players can spend in game currency to buy CGO tokens at the internal Auction. This makes the game more fair. To achieve this, 10.5% of tokens are generated with delayed emission controlled by a smart contract",False

Using tokens to motivate the team is required to ensure the team will finish the product and will launch it. This protects the ICO participants’ interest and influence the token price. Most of the teams who collect funds using an ICO do not have any experience in product development, product launch and product operation. Also, most of the teams collect money to develop the product. The average time from the ICO to product launch is approximately 1 year. Unlike most teams, Elyland is a stable and successful company with 100 employees. Elyland has a long history and 6 successful product on the market. Elyland completed all the products it started and there are no unfinished projects.

Using tokens to motivate the team is required to ensure the team will finish the product and will launch it. This protects the ICO participants’ interest and influence the token price. Most of the teams who collect funds using an ICO do not have any experience in product development, product launch and product operation. Also, most of the teams collect money to develop the product. The average time from the ICO to product launch is approximately 1 year. Unlike most teams, Elyland is a stable and successful company with 100 employees. Elyland has a long history and 6 successful product on the market. Elyland completed all the products it started and there are no unfinished projects.  Elyland has long-standing business procedures that ensure product development is finished on time and with high quality. One of the main parts of these procedures is a motivational system for the internal team.  Elyland has enough funds to produce and launch the product to market. The release date is planned for summer 2018. The delay from the end of the ICO till the product release is only 2 months. The main goal of the ICO is to collect funds for user acquisition in order to launch the product on a global level.  Topgames keeps 34.5% of tokens to guarantee the ICO participants that Topgames and Elyland are highly interested in token price growth.  In conclusion, Elyland has its own internal motivational system and 10 years of experience to prove its reliability. Not providing tokens to the team will not affect the release date, product quality, and token price.

The player’s task in Strategic Mode, is to use careful planning to command the base entrusted to him/her, and develop it so as not to allow other players to seize its resources. In AR-mode, Clash&GO uses geolocation, and turns the surrounding world into a real battlefield. Players travel on the map in real time, collect resources on it, perform geolocation quests, search for containers with modules, for mines that generate antimatter, and other rewards. The main task is to capture and retain as many geoobjects (points of interest located in important or interesting places in the city) as possible. If a player tries to capture a geoobject that is already under the control of another player, a real-time battle begins. This kind of gameplay encourages players to join clans in order to control territory together with friends and extract even more resources, and as a result, tokens.

As for buyback strategy every day, we will spend 15% of the revenue received on the previous day, to buy CGO tokens and subsequently burn them.  The more tokens we burn, the lesser amount of tokens will be left. Buyback and burndown lead to higher demand for tokens on exchanges, and finally leads to higher token price.

Every  day  we  create  a  report,  which  includes:  distribution of  tokens  on  in-game  wallets,  tokens  transactions  inside  the  game,  received  revenue  to  be spent  for  burning  tokens,  token  sales  on  the  in-game  auction,  etc.  The  report  will  be stored  internally.  We  store  the  hash  of  this  report  in  the  blockchain.  This  makes  the token  transactions  inside  the  game  transparent  and  ready  for  third-party  audit. 2.

Initially we planned to raise some additional funds through ICO to fuel user acquisition, PR and marketing. But after a hugely successful worldwide launch of Clash & GO we’ve gained a strong player base that keeps growing without requiring an additional budget. We’ve been working relentlessly to ensure this success as well as the highest possible quality of the game. And our work paid off as the game has skyrocketed to the top new games in its category on Google Play store in USA, JP, UK, CA, RU and other regions. In less than a month after the release Clash & GO is being played in more than 100 countries on all continents (except Antarctica, at least for now). We won the prestigious contest by Best Mobile Apps and received  Silver award as Best New Mobile App. Clash & GO was also prominently covered by Forbes, Venture Beat, as well as many other media and Youtube personalities. This overwhelmingly positive feedback brought us to conclusion that an open token sale is no longer required to ensure the project success. Instead we want to focus our time and resources on improving the game even further. Initial coin offering can be a valuable tool for small startups that want to raise money to finish their product. We decided to give it a try, but since Elyland is a profitable company that has been self-financing its products for the past 11 years, the ICO turned out to be redundant. Clash & GO was finished achieved success using only our own resources. We are truly grateful to everyone who took part in our pre-sale and showed their interest to invest on early stages. All gathered funds have already been returned to the investors. We appreciate your support and valuable feedback we received that helped us make the product even better.",False
