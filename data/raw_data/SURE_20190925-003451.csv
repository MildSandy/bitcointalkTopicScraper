Micro-insurance can be for anything ranging from life, health, personal gadgets, livestock etc.  The main differences between micro-insurance and traditional insurance products are their lower prices and lower coverage values.  Micro-insurances were not commonly sold in the past because their lower prices do not incentivise the agents.  With  digitisation, it is now possible to sell micro-insurances to end consumers.  2. With almost two-thirds of the vast population of Asia now using mobile phones (and usage is still increasing), growing  demands for technology-driven solutions will push insurers to enhance digital capabilities  in 2018 and beyond. In 2016, for example, there were approximately 330 million online  insurance customers in China, an increase of more than 40% from the year before,  according to Ant Financial and CNBData. These numbers will continue to grow as  consumers in Asia demand mobile solutions in buying insurance, and they want it simple,  affordable and on-demand.   3. Our token is pegged to the local currency which makes understanding its value and using it by the unbanked relatively easy.  It also contains the smart contracts that help insurance companies track insurance contracts and claims data, among other and utilities.",True

It would make sens to use some form of making the workflow easier but I do not necessarily agree with tokens becoming tender to use to buy things with. There are too much volatility going on in crypto for stable retail type payments apart from maybe a handful of coins out there.  Then also why do you want to burn tokens for PCT? Isnt that becoming a bit complex especially if you are targeting unbanked? Unbanked might not be crypto savvy.,True

In general, using tokens to buy things may not put the consumers to risk the price movement of the tokens. They can buy and use at the spot as long as there are necessary tools/app to facilitate such services. In return for this extra steps to get the necessary tools/app, the consumer will be incentives with certain discount. For example, today i need to buy a $100 insurance, i can just go to the app to buy and the app will tell me that i just need to pay $90. The app will then take my $90 and purchase the tokens and send the tokens to the provider. So in the end, it is a win win situation whereby i spent less, while it drive demand for the token system.

We are an official business partner of IBM where we use Watson as part of our AI technology layer in SURETY.AI, and do joint marketing with IBM.   Qns: How tokens will be used in this project?  With SURE Tokens, insurance policies and claim transactions can be stored on our chain, benefiting the unbanked and other participants of the ecosystem.  Among the token utilities are:  1. Insurance contracts: Insurance policies are stored on tokens and it is proof of insurance during claim. As these are immutable contracts, it fosters trust and security among insurer, re-insurer and the insured.  2. Insurance data: Unbanked consumers can use tokens to access their data for policy payment and claim information. This information form their credit history to gain access to financial services like loans from banks  3. Security and fraud prevention: Insurers use tokens to store claims data to avoid duplicate claims and insurance fraud. Blockchain’s immutable recording system can help insurers avoid claims leakage and lower loss ratio. In this way, premiums for micro insurances can be even lower for the unbanked population.  Please refer to our whitepaper for all the use cases and benefits of our tokens.  Thanks!",True
