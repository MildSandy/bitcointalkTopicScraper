As a result of the trip, AX1 has purchased 300 miners for delivery and installation in early June — putting the programme weeks ahead of its expected Road Map schedule.  As the recently launched AX1 token has already achieved its soft cap target, the trip was designed to leverage purchasing power by negotiating directly with the hardware providers rather than through brokers. This ensured the best deals were secured on the most power-efficient miners with the highest hash rates.  The trip also demonstrated AX1’s thorough due diligence, as well as helping to lay foundations for secure, long-term business relationships within a nation at the cutting edge of crypto mining technology. This will ensure that AX1 remains ahead of the game in the UK.  In today’s market, mining cryptocurrencies profitably requires not only correct infrastructure and reliable, cost-effective power but also the latest mining technology. Mining equipment is costly, with minimum investment starting at US$2,000 per unit, rising substantially dependent on the algorithm and specification of the miner. Furthermore, running an enterprise level mining operation requires a supplier that can offer a consistent supply of miners, spare parts and a world class after-sales support service.  AX1 has already secured the use of a stateof-the-art data centre in Manchester, UK, with an option to build a dedicated purpose-builtfacility alongside competitive power deals to power AX1’s miners. This plan is now well on track as the mining operation moves from plan to reality.  AX1’s equipment purchase includes 100 of the world’s most efficient Bitcoin miners — the Innosolicon T2, as well as 200 altcoin miners by Innosilicon.",False

Instead, we wanted that mining pool to actually help create long-term capital value for the token itself.  Mining Adaptability Many current mining operations spend huge amounts of money on hardware, in many cases that hardware is not very adaptable between coins. We wanted to avoid this as far as possible as we would rather mine coins more likely to increase in value than less likely to increase in value for the same net cost. The ability (within the obvious constraints of current technological possibility) to switch our rigs from mining one coin to another at short notice as directed by the Strategic Advisory Committee is a key consideration in our overall plan.  Avoiding over-concentration risk This factor is closely connected to mining adaptability. When analysing many of the current miningoperations that have been established for some time, we observed that in many cases the operationswere too focused on one particular coin. We wanted to avoid this and instead mine several coins, fromday one.. The layout of our data centre building lends itself very well to this as we can easily demarcateour miners by coin, even down to individual bays. With planning permission already approved for a second site, AX1 will build an additional structure that will also facilitate the above.  Research & Development Concentrating absolutely all resources on today’s mining operation only makes sense in a totally static mining space: one in which coins never deplete and the difficulty of mining them never increases. We know, of course, that no such mining space actually exists. We also know that in order for our token to be the best token in this category, we will need to constantly innovate and adapt our operation to keep up with both new technology and the dynamics of what coins to mine. To this end we are placing a major focus on R&D so that we can be sure we are the leaders when it comes to finding new avenues of profit.  Operational Scalability The whole project has been designed from inception with scalability in mind. The target amount to commence work on the second site in England is $10 million and when this amount is reached, work will commence on the second site and funds deployed to fit out this custom built mining centre. Planning permission has already been approved for the second site. If the crowdsale raises more than can be deployed on these two sites, the issuer already has commitment for use of space in an existing operation in Canada and is in discussion over precise terms — this will be operationally integrated with, and controlled by, the base site in Manchester.  The Opportunity As time has passed, more and more people have got involved in crypto mining. With increasing numbers of miners attempting to solve the problems each day, it would follow that the hashes of blocks are being calculated at increasingly faster rates. To avoid things spinning out of control, the community agrees to increase the difficulty of the problem miners need to solve to ensure the consistency of the block generation. Due to the complexity of the problems, it is now almost impossible to mine profitably from home using standard computer equipment. However, there is still a great deal of profit to be made for those who can access the right equipment, suitably managed, cooled and administered. People looking to mine cryptocurrencies in the near future are likely to be much more successful if they have access to a centralised mining pool that is built to withstand this increasing complexity of the block solution.  With AX1, we are offering token holders thechance to participate in a managed mining operation and enjoy capital appreciation via contractually guaranteed economic rights in the portfolio of mined coins. After deduction of any costs and liabilities incurred by the issuer, at least fifty percent of the value of the mined coins will be placed in a segregated account in order to assetback the AX1 Tokens. This represents a real, contractual, substantive and auditable value guarantee and is a key strength of this offer in addition to the other attributes of the AX1 Tokens discussed elsewhere. Under this arrangement, the Issuer will have NO further entitlement to withdraw, or otherwise use for any purpose of the issuer, ANY of the assets of this segregated account: its value therefore provides a solid basis for the perpetual assetbacking of the AX1 token and peace of mind to AX1 token holders that the Tokens are true and verifiable store of value. The assets held in the segregated account, though off limits to the Issuer will not just languish, however, but continue to be advised upon by the Investment Advisory committee and therefore could be deployed in Proof of Stake activities and or by being traded as part of exchange operations to the increased value of the token holders. The segregated account will even be audited on a quarterly basis to provide yet more confidence to token holders with the results posted onto our online portal for review. https://medium.com/@support_98049/ax1-explained-the-future-of-large-scale-crypto-mining-de78758364ec",False

This gives AX1’s management function the necessary skillsets to fully understand and implement its business model. Of course, in terms of actually acquiring, setting up and running the miners – this was from day one something that we envisaged would be done by external contractors and the reason for this is simple enough and based on the Executive Team’s extensive experience in the Financial Services and IT Sectors: by using external contractors (and bearing in mind that we have three demarcated floors in the Data Centre) we can use different sets of contractors who will effectively be in competition with each other to produce the best results. In the same way that fund management companies have a number of managers that they can inter-compare the results of and IT companies have different coding teams, we wanted to be able to assign mandates and then hire and fire teams based on performance. One of the reasons we chose Manchester and not China or backwoods of Canada where it would be difficult to get people to and which may be cut off for months of the year, is that we can get very high-quality teams to setup, run and adapt each floor’s miners very quickly. Our model may at first site seem a little ruthless but we have extensively analysed other operations over a two year period and what we see is that having the actual day to day people who run the miners embedded into the company’s board, C-Suite or as shareholders leads to huge inefficiencies as it is often awkward to get rid of such people if they don’t perform satisfactorily: with our model we simply do not renew the contract and get a new team in if we are not happy with mining output. So, sorry for a slightly long answer but this solution we think will deliver the best and most consistent results to our tokenholders",False

Jersey’s sophisticated regulatory approach requires any ICO issuer to obtain a specific consent from the Jersey Companies Registry, part of the Jersey Financial Services Commission.  Whilst this consent does not give the ICO a ‘regulated’ status, it is bespoke to the ICO in question, and mandates an additional set of conditions designed to ensure continued high standards of governance, investor disclosure and AML/CFT compliance.

Under this arrangement, the Issuer will have NO further entitlement to withdraw, or otherwise use for any purpose of the issuer, ANY of the assets of this segregated account: its value therefore provides a solid basis for the perpetual assetbacking of the AX1 token and peace of mind to AX1 token holders that the Tokens are true and verifable store of value",False
