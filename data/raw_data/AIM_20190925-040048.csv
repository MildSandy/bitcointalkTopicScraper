Sensitive data such as diagnosis, operation records and text copies of psychiatrist conversations will be held privately by the hospital or medical practice.  The sensitive data is sent between user and hospital through HL7 protocol, Aimedis does not hold this data and this is how they will be able to transfer clinical and administrative data. There is also synced data which is the data that is collected from smart devices and medical trackers but this will also not be stored on the blockchain.

I asked her your question and she said:  ""You will still have to do medical checkups with your doctor and upload your results to your Aimedis profile. You also need to grant your Aimedis doctor permission to view your medical data and based on the outcome of your appointment, the doctor will send you a prescription for your medicine online. You will then be able to order your medicine online.  Aimedis will also store doctors signatures on the blockchain and this means you will not have any issues with going to a local drug store or ordering online using your e-prescription"".  I think is the answer we were looking for, but it does also depend on your case. If it's a serious condition, you will have to go for a checkup and get your prescription there.  In my opinion, this actually relieves the burden on the public health service because if you think it's something minor you can talk to a doctor online in minutes and they will basically confirm if you need to go see a specialist. So it's almost like a screening process to reduce the number of people going to see a doctor over small, insignificant conditions and wasting valuable time and resources.",False

Everyone can join the huge bounty!   Overview of Aimedis  What is Aimedis?  Aimedis is the next generation e-health platform which will connect the efficiency of AI and the security of Blockchain to provide cutting edge medical and psychological support. Aimedis is a platform which will enable patients and doctors to connect with each other 24/7 from everywhere on the planet while offering never before seen security for patient's personal medical and psychological data.   Roxana at the World Blockchain Forum      The dual blockchain design  The Aimedis security system is based on a dual blockchain architecture, allowing Aimedis users to keep ownership of their medical data while allowing them to monetize their private data for  medical research purposes or pay for medical services and medication while getting great discounts by using the AIM token. Medical researchers will be granted only as much or as little confidential data as desired by the patient in a completely anonymized way, protecting the patient's sensitive information while allowing them to both profit and contribute to medical research. The AIMchain private blockchain will make trust visible for the patient and the users and will finally empower the patient via decentralisation and incentivising.   Connected Patient Communities  Aimedis helps connect patients in to communities using a unique social network system. Aimedis will provide a dedicated space for patients to share their experiences, recommendations, feedback, and advice with other patients. By coming together as a community, patient's benefit from sharing their experiences and in offering support to each other.  This helps in dealing with acceptance and treatment of medical conditions.  The members of this community will have rich media capabilities such as uploading video,  audio, text, or image content, allowing them to connect with their peers. This media and content  is part of a creation-incentivized rewards system where creators of high quality content can be rewarded by the other community members with votes.  As a community, members will be able to offer financial incentives (via voting) for content published on the platform. Patient's can use their tokens to pay for services, transact within the community, or exchange to fiat.  Secondarily, this content will be used as data inputs for our Artificial Intelligence when creating  extensive reports on specific medical conditions and diagnosis. This data is appended alongside wearables data, scientific data, and more.   Already a proven existing company  Aimedis is an existing company, which operates today in three countries: Germany, Netherlands and Thailand. Aimedis works today with several hospital chains as a technology provider working with medical data, and has helped more than ten thousand patients.     Helping people all over the world  E-healthcare has the potential to help billions of people from impoverished areas and victims of natural disasters. E-healthcare helps to raise the quality of life and financial cost in first world countries. Aimedis is positioned for this emerging market and thanks to its dual blockchain design brings true security and privacy to patient's data. Based on anonymized data gathering, new discoveries and cures can be found at an accelerated pace, while patient's are financially rewarded for allowing their data to be used in medical research studies.

In addition we rely on our well-developed network of connections in Europe emphasizing that the Aimedis founder worked in Germany and France for years which are the biggest health care markets in Europe. Since last year we are focusing on Asia and concentrating in building a powerful network which will help us grow in Asian countries.,False
