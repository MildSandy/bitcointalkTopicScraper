This ICO will soon go full scale and there will be also some hype.  I must admit, the international acceptance is a bit behind, they focus more on the German language market. But this is due to the fact, that HQ is in Munich and the main channel ""Welt Der Wunder"" is also in Germany. Not unusual to start activity in your home market.

Wir freuen uns über jedwede Interessensbekundung an unserem Projekt,  stellen aber klar, dass diese noch keinen Kauf unseres Tokens zur Folge hat und damit auch noch keine Verpflichtung, diesen zu erwerben, eingegangen wird.  Um einen etwaigen Tokensale durchführen zu können, werden wir mit der Schweizerischen Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA) zunächst die regulatorischen Fragen klären, um sicherstellen zu können, dass das Projekt rechtskonform umgesetzt werden kann.  Welt der Wunder strebt hier eine rechtlich eindeutige Regelkonformität  an, weshalb der Tokensale auch erst nach dieser regulatorischen Klärung durchgeführt werden kann. Wir haben zwar bereits erste Schritte unternommen, warten aber noch auf weitere Klärung.  Von daher kann der Start des ICOs auch erst zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt kommuniziert werden. Wir bitten um Euer Verständnis und die nötige Geduld. Letztendlich dient eine rechtliche Klärung dem Interesse aller, die sich später für einen Tokenkauf entscheiden möchten.

But could you, please answer the following  How high was the demand for the token sale in november? Why do you prefer regular currency over crypto? It is a token sale after all.  Where do I get the picture of what the actual service product, the licensing process, looks like? Overlooking your white paper I neither see overly technical stuff and also the legal mechanics that you promise to implement are hardly aproaching the realm of specificity.   Also why do you lay so much emphasis on what you call 'Media-Asset-Management'? Also it is not clear where this cloud is coming from. Is it your own/SwissTxt's, or could it be any existing service? In case of Netflix who with its Open Connect Appliances directly working toghether with ISPs would be publishing their content world wide in a seemless manner if it wasn't for all those nation-specific licensing issues. I hope you don't try to become the next Netflix.  If I understand it correctly the whole venture rises and falls with the quality of the implementation. How will content creators or their publishers for that matter actually use your contraction?  Help me if I get this wrong: Your smart contract will most certainly be the first of its kind, but once its out there it will probably not be the last. So unless you can put a patent on it (which I'm not sure is even possible) it has to be 100% implementable to the market to be successful.",False

How do you deal with imposts and restrictions concerning all sorts of things... lets say (for instance) advertising? If I want to sell content that persuades people to quit smoking can I prevent the buyer from putting Marlboro ads next to it? And if he does anyway, how is that claim made? Its not like the blockchain would be preventing or punishing him.   But anyway: Thank you for showing those lovely screenshots!   http://welt-der-wunder.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ico/images/Media%20Hub/1_MediaHub-SWISSTXT_4.jpg http://welt-der-wunder.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/ico/images/Media%20Hub/1_MediaHub-SWISSTXT_3.jpg  Now, how do I understand your model right? You create smart contracts that cut the cost of fees and intricate legal aspects of selling video content from creation to consumption by implementing a platform with the good folks of Swisstxt that functions basically like a VOD for VODs, TV and other sorts of video publisher? To get it going you try to sell your own content to show how well it works you only do that in Germany (at first) so that there is not so much trouble with licensing issues and what not (at first).. By the time you are ready to expand to other juristictions you hope to have worked out how to make your content legal enough and maybe create so much impact that it simply becomes standard procedure for video publishing?  I'm not sure how much middle man is cut out by that approach, but if cost is just right and you provide and present the necessary legal standarts brilliantly enough, this might work just wonderfully.  Still I'm not conviced: In Germany, how many creators and publishers of the video content you are looking for as users of your platform are one and the same entity? Surely companies like Walt Disney Company that at the same time produce and sell don't mind high lawer fees and strict copyright agreements. I would even argue that its pretty much in their interest because owning exclusive rights to their content is their bread and butter. On the other hand Germany with its laws recognizing ""Urheberrecht"" being different from copyright might even be a rather good place to start (being ignorous to the fact that copyright laws in Germany have gotten increasingly stricter (and worst for that matter) since time immemorial).  At first I thought that you just aimed at implementing a smart contract that legally required people to transfer content from creation to consumption (a bit like paypal). I didn't know that you wanted to be the netflix of  netflix.  Didn't you use to prefer crypto currency over physical currency? Why the change of heart?  Btw: Do also you sell tokens to Hong Kongers?",False
