Is there something wrong with us? There is a saying, if you point your finger at us, 3 fingers will point back directly back to you. Before questioning others maybe you could take a look at yourself back.  When we look around we see a lot of people taking their little success up to their little pea brain with their ego growing bigger than their pea brain. Just because they have 1 million pound, they forget that there are people out there having 100 million pound.  We treat everyone and when i mean everyone, i said everyone with the same respect that we give our loved ones. Don't disrespect a beggar because they are asking food or money from you...

Satoshi Nakamoto provided a open source code (in other word, technology coin ), no one own bitcoin project, knowing who is Satoshi Nakamoto doesn't matter, So don't compare apple to orange. Back to Orozu, we are talking about a project that own by team members, and as you mentioned your Orozu coin is a utility coin that power your exchange and lending program platform and without those things, it will lose his value. So knowing who is behind the project is important in order to evaluate your ability of achieving the goals. Because you asking for money and in order for investors to choose to participate or not in ICO, they need to know the team background and skills. It's not always about legit and scam, but it's also about if project worth investing or not.  Quote we don't need to hire credible people  No one ask you to hire credible people.

Have we not provided an open source code as well? Check Github and you will see it. We created this program but that does not mean we own it. Let me get you back to basics of cryptocurrency? Why was it created? So that it decentralized. So in a decentralized platform who owns the coins??? Us???  We are creators/founders but not owners.... You talk about knowing our experience, read into the whitepaper, understand what we have created, see how it differs from the other lending program, see how smart this program was built. If you failed to understand everything thru what we wrote. We are still open to be questioned that why this thread exist . But if you are asking us to put our pictures to tell you about our experience, i think that is ridiculous. You want to know us to trust us not to know about our experience.  If you want to know our experience , look into our codes and ask me ask much questions as you like because in all my answers and replies you will know our experience. You don't need pictures, you need to pick my brain to know about our experience. And this forum is what it is all about....",False

We want to be respected for privacy reasons and we don't believe in creating hype and sell to people portraying the experience of the team because credible people can be easily bought.  That is the reason why big companies are staying away from cryptocurrency and banning it for participation in thier industry. We have done everything to what it needs to be, registering 3 companies, getting a securities license for our trading and lending program and most importantly being transparent.  Our coin is not a technology coin, it is a utility coin. A utility coin must be known for its liquidity and utility propositions which is what we are working hard to provide. So coming back to your question, we don't need to hire credible people so that we can use their credentials to sell our ICO or to make our project look good...

We created the coin with a very clear objective which are  1. Why it is a coin and not a token,we have our own blockchain 2. We don't have a big supply which is beneficial for investors as more demand and adoption the more the price increases 3. Coin is a hybrid our POW has been completed and now it is on POS as POS as known to decentralize the whole eco system which is a better system 4. We are now in talks with many exchanges and other than closing a crypto to crypto exchange, we also understand the important of our coin to have fiat to crypto trading pairs. We have closed 2 exchanges with fiat to crypto trading pairs which we will roll out after we rolled out our crypto to crypto exchange for us to qualify to be in coinmarketcap. 5. We have a trading/lending program which is fair and we took a lot of time thinking and testing when developing it. We do not guarantee returns and you can only lend 50% of your total coins for risk management purpose. To top it of , we have spoken to an insurance company that will secure all our investors of the whole amount lend against mishandling and misappropriation. Our trading/ lending program carries a securities license which is stated in our website. 6. We have a 24 hr/7 days a week chat support for you to be in contact with us for any problems you face  There are many more reasons i could tell you which are amazing for our supporters/investors/community but i would just end to tell you that the whole plan was carefully planned so that it could benefit the whole community and our team will not stop working to make this coin one of the top coin in the market.

Crypto enthusiasts are eager to know the outcome of the initial launching. As this major event comes to a close in due time, crypto users will share as much anticipation for Orozu Exchange and Lending Program which is next on its roadmap.  Following this, the Orozu External Exchange Trading and onboarding of an insurance company to cover all its lending will take place. This will provide insurance solutions to the company’s lending-related activities before Orozu gets listed in the Coinmarketcap by May 2018.  With the emergence of new crypto coins, users have become more meticulous of their choices for coin investment. Orozu shows strength with its continuing stability since its test-run on crypto trading in June of last year. The coin’s value has increased by 25% even as its ICO is still ongoing and is highly optimistic to have a steady progression on its agenda to improve its features the entire year.  Along with its IOS/Android Wallet-launching in May, Upgrade on Security in June and Onboarding of External FIAT to Crypto Exchange in July, other planned improvements are on its calendar all the way to 2019. Orozu is projected to be in the Top 10 on Coinmarketcap by January 2019 and onwards to become one of the major currencies of the 21st century. Orozu is definitely strong and on its way to perfecting its coin. Taking the Orozu opportunity is the smart choice for today’s scrupulous investor.
