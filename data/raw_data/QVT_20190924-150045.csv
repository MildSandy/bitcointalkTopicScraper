We are sincerely apologize for such delay, I guess we were too excited last year and rushed the milestones without putting extra time for us to run all tests and checks. Also, picking up the right timing is key. If you particularly upset about QVT price being that low, well all markets are bleeding, not only QVT. That affects everything and this correction is natural and healthy. This is part of the game.  Moreover, team will never ""dump"" anything, that's something impatient investors do, not the team. In fact, team's focus is not price of the token, but rather development of the platform and product.

Main focus now is to finish out platform. We eagerly want it to be launched till the end of this year. While working at the full swing, we also want be 100% sure we don't have any bugs and outages. This is becoming a common practise within the cryptocommunity that a product oftentimes is very buggy and prone to hacks. Even such a giants like Ethereum is vulnerable to any sorts of hacks, leading to catastrophic consequences where people are losing millions. We don't want that, therefore we prefer to test and check everything. I would like to remind you that around 90% of ICO projects don't have actual working product yet, where around 50% still don't have it after a year since finishing ICO. We have finished our ICO a little over a month ago.  Regarding marketing campaign and listing on new exchanges. I personally believe that we should do your best and come up with a neatly structured yet aggressive marketing campaign aimed to raise attention to the Qvolta and make people FOMO in it. Listing on a new exchanges should be carried out in a logical sequence one by one so the volume really pours in evenly and stays there. In order to do that - we want to ensure that our marketing activities will be really effictive and certainly not misleading. So, how do you succeed on that? Well, first of all, we have to have a working product. This way, people discovering Qvolta will be genuinely interested in that. It won't be your everyday miserable pump&dump scheme, where people fomoed into and only then discover that there is absolutely nothing behind the flashy advertisement boards and empty promises. As an active crypto enthusiast I am invovled in many crypto projects, I hold enormous amount of different cryptocurrencies, and have a lot of side projects I am affiliated with. Really sad thing is that I see how few of them actually will survive in the following years. I bet that 95% of all current coinmarketcap will extinct in 3-5 years. Only genuine products that have actual utility case will be able to survive the tough competition. Qvolta has a real use case. It has really simple and down-to-earth goal - to serve the needs of one of the most fastest emerging market segmens - ""buying/selling cryptocurrencies"". This is one of the most prominent market segment out there. And Qvolta already set a foot on it. Qvolta just needs time.  Thank you for attention!  Regards, Diyor Qvolta",False

After looking through everything, I must admit to being somewhat confused.  1) The QVOLTA founding team is supposedly from Czech Republic with 2 of the team being co-founders of Fintech Financial Solutions which was registered in Czech Republic on 16 Mar 2017. That clearly contradicts the dates stated in their Linkedin profiles. Also, it seems kind of strange that they would then fly all the way across the world less than 4 months later to Singapore to register QVOLTA.  2) According to the roadmap published by the team, the desktop version of the full featured product was supposed to be available on 15 Sep 2017 prior to the launch of the ICO. There is a MVP available on their website but it's already been 3 days into the ICO so where is the promised desktop version? A MVP is not in any way a substitute for the full featured product.  3) Yes, this is supposed to be a P2P exchange in competition with Localbitcoins but how does it really provide anything truly different from Coinbase or any number of companies and exchanges that allow the purchase of cryptocurrencies with fiat? Perhaps it is less ""volatile"" since there is no fluctuation in exchange rate resulting in a possibly unpleasant shock if the transaction is delayed during a purchase or sale. It can also be argued that there would not be fees levied on the trades but QVOLTA does charge fees in the form of tariffs. Granted, they are way lower than some of the fees the exchanges levy but I'm not sure that is enough to attract traders, or as the white paper calls them -- Professional Traders to utilise their escrow service since they are the ones being burdened with those tariffs whenever they post a buy or sell order that might or might not even be fulfilled.  Just my 3 cents worth.",False

Also, one can register a company remotely if has all necessary documents. One would need a help of lawyers, but this is possible.  2) We had MVP before our ICO, now you can check out our Alpha (it is long live already). Once we finish our ICO and QVT tokens can be used - we are going to launch our platform. As for now you can register, open your orders and play around to get used to the platform.   3) Coinbase is not quite a right thing to compare with Qvolta. Coinbase sells/buys crypto out of its pocket, but Qvolta is p2p platform. Also, we don't deal with fiat, meaning that we will avoid any problems with regulations or government banning such things. What truly differentiate us from, say, Localbitcoins is that we have way better UI, we have ETH support (the second most traded crypto) and mobile apps (iOS and Android). Also, we will add more crypto later on. Ultimately, we have lower fees compared with Localbitcoins and any other service known to you.  Thank you for attention!",False

Qvolta platform offers the same, but will be able to support multiple cryptocurrencies(Not Just Bitcoin).  LocalBitcoin has a fee of 1% for every successful trades. The seller pays the fee. 1% of the trade will go to LocalBitcoin as a commission. So if you are going to send 1BTC to another person, You owe them 0.01(43 USD).  Qvolta exchange on the other hand, are going to accept QVT as a mode of payment for every successful trades. The Fee will be base on the percentage of  amount of trade. Regarding the percentage fee is unknown as of now. With this kind of token and platform,circulation will create a huge volume of trades everyday. If the volume growth rate is at steady upward position, we can expect the value of this token to skyrocket.  Business Model  LocalBitcoin business model is easy to understand.  Buying and Selling Bitcoins  You sell your bitcoin for a given amount on their platform(escrowed your bitcoin,1% of total BTC)->Buyer buys your bitcoin in exchange of FIAT(USD,EUR etc)->Seller and Buyer agrees with the terms of the trade->Buyer sends the payment via payment methods available->LocalBitcoins confirms your payment and releases the Bitcoin to your wallet.  So every transaction, LocalBitcoins get 1% of that. The collected amount will be use for basic operation funding of the website. And the Cycle ends here.  Qvolta Busines Model develops a cycle to make QVT tokens usable.  Like LocalBitcoins, You place a sell order on Qvolta for a given amount on their platform(Will be confirmed depending on the tokens you hold)-> Buyer buys your bitcoin in exchange of FIAT(USD,EUR etc)->Seller and Buyer agrees with the terms of the trade->Buyer sends the payment via payment methods available->Qvolta confirms your payment and releases the bitcoin to your wallet.  Every transaction, Qvolta gets QVT tokens. The QVT collected will then be sold to the exchange/market. Qvolta platform users again are going to buy QVT tokens to initiate a sell order/trade. The cycle continues.",False

Somehow I get a Coinbase (not Gdax but actual Coinbase) feeling, except nicer. Max of funds in ICO seems not absurdly high as with some. At ICO price the trading fees appear not high.  But it will take a lot of users to get liquidity, and there are quite some different kind of competitors out there and also coming up. QVolta really needs to achieve this before having any chance of having this token go somewhere. And when the only function of the token is pay fees per trade the upside of this token is limited. If it would go up, people would sell there tokens and go to another exchange.  With profit sharing this would have been a very interesting gamble. As for now, the only reason to participate in the sale woud be 50% and then hopefully get out with a profit asap, but since the actual ICO is still quite a bit of time away I feel other ICO's offer more opportunity. Too bad, I spent a lot of time considering this one, Good luck to the team and all who actually will participate though!",False

Be sure we will add this information! We did not take this moment into account from the very beginning because we thought that users would clearly understand everything from the description of the service.  Our service has 2 components (as well as any other working not only with cryptocurrency, but also with fiat money service has):  1) Payments/Transactions with user's fiat money  2) Payments/Transactions with user's cryptocurrency  If we consider the first component, then we are completely decentralized: the users' fiat money does not go through our trading platform and users make payments to each other directly, without our participation.  On the second point, of course we could not be called completely decentralized, because orders are processed by a centralized escrow mechanism.  Services  like Bitsquare are not  our competitor. In my opinion they are very difficult for the ordinary users/beginners in the world of cryptocurrency.  Our direct competitor is LocalBitcoins, but  we have huge advantages over them, which are described in our white paper.  We focus on a wide range of users and our mission is to popularize cryptocurrency for ordinary people by creating a convenient and understandable service for their purchase and sale.",False
