Although we are confident in overcoming and solving each of these problems, with the latest one we feel an obligation to make an announcement and to our community in order to stay open and transparent as we feel that every ICO project should.  On 23. March, our biggest investor pulled out his funding from our project.  Due to these events, we need to pivot our direction and agree on a smaller scope than initially planned. We've considered our options and nevertheless made a plan to continue onwards without major funding.  With a lack of necessary funding for development, we are going to cut most of our planned features and push them to a later date in the roadmap.  Due to these reasons, in the near future, we are going to issue a brand new token which current XNY holders can swap to. Prior to that, XNY token will be delisted from all the exchanges where it's currently traded.  Currently, we're working on a complete rebranding of the whole exchange and an overhaul of our front end code. After that, we will have a new roadmap that will be visible on our redesigned platform as well as a new announcement about the future direction of the project.  Since we understand that this is a change from our ICO roadmap and that some of you might not agree with the new direction, we are offering a full refund to everyone that bought XNY during our ICO phase.  Be sure that before contacting us for refund you have all the proof of your investment, your KYC documents, and your participation email. We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity.  You can contact our support team at support@cryptonity.io or on our Zendesk platform https://cryptonity.zendesk.com/hc/en-us.

We’re excited to join forces with Cryptoadvice, a Blockchain Trading & Investment Platform for our upcoming token sale. The sale will be exclusively on the Cryptoadvice platform.  CryptoAdvice: Welcome to CryptoAdvice, We believe that decentralisation is a new way of governing people, digitalising trust and decision making. We provide a diversified on-ramp for exposure to the digital currency asset class. Our investment interests range across the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, facilitating direct investment in cryptocurrency itself and investment in companies creating, implementing and adopting blockchain solutions.  QuickX: Founded by VAIBHAV ADHLAKHA and KSHITIJ ADHLAKHA, Quickx will provide Cryptonity with their topnotch technology service to run our digital exchange. Quickx performs transactions off the chain for some Blockchain assets and utilizes pooling facilitators who supply liquidity for cross chain transfers of crypto assets. Through this, transaction speed would be greatly enhanced, and the interoperability problem between different cryptocurrencies will be dissolved, thus, relieve the transaction fees and also solve the issue of scalability.  We're not excited just for the technical details. But for the shared core values of a cooperative, transparent and interconnected community that promotes collaboration in the smart economy. And that is something Cryptonity is all about.  Our Quickx partnership will support our mission to make digital currencies and trading work for everyone.  We are always looking for new ways to support our customers and expand the smart economy. That’s why we’ve partnered with Quickx, a novel protocol designed specifically to cure the many fatal flaws that are hindering mass adoption of cryptocurrencies today.  https://www.cryptonity.io/cryptonity_whitepaper_v1.pdf  Interested in knowing more about QuickX and CryptoAdvice?  https://cryptoadvice.com  https://www.quickx.io",False

The reason for this important decision is that the terms and conditions offered by Crypto Advice are far from being fair and clear,  to us, and to the people that wanted to invest in our project.  We would like to give you a brief history and a more detailed explanation of why we took this hard decision. As you know, we had our first ICO in November and December of 2018, at a moment when the market was really difficult and we didn't reach our soft cap. So we had to reimburse all our investors and although we had a functioning product, it was extremely hard, to execute our vision without funding and to come up with a product that was in line with our expectations. We were thinking about dropping the entire project in February of 2019.  At this point, QuickX founders approached us and offered help with the fundraising via the Crypto Advice platform. Since QCX already had a successful ICO through Crypto Advice we were assured by QuickX that they were a reputable and a transparent company. We accepted this new opportunity so we could give birth to our exchange.  The idea was to create a new token that would be sold exclusively on Crypto Advice in order to tap into their community of investors. We would then do roadshows, video conferences, and AMA sessions in order to explain our project to the Crypto Advice community and promote the token sale, which we indeed did during our roadshow in European cities of Maribor, Vienna, Koln, Berlin, and Warsaw.  But along the way, we discovered that the conditions Crypto Advice has offered were dishonest, not only for us but also for our community and investors.  First, during the phase 1 of our token sale, investors could buy our tokens only with QuickX tokens and as for the other phases, investors could buy 40% with QuickX tokens and 60% with BTC. Contrary to our previous agreement Crypto Advice changed the initial terms and offered us only the agreed amount in BTC not counting the QCX part of the collected amount.  Secondly, Crypto Advice wanted full control over the smart contract of our token and refused to give us a clear answer about what they intended to do with the portion of the raised funds in QCX. Besides that, they clearly stated that the original token distribution (15% for the consumer protection funds and 25% for Ecosystem Development) is to be kept by them, again in contrary to the original agreement.  Last but not least, was the fact that the QuickX team started to get involved in the ownership of Cryptonity, and tried to influence top management changes within our company. And since the beginning of our agreement, only until recently, we never had direct contact with Crypto Advice without QuickX founders acting as intermediaries between us and Crypto Advice, which management structure is still unsure to this day. (We suspect QuickX Founders to be CryptoAdvice Administrators and Owners)  Because of the above reasons we have decided to step away from our collaboration with Crypto Advice and QuickX. Although not an easy decision, since without proper funding our project probably won't continue, but we prefer to lose our credibility as good entrepreneurs rather than to be involved in a mechanism that we find dodgy and not transparent to our investors.  Cryptonity, to this day, hasn't received any funds from the token sale, which has been exclusively sold on the Crypto Advice platform. We urge all the investors that participated in the ICO to ask for a refund on their investment from Crypto Advice. Again, we are sincerely sorry for the inconvenience caused and we hope that everything goes back into order as soon as possible for everyone.  Thanks to our team of lawyers at BruzzoDubucq who guided and advised us to make this decision for our own safety. We have all the evidence of what we say, you can contact us for more information.

We’re excited to join forces with Cryptoadvice, a Blockchain Trading & Investment Platform for our upcoming token sale. The sale will be exclusively on the Cryptoadvice platform.  CryptoAdvice: Welcome to CryptoAdvice, We believe that decentralisation is a new way of governing people, digitalising trust and decision making. We provide a diversified on-ramp for exposure to the digital currency asset class. Our investment interests range across the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, facilitating direct investment in cryptocurrency itself and investment in companies creating, implementing and adopting blockchain solutions.  QuickX: Founded by VAIBHAV ADHLAKHA and KSHITIJ ADHLAKHA, Quickx will provide Cryptonity with their topnotch technology service to run our digital exchange. Quickx performs transactions off the chain for some Blockchain assets and utilizes pooling facilitators who supply liquidity for cross chain transfers of crypto assets. Through this, transaction speed would be greatly enhanced, and the interoperability problem between different cryptocurrencies will be dissolved, thus, relieve the transaction fees and also solve the issue of scalability.  We're not excited just for the technical details. But for the shared core values of a cooperative, transparent and interconnected community that promotes collaboration in the smart economy. And that is something Cryptonity is all about.  Our Quickx partnership will support our mission to make digital currencies and trading work for everyone.  We are always looking for new ways to support our customers and expand the smart economy. That’s why we’ve partnered with Quickx, a novel protocol designed specifically to cure the many fatal flaws that are hindering mass adoption of cryptocurrencies today.  https://www.cryptonity.io/cryptonity_whitepaper_v1.pdf  Interested in knowing more about QuickX and CryptoAdvice?  https://cryptoadvice.com  https://www.quickx.io",False
