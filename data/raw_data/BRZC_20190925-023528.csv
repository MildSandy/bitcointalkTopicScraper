At present, the company holds mortgage papers of approx. 50M USD worth. The interest rate is determined to be annually 6.5%. As the sales increase and the next projects are introduced, the total value of the mortgage papers will be increased, therefore the amount of payment will be higher. Here is an example calculation. Suppose the company has mortgage papers of 50M USD worth , and there is 200M total amount of BreezeCoins. If the annual interest rate is 6.5%, then this means that there will be 3.250M USD interest payment in total. If you have 5000 BreezeCoins, you will have: 5000 / 200,000,000 x 3,250,000 = 81.25 USD annual interest income. Payments will be done in the form of Ethereum.  At the end of 2018 the project will sold out so we will have 200M USD worth mortgage paper. Our future projects are Breeze de Mar Bahamas, Hawaii, Las Vegas and Antalya. When the future projects are done, mortgage paper amount will increase so the payments to holders will increase.",False

Breezecoin cannot be mined. But there is of course a reward in the future: Breezecoin is based on real estate projects, the first project ist Breeze de Mar Orlando. We sell the units of this resort normally for 20% down payment and we are giving 80% loan. So we get more and more mortgage papers. We already have 54 Million USD at the moment. For each USD of given loan we sell 1 Breezecoin with a face value of 1 USD. The interest rate we get for the loans is 6.5% p.a. for 30 years. This is exactly the amount we forward to our registered coinholders. This is your future reward. And please keep in mind that in that case it is a great advantage that the coins are not minable. That means, the total amaount of breezecoins is fix. When the project in Orlando is finished and further projects are coming up (Las Vegas etc), the total amount of mortgage papers naturally increases too, that means the interest payment per Breezecoin increases as well! I hope I could answer your question satisfactorily. Your Breezecoin team.",False

Our goal is to combine the blockchain-based cryptocurrency technology with the real estate investments. For this reason, we created a new cryptocurrency, BreezeCoin (BRZC), which is based on the Ethereum platform. The most prominent feature of BreezeCoin, unlike most of the other cryptocurrencies, is that it is tied to physical assets, namely real estate assets. It will become a medium of exchange in projects done by Breeze de Mar (see below) which has more than 15 years of experience in the real estate and construction fields. Moreover, BreezeCoin holders will be able to get monthly interest income payments in Ethereum.   What is Breeze de Mar?  Breeze de Mar has been making real estate investments and projects in the USA. The outline of the current and future projects is explained in detail in the whitepaper. The first project on our schedule, Breeze de Mar Orlando, has already started in Orlando, USA and the details can be found in the following section. In addition, the next step of the project, Breeze de Mar Las Vegas, will be publicized in the Istanbul Real Estate Fair (Istanbul, Turkey) in November 2018, and will be put up for sales in Cannes Real Estate Fair (Cannes, France). Furthermore, two additional projects, Bahamas and Hawaii, are still under project development.  Project Orlando The project is located in Orlando, Florida USA. With the excellent climate, unique environmental features, the whole world is attracted towards the area. Annually, the city welcomes 68 million tourists and it is becoming more and more eye-catching every day, not just for tourists but also for investors and residents, which in turn results in the emergence of new living spaces. Breeze De Mar allows investors to invest in the real estate resort market with as little as 20\% down payment with affordable interest rate. The Orlando project will operate as a resort hotel starting in the year 2019. The project construction has started in 2017 and will be delivered in May 2019.  Business Model  Our business model mainly consists of two parts. Firstly, the income from the interest payment of the mortgage papers will be distributed to the coin holders. Secondly, people will be able to use BreezeCoin in Breeze de Mar Resorts. The details can be found in the following sections.  Interest payment  In addition to the standard token functions, BreezeCoin is a store of value. The income that Breeze de Mar receives through the interest of mortgage papers will be distributed to the BreezeCoin holders. Just by holding BreezeCoin, the Ethereum address of the coin holder gets guaranteed monthly interest payment with an annual rate of 6.5\% on the last day of every month, starting in 31st of January 2019, in the form of Ethereum. As the sales increase and the next projects are introduced, the total value of the mortgage papers will be increased, therefore the amount of payment will be higher. Here is an example calculation. Suppose the company has mortgage papers of 50M USD worth , and there is 200M total amount of BreezeCoins. If the annual interest rate is 6.5\%, then this means that there will be 3.250M USD interest payment in total. If you have 5000 BreezeCoins, you will have: 5000 / 200,000,000 x 3,250,000 = 81.25 USD annual interest income. Payments will be done in Ethereum. Please note that the company already holds mortgage papers amounting ~50 million USD.     Implementing BreezeCoin to Resorts  BreezeCoin will be a medium of exchange in all the Breeze de Mar Resort Hotel concepts. You will be able to buy and pay goods within our real estate complexes. Thus, coin holders will be able to use it in the real life.  Initial Coin Offer (ICO) Period  Ethereum (ETH) is accepted as forms of payment for BreezeCoin ICO. The price for the ICO period is 1 BreezeCoin = 0.85\$ of Ethereum. Ethereum price will be determined as follows: At the time of ICO contract deploy, 24h low and 24h high prices will be retrieved from Bitstamp cryptocurrency exchange website, and these values will be averaged and directly used. There is no minimum payment limit to join into the ICO. Applications to buy BreezeCoin can be made through the official website. You will be required to submit information based on the Know Your Customer (KYC) and the Anti-Money Laundering Regulations (AML) as well as your ERC20 acceptable Ethereum wallet address. Upon the verification of the account, your Ethereum wallet address will be whitelisted and you will be able to send ETH to the ICO smart contract address and in return, the corresponding amount of BreezeCoin will be sent to your wallet address.  The ICO period will start on 1st of June and continue until 20th of June. The hard cap of the ICO is 30 million BreezeCoin. In case 30 million BreezeCoin is sold before 20th of June, the ICO period will be closed automatically.  Coin Allocation   Created BreezeCoins will be distributed as follows: 75% -> Reserve 15% -> ICO 5% -> Early Investors 5% -> team  Since we are aiming to create a cryptocurrency friendly resort, 150 million BreezeCoin will be kept in the reserve wallet and will be used on points of sales. The system that we are working on allows resort customers to buy BreezeCoin from point of sales. We predict that 1,000,000 BreezeCoin will be used daily, with the expected number of 10000 customers in Breeze de Mar Orlando Project. The amount of BreezeCoin in the reserve wallet will be updated regularly.

Interest payment will not be for a lifetime, it will be for 30 years because of the mortgage contract duration.
