The crypto world do really need some charity solutions to make the world a better place. I will also keep fighting for charities in crypto. We are just at the starting line with all those new solutions showing up using blockchain. Be smart and invest into charity solutions like Opakeco it will make the world a better place and help the poor in the other countries. They could really have a helping hand those days because countries are sending less and fewer funds to 3rd world countries. Crypto solutions can bring back the help.,False

If you've ever spoken more in depth with anyone from Opakeco, you know that the Opakeco fundamentals have been brewing inside our minds for several years now.  We've put large amounts of work into getting every done in the last week months: - getting the whitepaper to its final state; - speaking with many charities to run pilot projects with; - reaching out to interesting organizations for partnerships; and - getting invited to present ourselves at the WebSummit in Lisbon.  All these things are good to go, but we do feel that we're not ready yet, and we have huge opportunities in the pipeline that haven't been properly finalized yet. We need some extra time to make everything _perfect_.  For now, we can say the ICO will start somewhere in September, but we need to plan some things out and reschedule.

They have managed to get around the same as TribeToken. They tried their best in promoting. The point, not the promoting thing. People want fast returns. Charity in blockchain is the future. But basically its better to get a private investment out of this and release an ICO then when the platform has a proper working demo. That would be my recommendation. I am further not working on TribeToken anymore. It was everything or nothing and did not reach enough to even open an office to let everyone work on the project. I did learn a lot from that experience and I hope Opakeco does not give up and maybe can go the private investor way. Blockchain will only get hotter in 2018. Why did I not say this earlier?

Or, if we did it wrong, debunk it, in which case we would require a redo of the affected contract(s).  The smart contracts for asset management work by storing Ether (these are the funds sent in to exchange for Karmo tokens) sent from the ICO contract. The ICO contract transfers this to a contract wallet that is called every quarter to release a set amount of funds to the Opakeco Ether wallet address. Only when Ether arrives in this wallet, will it be usable by the Opakeco foundation. Alongside this, there is a mechanism that does a refund of all remaining Ether to the contributors in the case there is a vote to stop Opakeco using a kill switch contract.  With regards to the security of the specific wallet address, I refer you to my colleague, René (ren-e), as I know how much he enjoys explaining the layers of physical and information security surrounding the usage of our funds.",False

The wallets have been stored on three USB devices, which also contain multiple layers of security. The USB devices, computer and secrets are all stored separately in a vault.  We’re not stopping there, because the process also needed attention. At least two members from Opakeco are required in operating the wallets. Before we can use the wallet we must verify whether the computer, Ethereum client or USB devices needs to be updated.

It has always been theoretically possible to have full oversight of good causes. In practice, the Opakeco Foundation have learned that this is never the case. Over time, however, the feasibility of making this vision into reality has grown by leaps and bounds. With the coming of blockchain technology, digital transparency could be reached. And now with Ethereum smart contracts and the possibility to issue tokens, the Opakeco Foundation finally has a way to make our vision a reality.       Summary  The Opakeco Foundation is building a platform where token holders will be able to exert control over the foundation and support charities without the need of technical skills. In time, opakeco will become the quality label for measuring the transparency of charities and well-doers.  The Opakeco platform thrives on a connected community: as a token holder, your vote counts. Together, we decide what decisions to take; together, we steer the foundation; and together, we will help humanity.  The Opakeco Foundation wants to emphasize that token holders decide. Decisions within opakeco are made by asking everyone, with the majority of the deciding power in the hands of the community. Important points here are that token holders will be able to vote on all strategic decisions, including, but not limited to quarterly budgets, strategic goals and even board members.  Within the same platform users will be able to communicate with different charities,  verified well-doers and people who aim to make a change in their community. The platform will let you see to what extent a certain well-doer or charity is transparent according to the metrics the Opakeco Foundation uses.  Our goal is to have charities use our tokens to buy food, medical supplies and other necessities -- this can range from building water wells and houses to providing solar-powered lights -- that can help their cause.  Token holders will be able to send tokens to well-doers and charities through the Opakeco platform. So apart from the efforts that the foundation itself will be putting into aiding different causes all around the world, token holders are able to have a direct impact in a cause they feel strongly about.  The Opakeco Foundation will help organizations to become more transparent and give them an Opakeco rating according to the measures they have taken to be transparent.  This organization will be fully transparent and lead by example. The Opakeco Foundation will publish all internal company communication after 24 hours and token holders are able to see our income and expenses.  Key Features  New standard in communication with humanitarian causes Vote with tokens to decide on tactical and strategic decisions Send aid to humanitarian causes using tokens Built-in killswitch contract, refunds ETH if voting threshold is met Founder tokens locked for 5 years Token Buy back program with 40% of positive equity in Q4 Quality mark for humanitarian causes   Roadmap     Contribution Period  Start Time: 21-09-2017 Duration: One week Target: 10.000 ETH Hard Cap: 100.000 ETH   Token distribution  The Opakeco Foundation wants to a fair and wide distribution of tokens, the following steps have been taken to achieve this:  Fixed gas price (transactions above or below this gas price will be rejected) No whitelisted addresses No 3rd-party allocations No bonus structure    * Founder tokens will be locked in publicly disclosed wallets, They will be released gradually, at a rate of 5% per 3 months. Effectively meaning founder tokens will be fully released after 5 years.

The team behind Opakeco will do its hardest to set a leading example for the community. We care about the project and we want it to succeed, to emphasize this our CTO and CIO will work the first quarter without a salary!  We want to prove to you that our interests are aligned with our mission. The total amount of ETH is released gradually with the approval of token holders. We are all willing to put our reputation on the line for this project, as the Opakeco Foundation will be as transparent as any organization can be.  The Opakeco Foundation will add constant value to the tokens with our buy back program and adding features/functionalities, but we’d rather see a gradual incline of the value than a “moon” type of launch.

Your question regarding which country/countries the charity itself is focused on is both easy and hard to answer: none. These decisions reside on a strategic level, and these decisions are made by including everyone within the foundation and the community surrounding it.  I know quite a few Dutch humanitarian charities -- PAZHolandesa, for example, is a charity that focuses on Peruvian children with cleft lip/palate. A subject that hits close to home for me, because I grew up with family members with cleft lip, and know the struggle that surrounds it -- that are dear to me. Therefore I would want to put them up for consideration. Someone else in the community might know a different charity that is quite dear to them, and one that gathers more support and sympathy from everyone within Opakeco. In this case we would decide to help the latter.  So to clarify, the only real focus Opakeco has, is to better the people around us that don't have it as well as a large part of the world. That is a large segment, yes. For this we have everyone gathering together to decide and help.",False

Enjoyed reading some of the discussions here, but sometimes a bit difficult reading through all the lambos and moon images.  Nearly all the projects here are only in for the financial benefit and with Opakeco we also hope to turn this around. I hope you enjoy our project and please let me know if you have any questions.",False

This is correct, even though the Opakeco foundation has no legal way to have securities. In the Netherlands, a non-profit foundation has no form of securities; it is only run by board members and a chairman. However, the Opakeco Foundation has a somewhat interesting extra, that has no officially legal foothold: the tokens issued by the foundation can be used to vote for decisions that have legal repercussions. Effectively, this means that -- as long as the board of Opakeco performs its duties according to the democratic votes -- a token is akin to a share.  In the eyes of the SEC, the foundation is then a legal entity that is in a way selling securities without being registered with the SEC.  The ways to circumvent this would be to either qualify for the exemptions listed under rules 504, 505 or 506 of Regulation D and apply with the SEC; or perform a check to see whether anyone that is a US resident meets any of the SEC requirements of an accredited investor.  Unfortunately the foundation qualifies for none of the exemptions mentioned above, nor is it feasible (from both legal and decentralized standpoints) to perform the check. Hopefully this clarifies our standpoint.",False

Interesting question! There are several options to help people in immediate distress situations like you're describing.  1. With our platform you will be able to send aid with karmo tokens, through the humanitarian causes that are working with the Opakeco Foundation. You will have full insight in what resources will be aqcuired with your tokens.  2. As a token holder, you can initiate a proposal which can be voted upon. (Example: Would like the foundation to focus resources on Tsunami at country X)  3. You will be able to set up a project/crowdfund Karmo tokens with other token holders.  The Foundation will focus on making sure everything is transparent and accountable, however we do not choose for what humanitarian cause the resources are spent. You as a token holder will decide that.",False
