Impossibility to buy cryptocurrency directly. In order to enter a digital exchange, one generally needs to first purchase cryptocurrency from intermediaries at an elevated price. A trader’s losses in this case range from 2% to 15% (sometimes even more). Complicated mechanisms of digital exchanges. Overloaded exchange interfaces are aimed at experienced traders. They impede the development of the cryptocommunity due to their very steep learning curve. High risks when trading at an exchange. Even for skilled traders, an exchange is associated with high risks: it is very difficult to account for all the factors and achieve the desired result – that is, buy or sell cryptocurrency at an optimal price.   2.) High prices when buying directly through an exchanger. A trader wishing to purchase cryptocurrency for fiat has to confront high intermediary fees and commissions for deposits and withdrawals, ranging between 2% and 8%. Our platform provides a complex solution to all these issues. We offer the best exchange terms and a high degree of automation; all that a trader will need to control personally is the transfer of funds into his or her account.",False

In order to enter a digital exchange, one generally needs to first purchase cryptocurrency from intermediaries at an elevated price. A trader’s losses in this case range from 2% to 15% (sometimes even more). Complicated mechanisms of digital exchanges.  Overloaded exchange interfaces are aimed at experienced traders. They impede the development of the cryptocommunity due to their very steep learning curve. High risks when trading at an exchange. Even for skilled traders, an exchange is associated with high risks: it is very difficult to account for all the factors and achieve the desired result – that is, buy or sell cryptocurrency at an optimal price.  High prices when buying directly through an exchanger. A trader wishing to purchase cryptocurrency for fiat has to confront high intermediary fees and commissions for deposits and withdrawals, ranging between 2% and 8%. Our platform provides a complex solution to all these issues. We offer the best exchange terms and a high degree of automation; all that a trader will need to control personally is the transfer of funds into his or her account.",False
