Besides being a blockchain-based data sharing infrastructure and payment system for the travel industry, TravelerToken (TLT) provides a shared technical and economic infrastructure that will form the basis of a new standard for business practices as monetary systems evolve away from fiat. To do that, the TLT system consists of a set of interlocking P2P protocols that will allow members to keep their data wherever they like, choose fine-grained access privileges, and yet query the entire network like a traditional relational database. Moreover, the TravelerToken is backed by real commerce, has a stabilizing built-in reserve and exchange mechanism and incentivizes demand by rewarding spending with automatic 'cashback' rewards. As a result, travelers can pay for all their travel needs and even have a convenient option for any sort of payment in local currencies without the hassles of Forex.  Hope that answers your question!

TLT’s mission is to join the leading travel and tourism companies, universities, and the open-source community in an effort to build up a shared technical and economic infrastructure.

Foundation goals  The primary goal is to provide a forum for stakeholders and contributing universities, technical institutes, and open-source developers to pool their efforts with the aim of building blockchain and smart-contract related technology for the travel industry.  Establishing a global standard for the travel industry based on blockchain technology Providing an application layer that works seamlessly within existing systems such as ERP, CRM, etc...  Reducing the overhead associated with intermediaries and payment settlement Nurturing a culture of transparency and cooperation among members of the consortium  How TLT is Going to Improve the Travel Industry  The core idea is to create a system which is scalable, borderless, democratic, and trustworthy. Blockchain technology allows TLT to create a federated, distributed network over the internet enabling a host of data sharing applications and enabling smart-contract based services, such as a joint asset registry and information access management. By reducing the number of parties involved in - and ultimately, the complexity of - online booking and worldwide payments, travel becomes easier and less expensive.  The TLT system will be operated by a consortium of airlines, hoteliers, transportation providers and other related businesses. Each member of the consortium can continue to use their preferred data storage strategy - TLT’s new peer-to-peer protocols simply connects their locally stored data into a single virtual directory, making it searchable and downloadable according to permissions.  Data integrity is ensured by the use of a modular blockchain architecture. The consortium will be governed by an open foundation, whose aim is to the further develop, maintain, and improve the infrastructure.  http://i67.tinypic.com/xlcy1v.png  Token distribution and funding  http://i65.tinypic.com/27xlyqe.png  Token Distribution 67 % Free Market 20 % Token Reserve 10 % Team, Advisors, Early Supporters 3% Bounty Program  Token Funding 35 % Research & Development 25 % Sales & Marketing 20 % Partner Acquisition 10% ETH Reserve 10 % Admin, Operations, Founding, Legal  Early Bird Discounts  http://i65.tinypic.com/30k8s9c.png                                                                                                  Pre-Sale: 23/04/2018 - 20/05/2018 30 % (Above 50 ETH) 20 % (1-50 ETH) 15 % (Below 1 ETH)  Public Sale: 21/05/2018 20 % (Above 50 ETH) 15 % (Below 1 ETH) 7.5 % (1-50 ETH)  Week 2+: 0 %  The Roadmap  http://i67.tinypic.com/nn4hau.png  Team  Thorben Biesenbach - CEO Nizar Qaabar- CTO Gunnar Maier - CSO Kathrin Funke - CBDO  Advisors  Franz Wollang - Managing Director at AllBlock Prashan Nagendra - CEO EFutures Private Limited Sven Schikarsky - Managing Director FTI Touristik  TLT’s Social Media channels  Facebook Twitter Telegram Instagram Reddit Medium",False

Travel More! ✈️,"   Hi there! Thank you for the insightful questions! The initial ERC20 token has a fixed supply and it is likely to see increasing demand as we onboard more commercial partners. Users will already be able to pay with the token anywhere using the debit card. Furthermore, 20% of the token supply is set aside for the long-term maintenance of the foundation and will not be touched for a long while. Moreover, participants in the closed sale who have made particularly large contributions are subject to a lockup period, thus they will not be able to just ""dump"" the coin right after the ICO.  As for your last question: The TLT system is a so-called 'protocol layer'. It comprises a collection of fast peer-to-peer protocols that provide a rich framework for arbitrary applications; the Standard Asset Registry and the TravelerToken itself are two applications we've already defined, but provisions for general distributed computation to user specification are included. As a network run by a consortium of businesses, who are all known entities, the expensive high-security consensus mechanism that public blockchain platforms use can be substituted for an extremely efficient consortium consensus algorithm similar to those used in large-scale data centers; it is highly modular and the incorporates the newest understanding of state dependencies, ownership, and validity conditions to improve latency and through-put to near optimal levels. Furthermore, given such a pool of relatively trusted peers, a cutting edge technique for distributed database searching can be implemented without concern for excessive security measures. This technique bypasses the traditional dichotomy of using a single central search structure or inefficiently replicating the search structure to every peer (as done in all current blockchain platforms). It does this by allowing semantic information to be encoded into the connectivity of the peers themselves, letting the same greedy algorithms that perform communications routing between peers also directly resolve requests for items organized by semantic features. The advanced database queries this enables are unheard of for a fully distributed system, and it allows for the businesses to set extremely fine-grained access/search permissions for all of their data (wherever they choose to store it). These few examples underscore the fact that the TLT system is not just an attempt to rip off other successful projects, but has been engineered from the ground up to provide the modern infrastructure real businesses need, right now, to enable innovation, cut costs, and provide their customers with the best and most customizable service possible. Therefore, our budget of 100,000 ETH is justified.",False

TravelerTokens’s mission is to join the leading travel and tourism companies, universities, and the open-source community in an effort to build up a shared technical and economic infrastructure. This new infrastructure represents a simplified standard that not only minimizes costs to the customer but gives businesses the tools they need to stay with the times.

Upon reaching the hard cap, the token generation event will end immediately. Then, they will be transferable once the token generation event is completed, following this distribution: 67% free market, 20% Token reserve, 10% Team, Advisors, Early supporters, 3% Bounty Program.
