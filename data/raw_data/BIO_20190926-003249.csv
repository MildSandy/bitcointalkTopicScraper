How are the funds handled?  The BIO token sale is being run on Oracles.org ICO Wizard. The smart-contract set up with the wizard locks down the multi-sig wallet after 5 contributors.

The available amount of BIO during ICO has been reduced to 5,000,000 BIO plus the reserved amount for bounties, devs and previous contributors from last contract. At the current rate, the token sale will bring in 1,666.66 ETH and at the current price is $604,133.33 if sold out before the next price increase. This cap is a more realistic amount for such an unknown and small team and just hope some people are willing to take that chance for a long-term small investment. The lower amount of available BIO also opens up the supply and demand market when our first product on the Ethereum Network is put to use and I can assure you that it will. Please, take that chance, just because we don't have tens of thousands of dollars saved up and put towards our sale, doesn't mean we don't have potential.  I understand that our website is not very appealing, not enough information and no actual whitepaper, but that is because we do not know which way to go with this right now. If we want to deliver our promised product, it wouldn't be finished for a while due to testing a new system to make sure it would be secure enough to handle actual payments without needing your phone or card with you. Our focus has moved to a much simpler project to begin and earn a community with a live product, we will be releasing full details and possibly a first release, before the end of the year.  The new project will solve many issues that will soon arise with the new businesses coming to blockchain like insurance companies, medical businesses, governance situations, taxables and federally adopted payment systems by providing additional identity mechanisms through smart-contract technology and able to verify identities on the Ethereum network and any BRIDGED private networks associated with the EVM.  I have left my personal facebook page and email on the ""Contact"" page at biopaycoin.com in case anyone is interested, but scared to invest. With the help of many people contributing micro amounts can help bring a team together and speed up development because I won't lie, we need the extra developers. Everyone investing in BioPayCoin will know exactly who made the website and posted here on BTC and I can promise that, given the chance for once in MY life, I know I can do great things. Even if the main idea does not get released for an entire year, I KNOW our work in progress will be a big hit. It will come in a Dapp form, allowing anybody on the Ethereum network or private networks BRIDGED through Parity to use. I will do whatever is necessary to make a successful business providing many open source projects for the community, we just need that chance to assemble a team for many reasons.  Every day I look through the upcoming ICO's and I am amazed. The creativity/insanity from some of these projects, sometimes having NO NEED for a token, nevermind 200 million dollars with their main product already launched. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of good ones out there, but the ratio is very small, I know that given the chance and in time, BioPayCoin could be a great underdog. My point is, even the ICO's that have no need for an ERC20 token can earn almost 20k contributors and tens of millions of dollars, mainly because they put together a nice looking website and paid tens of thousands of dollars to advertise. So why can't we do it? Well we didn't have that opportunity, I just discovered Bitcoin 8 months ago and introduced my partner to it, shortly after and with me having a large family to take care and provide for, there's not much to invest with.  So far there has only been 6 contributors, one of which participated in the original not-so-smart-contract I had posted who will be receiving double for early participation and if ends up being in top 100, will receive an additional 100% of the original investment. BIO's initial price was 1000BIO/1ETH and was raised to 5000BIO/1ETH with the new manageable contract. Every ~3 weeks the amount of BIO per ETH dropped 1000 and is currently at 3000BIO/1ETH which means basically 200% bonus right now, still, for ~18 more days.  Head over to BioPayCoin.com now to check out the Token Sale or invest right on the ""Invest"" page using MetaMask Wallet. If you do not have Metamask, you can use any other ERC20 Compliant Wallet that you control the private key of. Instructions on how to invest using ""MyEtherWallet"" ""Parity"" and ""Metamask without ICO Wizard"" can be found on the ""How To"" page on BioPayCoin website.
