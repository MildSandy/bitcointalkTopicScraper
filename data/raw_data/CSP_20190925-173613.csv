Caspian Project Breakdown The brainchild and joint venture between Tora Trading Services Limited — a leading global cloud-based technology provider — and Kenetic Trading Systems Limited — a leading blockchain and crypto investment firm — Caspian is striving to institutionalize crypto asset management by way of a full-stack cryptocurrency trading and risk management platform.  Thanks to Caspian, digital asset investors will be equipped with an inclusive Risk Management System (RMS), Position Management System (PMS), and Order and Execution Management System (OEMS) at their fingertips.  Caspian will also provide interoperability and sophisticated connectivity to the digital asset exchange ecosystem.  At its core, Caspian can be organized into 3 overarching categories, all set to meet the needs and inadequacies of our present-day cryptocurrency trading space:  Execution: Provides OEMS for access to major digital exchanges for traders and portfolio managers, a Smart Order Router (SOR) for the visualization of single pool liquidity across exchanges, customizable user-built strategies for traders to define order management (via rule-based language), and a configurable alerts mechanism for users seeking to define conditions under which specific alerts are triggered.  Position and Risk Management: Provides PMS and RMS for users to monitor their positions, exposures, and P&Ls, recordkeeping functions to perform reconciliations, and an allocation engine for users to achieve the best execution of an order (e.g. ability to define order on a per-share, per-NAV, or percentage basis).  Compliance and Reporting: Provides a low latency (with extensive functionality) compliance engine for users seeking to define limits and rules for both pre-trade and post-trade workflows, reporting engine for trade files, position data, audit reports, snapshot reports, and compliance reports, and an online dashboard for graphing, order status, and margin reports (to name a few).    Furthermore, Caspian sanctions users to analyze all of their trades in a single place, regardless of the original exchange where the transaction took place on — ultimately driving exchange liquidity and volume across the sector.    Simply put, Caspian is a complete asset management solution, covering the entire lifecycle of a trade, all the while enabling investors to seamlessly navigate fragmented exchange ecosystems.

Accompanying this is the announcement that the platform is now live and no longer in beta testing.  Caspian also revealed it has 170 institutional-grade customers interested in on-boarding to its platform, with 15 customers already using it — perhaps the strongest signal yet that financial institutions are ready to embrace cryptocurrencies.  It’s significant news for a crypto investment community that is looking to Caspian — which has a community numbering almost 100,000 — to spark an influx of institutional investors that could in turn lead to rapid growth in the cryptocurrency market.  Caspian’s platform provides a single interface into all major crypto exchanges, as well as real-time and historical P&L and exposure tracking. The system has been designed to meet the needs of institutional investors who need to execute trades and maintain target allocations across many exchanges.  Pre-sale investors and customers include Galaxy Investment Partners, Global Advisors, Octagon Strategy, Kenetic, Techemy Capital and Bletchley Park.  Caspian recently entered into strategic partnerships with Blocktower and Galaxy Digital Capital Management, led by Bitcoin evangelist Mike Novogratz.  Novogratz said: “We believe institutional investors will drive exponential growth in the cryptocurrency market, and Caspian are becoming a big part of this story. We’re excited to be in partnership with them and expect exciting developments over the next few months.”  Caspian is now connected to over 24 different exchanges including Binance, Bitmex, Bitfinex, Gemini, Coinbase, Huobi and OKex.  Coinciding with public sale of the CSP token, the Caspian platform is now live and no longer in beta. This will give purchasers of the CSP token who have on-boarded to the Caspian platform the ability to maximise its utility from day one.  The public sale of the CSP token takes place on October 3, with interested parties encouraged to join the whitelist as soon as possible in order to avoid disappointment.

As part of the deal, Caspian will integrate with Coinbase Prime to bring additional sophisticated trading and portfolio management functionality to Coinbase’s customer base, with the possibility for further integrations in the future. The partnership builds on Coinbase’s extensive range of institutional product offerings, which include Coinbase Prime and Coinbase Custody, and its Institutional Coverage Group.  “We’re delighted to cement this important partnership with Coinbase, which will see one of the world’s leading digital currency trading venues join forces with one of the most exciting emerging crypto platforms. Our goal at Caspian has always been to make it is as frictionless as possible for professional traders and investors to trade and manage portfolios of cryptocurrencies in order to drive exponential growth in this market and we’re delighted that Coinbase shares this vision,” said Robert Dykes, CEO of Caspian.  Caspian is a joint venture between Tora and Kenetic that provides institutional grade trade order, execution, compliance and risk management features to meet investors’ regulatory and operational needs. It currently connects to 25 major crypto-trading platforms, including Coinbase, BitMEX, Gemini, Bitfinex, Poloniex, Huobi, OKEx, BitFlyer and Binance.  Coinbase is the most trusted and easiest to use suite of tools and services for consumers, professional investors and institutions to buy, sell, trade, store, access and utilize cryptocurrency in more than 33 countries.

San Francisco, 2 October 2018. Caspian, the full-stack crypto trading and risk management platform for professional traders and investors, has partnered with B2C2, the cryptocurrency market maker and liquidity provider, in a move that makes life much easier for larger investors wanting to increase their exposure to cryptocurrency markets.  “B2C2 is one of the largest crypto market makers and it is therefore great to have them as a partner. Our goal is to build an ecosystem of partners that can help sophisticated traders to work effectively and efficiently, so we are very happy to have B2C2 adding to our offer,” said Robert Dykes, CEO of Caspian. The partnership is significant because of the liquidity that these kind of investors need if they are to move further into cryptocurrency markets. While Caspian provides a suite of tools designed to make accessing and trading these different markets much more easy, B2C2 is experienced in providing the OTC liquidity that this type of investor requires. Users of the Caspian platform will be able to “point and click” trade liquidity streamed by B2C2 via API connectivity directly into Caspian.  “We’re delighted to be joining Caspian as they seek to increase institutional involvement in crypto trading. Many retail brokerage firms already trust us to provide liquidity for their crypto trades and we believe the multi-functional Caspian platform will appeal to these clients too,” said Max Boonen, Director and Co-Founder of B2C2. While the OTC liquidity nature of the partnership is unique, B2C2 is the latest in a long list of companies that have joined the Caspian ecosystem. As well as a recent partnership with Coinbase, the trading platform is actively partnering with wallet providers, exchanges, custody services and more to attract institutional investors to their platform and to the crypto industry in general.  Caspian’s crypto trading platform has been specifically designed to meet the needs of larger investors who are implementing a diverse strategy that currently requires them to execute trades and maintain target allocations across many exchanges. The fragmentation of crypto-exchanges creates liquidity and slippage issues, as well as a challenging audit and compliance environment.  B2C2 was founded in 2015 by Director and Co-Founder Max Boonen, after he left his job as a fixed-income trader at Goldman Sachs. It works with hedge funds, asset managers, brokers and family offices to facilitate large OTC crypto trades between big investors. B2C2 provides 24/7/365 liquidity for trades from at least 0.01BTC, and executes hundreds of trades per second.",False

The Latest update on CSP distribution.    We are currently in discussion with a number of digital asset exchanges that are interested in potentially listing CSP.  Any such listing is not guaranteed.  It also carries a range of requirements that the Caspian team will need to fulfil. We fully support and respect the due diligence process that the digital asset exchanges are undertaking.  At this time we plan to unlock CSP tokens to purchasers in our token sale in tandem with CSP being listed on one or more exchanges.  We believe this approach will help ensure the integrity of any market for CSP and reduce the risk of any fraudulent or manipulative schemes before that takes place.  It will also complement the existing measures we have taken to protect the integrity of CSP distribution, including under the contractual pre-distribution restrictions in the Terms and Conditions.  We stress that Caspian, Ltd does not support purchasing CSP or trading CSP for speculative reasons.  But we appreciate that an exchange listing has an important role to play in ensuring access to CSP by those who need it.  We also believe that the availability of sound trading venues supports market integrity generally.  At this stage, we expect that CSP may be listed around mid-December2018.  We will update you if that changes.   More information can be found in the official telegram group.",False

The appointment comes as Caspian also announced a number of milestones, as it establishes itself as the platform that enables sophisticated traders to operate more efficiently and effectively in cryptocurrency markets.  The company has announced that it now connects to more than 25 exchanges and has 12 funds on its beta platform, with 8 more clients expected later this month. It also said that it will be adding its first Over The Counter (OTC) desk as a destination later this month.  Finally, Caspian has announced that it is allowing for a defined composite order book that aggregates and displays liquidity from more than 20 exchanges with the ability to trade against it using the Caspian Smart Order Router (SOR).  Speaking about his appointment, Ari Paul, whose BlockTower cryptocurrency investment firm is becoming a strategic partner to Caspian, said: “Until now, cryptocurrency has mostly been limited to individual investors. Caspian provides tools that make it far easier for institutions to trade cryptocurrency and manage risk. I’m excited for the increasing institutional participation in cryptocurrency trading and investing that will be facilitated by tools like Caspian.  “Caspian is an important part of the infrastructure necessary to usher in institutional participation in cryptocurrency. I’m excited to see the infrastructure being built that will support institutional participation in cryptocurrency markets.”  Paul, the former portfolio manager for the University of Chicago’s $8 billion endowment, founded BlockTower with Matthew Goetz, an engineer who worked in investment management at Goldman Sachs for 11 years.  Caspian’s multi-asset trading platform has been designed to meet the needs of institutional investors who are implementing a diverse crypto-currency strategy that currently requires them to execute trades and maintain target allocations across many exchanges.  Caspian provides investors with a comprehensive Order and Execution Management System, Portfolio Management System, and Risk Management System, backed by customer support.  Robert Dykes, CEO of Caspian, added: “We are very pleased to welcome Ari to the team of advisors as we build the leading full-stack crypto trading platform for institutional investors and sophisticated traders.”  “He brings a wealth of highly relevant experience to Caspian and I am really looking forward to working with him as we move into the next stage of our project.”  Stay tuned for further updates on Caspian by following us on Medium and Twitter or join our Telegram.",False
