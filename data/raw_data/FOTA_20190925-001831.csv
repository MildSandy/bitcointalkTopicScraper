It’s a great honor for Fortuna Blockchain Research Center @Zhejiang University to have Professor Zhong Shao, Department Chair of the Computer Science Department at Yale University and Co-founder of Certik, Professor Wenzhi Chen, Director of IT Center for Zhejiang University, Brian Cai, Founder of Fortuna, Shengqing Zhu, Founder of DCC. Xiaoxiao Song, Co-founder of DATA, all delivered their keynote speeches. Jianliang Shao, general manager of Blockchain business division at Canaan, Xizhi Pan, COO of JD Cloud Blockchain Lab, Kim Seongkee, Co-founder of MoFAS attended the roundtable forum after the keynote speeches. This seminar marks the debut of CertiK here in China and the first collision of ideas between Yale and Zhejiang University Alumni in the blockchain field. Also, it is the first meetup that gathered CertiK, Fortuna, DATA and DCC, the four Blockchain projects established by Yale Alumni. During the seminar, all the attendees had heated discussion in terms of blockchain security, financial application of Blockchain, the meaning of blockchain to data, etc.    CertiK is a blockchain project famous for formal verification of smart contract. Professor Zhong Shao attended this meetup as the Co-founder of CertiK, and he delivered a keynote speech which was named “Building Fully Trustworthy Smart Contract and Blockchain Ecosystem”. He indicated that we could conduct formal verification by splitting big program or system into small modules. CertiK can verify whether the smart contract is complete and secure effectively. Meanwhile, he also thinks that the blockchain technology is still in its early development stage. As the gradual improvement of expandability and trading performance, the complexity of the system will be much higher. Therefore, the needs for safety hazard prevention and formal verification of smart contract will be much more substantial. Formal verification, as a mature technology in the safety field, has been successfully applied to many areas. If we make use of it in the blockchain world, then the security, consistency, intelligibility, programmability of a smart contract will be way higher. So that’s why CertiK has spent tons of time and energy into doing this thing.    In the past two years, China’s blockchain technology has been rising and was even leading in the international arena. Under this circumstance, high-level universities driven blockchain technology and projects can’t be neglected, especially blockchain projects created by Zhejiang University alumni. Professor Wenzhi Chen, one of the leading figures in the blockchain technology research of Zhejiang University, also given an excellent sharing at the venue. He detailedly explained the advantages of applying DAG technology in the blockchain field for all the attendees. Also, he denoted that we’ll enhance privacy protection of blockchain through the way of adopting ring signature, zero-knowledge proof, etc.    Fortuna is the first Blockchain project created by Yale alumni. Brian Cai, its founder, delivered a keynote speech which was named “Derivatives Will Be the First Application of Blockchain Finance.” He denoted that the essence of finance rests with the value exchange in specific time and space. While the development of finance is moving forward all along under two main thread of enlarging the scope of value exchange and reducing the trading costs. So here, the blockchain, as the only technology that was endowed with a full set of financial system, has undoubtedly contributed a lot to those two aspects. For example, a blockchain-based token is currently the most effective means of asset securitization around the world. While for the reason why derivatives are most likely to be the first application of blockchain finance, they are as follows: Firstly, the pointcut of financial derivatives is well-focused. Secondly, it will never be restricted by existing ecological bottleneck problems, such as putting data and asset on the chain. Fortuna, as the forerunner and pioneer in this field, is now poaching world-level talents from Wall Street, Chicago, etc. We aimed to revolutionize the financial derivatives world with the blockchain technology.    Distributed Credit Chain (Known as DCC for short), is world’s first distributed public chain for banking. DCC is dedicated to building a distributed ecosystem for global financial service institutions. Also, it aims to realize benefit-for-all finance through a distributed-bank financial system globally. During the seminar, Shengqing Zhu, Founder of DCC, delivered a keynote speech which was named “ Solution for Financial Systematic Risks: Distributed Credit.” He noted that you would never know how valuable your credit data is going to be. Here, DCC can help you maximize the value of your credit data.    DATA, which aims to solve the trust issues among users in the digital ecosystem with the use of blockchain technology, is another excellent project created by Yale alumni. Xiaoxiao Song, its co-founder, delivered a keynote speech which was named “Blockchain — the New Backbone of Digital Ecosystem.” He indicated that the current digital ecosystem is entirely a mess while DATA will dive more in-depth in this field with decentralized layer data protocol driven by AI technology and P2P mobile storage architecture.    After the sharing part, with Brian Cai as the host, Professor Zhong Shao, Department Chair of the Computer Science Department at Yale University and Co-founder of Certik, Professor Wenzhi Chen, Director of IT Center for Zhejiang University, Brian Cai, Founder of Fortuna, Shengqing Zhu, Founder of DCC.

Jianliang Shao, general manager of Blockchain business division at Canaan, Xizhi Pan, COO of JD Cloud Blockchain Lab, Kim Seongkee, Co-founder of MoFAS attended the roundtable forum. They had an in-depth discussion regarding blockchain knowledge, security, performance, differences between China and U.S, differentiated investment philosophy in the internet era, etc.      Fortuna’s meetup is a meetup series hosted by Fortuna Blockchain Research Center @Zhejiang University on a regular basis. We invited famous scholars from both home and abroad this time.

In response to the spirit and instructions of Zhejiang Provincial Government’s Blockchain Technology and Application Conference and the Governor of Zhejiang Province, Yuan Jiajun, “Building blockchain innovation highlands, building blockchain application highlands, creating a blockchain talents highlands and building a blockchain development ecosystem”.  On May 26 2018, Zhejiang University Fortuna Blockchain Center was founded. Director of Zhejiang University Information Technology Center, Professor of College of Computer Science and Technology, ZJU (Former Associate Dean) and Doctoral Supervisor Chen Wenzhi will serve as the directors of the Zhejiang University Fortuna Blockchain Center. Additionally, they will also serve as a strategic consultant for Fortuna.     Director Chen Wenzhi and Brian Cai, the founder of Fortuna delivered a keynote speech at the ceremony.     Thus far, Zhejiang University has applied for 6 blockchain patents and published 7 blockchain papers. They are in the lead compared to many domestic universities. At the same time, Zhejiang University will begin a blockchain and digital currency course for the more senior undergraduates and postgraduates in September this year. This is the first blockchain-related course offered by domestic Chinese universities. On top of that, Zhejiang University will also consider the addition of blockchain-related professional orientations and set up corresponding postgraduate courses to cultivate research talents.  In the field of blockchain, the strength of Zhejiang University can’t be underestimated. From alliances with chain technology experts/enterprises to several blockchain financial enterprises, from experiments and research institutes to investment agencies, Zhejiang University has a large number of people with influence and power.  To name a few: Huang Butian (founder of YUNPHANT BLOCKCHAIN), Li Wei (founder of Fun Chain), Wu Sijin (founder of 33.CN), Zhang Xiaodong (co-founder of Fortuna), Xie Hanjian (co-founder of Cryptape), Du Yu (director of Wanxiang blockchain laboratory), Zhang Yifeng (dean of ZHONGCHAO blockchain technology research institute) and Chen Weixing (founder of FUNCITY Capital).  Milestones and a New Starting Point  At the inaugural ceremony, Director Chen Wenzhi stated that blockchain technology, as a new revolutionary database technology, will help transform the Zhejiang provincial government on different levels. It also exerts significant influence on Zhejiang’s provincial government’s work, industrialization and people’s lives in general. The establishment of a blockchain research center between Fortuna and Zhejiang University is both a milestone and a new starting point. The two parties will play their respective advantages and will promote blockchain technology adoptation at the application level.         The Integral between the square  At the ceremony, Brian Cai, founder of Fortuna, stated that there is too much opaqueness and indirectness, to high cost and low efficiency in the traditional financial sector. The blockchain technology is a new type of financial technology depriving trust and a distributed database technology that is difficult to falsify. It will have an immense impact on the financial sector. Fortuna hopes to develop a financial public chain of BAAS architecture with good storage security, risk isolation, good transaction performance and create comprehensive distributed financial activities. At the same time, unlike other public chains, Fortuna hopes to dig deeper into the sub-sector market for OTC financial derivative products to create a well-experienced distributed financial application. This to refine its own technological development capabilities for distributed financial activities and then look for partners with related resources and operational experience who will work together to co-create these financial activities, including distributed banking, mutual insurance, family trust and asset securitization. The Blockchain research center between Fortuna and Zhejiang University will give full play to the advantages of school-enterprise cooperation. They will use blockchain technology and focus on issues such as the peer-to-peer trust mechanism in the financial market, the issue of guarantee-cost reduction and transaction efficiency issues. Fortuna and Zhejiang University hope to open up a new road for the application of blockchain in the financial sector.    Let’s wait and see, in the days to come, what the collaboration between Fortuna and Zhejiang University will bring. How will we shape the future of blockchain finance?

Fortuna is the world’s first project of this kind and the first blockchain project of the Yale Alumni.  Fortuna got itself started with OTC derivatives, and has put all its energies into FOTA in 2018. We want to build world’s most professional futures and options trading platform with license and compliance certification. To be more specific, we aim to build another J.P. Morgan in the new era.       Besides, Brian also mentioned that we’re in an era with booming financial derivatives. We need to seize the development opportunities brought by Blockchain technology. China is undoubtedly a financial derivatives market with the highest potential; the detailed reasons are as follows:  Firstly, the percentage of institutional investment has gradually improved. Secondly, China has opened its market wider to foreign countries. Thirdly, the underlying securities market has continuously expanded. To be more specific, we now have a securities market of dozens of dollars and a share market of the same scale. Fourthly, the derivatives tools have been further enriched. In Brian’s point of view, all the profiteering part created by infomediaries and trust intermediaries can be eliminated through blockchain technology.    FORTUNA Blockchain Research Center at Zhejiang University won ‘Academy of the Year’ ‘Board of Fame’ industrial award ceremony of the World Blockchain Conference (Wuzheng) has been held this afternoon. We want to send our sincere congratulations to FORTUNA Blockchain Research Center at Zhejiang University, Blockchain Academy of Huobi, Blockchain Technology Research Institute of China’s Banknote Printing And Minting Corp., Blockchain Engineering Institute of OK for winning the ‘Annual research center’ prize together.    On Jun 26th, Zhejiang University has established an official partnership with Fortuna and build its first school-level joint blockchain research center. Fortuna, based in Hangzhou-the No.1 city for blockchain, has carried out all-round cooperation and exploration with Zhejiang University.    Website: www.fota.io Email: hi@mail.fota.top",False

What’s the relation between Fortuna and Fota?  Fota is a mostly centralized platform and Fortuna is Fota’s next decentralized iteration. In laymen’s terms, we will slowly move modules of Fota to our main net and make other necessary additions/optimization eventually we will have Fortuna.  2. Will there be any incentives on the centralized platform for the Fota token?  Yes, there are two main reasons. On the one hand, we have analyzed the situation from both a technical and a financial perspective, and have decided that going straight to a DAPP would not be smooth and intuitive. Just look at BTS and some other decentralized exchanges. They face many problems. And our solution is more complicated that those exchanges since a derivative platform is multitudes more complicated than an coin exchange (exchange for the underlying). For example, a mature margin system takes CME 200 people 5 years to complete. On the other hand, a better approach is to start from a centralized platform and slowly move modules of it on the chain. For example, given the current technological capability of DLT matching algorithm of traditional exchanges are much more efficient and suitable than doing so on chain. However, we could slowly move ledgering and data storage on chain and thus makes transaction history enjoy the benefits of the blockchain tech which I believe I don’t have to elaborate since you all probably know (traceability, immutability etc.) but eventually everything will be decentralized and by that time the DLT tech would be much more mature given the speed at which it evolves.  3. The circulating volume is around 4.15 billion right now. Why does it keep increasing lately, Z.T.?  If you look at the top 2 addresses, especially the top 1 address of Fota. Most of the out transactions are small, usually around a few scores of hundreds. These are mostly used to give incentives and rewards to the community in addition to that one of our early seed investors got a portion of his shares of Fota lately and those are the main reasons we see the supply increase. The team have yet used the foundation for any other reasons.  4. What is the current plan for attracting institutional traders once the platform is live?  Even though our focus is now on retail investors at the current stage, we are indeed also talking to some institutional investors such as market-makers in the Chinese OTC equity option market and the exchanges and capitals in Singapore.  5. Do you see yourself partnering with one of these institutions?  Yes, for sure. We are building relationships with those institutions but the actual collaboration would have to wait for Fortuna.  6. Do you think Fota will be a product with an excellent user experience?  I think Fota will be a great product. We put a lot of thoughts on it. When I designed it, the goal is to make it professional but easy to use. Mostly importantly, the system of Fota, unlike those of some other derivative exchanges, are not a make-shift idea. For example Fota’s margin system is mathematically complete, a feature I don’t see on any other crypto futures/derivatives exchanges. It has to do with measure theory so I am not going into details on that this time. but maybe sometime we can discuss this with math savants.  7. I know you mentioned that we would partner with Certik. When will that happen?  In fact, we already have a partnership with Certik. We even started a organization called Yale Consensus. We are working with Certik to provide an API for users of Fortuna to use Certik’s formal verification services.  8. Hey, Z.T, I was wondering what are the bottlenecks that Fortuna is facing right now?  I don’t think there is any bottleneck but there are indeed lot of details to work out. This is why we are choosing the route of doing Fota first and then transition to Fortuna. A lot of the modules of Fota can be reused in Fortuna and we expect to learn a lot from our experience making Fota.  9. How can we access to your tech team directly? Will there be a help desk or something like that?  Unfortunately the only way to access technical support for BlackFriday is to talk to admins here first. This is due to the fact that BF is just a usable prototype. We intended it as a demo however we made it usable anyways. If you have any trouble with it, feel free to contact admins here. For Fota however, we will have a full support team and customer representatives.  10. ZT, the other day you mentioned you were meeting JD on a business trip. Can you share any details on this and does it pertain to Fortuna?  Yes, I met the head JD.com’s blockchain lab on my trip to Beijing. Their focus is on data. In other words, they would be a data provider like Bloomberg for cryptos. We are still discuss how we could work with them tho but currently we have no solid plan for that yet.  11. Can anyone create a derivatives product on the Fortuna platform? What’s the process for adding investment products to the platform?  You would use the contract templates provided by other nodes of Fortuna in order to do so. Furthermore, if no current templates are suitable for your specific derivative, you can create your own template. This requires some coding and professional knowledge but will also earns you Fota as incentives.  12. Any advises on personal investment in the blockchain field?  This is a difficult question haha. I wish I could answer that here but that would be irresponsible. This deserves a whole session, haha.  13. Does Fortuna use Fota to pay its payroll?  Great question. Actually that is the second reason I haven’t had the chance to mention yet. and yes it does. The second reason for use to make Fota first is to generate steady cashflow since we do not fleece retail investors.  14. What are the major markets of Fortuna?  The derivative market is huge. This question also depends on how you catagorize “markets” (by underlying assets or geographically etc). We currently have plans for cryptos and equity options/futures market. With a focus on jurisdictions with a more open mindset on the blockchain tech. To be specific, we are working on acquiring licenses in Singapore, UAE, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. The largest market are definitely North America and China, but they also have very strict regulation regime. So our plan is to start from more friendly places and when we could prove our model and products we will spend more resources on those bigger markets. The above answer is for Fortuna. For Fota, since we are focused on cryptos, our target market is the entire crypto community.  15. Will you poach some more talented people from other companies? On this note, could you tell us a bit about Wei Zhu’s role in the company and how he will contribute to Fortuna.  With him, my team (Finance/Quant team) works a lot more efficiently since I cannot do everything myself. Currently he is in charge of R&D on topics such as crypto market momentum, market microstructure etc. He also helps a bit with our market-making strategies but his focus is more on research. We believe we need someone like him since research is also a very important aspect of the finance industry.  16. Would you be able to give the community a few points on who he is and where we poached him from?  He is the director of Derivatives at Credit Suisse, Wall Street. I got to know him from a common friend. We discussed what we do and he was quite impressed and interested and eventually he joined.  17. There are currently 70 team members, how much more do you plan on growing the team in the next 24 months?  24 month is a long time for the crypto community. We actually are planning on reaching 100 in 6 months.    Website: www.fota.io Email: hi@mail.fota.top",False

We won't know how much FOTA is worth until the main platform is launched in Q3 (or beforehand).  If the platform is successful, there could be a huge wave of traders who buy FOTA to trade derivatives on the platform (it will no longer just be speculators like you and I but actual traders who use FOTA to set up their positions and manage their risk).  A huge influx of traders into a relatively small coin could be massive.  I can't quantify it now, but I would focus on the underlying technology Fortuna is working toward.

My name is Liangbin (Brian) Cai, I’m founder and CEO of FORTUNA. I’ve started a series called ‘Founder Blogs’ to share some of the ideas me and my team have, that do not fit anywhere else. Welcome! After graduating from Yale University, I won first prize at the International Mathematical Contest in Modeling. I worked in various segments of the financial industry all around the world (New York, London, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Hangzhou), in the fields of investment banking, supply chain finance, Anglo-American law trusts, civil law trusts, and private banking. At the age of 26, I was able to work my way up in a state-owned bank. Prior to leaving, I was the general manager of the private bank and was responsible for over 30 billion in assets. After these great experiences, I decided it was time for something new, something bigger. That is when I founded Fortuna.  Update  Many friends have asked me what I am doing recently. It seems that they haven’t heard my voice for a while, I have been working tirelessly and have not been able to tell them about Fortuna yet. That is also why I originally chose to write “A Letter from Brian Cai（Founder and CEO of FORTUNA)”. To keep everyone up to date on what is going on.  I would like to start out and say that we have been very busy recently. Busy with building products and recruiting people. But especially with achieving the goals we had set for ourselves to be completed per the first quarter: the design and development of FORTUNA’s derivatives trading system of single-node version. Why will we start with a single-node version of the derivatives trading system (and not with a multi-node mainnet)? I am happy to share this with you and get a little technical:  Excellent methodology with both mobile internet and blockchain  The most powerful methodology of the mobile internet is the A/B version test. This simple and crude method was born in the mobile era and enables a company to try different versions simultaneously and compare results. It is a type of experimentation that is short, frequent, and fast. This methodology has become notorious for pushing out traditional companies that were focused on one-year-version updates.   One of the most important features of blockchain as an autonomous and self-managed distributed network is that it cannot be tampered with. Data can’t be tampered with, rules can’t be tampered with, and this means that many mobile internet era’s methods are not fully suitable for the blockchain domain. How to better inherit and use the excellent methodologies and tools of the mobile Internet? Personally, I think that using a single-node version as a trial and leveraging the rapid verification and continuous trial-and-error methodology can be very beneficial before publishing a fully distributed main net version.  Data formatting and risk control modeling  Some of the core components involved in managing derivatives are the risk control and pricing models. These models are so important that they are said to determine the survival of the investment companies that make derivatives their main business. Because of the quantitative complexity, the core of the derivatives-related companies is usually run by experts from the quantitative fields. After the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008, the quantitative risk management department and the model validation department started to play an increasingly more important role in many large organizations and hedge funds. To attune the quantitative models, it is important to have real historical data. So, how can we quickly accumulate historical data? Using a crawler is one method. Self-done accretion is another method. A single-node version of a derivatives market will become a great business data accumulation method. Just like our Chief Product Inspector Z. T. said, “Sooner or later, the digital currency space will also become a data processing and service company akin to Bloomberg. Given it’s bound to happen, why can’t it be us?”  Environmental Construction and Investors’ Education  In the past China’s derivatives exchanges had derivatives that linked to stocks, such as options and warrants. In 2005, the Chinese market had launched seven additional stock-linked warrants (similar to derivatives such as stock and options). It is said that at that time, relying solely on the trading volume of these seven warrants, China ranked first in the world in terms of trading volume of stocks and warrants. However, due to the failure of investors’ education at that time, many investors did not know that warrants should be exercised on the exercise date. Many investors did not exercise their rights before the expiry of the exercise date, resulting in zero value of these warrants once they expired. This led to many unfortunate incidents. Fortuna’s (single-node) derivatives trading platform will prioritize beneficial and simple derivatives: ‘Option Iron Butterfly’ and ‘Binary Synthetic Option’ based on mainstream digital currencies, and all options will have an “automatic exercise” mechanism that will be set up to avoid unnecessary trouble for investors.   In summary, designing and developing Fortuna’s single-node derivatives trading platform is not only an explanation of Fortuna’s vision, but more importantly the overall strategic deployment of Fortuna’s product. As I often say, the “technology roadmap” is very important. Promises and commitment are very important, but the most important thing must be the team and making the business tangible. Otherwise, all this is just a game of “weaving bubbles and dreams together”, leaving codes but leaving no productivity, creating memories but not making sense. In fact, the success or failure of a business often depends on the first ten people who joined the company. The advantage of starting with a small team is not in being small, but because you can choose members.   I remember an analogy from the book “Hackers and Painters.” It roughly says that big companies are like giant ancient Roman warships. One thousand crew members paddle at the same time to make the battleship go forward. However, there are two core factors that make this giant battleship unable to be fast: Firstly, nobody notices that their efforts to paddle makes the battleship move faster; Secondly, the speed of battleships depends on a thousand people, which greatly averages individual efforts and achievements.  Ancient Roman Battleship  If you select 10 people from a thousand people to make a relatively sized boat, it will move faster than the battleship itself. It will be faster, because working hard is encouraged, and inactiveness is discouraged. The boat is a cooperative park and athletic field that is naturally suitable for the survival of the fittest. At this point Fortuna has only existed for three months. As you can imagine this is a very short time spent for a project, let alone running a company. We have grown rapidly during this time and I have spent the most time and energy in attracting like-minded and talented people to join the party. I believe that this is one of the most important things in the development of Fortuna. Fortuna has now gathered a small group of powerful “fans” in their respective fields (blockchain technology, financial derivatives, trading systems, business operation, etc.) and together we are making progress very quickly. This is one of my happiest and proudest experiences. Thanks for reading and see you next time! Brian Cai.

My name is Liangbin (Brian) Cai, I’m founder and CEO of FORTUNA. I’ve started a series called ‘Founder Blogs’ to share some of the ideas me and my team have, that do not fit anywhere else. Welcome!  After graduating from Yale University, I won first prize at the International Mathematical Contest in Modeling. I worked in various segments of the financial industry all around the world (New York, London, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Hangzhou), in the fields of investment banking, supply chain finance, Anglo-American law trusts, civil law trusts, and private banking. At the age of 26, I was able to work my way up in a state-owned bank. Prior to leaving, I was the general manager of the private bank and was responsible for over 30 billion in assets. After these great experiences, I decided it was time for something new, something bigger. That is when I founded Fortuna.  Can you tell me something about the direction blockchain is going?  Whenever you ask someone if they know bitcoin, the answer is yes, however many are unaware of blockchain and many of the other coins and tokens. Sometimes, talking to people outside of the blockchain industry feels like talking to “Muggles” from the Harry Potter franchise. They are not fully aware yet of the magic in our world.    However, in the past two months, more and more people around me started showing interest in ‘digital currency’. I also realized that the people started to believe more and more in the success of the blockchain technology. Today I’ll talk about how I turned into a blockchain “believer”! My first experience with blockchain was in 2013, I wanted to do an Utransfer project for Transferwise. The Utransfer project primary goal was to use the Internet to solve the problem of excessive cross-border exchange costs and too slow efficiency.  However, after communicating with the related departments at that time,  it came to light that this type of business could easily be characterized as an “evade foreign exchange control” (2013 RMB internationalization was not yet a major development strategy and foreign exchange control was very strict). Thus, the project never started. At that time, I noticed that a technology company named Ripple was listed at MIT Technology Review. Ripple used blockchain technology to solve the problem of cost and efficiency of cross-border payment. After that, the story must have been fully understood. Ripple is already the third largest blockchain project in the world. From that time on, I started to learn and understand the blockchain. As I was engaged in the financial industry, I became more aware of the blockchain industry. I began to really realize and recognize the blockchain and the value of blockchain’s Killer App “digital currency”.  The phenomenon of “rent-seeking costs” and “low efficiency” in the financial industry is too common. In a big jargon, it is “taking a lot of money, things are done slowly,” and the blockchain is not so much a subversion as it is an improvement. The degree of centralization is gradually weakened, allowing more people to “pay less money and do things faster.” In terms of space, I only share one case today: Commercial Bank (a form of modern credit organization-the most mainstream financial intermediary that is close to people’s lives), and its core business model and disadvantages. “The economic crisis is an inevitable product of the capitalist system”  In our childhood, the teacher taught us: “Marx said that the economic crisis is an inevitable product of the capitalist system.” However, as I grew up, I discovered that there are also economic crises in socialist countries. In fact, there have been about 60 economic crises in the history of mankind. Originating in the credit market, stock market, foreign exchange market, commodity market, etc. All are closely related to the proliferation of liquidity. The most important two ways of the proliferation of liquidity are M0 and M2.  The most basic business of commercial banks are deposits and loans (internal banks call it debt and asset businesses). However, how many people carefully considered the core difference between deposits and loans?  What is a loan? In short, it was the bank that gave me a sum of money. Over time, I returned it with interest to the bank.  What is a deposit? In a nutshell, it was me that gave the bank a sum of money. After a period, the bank returned it to me with interest.  Repeat the paragraphs mentioned above and you will find that, in addition to the different direction, the two are almost the same. In essence, A gives B a sum of money. Over time, B returns it to A with interest. So your deposit is actually not a “deposit”, but your loan to the bank. Therefore, your deposit appears as a “liability business.” in bank’s view. This business model may be one of the most intuitive and close-to-life sources of economic crisis from your side: commercial bank credit expansion.  “Interest” and “deposit” are incompatible  A long time ago, some wealthy families had hidden a lot of gold bars in their homes. To keep their gold safe they decided to buy a safe. They bought safes that were too big to house all the gold.    As a result, they began to accept the trust of their friends to keep their gold bars and charge some custodial fees accordingly. This resulted in the birth of earliest form of a “bank.” What are the responsibilities of this rich group with safes? They had to take care of the gold bars and keep them safe from others. What kind of fees did they charge? They charged safekeeping fees for housing the gold bars. Currently we deposit our monthly salary in the bank. Have you ever thought of giving the bank a custodial fee? On the contrary, the bank will pay you interests, and you will take it for granted. Why? Because everyone knows that the bank will take out deposits to lend out and make profit. This is the bank’s financial intermediary position and core business model.  Have you ever wondered whether the business model and the custodian’s responsibility are inherently contrary? Will you take your family’s sapphire necklaces in custody and allow others to use them casually? So why did you give your salary to the bank, knowing the bank would lend it to other? The answer is because the law allows it, and you are used to it.  The law allows banks to use the “law of large numbers” to make money. Banks feel that it is not necessary to leave all their money in the safe as they are, because it is unlikely that everyone will be able to withdraw everything on the same day. Thus the bank is able to take a portion of the deposit to loan. What is the difference between this and “fund misappropriation?” Actually, there is no difference between the two. Historical governments have legitimized this fund misappropriation through a “fractional reserve”. This “legitimate misappropriation” is the basis for the development of the bank and is also a feature of modern credit organizations. It’s also one of the root causes of the economic cycle. In our final analysis, if you think about it really thoroughly, you will find that interest and savings are out of tune.  As stated in the Introduction to the Business World:  “Bankers, Greedy Gluttons”   As a profit-seeking company, obtaining the privilege of legally misappropriating funds, the bank’s profitability will inevitably cause it to continuously absorb and lend. This is where the economic cycle starts. (this is the reason why various governments set up banking supervision departments). Because the bank’s lending activities are essentially a kind of currency creation behavior (money misappropriation), especially the lending of current deposits.  It is not the same as an investment. When you invest 10,000 yuan in cash to a company, you think that the company has 10,000 yuan in cash, but instead you have lost 10,000 yuan in cash, and some more equity. But when person deposits 10,000 yuan in cash in a bank, he may think that he still owns the 10,000 yuan, and he can withdraw it at any time. Immediately after the bank has already lent his 10,000 yuan to others. The borrower who got the bank a loan of 10,000 yuan also thinks that he already owns the 10,000 yuan. Therefore, at the time of lending, the world has somehow added 10,000 yuan “virtual currency”.  But this is not where the cycle ends. After the person who borrows 10,000 yuan pays 10,000 yuan to others, it will be re-deposited by another person to the bank for 10,000 yuan, and the bank will use it to lend again. Again the world has an additional 10,000 ”virtual currency”. This is the money creation ability of the so-called bank — the money multiplier.  It is exactly this credit expansion lacking savings that has consisted of the fundamental reason why our economy is in a cycle between prosperity and recession in the light of false prosperity, because credit expansion is bound to end with the credit crunch, just as people have joys and sorrows. In fact, until Cipolla’s Florentine Monetary Policy in 14th century came out, people gradually realized that there was another kind of “virtual currency” in society, that is, M2 we are now familiar with. From this point of view, take a look at the core value of Killer App “digital currency” in blockchain, I think it will be particularly interesting.  Thanks for reading and see you next time!

I really enjoy the Account page where you can see all of your positions and the estimated profit/loss at any time, tied to the price of BTC.  2. I wish we could enjoy some more charting features instead of just the 1 month, unless I am just bad at charts and cant figure out how to see daily view.  3. It would be great to be able to see past trading history.  This is the most important thing for me I think.  For example on May 4th when the first round of options expired, I was able to see my gains (pretty sweet), but could no longer see the positions I took in the first place.  The Account page seemed to reset which was alarming at first, until I checked my balance.  Would be great to be able to see past trades, as well as OVERALL gains rather than just the profit/loss in any given week.  Being able to export past trade data would be great too.  4. I think it would be super cool to be able to save some strategies that have worked for you in the past.  For example, maybe I bought 5 call options that were furthest OTM, and 2 put options ATM.  Would be great if I could quickly replicate those trades again (just a thought)  5. When actually purchasing options in the Trade tab, it's kind of buggy typing in the option price. for example if you type "".645"" for the price of the call, it autocorrects to 645 unless you put a 0 in front like ""0.645"".  I have learned this, and its fine now, but it was something I had to get used to and less intuitive.  6. Any insight into the profit mechanism would be helpful.  For example, if your options expire in the money is it a 1.2 x # of options payoff?  If they expire OTM do you just lose the price of the options or is it magnified?  Not sure if this is proprietary but the more transparent the better.  7. When I am making money on Black Friday, who is losing money (I know this is just a test phase and it wont always work this way)?? Are we just increasing the FOTA supply and issuing new coins here? Wondering if that could be the reason for the slight dip in FOTA value over the past week or so.  8. As my option portfolio value increases, it does leave me exposure to the price of FOTA.  Will be AWESOME when we can use a few more currencies.  Overall I've enjoyed the platform and the nice lil gains.  No response necessary, just my thoughts for your consideration.  Thanks!",False

As always, thanks for being a great community, and enjoy the read!  Founder Brian Cai’s Foreword  Dear Fortuna Community,  I want to take the opportunity to address some things in this weekly update. We have recently released the Black Friday platform and received a lot of feedback. I want to be clear that the Black Friday platform is only a testing platform. We use it to collect valuable data and users’ feedback, it is not an official version. In fact, from the domain name blackfriday.fota.top, it can be seen that Black Friday is only a transitional test version. Actually, this was mentioned in my forewords and weekly Fortuna news;  Secondly, I’d like to emphasize that since Black Friday is a test platform, most of our attention is spent on the development of the main network and the quantitative resource database of Fortuna. After the completion of the quantitative resource library, many more tools will be available. If we combine that with the feedback on the Black Friday platform we will have all we need to launch a formal version with high performance, high availability, asset security, sufficient mobility, and rich products, so stay tuned!   Thirdly, we have been recording weekly news video’s (see the links at the bottom of the page), but will switch to a slower rythm such as a monthly video, or a video once in a while, instead. We are making this change because we felt the results were not satisfying for the amount of effort we put in. In the future the video’s will capture interesting information on topic such as the R&D progress, product strategy and business plan and will be explained by the people who are in charge of these business segments.  -Visual FORTUNA-  You can check out our Fortuna Behind the Scenes #012 Here.  Technology Research and Development Decentralized Fortuna Platform: The minimum runnable version (called FirstBlood) of our multi node platform is undergoing testing and the multi-node connection has been approved.

Over the past last decade, the velocity of money has decreased as money doesn't change hands as quickly as it did in the past.  How is this possible with decent growth around the world and technological improvements?  Concurrently the gini coefficient has widened dramatically and the rich are getting richer, hoarding money, while the poor are get poorer.  Why does this matter?  Central banks (the bank that lends to the banks) print money out of thin air and this erodes the buying power of the people.  Why? because ultimately these dollars slip into the economy and push the price of goods up.  Venezuela is a great example of hyper-inflation.  This isn't too terrible if you are already wealthy, as you could find investments globally and live off of interest alone.  The average guy must work/hope for a pay raise, as costs increase indefinitely because of fiat printing.  Higher cost/price means more tax revenue.  So what can we do?  Find a sound currency, one that doesn't print money continuously.  Welcome! “virtual currency”.  Once a virtual currency (fixed supply Virtual Currency) is widely adopted, value will increase indefinitely as central banks print money.  The virtual currency will be a storage of value but when needed, this virtual currency could be exchanged for fiat to do business or buy goods if necessary.  The Future of Banking?  So in the future, some people may store their money at a bank while others may use a wallet with a basket of virtual currencies.  The future is at our fingertips.  ",False

Hello everyone! My name is Liangbin (Brian) Cai, I’m founder and CEO of FORTUNA. I’ve started a series called ‘Founder Blogs’ to share some of the ideas me and my team have, that do not fit anywhere else. Welcome!  After graduating from Yale University, I won first prize at the International Mathematical Contest in Modeling. I worked in various segments of the financial industry all around the world (New York, London, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Hangzhou), in the fields of investment banking, supply chain finance, Anglo-American law trusts, civil law trusts, and private banking. At the age of 26, I was able to work my way up in a state-owned bank. Prior to leaving, I was the general manager of the private bank and was responsible for over 30 billion in assets. After these great experiences, I decided it was time for something new, something bigger. That is when I founded Fortuna.  The comparison Our project is called “Fortuna”, and this refers to the goddess of luck in Roman mythology. If you happen to be a fan of Carl Orff, you must be familiar with “O Fortuna”. A beautiful song and a timeless classic. The abbreviation of our project and the name of our token is “FOTA”. It has often occurred that a comparison is drawn with IOTA when we first tell the name. On occasion, people have even jokingly compared the names and made the remark that we should become the IOTA of the financial sector and use the comparison in names to attract attention. We think that is a great idea!  We will fully exploit the possibility of comparing ourselves with the giant that IOTA is this very day: a big tree, made of fine materials and full of weight. Here we go: firstly, FOTA begins with the letter F which refers to the financial world. Secondly, IOTA’s pronunciation requires three syllables and FOTA only has two. In conclusion it should be easy for the reader to spot that FOTA is thus easier to pronounce, more pleasing to the ear, and requires a bit more ink.   (Just kidding).  To be honest, if we think about the “FOTA becoming the IOTA of the financial world” joke, or the FOTA will be “everything in the financial world” proposition, we find the idea quite significant. IOTA wants to be the “connection of everything” and to be this ultimate manifestation in the financial world, people worldwide must be able to freely trade and exchange various kinds of financial assets. Trading of course already happens on a large scale, and with it we have seen many difficulties arise. Blockchain technology can solve many problems, such as the problem of trust and efficiency, however the blockchain technology currently is incapable of solving the problem we refer to as “chaining of assets”. What I mean is, eventually with a well-developed blockchain infrastructure, asset registration and circulation it can become a very convenient and efficient trading platform / redemption market. However, it needs better adoption by businesses to get to that stage. Until then it will be difficult to digitize assets and exchange them on-chain.  A good example would be real estate. Real estate transactions are still based on real estate licenses and therefore no distributed community can chain real estate licenses without external cooperation. Another example are stocks. Stocks are still based on securities registration and settlement agencies, and therefore no distributed community can chain stocks without external cooperation. So, the difficulty lies nót in ensuring there is a trust mechanism and there is transactional efficiency in the chain of transactions, but in the how.  How to chain the assets?   (Just kidding)  If we take a closer look at the goal of asset trading and analyze it in detail, you find that people purchase assets only for two purposes: one is to use (i.e. a house) and the other is to invest. In the field of asset transactions, “investment” is more important than “usage”.  Derivatives are price contracts derived from basic assets. This contract is based on the future purchase or sales price of assets. When you purchase a derivative the only thing you need to do to increase value is to correctly judge the direction of the price of the asset. You do not need to hold or deliver the physical asset. For example, if you are optimistic about a hard-to-get stock and feel that the value will rise in the next three months you can use FOTA to buy a call option or forward linked to this stock. Without owning the stock, you can still make a profit if the price moves upward or downward depending on the type of derivative contract that you have purchased. Most asset transactions are based on price forecasting like this. As a blockchain facilitator for OTC derivatives transactions, Fortuna can thus open free trade and exchange in all areas of financial assets at this price contract level. Due to the nature of the Fortuna blockchain platform, all physical forms of basic assets do not need to be digitized and chained. Instead we exchange contracts that are negotiated for future trading prices. Determining the profit and loss depends only on the outcome of the future prices.  From this perspective, FOTA has avoided the biggest bottleneck in bringing assets to the blockchain. To return to the IOTA / FOTA gimmick. Until all asset classes in the world have been completely covered and infiltrated by blockchain technology, FOTA may be able to achieve the “connection of everything” in the financial world and it will be the IOTA of the financial world.  Thanks for reading and see you next time!  Brian Cai.",False

I worked in various segments of the financial industry all around the world (New York, London, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Hangzhou), in the fields of investment banking, supply chain finance, Anglo-American law trusts, civil law trusts, and private banking. At the age of 26, I was able to work my way up in a state-owned bank. Prior to leaving, I was the general manager of the private bank and was responsible for over 30 billion in assets. After these great experiences, I decided it was time for something new, something bigger. That is when I founded Fortuna.  Why did I create FORTUNA? Many people ask me: “with so many people focused on speculation, and little real knowledge about blockchain or financial derivatives, why would you want to create Fortuna?’’ In one sentence: To throw a stone into the OTC Derivatives pond and see what happens. If the stone ruffles the water, we should still feel comfortable. If waves start to rise, it will be great. And if earth-shattering disruption starts to take place, the view will be magnificent.  I have been telling others that we are a financial derivatives company that uses blockchain, rather than a blockchain company that has financial derivatives as a topic. Fortuna is not one of those companies holding the Blockchain hammer, looking to find nails to hit. Fortuna is also not a conceptual enterprise that simply replies to the blockchain hype.  Our team includes Bachelors, Masters, and PhD’s from Yale, Oxford, Columbia, Chicago and other top universities in the world. There are also elites from domestic and international large investment banks, top strategic consulting companies, private banks, hedge funds, and digital companies. We can gather together because everyone has a very strong sense of purpose and wants to create some real value in the financial industry. Because the financial industry is not transparent, direct, or fair “Make the World More Transparent” is our internal slogan. We chose to create Fortuna because we selected the entry for financial derivatives as the starting point for our campaign rather than blockchain. Several key points in the financial derivatives market are well-adapted to the blockchain’s technical system and economic thinking. Thus, FORTUNA was founded.    Why I chose OTC derivatives? Before answering the question, I would like to briefly explain the differences and merits and demerits between the “trading pit” and the “OTC trading” of derivatives.  Trading pit The Trading Pit refers to the ground floor trading you see in old movies, where you can pick up options and futures at a bargain and it is basically all-out war. The advantages of this are that using an exchange that works this way helps control your counterparty risk through their guarantee mechanism and margin account systems. The so-called opponents’ risk is the risk of opponents’ cheating; the disadvantage is that the exchange, rather than the user, decides on the kind of transaction. The same thing goes for the contract terms. More importantly, futures and options on the exchange are standardized contracts, this means that you can’t change any terms or trading elements. These exchanges are simply ‘take it, or leave it’, there is no room for a custom, personal, preference.  This brings us back to the original question, the OTC derivatives market, and why we chose this market as our entry point. First, especially looking overseas, the OTC derivatives market is attracting and mysterious. In 2016, the total global nominal value of OTC derivatives was $483 trillion. Compared to a global GDP of $74 trillion and various other industries, this shows you the immense scale of the global OTC derivatives market. A very interesting market for Fortuna to enter, especially since our home market China is only just beginning to scale up their derivatives market.    At the age of 26, I began to serve a cadre of divisions of the state-owned bank. Prior to leaving, I was the general manager of the private bank belonging to a state-owned bank. In those two years, I learned about domestic private hedge funds and the derivatives industry. The more I learned, the more I realized that the domestic derivatives market wasn’t perfect. I was born in the year 1988, at that time the National People’s Congress pointed out that: “developing various types of wholesale market trades and exploring futures”, is a potentially huge market. Although so far, all the Chinese derivatives exchanges combined, support only 48 varieties of derivatives (including futures and Intra-market options).    A more crucial point is that although there are only 48 varieties in China, adding the fact that there is high demand, the transaction cost is still surprisingly high. According to the data from the 2016 Statistical Report of the American Futures Industry Association (FIA), showing the top 30 derivatives exchanges in the world, three of the four domestic derivative exchanges are listed: No. 6, Shanghai Futures Exchange; No. 8, Dalian Commodity Exchange No. 11, Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange; In conclusion; this means that the demand is sufficient, even though there aren’t many exports, the transaction volume is still huge.    In fact, the relevant domestic departments are aware of the problem that there are only a few varieties of derivatives. They have also realized that derivatives have a lot of disadvantages compared to standardized products. Hence in 2013, the China Futures Association issued “Guidelines for Carrying out the Pilot Program for Futures Companies’ Establishment of Subsidiaries to Primarily Provide Risk Management Services”. This encouraged all types of financial institutions to provide ‘Over-The-Counter’ (OTC) derivatives such as OTC options to the market. In 2015 the OTC options business entered a period of vigorous development, this was caused by the margin trading of securities. As far as I know, an off-exchange business team consisting of 20–30 people, ran by a securities company, made a turnover of more than 150 billion Yuan (±24 billion USD) for customers in 2017. This shows how hot the market actually is. However, this market has only just begun! At present, only ultra-high-net-worth individuals can participate.  OTC derivatives are inherently peer-to-peer (P2P) markets that are aligned with blockchain technology.  The OTC derivatives market is an OTC market outside of an exchange. It’s a natural P2P trading market and will therefore face several problems: 1. How to establish trust between counterparties; 2. The cost and time of establishing trust; 3. Efficiency issues from combining transactions;  1. The distributed consensus algorithm and asymmetric encryption technology system can largely solve the problem of point-to-point transaction trust. At the same time, the structured smart contract of the map can be directly tied to FOTA to achieve the “decentralized margin system” of the margin account system. This is similar to a centralized exchange, it can keep control of the counterparty risk. Derivatives are automatically liquidated when the smart contract expires. Before expiration, the user can transfer the derivative smart contract for second-hand use.  2. Taking the domestic OTC option as an example; brokerage fees generally charged by brokers can be as high as 6%-7%, which is a very profitable business. The reason why they can receive such high agency fees is the lack of demand for means of connection. This can be solved by traditional Internet and blockchain. Because the two parties wishing to trade often vary there is a lack of trust. At the same time, the OTC market does not have a margin account system and supervision system that is owned by an exchange, so a brokerage firm must guarantee it and collects guarantees. These issues can be solved by using the blockchain technology that uses encrypted digital tokens and smart contract technology.  3. Take the domestic OTC option for example; the contract is artificially combined. The contract is created and signed manually. The maturity clearing is also controlled by people. This labor is very inefficient and does not have any hand-made feelings. Foreign financial IT service providers such as Bloomberg have already solved this part of the problem. Domestic Wind is also entering the market. However, through the traditional Internet and IT methods, only the connection efficiency of the matching and the management efficiency of the internal system can be solved, and the efficiency solution cannot be provided at the transaction level of the contract, including but not limited to contract creation, signing, and liquidation. This is exactly what the blockchain technology solves, as a representative of valuable networks.  Thanks for reading and see you next time!  Brian Cai.",False

My name is Liangbin (Brian) Cai, I’m founder and CEO of FORTUNA. I’ve started a series called ‘Founder Blogs’ to share some of the ideas me and my team have, that do not fit anywhere else. Welcome! After graduating from Yale University, I won first prize at the International Mathematical Contest in Modeling. I worked in various segments of the financial industry all around the world (New York, London, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Hangzhou), in the fields of investment banking, supply chain finance, Anglo-American law trusts, civil law trusts, and private banking. At the age of 26, I was able to work my way up in a state-owned bank. Prior to leaving, I was the general manager of the private bank and was responsible for over 30 billion in assets. After these great experiences, I decided it was time for something new, something bigger. That is when I founded Fortuna.  The Long Tail Let’s talk about the long tail! — An interesting business model. What do YOU think when you hear the word “long tail”? I think of a new business model that breaks the fixed mindset of the “Pareto principle”.  People usually pay most of their attention to the best-selling products or services that can bring 80% of their income. The remaining long tail (small sales with large quantities of customers, products and services) can only be kept in the statistics manual.  Since the birth of the new business model ‘long tail’, some fundamental changes have been made. The most familiar example is the search engine, represented by Google. They successfully created a brand new long tail advertising market. It was full of twists and turns during a period.  Whether it is paper media advertising, radio advertising, television advertising, or portal advertising, the advertising itself will always play a huge role in a company.  I still remember in the 1990s, one of the topics that would be discussed every year was; who bought the CCTV advertising standard. The price of bidding is hundreds of millions or even billions. It is shocking but don’t forget that this number is the amount of the 1990s. Small businesses and self-employed people, whose sales are not ideal nor have a high frequency of purchases, are unlikely to appear in mainstream media such as newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and portals. However, after the birth of search engines, everything changed!  A traditional media’s contract allocation model consists of core elements such as a layout and a time period, are divided into multiple contracts. A different approach is using search engines to adapt to keyword bidding transaction modes, the long tail and low frequency search keywords. This can generate more than 70% of the total advertising revenue of search engines.  If a keyword has only one visit every six months, but the word has a high conversion rate, it is impossible for a search company to send a salesperson to sell this keyword. The reason for this is that the income is insufficient (sales income does not cover the cost of sales), this can be solved by an auction-trading model. The cost of sales will be almost zero, and the income obtained is almost always a profit. Yahoo uses the contract allocation model to serve more than 2,000 large-scale advertisers. Google, which uses an auction-trading model, has served more than 2 million small and medium-sized advertisers, opening an incremental market completely. This is the biggest difference between the long tail advertising market and the traditional advertising-market. The demand for long tail advertisements has always been there, but due to the reasons such as transaction patterns, marginal costs, and connection efficiency, there has been a lack of a truly effective market to meet these conditions.  Fortuna will pay tribute to Google and create a long tail derivatives market.  Our plan is to pay tribute to Google and create a long tail derivatives market. Google’s keyword bidding transaction model through search engines has enabled the needs of more small and medium-sized advertisers to meet the marginal cost of nearly zero. It is impossible for these small and medium-sized advertisers’ advertising budgets to enter mainstream media. The only thing that they can do is advertise by the means of; stickers in a corridor and flyers on the street. Similarly, in today’s OTC derivatives market, many small and medium-sized institutions and individual customers are rejected:  On the one hand, this is the result of insufficient funds. Brokers won’t help you under 10M RMB in China. However, the question is: Is there demand for derivatives of 1,000–100,000 RMB? Obviously yes, they are just like long tail advertisements. Due to the trading patterns and marginal costs, there has always been a lack of an effective market to meet these needs.  On the other hand, it is because their qualifications are not enough. I mentioned in my letter “Throw a Stone into the OTC Derivatives Pond (in 483 trillion U.S. dollars)” that although the OTC derivatives market is rich in products and the contracts are flexible, there is no corresponding guarantee mechanism and margin account system. Therefore, the traditional OTC derivatives market is basically based solely on the credit of individuals or institutions. At this time either you have a very good qualification and belong to state-owned companies, listed companies, large private companies, ultra-high net worth investors, or you find a good guarantee agency, which you pay a 6%-7% guarantee fee. The qualification threshold of the former excludes most of the individual investors and small and medium-sized institutional investors. The latter is costly and, more crucially, such a guarantee institution does not accept small businesses. High guarantee costs and high capital thresholds will also reject most individual investors and small and medium-sized institutional investors.   What should we do? FORTUNA will reshape the OTC derivatives market based on the blockchain’s technology system, core concepts and provide everyone with a long tail derivatives market.  1. Realize a fully decentralized derivatives trading platform. To achieve a fully decentralized derivatives trading platform, all the derivative contracts are designed and initiated by users, so that market demand determines the market supply, rather than the dictatorial decision of the centralization exchange. Thus, everyone’s right to speak and use are equal.  2. No financial threshold and qualification threshold. Through the Smart Contract and the Utility Based Crypto Token mechanism, the counterparty risk can effectively be controlled and a value-based trading network with zero confidence establishment cost can be established. Bid farewell to the capital threshold and qualification threshold. As long as there is the counterparty, any amount of the contract can be reached to achieve a truly inclusive market for derivatives.  3. No need for any transaction fees In the state that the entire distributed network node is operating autonomously, Fortuna won’t charge any transaction fees as a blockchain platform. All forms of fees will be charged by nodes in the ecosystem that provide various types of services, such as Delegate nodes that provide block services, Quoter nodes that provide quote services, Market Maker nodes that provide market-making services, and CoT Maker nodes that provide contract template design services. In other words, the platform does not make any money. All profits are attributed to all the nodes that jointly build our ecosystem. All community members can apply to become all of the above types of nodes.  Thanks for reading and see you next time!  Brian Cai.",False
