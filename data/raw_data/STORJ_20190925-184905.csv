We believe that Test Group C will last less than expected as most of the requirements to go live will be tested starting in Group B. But giving out an estimate is really hard, things may go wrong during Group B or even C and we may have to go back to the drawing board for some of the components. So even a rough estimate is hard to give seen the delicate nature of software development where an issue could delay deadlines extensively.

Conceptually I've been working on it since about July 2013. Coding started in December 2013, but we had to throw the whole project away about 3 times before we understood what we were doing. We did a crowd fund in May 2014, which also predates Storj's crowd fund. Then we went under the radar for 12 months while we worked away at the codebase. Had to throw everything away again in October, but we've finally got something that's going to work up to something between 50k and 1m users. That's good enough for us to keep the current project, but we'll have to keep improving on it as we approach that 1m mark. I'm not really sure where the next optimizations are going to be, but as super3 keeps saying you basically have to move as much as possible off-chain. Blockchains simply don't scale. Even Bitcoin is going to give up past ~50 million users.  We'll figure something out when the time comes. We've got a lot of ambition and 1 million users is a good starting place.

Similar to decentralized currencies, decentralized data storage is free from the threat of a central authority. Risks of censorship or information control will become a thing of the past. A working Storj solution would've been perfect for whistleblowers like Assange and Snowden. Authoritarian regimes like North Korea also will no longer have absolute control of data released to the world.  More than that, decentralized data storage is also attractive commercially. Individuals and companies no longer have to make massive investments in hardware. Instead, a pay-as-you-go model comes along.

Cloud storage like Storj also allows retrieval from any devices which is really where computing is going.  If I work on a presentation on my laptop I may want to present it from my iPhone with my micro projector for the iPhone.   I think the fact that people will have more drive space, just means that they will have more files that they want to protect files.  Cheaper hard drive space does mean cheaper Storj drive space because more people will put space online through farming.  That is what the network wants.  The money that can be mad will undoubtedly be driven by market forces.  In the beginning there will likely be more drive space than consumption.  As it catches on that will change.  I think over time there will be one or more decentralized storage options and there will be an open market for the consumer.  that is good no matter how you look at it.",False

How do the intended applications for Storj differ compared to that of Datacoin (DTC)? DTC was the original coin for data storage and while innovative, it is also pretty much dead right now in terms of market cap. Say, for example, I have a draft of a short novel that I'm writing which takes up 1 megabyte of space. In order to permanently back this up into the DTC blockchain, this would cost me 50 DTC or about 50 cents.  What price range should I expect for Storj and will it be permanent too?  Secondly, how does Storj intend to keep the blockchain size small enough for practical use? The Datacoin blockchain is designed to grow at a rate of 500 GB per year which limits the coin's usability and lowers the number of nodes which can take part in the network and thus, lowers network security. Will Storj also feature a bloated blockchain or will there be measures to prevent this?  EDIT: Well there wasn't much information in the OP or the official site but a quick read of the whitepaper suggests that data won't actually be stored in the blockchain but rather on other people's hard drives. How will I know that my data will stay backed up unless every node in the network has a copy of it - i.e. a blockchain? Doesn't this mean that a few computers in the network can be switched off, break down, or their owner(s) might decide to reformat their hard drives and my novel can disappear forever while the network - oblivious to all of this, continues chugging along?",False

Requirements A crowdsale SJCX address where you control the private key, to be able to sign a message for ownership verification. We recommend using Counterwallet. Addresses from exchanges and sources you don’t control will not be valid. A balance of 10,000 SJCX in your crowdsale address. Your original crowdsale address can be topped up to and over 10,000 SJCX to be eligible.  What outcomes do we expect from Test Group A To get load testing experience and statistics on our verification nodes. To get uptime statistics for farmers, which is useful data for our distribution algorithms.  Who is Test Group A for This is our first software beta and there may be technical problems and issues. Ideally we would prefer power-users, willing to deal with the problems and give us feedback. Users not willing to go through technical issues, troubleshooting, and actively provide feedback, should participate in later test groups. There will be no SJCX rewards for participants.

Visit the Dedicated Thread for Support and Feedback on StorjTalk.  Not Eligible? Details on other test groups can be found on the Early Access Page. Visit the Dedicated Thread for Early Access Questions.  When is the launch? The launch will be on Saturday December 20 at 8 PM (EST). We will host a live hangout and an IRC chat. In that event we will provide instructions and support, as well as answer questions. If there are any updates or delays we will keep you informed via social media or email.

If a node stops carrying a file or goes offline, it will fail a 'check-in' for that data by the network. The network will heal this missing file by taking an existing copy and rehosting it to a new node to maintain redundancy. If you're still scared of files going  down, you can set redundancy to 50 or even higher - just keep in mind these are quite small micropayments to hosts so even redundancy at 50 won't cost too much relative to, say, Dropbox prices. Keep in mind that bandwidth is also taken into account, not just storage.   2) Considering the encryption involved, though it isn't impossible to break, it will be extremely hard to figure out what a file is that is being stored on a node's hard drive - so hard in fact that it would be virtually useless to try to break the encryption. In that way, you can't really get in trouble as a host because there is essentially no way to see what is being stored on your hard drive.   On the flip side, if you are storing something illegal on the network, you yourself can get in trouble if LE confiscates your computer. Considering that people will be using things like VPNs and that all you have is an address for SJCX, even then you wouldn't be able to tell what node is storing the illegal content. So while for these examples you can't say FOR SURE that the encryption would be cracked back to the storee or forward to the storage node, it would most likely take such an incredibly long time and a huge amount of computing power that it would be useless to try (to the point that even with a supercomputer or something of the likes it would take billions of year to brute force).      This isn't to say that Storj is made for illegal content, though. We've been passing around ideas for things like if a storee or node makes it public knowledge that they are facilitating the transfer of illegal content, they can be blacklisted.",False

It's fine to be skeptical; at the end of the day, for anything to truly take off there are folks will need to ""see it to believe it.""   As for the illegal content, the bolded statement just makes no sense at all, sorry. Illegal content will be stored and Law Enforcement will indeed pursue it, whether the storee has knowledge of what it is in their hard drives or not. And if what is there is illegal, they will be held responsible, one way or another, regardless of the level of encryption.  Of course LEOs will pursue folks who do things illegally anywhere. That's their rightful job. Folks who knowingly upload illegal content and share the decryption keys can certainly be liable. Folks who knowingly advertise access to illegal content could also be in hot water depending on jurisdiction.  Farmers receive encrypted chunks from the network, in an automatic fashion. Farmers can't tell chunks apart or piece them together as (a) it's highly unlikely they'd have all the requisite chunks to do so and (b) they may not know how the chunks were encrypted and (c) they wouldn't have the keys to decrypt any content. DriveShare clients will also ultimately prune any chunks that aren't being paid for, as a farmer would only want to store chunks that were economical for them.  So if a LEO nabs someone distributing illegal stuff, that person can no longer pay to keep their content on the network and it would be automatically purged from farmers' drives.  Is there a legal precedent you are basing your last statement on? Are you thinking about a certain legal jurisdiction?  Tor relays, for example, may see all kinds of content, however the Tor Project FAQ indicates that no one has ever been sued or prosecuted in the US for running a Tor relay. The same FAQ indicates that the Tor folks believe running a node is completely legal under US law. One of Tor's active sponsors (2014) is the US Department of State Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. I highly doubt the Department of State would fund a project where running a relay would put you in legal hot water.   On another matter, I read now you are selling your network (or leasing its use to be more proper), to others. Such as GEMS. What network is that? You don't have storees as of now to be leasing at all? Or am I missing something here?  Where did you read this? I think you may be thinking of folks who want to integrate with Storj.

For example if someone has 10,000 SJCX on an exchange and starts withdrawing them 1 SJCX at the time the Tx fees cost could spiral pretty high. A way around that would be to set higher withdraw fees on the exchange itself.  I believe more exchanges will come sooner or later.

If your storage space is encrypted, it's likely that MS holds the decryption keys so your privacy is questionable (though I haven't researched their offering in depth). You also have to keep paying Microsoft (i.e. the same singular entity) indefinitely or your space is gone. If you end up storing lots of data with Microsoft (assuming you could, in actuality, store hundreds of terabytes -- e.g. if you're a video producer), Microsoft could suddenly decide to scrap its unlimited storage model, or spin off the business to someone else. It could also decide to suddenly change its pricing structure: i.e. you still have unlimited storage, but now they decide to charge an additional $25/month if you hold over 10 TB on their service.  With Storj, you'd only pay to store the amount of space you're using at the redundancy you desire. Your files are chunked, encrypted and distributed across the network so there isn't a single point of failure. There isn't one central company that can shut off your space all at once, as well. Think MEGA -- when they got shut down, a lot of legitimate users lost access to their backups/files. If someone stores something funky on a centralized service, an enforcement agency may decide to freeze the entire infrastructure or server during an investigation/to preserve evidence (that other innocent folks data may be held on) and you may be out of luck with access.  I'm also skeptical of indefinite, unlimited storage with a traditional provider. When iPhones first came out, many cellular providers like AT&T offered unlimited data plans, but those are now gone unless you're grandfathered in. And only a few days ago, Bitcasa, which also had an unlimited storage offering for $10/month, also stopped (see: http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/24/bitcasa-no-unlimited/).

Our project has had a lot of costs up until this point, such as marketing, full-time and part-time salaries for team members, and the cost of travelling across the country to different conferences to help spread Storj. Up until the crowdsale, all of our costs were paid out of pocket and for those who are doing Storj full-time, that is not sustainable living. Also, we have had no money given to us by VCs either. The crowdsale (and potential future ones) are the only thing that will be able to keep Storj going, project-wise and team-wise.

OR maybe they need the BTC and hop on to another very short term investment? Looking at Poloniex SJCX/BTC, and seeing people selling at a loss is not concerning. If you pay attention, the sell offs are very low volume. These may just be people who expected for quick profit immediately after release, but since that didnt happen, they're selling and they have every right to do so. All im saying is, once even just the prototype of Driveshare is complete and works, it's basically a done deal. The technology will be proven. From there it will be all about fine-tuning the product and continue to improve it in time.  Storj's potential is way too great to treat like just another 'ordinary' coin.

Driveshare is composed of 4 parts, heartbeat, upstream, downstream and the ux.  3/4 of these are functionally complete and can be see no the github.com/storj  work has been going steadily you can see the commits by the developers on each portion.  Simply stating that the program will be done and ready on x date is not wise as with programming you can have good days where you makes lots of progress and bad days where you stare at a piece of code for hours on end( why I changed my major from computer engineering to electrical). If you or anyone reading this would like to contribute feel free to fork the project and make any and all contributions to the project.  So to the actual question, we will begin farming as soon as the binaries are entirely functional.  2.) there has not yet been official announcement on this.  I know people are worried about what will happen to the coins.  And are worried about dumping. If necessary we may place the coins in a wallet that would be time locked untill an adequate  and acceptable decision can be made.  3.) the developer has stated on several occasions and during interviews that he would like to see a staggered release for testing.  10 people use it test the hell out of it fix bugs reship to 100 people.  Test reship to 1000/ all participants.  There were about 1300 total donations made to the crowdsale many were repeat addresses.  These people will be the ones running the network untill a time comes that it is needed to release publicly to support the network.

You should have gone with a lower coin total... maybe 1-10 million. And then set aside for example 25% (could be more or less, just an example) for the IPO. Unsold coins would then be kept in escrow for other crowd sales (people are going to be really unconformable with devs holding 90% of coins, should have used escrow). Then the only way to ""mine"" coins would be proof of storage. Why didn't you make the proof of storage payments automated? By the way how will the coins be distributed in the current set up for storage payments? Will they be sent manually, or through a centralized system? Or maybe I missed something and it actually is decentralized?  Other than that I like these sorts of decentralized applications.

We completely understand why somebody would feel nervous with how the allocation system for coins is set up. The main reason we freely disclose our personal information is because people interested in the project want to see real names and real faces instead of just a nice looking website and an address -- the fact we put our real information out there should be at least some reassurance that we won't just take the BTC or SJCX and run.    A large portion of the Bitcoin donated during the crowdsale will be going into a 3-of-7 multisig wallet on copay.io which is already completely set up. This wallet will become the holder of the Bitcoin after the crowdsale is over (wallet address is 3PQwFtfHnL9vC4E6zEgWieQGXV8MeSpfC2). The Bitcoin that doesn't go into this wallet will go, for the most part, to covering past expenses such as travelling to conferences and marketing, as well as toward the payment of full-time (and part-time) developers.   In the early days of DriveShare, some of the leftover SJCX from the crowdsale will go toward the payment of those who rent out their hard drive on the early network. We do not currently have a hard set number for how many SJCX these users will be rewarded because we wanted to wait until after the crowdsale is over so that we are able to see how many coins are left. We feel that deciding this amount arbitrarily, without knowing how many are remaining, would be irresponsible.   For major decisions regarding Storj, we tend to prefer having open discussions with the community and letting our users have a say as well. Examples of this were when we were deciding whether to have Storjcoin X run on the Counterparty on Mastercoin protocol as well as when we decided what to do with the asset squatter on Counterparty. Because of this, there will be more than likely multiple discussions regarding the use of SJCX leftover from the crowdsale where the community can join in.    As of right now, we do not have a set plan on how the early storage payments will be done. It will most certainly have to be automated because our team would not be able to handle a large number of payments. In other words, payments for early storage will most likely not be going through the hands of, say, multiple people.   We apologize if we caused any alarm or confusion with how we are handling things. We are more than happy to provide evidence pointing to the fact that we are an extremely dedicated team creating as good of a product and service as we can. I hope I answered your questions as thoroughly as you were looking for, and I would be happy to answer any more that you have.   Cheers, Matt",False

There is no mining at all. As a crowdsale participant you get access to early farming. In this phase we are testing the network and seeding it with files. Leftover SJCX allow us a large pool of funds for both new software, but also as funds to rewards the storing of file.  So for example, we could decide to archive the entirety of Youtube. We can use the leftover SJCX to pay for this massive use of storage. This provides huge value to everyone. Why use Youtube, when you can watch the same video on a faster(because P2P), censor free, platform that also integrates cryptocurrency. After a while it will become self sustaining from file demand. No one person could pay for this, but as a whole we can use the leftover funds to bootstrap the network.  So think of it not as a premine, but as a pool of funds for bootstrapping the network with actual content, and developing new software.  Its a bit of a strange model, but let me know if you have anymore questions.  ",False

I'm not crypto-techie. There are many coins, many message threads, many posts and many scams across bitcointalk. With a day job, it's not practical or cost-effective for many of us to read everything out there until we come across digestible tidbits/summaries/previews that command our attention and merit a deeper read and research. For instance, I've read a ton about Ethereum. I never read anything about DarkCash (and thank heavens). I have to prioritise and count on correspondence in bitcointalk with people who have explored these things in depth to get a preview and early education to decide whether to explore a coin further. It's just being practical and, to be a successful coin developer, you need to do a better job of suffering us fools galdly. See Vitalik Buterin - guy's a genius, but he treats every inquiry he gets (that I'm aware of, no matter how inane, as long as it's a genuine inquiry) respectfully and with patience, his time permitting. Now, I came here, because what I saw of the website and glimpses of the interface and concept looked professional and impressive, but I dont have time to read it all.

It is balanced against the dev fund, so each gets 15%. The idea is that the community should have the same or more power than the devs. To make this happen we will have to build a multi-signature wallet. We will be using copay for the BTC that the community holds, but we will have to build a new wallet for the SJCX.  This has never been done before, but I think everyone will start to follow this model once they see it in action. The community should be key in a coin, not the devs.  As far as any remaining SJCX from the crowdsale here is our current plan: 1) Distribute it through hard drive mining/farming to the crowdsale participants 2) Use it for future crowdsales for new Storj platforms(decentralized Youtube, Imgur, etc.)  So someone who contributes 1 BTC to the crowdsale could end up with 4-5 BTC worth of SJCX by the time the network goes public. Those who don't participate in the crowdsale won't be able participate in the early network. They will be able to generate addresses and use SJCX, but they won't be able to mine.

But it needs to be robust and scalable.  We use tons of disks, each system has 2 disks, and they are sold on potential maximum disk usage basis, hence even smallest servers generally have 30%+ of disk space unused, large servers can run 80% empty. We have even nodes with 30Tb+ of disk space and just 4Tb used. For low activity data, that's perfect storage, as long as it's robust. Ie. if users need more disk space available, we need to be able to autonomously, effortlessly and fast go from say 2Tb to the network to 1Tb to the network on a single node.  If that can happen and esp. if built in, and the software works stable on Linux, we could put it in 50 servers just to test out.  If it actually makes a positive return financially, we could eventually put up petabytes of storage only dedicated to the network.  NOW, as a data specialist, you need at least replication in any case, in a network like this probably 3+ replicas. Better yet, since CPU and RAM is going to be abound and no data on this network is going to be need to have tons of iops and real time RW access, built in erasure coding would be much better. Dedup is a must.  For example, a 1Gb file, split it into 30+5, 30 data pieces, 5 redundancy pieces. It could be hard coded, say 128Mb pieces for files larger than 1Gb, 32Mb pieces for 500Mb-1Gig files, and smaller ones so that there will be always 16 pieces in multiplication of 4KiB, unless the file is really tiny (<1Mb perhaps?) then just replicated. That will save storage a TON, increase reliability A lot. With 32 pieces + 8 redundancy, 8 nodes can disappear simultaneously without loosing the data. That's in a network like this a bit risky still perhaps, maybe when the network matures it's not risky at all anymore since most nodes will be 24/7 servers eventually  Financially, to dedicate resource just for this, i need to see 3€+/Mo per TiB storage and 2€+ per TiB of uploaded data traffic. Market pricing for storage right now in dedis is about 7.5€/TiB/Mo. It's best to let the market decide the pricing. The market deciding pricing is the most important bit: You cannot compete with Dropbox like pricing, then people will use Dropbox. But something which is free as in beer -> people will flock in and use it insanely much, putting pressure for prices to increase.  Apps are important too, for example, backing up servers this would be golden! I would love to use something like this to backup our vast amounts of data if the price is sufficiently low, but in my case it's either or, if the price is extremely low, i will use the system myself, if the storage prices are high, i will be providing storage. We cannot justify doubling the cost per user account, except for limited portfolio of services.  Further to gain market adoption, things need to be simple. Ultra simple. Even a trained monkey can use simple.  But i like this. Looks awesome. Can't wait to see when testing begins!",False

That article tho - you move directly from storage pricing to compare storage pricing against transfer pricing? What?!? Now that doesn't make - since when did transit capacity become storage capacity?  Apples to Oranges.  Now, the going rate per TiB per month at lowest levels on current dedicated market is 7.5€ for low end servers, and around 6.2€ for very large nodes. Hence, 100Gb costs a month somewhere around the average of 7.25€ when using the current most cost effective offers out there.  and for someone like me who has his own DC... Well, it's on the CAPEX and not OPEX side of the sheet, but turned to OPEX... Well, it's a fraction of that Depends on what kind of deals you got, what bulk pricing you get, do you outright buy it or do you lease or rent it, what level of hardware are you utilizing etc. If you buy really big, and seriously skimp on the quality level of hardware we are talking about under 1.5€/TiB/Mo potentially, plus bandwidth fees. So approximately 0.15€ for 100GiB/Mo with current HDD pricing at cost level, at high efficiency operation.  So, on a system like this, we could potentially see pricing to fall to about quadruple to that fairly easily, when the storage providers start to outweigh user base, we will see it to drop around just 25-30% markup.  If average lifetime of data is 1year, and it is read 4 times during this time, we have 3months timespan, hence with 1Gbps you can host about 790TiB. 1Gbps connected server never really achieves more than 85-95% of the maximum, infact, no link can do faster, since usually about 5% is spent on error correction.  The true ratios of read, cold data timespans etc. will only be revealed on production, it's totally impossible to predict.  What kind of erasure coding is in the plans?  Further, deduplication on GRAND scale would be worth it on something like this, on blocks/files larger than 1000Mb or something like that, then the hash tables will stay somewhat sanely sized. but that can be worked in later on... Just saying, deduplication along with erasure coding in this kind of system are not only just a GREAT idea, but almost necessary. Further, the dedup count could increase redundancy factor for that data as well, dynamically making data which is of interest to more people, more resilient to failures, and the cost could be shared by all those users who wanted to store that data, thus driving the cost dramatically down for those putting in data others have put in as well. Those dedup tables will still consume INSANE amounts of storage - but hey, that's what's abundantly available It would still work rather fast with nicely optimized lookup trees, split those hashes up! a single look up would consume only a couple of I/Os, needs some careful thought to see the quantity of I/Os and to minimize them.  Just because it's cloud, resources ought not to be wasted  EDIT: Oh yeah, and i'm sorry to say, but reading that article made the impression that the writer doesn't know sh** about industrial scale computing, at least explain the reason why comparing apples to oranges, and assumptions that 1Gbps can actually do 1Gbps tells writer had no idea of network technology. In all my 15 or so years in hosting industry i've probably never seen above 120M/s for 1Gig link, and over internet  never above 116M/s, and even that is a freakishly rare occurence, average node, average network seems to stall at 95-105M/s commonly.",False

As we start to overload these sources it should be clear that the rest of that becomes profit would be split among that actually people who store the data (at whatever rates the market decides).  We want to build legacy APIs to have integrations with existing platforms. If we can make this easy enough we don't see the providers outpacing the consumers as quickly as one might think.  As far as erasure coding zfec looks best because we are a Python shop right now. We plan to implement multiple data sources, so Tahoe-LAFS integration would probably be a nice little fallback if you want proper erasure coding.  1 Gbps = 1 Gbps is just a simplification for describing the cost disparity.

Server pricings?  We charge for an Dual Hexcore Opteron, 16Gb ECC, 4x2Tb with 1Gbps burstable connection just 99€ a month. Tho the bandwidth is calced among max 150mbps average upload traffic. Downstream doesn't matter to us, and this would be mostly downstream most likely. Tho that is extremely cheap for a dual cpu node, and we are likely to increase that pricing at fall. For storage servers we charge for an E350, 8G, 4x3Tb, 100Mbps Unmetered, 89.98€/Mo + 125€ setup fee. Both of these two are very cost effective options, the latter coming to just under 7.5€/TiB/Mo.  Zfec: Good, a common, well used library. Eliminates chances of making mistakes, and puts the pressure of bug fixes on 3rd party on the erasure coding front.  Free data sources? What's that? Please explain why transit capacity becomes storage available? Does the system constantly transmit the data again and again and again even tho no one is requesting it?  If the system is built so that bandwidth == storage maximum, it becomes INSANELY expensive. Most operators still pay something like 1.5€+ per Mbps, that's 1500€ for 1Gbps connection -> ~300Tb a month transfer capacity. That's 5€ per Tb! For a large operator like that the cost per Tb of storage to offer then quickly quadruples! Nevermind a gazillion of other issues.  In any case, as long as the bandwidth usage is sane, for example i have a warehouse which is limited to 20/1M connection or über expensive SDSL, but it needs to be heated up during winters, 5-6 months of a year we need to spend money on heating it up, whether it's oil, bitcoin miners or to this. If BW usage is low, it would make us much sense to put in a couple kWs worth of disk arrays there over time as the capacity gets filled.  Which reminds of compression? On the plans? Also, do you intend to build in algos separating colder data from warmer to emphasis warmer data to those storage nodes with more BW and colder to the ones with less BW, or do you intend to let natural selection do the job for you with some ultra simple idea?  If the price per TiB on end user ends up cheap enough i envision a lot of parties will use this for backup purposes.",False

Remember you have two completely unique coins, so I expect the market will behave like it always does. 2) One of these coins is needed to make Metadisk run. So as people use Metadisk to share and store files on the web, the nodes will be buying the coins off the exchange.

This is what HDFS (the google filesystem) does. Of course, an attacker could host a lot of files on a botnet and take the whole botnet offline.  Alternatively, you could spread tiny files across the network, of which a large group has a copy.  If I am not mistaking, this is something that bittorrent is doing. It could have like a reward system, if you upload data or participate in supporting the network you get a small btc ?  Another issue is speed and availability.

If you are running as a node I would recommend that you run them as single drives. Without doing any calculations (I'll run numbers at some point), I figure that the profit lost from using a drive for RAID redundancy will be more than profit lost from refilling a new drive with data(provided you have a fast enough connection). For slow connection I would indeed recommend a RAID setup for drive failures.  Failure is on the side of the hoster not the user.

Three months ago we were at double the price, Mt.Gox wasn't empty, people were not really talking about alternate uses of the blockchain, regulation was pretty up the the air. Major changes happen in a short amount of time. Products and services have to move fast as well to keep up.  Quote We'll this is why I even started this conversation, I asked you why don't you build this on the MaidSafe network. By using a Storjcoin you are building a ecosystem outside MaidSafe and thus directly damaging MaidSafe. Why do you think that you will be able to use the Safe network for storaging files that you charge for? MaidSafe is in no way getting your userbase since you are making them use Storjcoin and therefore it's not a symbiotic relationship, as you suggested, but rather a parasitic one. I don't see how this is different? Essentially doing the same thing, but also but also adding Storjcoin to the mix. Storjcoin performs more than just as a token. It can also serve as structured metadata store. It is used to coordinate the efforts of the entire Storj network, and make each node interoperable. It can handle file objects, DNS, compute requests, etc.  While I see what your trying to say that we should only use Safecoins because that is the best bet, but let me break it into node structure perhaps we could shed some light. Am I correct under this assertion?  Your system: ""Dropbox"" Application Running on Node A - Payments in Safecoin - Running on Maidsafe Network  Under my proposed system: ""Dropbox"" Application Running on Node B - Payments in Safecoin - Running on the Maidsafe Network ""Dropbox"" Application Running on Node C - Payments in Bitcoin(Safecoins only used for storage) - Running on the Maidsafe Network ""Dropbox"" Application Running on Node D - Payments in Storjcoin(Safecoins only used for storage) - Running on the Maidsafe Network ""Dropbox"" Application Running on Node E - Payments in US Dollars(Safecoins only used for storage) - Running on the Maidsafe Network ""Dropbox"" Application Running on Node F - Payments in Storjcoin - Running on the Storj Network ""Dropbox"" Application Running on Node G - Payments in Bitcoin(Storjcoin only used for storage) - Running on the Storj Network ""Dropbox"" Application Running on Node H - Payments in Safecoin(Storjcoin only used for storage) - Running on the Storj Network ""Dropbox"" Application Running on Node I - Payments in US Dollars(Storjcoin only used for storage) - Running on the Storj Network  The nodes will pretty much run all the exact same software except their payment modules will be different, or their data storage modules. Using the Storjcoin blockchain as the ""universal language"" all nodes can communicate. Therefore if I store a file on Node B, and can retrieve it on Node I without a problem. If another decentralized storage protocol comes along, we need only create a new data storage module, and launch some new nodes. Node only needs to turn a profit to stay alive. As market forces, and technology changes so will the advantages and disadvantages of running on certain types of nodes.  Bitcoin could have a huge speculative rise or fall impacting the price of cryptocurrencies. In that case nodes E and I would be relatively unaffected. A large amount of resource miners could be added to the Storj networking making it much cheaper to store on the Storj Network. Other nodes can buy space from Nodes F-I.  If your assertions are correct then Node B will achieve the greatest profit. But that doesn't also mean that nodes C-I can't appeal to their own niche markets(through alternate UIs and use cases) and make a reasonable profit as well. Storjcoin holders benefit across all nodes and platforms.  Under this plan we still hit your 1-6, but we also created a bunch of ""alt"" options as well. Its almost if like Bitcoin lauched, then added Bitcoin-B(litecoin), and Bitcoin-C(peercoin). We make all possible ""competing"" protocols interoperable with the core network. In that way we keep network effect even though markets and technologies might change.  The market will decide which technologies(nodes) we build. We don't have to have any preconceived notion that a protocol or technology will work the way we hope it will work.  Does the Dark Side have cookies?",False

Since Safecoin's value is going to rise the farming of the storage will be more valuable because you get the Safecoins and therefore the price of storage is going to be zero for as long as Safecoins are worth buying HDD and farming  To try to really hammer the point home for anyone that doesn't follow, imagine this - what if Bitcoin instead of using CPU's to solve complex math problems for mining, uses HDD to store data for mining(farming). Well that's Safecoin.  So instead of meaningless work with mining as a proof of work you get storage as a proof of resource.   Look if you think you can sell this and make money doing this then by all means go for it. But I think you are in for a uphill battle that doesn't make any sense on many levels. And also why build it if you know that you have a year at most before storage as a service is commoditized?  P.S. this is all hypothetical and I have no proof that MaidSafe will work as advertised.

We aim to replace that with something cheaper, more secure, faster, and more scaleable. Of course, every technology will be replaced with time. You must understand that is not the core of the business model or value added.  Your models limits the ability of Storj to reach all markets, and be reliant on a singular platform/token. That is not true decentralization.  Since I'm getting some question about Ethereum integration comments I'll address that. Ethereum allows ""Bitcoin 2.0"" like contracts. This is inherently useful for many reasons. Here are my two immediate ones: 1) Cross Node Contracts - Node A is overloaded, and needs to offload bandwidth and storage space. It can autonomously and automatically enter into contracts with others nodes to help it out for a profit. 2) Compute - Our goal for Storj is always to have 100% utilization of resources. Our nodes will mostly be I/O bound, and the CPU won't be put to task initially. Would like to use the Ethereum Contracts  + Structured Metadata on the Storjcoin chain to allow for a rudimentary decentralized cloud computing service to use that CPU. Works something like this.  User stores Data 1 on Node A Node A Replicates Data 1 on Node B and Node C (part of normal redundancy) User Initiates a Compute Contract Node A-C, perform computations on encrypted Data 1 Node A-C, returns the hash of the data result to the contract Contract can achieve consensus that the resulting data is correct, and pay Nodes A-C for their work User receives result for Data 1  Again this is a rudimentary system for Storj 2.0, but Ethereum will allows us to prototype out something useful that we can learn from.",False

Along my research, I found a few problems and potential solutions, so thought I’d share (since I never actually started developing it). I hope you find these useful in some manner.  First, torrent-like technology is the way to go. And I suggest you look into how the SOP (SOPcast) protocol works as well (used in Europe mostly for P2P streaming TV channels).  Availability and redundancy will be the next major things to address once you have communication in place. Ideally you’d configure distribution of the same data packets to several computers based on their distance, time of availability and frequency of access. My thoughts were along modeling redundancy after RAID 5 (abstracted over the internet of course). Some people keep their computers running non-stop, but not everyone, however, if you can group people with the same patterns of activity (which I’m sure you can figure out), you can achieve much higher redundancy with fewer copies of the packets. This grouping based on availability will also allow you to store only a couple copies on always-available machines, and the gross on the machines in the group. You can then store only a handful of packets from always-on machines on the less-available machines.  Next comes speed. Computers close to each other usually communicate faster, so (at least frequently accessed) packets are best stored within proximity, or at least prioritized based on distance when retrieved. A local cache of frequently accessed files would also be advisable.  To solve the problem of availability long-term (once the technology is proven and mature), I recommend you reach out to hardware vendors, lan-cards in particular, to incorporate an SSD buffer chip, and open an API similar to WOL to allow them to still communicate even when the machine is off. I’m sure you/they can solve any legal/privacy/etc concerns.  The vast number of users don’t use their HDD anywhere close to capacity, so I’m sure they wouldn’t mind sharing their hdd for only a portion of protected storage in return. Best-case scenario would be share 90GB and you get 30GB of protected redundant storage in return (realistic number would probably be more distant).  I also suggest you look into potential commercial applications, since companies usually have the majority of their workstations on, and with very large drives that go unused, while cramming everyone’s files on some sort of central storage (SAN, directly attached, network shares, etc). I’m sure at least a few would welcome a test-run.  The problem I haven’t been able to solve is privacy vs deduplication. You’ll likely end up with thousands or even millions of copies of the exact same file, so it would be efficient in terms of both speed and resource management to reduce the number of copies, and use pointers to files (or chunks in this case).  I hope some of this helps, and good luck!",False

We want to provide working solutions one by one than promising you the moon, and taking 3 years to deliver. In our first development run, you can run web nodes that sell bandwidth. These nodes sell bandwidth, and shuttle files around the network.  Lets say: Node A: Is a node with 56 KBit/s and 1 TB storage Node B: 10 MBit/s upload and 1 TB storage  Node A will be treated as a ""passive"" node, and Node B will be treated as an ""active"" node.  People will want to use Node B because of the faster speed. On the other hand, Node A, has 1 TB of unused storage. So people will upload files to Node B, and Node B will charge for bandwidth and storage. Node B has to maintain file redundancy in case it goes down, so it will buy storage space from Node A, and verify periodically through hashing that Node A is storing the correct data. Node B can also rely on other external services, or another decentralized network such as MaidSafe to physically store the files.  Node's B motive is to approach 100% saturation of its resources. So using Dropbox prices and 3x redundancy, Node B could generate about ~$150 a month. About half of this is from selling its hard drive, the other half is from reserving a small cache space and then shuttling uploaded files to other nodes and networks.  Node A would earn substantially less. It would serve as a very poor shuttle for data. Furthermore because of the low bandwidth, it would be very hard to achieve full saturation of the hard drive.  But wait, we still have a use for Node A. If we could pre-load Node A will files. Let's say tons of small < 100kb files that are slated for long term storage (lets say these are used on a backup application and probably won't really be accessed much at all). Therefore Node A would only have to pass hash verifications, and the occasional file transfer. It can also approach full saturation.",False

Functions similarly to a web based version of Dropbox. As soon as MaidSafe is ready we will offer integration with our web software. Will will probably be the first solid MaidSafe consumer facing application.  No need. We intend to use MaidSafe as a data source. So a user uploads a file, and we keep track of it on our network.

Storj is designed in a modular way, so you can upgrade, swap out, and change features as needed. As you said making one UI would be a nightmare. Instead we provide an API for which the web interface rests on top. So if you want to change the base UI for a different use case or language go right ahead. Just make your changes to the HTML/CSS/etc. and you don't have to touch any of the core code.  In this case Storj make it easy to build ""very specialized and easy to use"" apps. If you want to develop a storage app would you rather use a C++ API or a nice REST API? In one case, you have to do a ton of work, in the other you are just doing a reskin to fit a different use case. After our tech is a little more solid I think I might write something like a 'Making a Storj app in 15 minutes' just to make the point.  Useful for the Average Consumer So if you picked a random person of the street, sat them down in front of a computer, and asked them to store a file on a decentralized network how do you think that would go. Would the average user (who probably knows nothing about Bitcoin) be able to get some specialized token? Not to mention they have to probably download and sync specialized software.  Not so with Storj. The user goes to something like storj.io, pays for some bandwidth with their credit card(bitcoin or storjcoin), and begins uploading files. To use it they don't have to install any specialized software(although we will have that later for convenience), or go through the hoops of trying to acquire tokens. At the end of the day it just looks like we are offering a file storage service, so we can accept payments through more ""traditional"" methods. This opens up Storj to the entire market immediately, rather than just the Bitcoin market.  So its 5 minutes, vs. Signing up for Coinbase, verifying your account, waiting 3-5 days, buying x token on an exchange, using the app.  Protection from Price Changes These other tokens are traded on open markets. That means they have a fluctuating trade value. So 100 GB might cost $5 one day and $10 the next. People might not like this so much, but if your stuck using one storage network and one token your going to have to deal with it. So lets say the speculative price of an external service shoots up to an unreasonable amount(data based cryptocurrency bubble of 2014 perhaps), the Storj network can store the files on its own network. If after a few days the price goes back down to reasonable levels. Storj can then transfer the files to the external network. So the cost of data storage on Storj will always be the lowest, because Storj does not have to rely on its own data storage network.  First to Market Our development process is completely different. We want to release features and applications early and often. We want to build toward a solution than promising the moon and delivering months later. Our web nodes are working now, we are just adding polish and features.  Value in Storjcoin Storjcoin provides more than just speculative value. Storjcoins are spent via tx fees to send network wide information. In our prototypes these will be returned to miners, but as the coin tech for it appears I might want to return these as dividends to the coin holders. So by holding Storjcoin you gain value from the physical storage and all the apps built off the entire network. So if someone pays in Bitcoin for their storage, Storjcoin will still have to be spent to send that information to the network. In that way Storjcoins will always build value either directly or indirectly.  So the value added: is easy to build on, immediately useful for average consumer, protection from price changes, first to market, and network wide rewards.

And also even though Storj is going to be easier to develop on (at first) Maidsafe is going to have a lot more devs, fascinated with the tech, trying to build apps on top of it.

Would the average user (who probably knows nothing about Bitcoin) be able to get some specialized token? Not to mention they have to probably download and sync specialized software.  Not so with Storj. The user goes to something like storj.io, pays for some bandwidth with their credit card(bitcoin or storjcoin), and begins uploading files. To use it they don't have to install any specialized software(although we will have that later for convenience), or go through the hoops of trying to acquire tokens. At the end of the day it just looks like we are offering a file storage service, so we can accept payments through more ""traditional"" methods. This opens up Storj to the entire market immediately, rather than just the Bitcoin market.  So its 5 minutes, vs. Signing up for Coinbase, verifying your account, waiting 3-5 days, buying x token on an exchange, using the app.  well this one falls flat on it's ass since MaidSafe is not going to charge for storage.  Also good luck trying to get the average person of the street trying out your new decentralized storage system when they can just use dropbox. What I'm trying to say is those who win on bitcointalk and r/bitcoin will have a huge advantage   Quote Protection from Price Changes These other tokens are traded on open markets. That means they have a fluctuating trade value. So 100 GB might cost $5 one day and $10 the next. People might not like this so much, but if your stuck using one storage network and one token your going to have to deal with it. So lets say the speculative price of an external service shoots up to an unreasonable amount(data based cryptocurrency bubble of 2014 perhaps), the Storj network can store the files on its own network. If after a few days the price goes back down to reasonable levels. Storj can then transfer the files to the external network. So the cost of data storage on Storj will always be the lowest, because Storj does not have to rely on its own data storage network.  Falls on ass due to free storage also.  Quote First to Market Our development process is completely different. We want to release features and applications early and often. We want to build toward a solution than promising the moon and delivering months later. Our web nodes are working now, we are just adding polish and features.  remains to be seen (MaidSafe is pretty close to launch)   Quote Value in Storjcoin Storjcoin provides more than just speculative value. Storjcoins are spent via tx fees to send network wide information. In our prototypes these will be returned to miners, but as the coin tech for it appears I might want to return these as dividends to the coin holders. So by holding Storjcoin you gain value from the physical storage and all the apps built off the entire network. So if someone pays in Bitcoin for their storage, Storjcoin will still have to be spent to send that information to the network. In that way Storjcoins will always build value either directly or indirectly.  So the value added: is easy to build on, immediately useful for average consumer, protection from price changes, first to market, and network wide rewards. There are a few more, but have I answered your question? I can move on to compute next, but I wanted to make sure I addressed the first part.  everything you said just replace Storjcoin with Safecoin.   All in all good response and I'm looking forward to part two.",False

I understand where the confusion is. Let me clarify.  So what your describing is closer to gmaxwell's original spec where an agent is a temporary file store. That is a user wants to store a file for 24 hours on a server and pays for that. In that case you don't need a blockchain.  Now if I want to store my file for a few years. Obviously, the agent could die or go down in that time period. So we use the blockchain or P2P software as a lookup to where the file is. Therefore an agent can act as a retriever for that data, and still get paid for its used storage and bandwidth.  Essentially you can do both with the exact same software. In one case the file is kept on the agent, and deleted when time is up. In the other the node only acts as a conduit for the data to a larger distributed storage network.",False

To be clear we are only talking about the prototype coins for now. Distribution and algorithm for the Storjcoin will be decided in the future. The prototype coins will allow us to test our applications and algorithms on a live network. That way we can learn and arrive at Storjcoin will working solutions, and values based on on data rather than arbitrary numbers.  ""How are you going to distribute the initial coins, if not by proof-of-burn?"" For protocoin(let's just call it that for now) standard genesis address funding, most likely using the Angelshares model. We would rather use the BTC to further development then destroy it.

""If you do POW like bitcoin, then your inflation rate will be around the same 15% that bitcoin is looking at.

Our prototype coin that we intend to release soon will be your typical altcoin with POW, with a few changes. We can use this immediately in our proof-of-concept decentralized storage web app. I think we will be the first to use blockchain as the basis for a full application. The blockchain will store file metadata, and allow all the web nodes to play nicely.  Keynesian inflation doesn't really apply that well here. While initially there will be a burst of created coins (as with any coin launch), but as the decentralized storage web app is used tx fees for storing metadata are returned to miners. So essentially your block reward could mostly consist of recycled coins through the app. Theoretically, you could destroy the tx fees, or replace the block reward with tx fees. Essentially you could enforce smooth and used defined deflation through use of the currency. Or perhaps the tx fees could be returned to the coin holders as dividends. Possibilities of cool economic models are endless.  I can't think of a single benefit of POW over slasher... POW works, and can be deployed now. Last time I checked slasher only existed on paper.  If you do not implement these things, then I think I am more excited for alt-StorJcoins than I am for Storjcoins. I've always thought that altcoins helped innovation(although most are copies).

Less expensive for the same industry standard redundancy, uptime, and reliability; Preferably client-side encryption and hashing automatically enforced prior to upload so all data on the Storj network is encrypted and anonymized; Open source code released under the MIT license; Decentralized, autonomous, and implements multiple blockchains thereby making it resistant to interruptions of service and security risks.  A key project development goal is for Storj to include a blockchain-based dual purpose token scheme that serves as:  1. An incentive payment mechanism within the Storj network between consumers and    providers of storage space and bandwidth 2. An information storage mechanism to record the hash and location of files stored in the Storj network.  Storj won first place in the Texas Bitcoin Conference 2014 hackathon contest, by unanimous decision.  The prize is a guaranteed $250,000 donation from the backers at BitAngels for their initial round of “kickstarter-style” crowdfunding soon to be announced.  Storj team members Shawn Wilkinson and James Lowry made the final scheduled presentation of the contest, which included a working proof of concept software demo.  The founding devs are now getting the alpha software ready for general testing release while putting the finishing touches on the whitepaper and crowdfunding model.  Storj is a proposed decentralized storage system that seeks to disrupt the cloud storage industry by dramatically lowering costs to cloud storage users.  It would do this by paying incentives to storage providers in the form of a ""blockchain-based dual purpose token"" that would also store information about file integrity and storage locations.  The Storj network would autonomously issue, collect, and distribute these tokens so that users could pay for storage and be paid for providing storage.  All data would be encrypted, preferably client-side, before being uploaded to the network. We believe that Storj should simply be a mechanism for users to store their data, and the end user should have control over their data and privacy.  Web Nodes At the Texas Bitcoin Conference 2014 we debuted a proof of concept web node for Storj. We have since been refining that software. You may upload your files to these web nodes and after about 10 minutes your files become accessible network wide. This requires no central server. Any web node connects to the prototype blockchain and may upload and download files at very little cost. This software will be made available to early backers and supporters.  New Cryptocurrency Most cryptocurrencies use their blockchain as a ledger for coin balances. We would also like to use the blockchain to store information about file integrity and storage locations using structured metadata. To this end we will be releasing details about a new cryptocurrency that allows us to accomplish this and get our network running immediately with the help of our web nodes. We will be including this new cryptocurrency as part of our crowdfunding model.  Whitepapers Many of you are hungry for the technical details.
