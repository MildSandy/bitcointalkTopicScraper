Verify - The Future of Reputation ✅✅✅,"   I think you fail to understand who AnonyMint is and the scope of his project will likely overwhelm in popular usage anything this narrow project Verify will ever achieve (not unless perhaps in a very unlikely scenario Amazon decided to accept cryptocurrencies and selected Verify as their reputation service, but even I think that would be mostly hype and not enough people would buy on Amazon with cryptocurrency at this time, although that might be viable some years from now yet then one would assume Amazon would create its own reputation service). And the CRED project has been in research and development for years.  You can do what ever you want, it won’t change the fact that we own the CRED name as both the project name and the token name because our project will have orders-of-magnitude more users and exposure than yours.  I was attempting to make a friendly suggestion that you consider changing your token name to REPS avoid causing confusion at the exchanges. You (and the exchanges who host you) could end up getting sued later perhaps by our users in a class action lawsuit who are pissed off that your selling them tokens (on exchanges) which are not usable for our project. Or who knows what our attorneys may advise later. So it might be best for you to bite-the-bullet and make the change sooner than later (that is if your project is serious about being around a year or two from now, but I doubt that as well). Frankly I think we’re probably in entirely different markets not only w.r.t. the scope and features of our respective projects, but also because Verify is likely primarily targeting speculators first before users; whereas, our CRED project is targeting users and not speculators. And there will be actual teeth behind this claim to make it provably so.  Your project is supposed to be a serious, objective reputation service for merchants. Reputation is a quality attained by widespread acceptance. So you should be using REPS and not credibility which is more informal, can vary based on localized, subjective persuasion, and associated with street cred where it fits better with our project (e.g. we will have decentralized curation/moderation wherein credibility can vary for different sets of users). Also who knows you may possibly end up doing very well with your project by piggybacking on ours, so why are you trying to make enemies? Even look at the title of this thread says, “Verify - The Future of Reputation” not “Verify - The Future of Credibility”. You can clearly see that the word credibility doesn’t describe your project well. Be consistent and use a token name that matches the words you use to describe your main feature, and stop infringing our project and token name (which are consistent and well matched to our project theme).  Quote cred·i·bil·i·ty ˌkredəˈbilədē/ noun the quality of being trusted and believed in. the quality of being convincing or believable. another term for street credibility.  Quote rep·u·ta·tion ˌrepyəˈtāSH(ə) noun the beliefs or opinions that are generally held about someone or something. a widespread belief that someone or something has a particular habit or characteristic.  You’ve been sent a friendly notice at the earliest time that we became aware of your use of our project and token name, for your token name.  Btw, are you a member of the project team or just some random supporter that we should ignore?    don’t forget Ethereum was also an ICO.  You’re not Ethereum. You’re one of some 100s of ERC-20 token ICO metoocoins with a niche idea and whitepaper, extracting money from speculators for a common enterprise, which makes it a security subject securities regulations in the USA, Asia, and soon in Europe with MiFiDII:  Quote from: CRED.me on January 12, 2018, 05:42:35 PM And the ICO cease & desist orders begin:  https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/12/sec-shuts-down-munchee-ico/  And the European regulator is coming:  http://archive.is/heVFi  G20 coordinated regulation coming:  Quote from: https://cointelegraph.com/news/indian-banks-suspending-bitcoin-exchange-accounts The international mood toward Bitcoin has continued to tighten, particularly with US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin stating that the G20 nations will begin working together to make sure that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are properly regulated.  There’s no way we’re going to let you waste the CRED token name on that, given we owned it before you starting infringing and our plans are vast and have been in place for a long-time. And we’ve already used the CRED token name, you just aren’t aware of it.   Lol get the fuck out of here.  The gangster tone is not befitting a professional project.   Quote from: Bitnumb on January 23, 2018, 10:40:51 AM I'm nowhere stating that CRED is Ethereum, just debunking your argument where you state that ICO-issued project will not survive in two years.  Read more carefully. I wrote “ERC-20 ICO-issued”, not “ICO-issued”.  And that’s a very important distinction which is covered in detail in the linked threads I provided. ERC-20 means you can issue a pre-functional token fairly easily with nearly no open source community (at the time of the launch or within a short time thereafter) and other aspects that might make issuance instead a utility token or otherwise side-step the Howey test.  Quote from: Bitnumb on January 23, 2018, 10:40:51 AM go to their website and contact the owner or sue them  I’ll presume they read this thread or have been alerted by their community who do. Yet we’ll also alert them through their other channels of communication. I’ll also presume their attorneys are capable of understanding the implications of investing heavily in a token name which is later subjecting the principals of the project to potential liability. As I said, our post here was only to serve notice that we will not stop of our use of the CRED name for both our project and token. And suggesting this could possibly lead to problems for them in the future, which they might wish to avoid. And suggesting that REPS is better fit to their theme of reputation. Obviously we’re not at the point right now of suing anybody nor wishing to do so. Trying to suggest amicable resolution. It’s up to them obviously how they want to respond or not at this juncture. I presume they’re only interested in the short-term extraction of speculators money and so I presume they don’t care about the long-term outcome. They probably presume they’ll be long gone by them any way. So as I said in my first post, I think the market may resolve this naturally. We’ll see…  Quote from: Bitnumb on January 23, 2018, 03:52:45 PM Lol you’re pathetic. I’m just saying that because registrering a domain doesn’t mean you have the exclusive right for a name first.  The first thing we do before deciding if a name can be ours to use, is to see if we can register the major domains and see if there we any recent registrations for the applicable domains which would indicate some other project may be using the same name. Because being aware of potential future conflicts ahead of time is important for planning and decisions. If they had done this, maybe they would have decided to use REPS from the start instead.  Additionally the issue here for trademark law (copyright is the not the correct law for name protection) is establishing preponderance of public awareness for a particular target market. If our target markets don’t overlap such that users don’t get confused, typically there can be no trademark issue. Yet if our use of CRED totally dominates public awareness, yet they’re selling CRED tokens to our confused users on exchanges, then they would be the infringing party regardless of the dispute about who claimed the name first. So that is why I suggested that if they intend to still be on the exchanges 1 – 2 years from now, they might want to contemplate the implications and consider whether a change now to REPS might be a better strategy. If they instead wait too long, maybe some other project grabs REPS, then they could get squeezed by our more popular adoption and having not a good alternative to switch to if trademark lawsuits come later due to exchanges confusion. The exchanges within our legal reach aren’t going to be offering our token any way (by our design), so we wouldn’t care if they were listed as CRED on exchanges except for the conflict will be, if any, that if our users are mistakenly assuming they can buy our tokens on exchanges and then getting pissed off at Verify for selling our users something they can’t use in our project. Perhaps the confusion will be minimal. I dunno. We’ll see…  Thus, I can conclude you’re also apparently ignorant of the law.  Quote from: Bitnumb on January 23, 2018, 03:52:45 PM Just saying, get the fuck out of the CRED topic, bringing a negative vibe. And if you really have a problem with CRED then normally a smart person would contact the owner itself, not via a forum lol. Ask them directly or sue them directly.  We have hereby provided notice officially in the most popular forum for altcoin announcements and discussion. This is a necessary action so that a date of first public notice is established.  Since 2015, AnonyMint has been quite negative on ICO-issued projects that violate securities and/or FinCEN/AML regulations. A forum is for speaking openly about analyses. The regulators have begun to take actions all over the world on ICOs and this will increase. They can’t shutdown every exchange in every third world country, but they can go after the principals of the projects who reside in G20 countries for example. IMO a huge clawback and crypto winter is coming for those projects which flaunted the law, even if they had legal counsel advising them that they could side-step based on some invalid theory or jurisdictional arbitrage. It’s a very complicated subject matter though, so we’ll have to see what transpires on that front. Nevertheless, I presume 99% of the ERC-20 token offerings are “get rick quick scams” for the insiders.  But moreover, I can basically assume this project is BS because they have a fundamental hen-egg problem with scaling. They can’t scale merchant adoption of reputation services by being a (one of eventually dozens of) 3rd party(ies) to the decentralized ledger trying to aggregate customers and merchants. Rather the reputation problem needs to be solved by the officially sanctioned decentralized ledger protocol itself for a popular decentralized ledger. So that economic reality further weighs into the consideration of whether Verify’s token is truly a utility token and not a speculative security. OTOH, they appear to have some capable people on the team, so it may not be all a mirage, but I still think they'll fail to scale it. There’s other issues I see with the project concept, but I’d rather not expend my time writing it all down.  Quote from: Bitnumb on January 23, 2018, 03:52:45 PM And by the way, i’m not working for CRED in any matter. I don’t even have CRED lol. I’m just following the project because i see its true potential. But found it very funny to see such dumb people on the internet thinking they know everything.  Yeah like you think you know everything:  https://gist.github.com/shelby3/e0c36e24344efba2d1f0d650cd94f1c7  When CRED launches its correct solution to the above issue of how to scale decentralized which Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Iota and all others have not and will not be able to solve, do you even grasp that it’s on an entire other level than this niche reputation project Verify.   Note Bitnumb is apparently just a troll with a gangster attitude and not a representative of the Verify project, so he has been put on Ignore.",False

Verify - The Future of Reputation ✅✅✅,"Afaics, you’re infringing on our use of the CRED token name. Our plans/use of this name predates yours as best as I can determine based on the first public post from your project being early October 2017 on Medium, which didn’t even mention CRED. Your whitepaper has a reference to “Oct. 18, 2017” on page 12, so it wasn’t created before that date. Do you have any public evidence of your plans/use of the CRED name from before October? The first public mention of “CRED tokens” that I can find is on your Medium post of Nov. 8 and the OP of this ANN thread which is also dated Nov. 8.  https://www.name.com/whois-lookup/cred.cloud https://www.namecheap.com/domains/whois/results.aspx?domain=cred.cash https://imgur.com/a/JvmFI  I think that for a considerable duration of time it won’t really matter. Our projects have different target markets. I don’t expect an issue on the exchanges because of this (I won’t tell you why now and actually you’re use of the CRED name on exchanges is somewhat of a blessing for us). And I doubt very much that your narrow scope, ERC-20, ICO-issued project1 will be of any serious threat in terms of name confusion to the scope of our goals/plans. But none of us can predict the future.  Yet this serves as notice that we don’t intend to stop our use of the CRED name.  To avoid confusion and dilution of brand (mostly at your detriment, if any, since CRED is the name of our project and domain name), you might want to consider changing your token name to REPS (can’t be REP as is taken by Augur). Since reputation seems to be your project’s primary function.  Other than that, best wishes for you.   1 I have strong doubts about whether ICO-issued projects will survive for more than a year or two due to a sea-change in regulation on the way.",False

Verify - The Future of Reputation ✅✅✅,"   Thanks!   What would the max credit ceiling be, in percentage of the total payment? Is there a way to recover these losses through the advance payment that the seller gets?  The credit ceiling is established in fiat (so, a $ amount) that represents the maximum advance payment the seller can get. The seller cannot withdraw this in cash. It is solely used for advance payment on transactions that the seller receives. The credit extended to a seller is essentially a negative balance on their account, and we settle this balance before paying out the seller for any future transactions. We have alot more detail around this mechanism in Section 4.3.2 of the whitepaper (relevant quote below):  Quote The second facet includes management of the credit ceiling for sellers. Sellers are assigned low credit ceilings, and these are increased only once the seller has resolved any negative balance outstanding from previous credit issuances. This would mean that a seller will not be issued $20 credit if he has not successfully accepted and repaid a $10 credit.  We take things even further by requiring that sellers that have a negative account balance (i.e. that have received credit but not repaid it) settle this balance before they are paid out for any new transactions. This settlement is done automatically, and ensures that any credit extended to sellers is recouped in the shortest possible timeframe   What is your goal in providing an advanced payment to sellers? Also, will the rest of the payment only go through when the buyer receives and inspects the item, or before that?   Sellers hate using escrows because it chokes their cash flow. We make this a non-issue, in the long term. Payments are made in full 3 days after the buyer receives the item (and sooner for sellers with reputation).   Sorry to ask so many questions, but I know escrow is a hard service to manage, especially when dealing with physical shipping, so I'm trying to get a better understanding and see if there are any loopholes.

Verify - The Future of Reputation ✅✅✅,"   Thanks! Let's dive in...   1) The credit ceiling of a seller can be decreased. But how does it exactly get decreased? With a reputation of <3 stars? Or does it need several bad reputations?  The exact mechanism is not made public to prevent manipulation. I can tell you that it would depend on several factors, the primary one being the magnitude of the difference between the expectation that was set with the buyer and the actual result. It also, as you noted, is dependent on our confidence in this assessment (based on historical data).   2) How do you secure yourself (or the buyer) from an exit scam of a seller with a high credit ceiling? Are personal information gathered somehow?  We perform Know Your Customer (KYC) checks on all sellers. This is required by law in many jurisdictions, and also helps prevent some obvious attack vectors (like a Sybil attack). We describe this in detail in the Section 4.3.2 Advance Payment:  Quote An obvious risk against reputation systems is that of a Sybil attack; this is an attack that relies on forging identities in peer-to-peer networks and using them to gain a disproportionately large influence [17, 21, 22]. In the context of the Verify reputation protocol, this would entail a seller registering multiple accounts, performing many “fake transactions” in order to artificially boost his reputation and then, having accumulated a high-enough credit ceiling to make his pursuits worthwhile, withdraw this credit and depart from the platform. At this point, the entire process can be repeated, resulting in further credit theft, and so on.  A critical component of this attack is based on the attacker’s ability to create multiple accounts. An effective way to limit their ability to do so is to require Know Your Customer (or KYC) requirements from sellers -- collecting things like passport information of the principal, business registration and proof of address. Not only is it best-practice to request this information from sellers, but, in many jurisdictions, it is actually required by law to limit certain forms of financial crime like money laundering.  Another dimension to this solution is to make it difficult for an account to accumulate a large credit limit within a short period of time. A treatment of this solution is subtle; it is important to allow legitimate sellers access to credit, in some ways proportional to the transaction volume that they process, while also ensuring that the transactions themselves are legitimate business transactions. Our solution considers both of these aspects. The first facet of this solution is to prevent sellers from accumulating a high reputation in a short period of time through “fake” transactions. Here, we note various signature traits of a transaction (device fingerprint, IP address, source of funds and other patterns) to detect and reject repeated fraudulent transactions originating from a single buyer (or a network of illegitimate buyers). The mechanism used here is similar to the one described in the prior section on Buyer Protection abuse prevention. Further, the reputation calculation mechanism limits what proportion of one’s reputation can originate from a single party. The second facet includes management of the credit ceiling for sellers. Sellers are assigned low credit ceilings, and these are increased only once the seller has resolved any negative balance outstanding from previous credit issuances. This would mean that a seller will not be issued $20 credit if he has not successfully accepted and repaid a $10 credit.   3) In theory a seller could ""sell"" products to his own accouts to gain a good reputation / high credit ceiling. Did i miss something in the whitepaper here?  Another great question Bob! You're thinking of many different attack vectors that this solution might be susceptible to, and we've got this one covered too. Section 4.3.2 comes to the rescue once more:  Quote The first facet of this solution is to prevent sellers from accumulating a high reputation in a short period of time through “fake” transactions. Here, we note various signature traits of a transaction (device fingerprint, IP address, source of funds and other patterns) to detect and reject repeated fraudulent transactions originating from a single buyer (or a network of illegitimate buyers).

As the reputation of sellers improves, they get a credit ceiling (maximum advance payment that they are allowed to get on orders) that increases proportionally with their reputation -- until it results in instant payouts for practically all of the sellers transactions.  If the sellers ""scams"" the buyer (e.g. delivers the wrong product), the actual damage would be limited to the credit that has been extended to that seller (since transactions outside the ceiling are escrowed). We have various controls in place to determine the credit ceiling that is safe to extend to a seller, based on their proven previous performance plus a delta. Credit is extended by the Verify Fund, for which we've dedicated 15% of the token supply for use strictly as an incentive for usage of the network.",False

Verify - The Future of Reputation ✅✅✅,"   Great question! We actually describe our solution to various forms of reputation system attacks like Sybil, Traitor attacks. Another class of attacks include targeting attacks that happen when an attacker tries to downgrade (also called Slandering attack [1]) or upgrade another user's reputation or even their own account (i.e. self-promoting). This type of attack occurs by submitting a false review or even purposely rating another user once or even more than once (also called Ballot-Stuffing [2]) without truly interacting with the other party. In some cases, it can occur by hiring external entities to execute the attack (similar to a Sybil attack).  This solution to this kind of attack is as follows: Only users who have completed a transaction can rate each other. Only allow a single rating per user per transaction. Throttle the reputation contribution by counter-party (i.e. track repeated transactions made by the same counterparties and limit the contribution that any single counterparty can have on the overall reputation of a seller). The method used to calculate reputation should not rely on just the number of transactions but include other factors like transaction value, the reputation of the parties involved and transaction recency to name a few.  You'll find much more detail in our white paper under Section 4.3 Abuse Prevention.   References: --- [1] Hoffman K., David Z. and Nita-Rotaru C.
