Due to the fact that we do have high-profile, popular members of our team (such as Joleon Lescott, ex-premiership England footballer, and Howard Lake - director of fundraising.co.uk and digital fundraising entrepreneur); each member of our team has had to do their own due diligence on the entire project, ensuring that we remain 100% transparent, and meet all regulations required.  You can see us all share our passion for Wishcoin in our Wishcoin Launch Video.  An interesting fact is; although we don't have to, as a UK registered non-profit foundation, Wishcoin Foundation has capped its salaries to the same regulation as charities - meaning nobody working for Wishcoin Foundation can draw an overly-large, unjustified salary from the foundation.

Wishcoin simultaneously creates an infinite funding stream for charities worldwide whilst also addressing the main issues facing most Altcoins, lack of mainstream awareness and adoption. Wishcoin will not only be accepted as a method of donation for thousands of charities, it will also be introduced to their corporate partners and other respective businesses looking to be associated with such an altruistic brand. Wishcoin will be the first cryptocurrency to truly benefit both investors and the charitable sector, one built on widespread awareness and emotive, newsworthy causes.   http://wishcoin.io/uploads/ext/services/bitcointalk/s_heads/wishcoin-how-wishcoin-works.jpg Wishcoin is a heavily pre-mined coin, with 50% of all coins generated to date having been donated to the Wishcoin fund. This means that 50% of all Wishcoins will directly benefit charities. This not only makes humanitarian sense, it makes perfect business sense. Every donation made to charity will raise the profile of Wishcoin amongst consumers and businesses alike. Charities that are due to receive donations will be encouraged to promote Wishcoin and accept Wishcoin as a donation method for their charity. This in turn will increase the awareness and subsequently the price of Wishcoin and thus increase the value of the donation that charity is due to receive, creating a win-win scenario. Charities will receive their donations in fiat currency after their coins have been sold in a drip-fed fashion to avoid any negative impact on the price of Wishcoin. Every charity that partners with Wishcoin will attribute more and more confidence to the coin and subsequently the price will continue to rise. The next step will be to work with businesses that support our charitable partners to enable payments and/or donations on their platforms. This staggered adoption will be a soft introduction to WishCoin for these businesses, allowing them to familiarise themselves with Wishcoin and to experience the benefits that can be achieved compared to fiat currency. This cycle ever perpetuates, as the currency grows in value, donations will increase and thus media coverage and influence will build. These increases will fuel further confidence in the coin and facilitate expansion, greater adoption and drive the value of the coin ever higher.   http://wishcoin.io/uploads/ext/services/bitcointalk/s_heads/wishcoin-donations.jpg Wishcoin will directly benefits thousands of charities worldwide. Donations will not be industry specific, all causes will be considered on their merits alongside the direct benefits to Wishcoin. The foundation will carefully select which charities will be donated to and will be adopting multiple strategies to ensure maximum exposure. This may include donating within televised fundraising events, donating to well established charities with strong retail links, whilst also focusing on smaller charities where funds will have a greater impact. Publicity stunts will be routine, whether it be the handover of a cheque to a celebrity ambassador of a given charity or encouraging a small town to adopt Wishcoin as a method of payment within their local shops, in exchange for a donation to their local cause. The genius of Wishcoin is that it will be in the best interest of the entity receiving the donation, to publicise Wishcoin to the fullest degree. A pledge of a certain volume of coins will be made months in advance of said coins being converted into fiat currency and thus in that time period, should the value of the coins double or treble due to their marketing efforts and raising the profile of Wishcoin, everyone will greatly benefit. The coins pledged will be worth significantly more and those who are due to receive future pledges will also benefit from the increase in value. Our team has over 50 years of experiences working both within and alongside charities, fundraising and building contacts. These relationships will be integral to ensuring that Wishcoin benefits fully from the donations made. Our in house PR team will also work tirelessly to ensure that donations gain the attention of both mainstream media and crypto specific media alike, raising the profile and awareness of Wishcoin as a brand. Further we expect for significant media attention to surround Wishcoin as an investment, due the exponential gains mixed with the good causes that are benefitting from the value of the coin. We believe this will encourage traditional investors, who may have been previously guarded with cryptocurrency as an investment, to invest.   http://wishcoin.io/uploads/ext/services/bitcointalk/s_heads/wishcoin-gdpr.jpg It is worth noting that the General Data Protection Regulation due to come into force in May 2018 will have a significant impact on charities fundraising activities. This could have a devastating impact on smaller or less financially secure charities, whilst also having a significant impact on others, Wishcoin will be perfectly primed to assist such charities and the market will be even more receptive.   http://wishcoin.io/uploads/ext/services/bitcointalk/s_heads/wishcoin-the-core-team.jpg Robert McLean: Co-Founder Robert is a serial entrepreneur, currently CEO of The British Property Awards, one of the largest awarding bodies within the UK residential sector, judging thousands of agents each year. Robert has previously sold a successful estate agency that he personally built and has brokered commercial office space in London for a number of years. Robert co-founded Wishcoin to utilise his business experience within an altruistic marketplace, firmly believing that Wishcoin can revolutionise charitable fundraising, creating stronger corporate links whilst changing the face of Cryptocurrency.  John Davies: Co-Founder John has extensive business systems development & management experience. With interest in application development, John adopted CSS, Javascript and SQL early. John is experienced in programming Java, VB, VB.NET and C#, and coding primarily with the PHP language; building corporate management tools for businesses globally. John operates J-D.Design, and has been the lead developer on a cutting-edge website management system due for release in 2018.  Joleon Lescott: Co-Founder Joleon has had an accomplished career in football, playing professionally for Premiership teams such as Manchester City, West Bromwich Albion and Everton over the past 17 years, including 6 years representing England. Joleon‚Äôs altruistic nature lead him to be pivotal in the creation, structure and progression of Wishcoin. Through both social media, traditional media and an extensive set of contacts, Joleon will continue to be a driving force behind Wishcoin.  Gary McLean Hall: Senior Developer Gary McLean Hall is a software developer, architect, and consultant with more than a decade of experience optimizing processes and practices in diverse Agile environments. He recently founded Igirisu to provide developer training for TDD, continuous integration, refactoring, design patterns, SOLID principles, and Git source control; cultural coaching towards Agile; and related services. His book, Adaptive Code via C# (Microsoft Press, 2014), has been translated into German, Japanese, and Korean, and won the Society for Technical Communications Distinguished Award in 2015.   http://wishcoin.io/uploads/ext/services/bitcointalk/s_heads/wishcoin-core-advisors.jpg Howard Lake: Senior Advisor Howard Lake is a digital fundraising entrepreneur. He has published UK Fundraising (fundraising.co.uk) since 1994, helping charity fundraisers make the most of digital tools. He has worked in fundraising since 1988 for Oxfam GB, Afghanaid and Amnesty International UK. He wrote the world‚Äôs first book on digital fundraising (1996), and has trained thousands of fundraisers in digital fundraising since then. A Fellow of the Institute of Fundraising, he is chair of the judges for the National Fundraising Awards, and founded the Fundraising Camp event series.  Mal McCallion: Senior Advisor Mal McCallion has been involved in a number of significant, innovative and successful new technology ventures, including Zoopla and Primelocation. His interest in Wishcoin stems from an ongoing desire to harness technology to help those in need, something that unites his long experience in ‚Äì and enjoyment of ‚Äì the tech space with his Degree in Social Policy and Social Work, some 25 years ago. Mal‚Äôs extensive experience in driving technology ventures through periods of high growth will be invaluable for Wishcoin moving forward.  Chris Madden: Senior Advisor Chris has focused on developing UK and international donor support for the last 13 years and his work has been recognised by the Institute of Fundraising - winning the prestigious award for ‚Äòbest donor development campaign‚Äô. Chris has defined cash growth strategy for one of the UK‚Äôs largest charity brand and specialises in developing product and propositions - firstly by identifying market trends, quant and qual research, test, upscale and eventually rolling out multi-million fundraising products. Chris is responsible for raising ¬£40+ million of new donations across a range of charity products including regular giving (restricted and unrestricted income), cash appeals and mid value donor programmes. Chris‚Äô extensive experience working with a range of UK and international charity brands campaigns will be extremely beneficial to Wishcoin‚Äôs progression.   http://wishcoin.io/uploads/ext/services/bitcointalk/wishcoin-roadmap.png   http://wishcoin.io/uploads/ext/services/bitcointalk/s_heads/wishcoin-video.jpg Watch our Video Here   http://wishcoin.io/uploads/ext/services/bitcointalk/s_heads/wishcoin-ongoing-support.jpg We aim to be as engaged as possible with any feedback, suggestions or questions you may have.

Yes we appreciate that it does sounds similar to Make a Wish foundation, however 'Wish' is commonly used in the name of a number of different charitable organisation and projects, so we felt it would resonate strongly with the general public and charitable sphere alike.  Regarding 'why use crypto', cryptocurreny is gaining in notoriety and adoption on a daily basis, we believe that cryptocurrency will be commonplace within mainstream businesses in years to come and thus it is a great market to align the project with. Moreover, businesses that look to adopt crypto will judge each currency on it's merits and one that has such a clear altruistic message, which can assist charities in such a direct way, will be very appealing. Further, many corporate companies understand that being connected with charitable causes not only makes humanitarian sense, it also makes perfect business sense. Thus there are very strong, long lasting relationships between the charitable and commercial spheres which will greatly assist with the promotion and adoption of Wishcoin post ICO.  The crypto market facilitates early investors to receive a unparalleled return on investment for those projects that can achieve successful promotion, adoption and implementation. We therefore believe that crypto is a great market to launch such a project as there will be thousands of people with vested interests and thus engagement will be much higher than in alternative platforms.  Yes, Joleon is the member of the team with such a sporting pedigree, the others are coincidences.  If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.",False

Although the project is a not-for-profit, investors can still make significant profits through their coin holdings. I appreciate that some may see the project as merely romantic, conversely we believe the project is very realistic. Unlike many crypto projects, Wishcoin does not rely on technology yet to be created and/or working within a market that is unlikely to be receptive. Wishcoin relies on common business sense. Charities are now more than ever needing additional funding streams, especially those within Europe that are six months from the implementation of the GDPR legislation. Having spoken with numerous charitable payment platforms, we could seamlessly integrate within a significant proportion of the market with ease. Through partners and advisors we have the contacts to connect with numerous high profile charities and their corporate business partners moving forward. Charity is the perfect partner for crypto, instead of staged PR stunts, a charitable cryptocurrency will assist thousands of emotive causes worldwide and will effect real change in the world. That is something that not only the general public can get behind, mainstream media can get behind, but also most importantly big business can get behind.

I believe this attitude of responsiveness and willingness to answer queries from a curious community will bode well for your project.  I can see the logic of ""why use crypto"", and there is of course great justification in trying to use its popularity to benefit charity. However, I would say to be wary of trying to present win-win situations or you end up being unclear about who the true benefit receiving parties are. A charity must clearly put the people it helps above all. I think you must downplay the promise of unparalleled returns on investments. But that is my opinion and I wish this project well.  I might check it out with more detail. Thank you again!",False

Glad to hear, we are all completely dedicated to Wishcoin and believe that it can play a pivotal role as a fundraising channel for charities, so hopefully that's conveyed through discourse.  Yes, we fully appreciate your comments and will take those on board. You are correct the first and foremost beneficiary is the charities and they are the focal point for Wishcoin. When we refer to win-win we merely mean Wishcoin can have a positive impact for charities, businesses and investors alike. The more Wishcoin is adopted and transacted, the more it's value increases, thus larger donations are facilitated to charities worldwide. The increase in donations will facilitate greater media coverage and awareness, greater influence and subsequently even greater adoption.  Thank you again for following up with your initial comments, these such interactions will prove invaluable for Wishcoin and they are greatly appreciated.  If you have any more comments or questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.
