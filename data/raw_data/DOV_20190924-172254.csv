Well really I would just like a fast and easy way to exchange dovu. Whatever that mechanism may be. The UX of going to an exchange is something we all deal with and is normal but most people aren't going to do all that. The use case for this token only benefits people if they can exchange their DOV for fiat or products/services (giving it value) quickly and easily.  So I think it's inherent to the vision that within this system there is a fast and easy to use exchange.  All speculation, but if I'm right then it's a milestone, and with the way the team has been executing milestones, Hitting multiple pilots in different fields, one being successful with BMW, and developing those relationships more then I have little doubt that they'll accomplish this at some point.

People really need to do their research a little better. Especially before calling projects a scam; it essentially amounts to I DIDNT LOOK INTO THIS AT ALL BUT LOOK AT THIS SUPERFICIALLY SCARY THING.  I'll be generous though.  .3B tokens were available in the token sale they actually ended up burning .236  (not exact amounts) hence the 63 mil in circulating supply i.e. Tradeable  .42B tokens are allocated to a user growth fund. These are earned by contributing to the quality of the ecosystem. These can only be used within the DOVU ecosystem for value added services. Unused user growth fund tokens get returned after 6 months to be used for new users. In other words these won't be traded on exchanges they'll be used in the ecosystem that DOVU creates  .18B for team building. These are vested in six month installments. These could be exchanged and added to the circulating supply.  .3B are reserved/locked down for two years  1.5 mil for the bounty  So the team has 3x the circulating supply but divided up into 4 installments so that should be a pretty gradual introduction into circulation. Not to mention with everything the team is accomplishing it's highly unlikely they devalue their own token by dumping  And a little under 5x after two years. Based on their very aggressive road map DOVU is going to be rocking by then. Will it cause some inflation and FUD? Yes but I don't think that will impact anything in the next 18 months, and even then this is one of the most professional teams I've ever seen. They aren't hyping and pumping, they are delivering solid content about their project, nailing milestones (BMW pilots and probably many more in the coming months), and for them to build all that then destroy their token but market selling .3B is highly unlikely. They'll get what they've earned and enjoy the rest as they continue to grow. That's just my opinion after looking into this for a few months I could be wrong, but that's my wager  Source https://dovu.io/whitepaper.pdf  Roadmap is in there too.  The team really hasn't gotten the credit they deserve for what they're doing at the moment. Luckily that means very cheap tokens for anyone that agrees.",True

What people need to understand is that DOVU is a utility token. Besides having a value on the market it has a value within our ecosystem. We will continue to release more supply as it’s needed for future projects. This means more tokens will be released on an ongoing basis. If it is a relatively large chunk of the circulating supply, this will, of course, be communicated. User growth fund tokens will be released for user growth fund purposes, team tokens for incentives, etcetera. The ultimate goal is to increase token utility. The reserve (300 million) is locked in for 2 years. Because tokens enter circulating supply for projects etc., this doesn’t mean that they are going to be immediately traded on exchanges. They are circulating for project use.  I hope this sheds some light as to why the ration is the way it is.  Best, Jelena",True

DOVU is not linked to the Tesla Motor and that announcement did not come from us! Furthermore to answer your question about the distribution time: It is not in our interest to dump tokens and dilute token value. As we release more tokens the supply goes up. We will continue to release more supply as it’s needed for future projects. This means more tokens will be released on an ongoing basis. If it is a relatively large chunk of the circulating supply, this will, of course, be communicated. User growth fund tokens will be released for user growth fund purposes, team tokens for incentives, etcetera. The ultimate goal is to increase token utility. The reserve (300 million) is locked in for 2 years. Because tokens enter circulating supply for projects etc., this doesn’t mean that they are going to be immediately traded on exchanges. They are circulating for project use. DOV is a utility token.  Best, DOVU Team",True

Like seriously why does the company need to control 99.9% of the supply? This is why I cannot take these coins seriously. Why would I want to put my money into nothing that can be devalued with millions of coins over the long run? Its not financially attractive at all. I think this is going to be a huge draw back to some of these up and coming projects.  There literally is no reason for them to retain 99% of the supply. There are so many successful trustworthy projects that only hold about 10% of the supply and they have more than enough money to build a successful company.  Unfortunately because of this I will have to pass on this one however it looks like a great idea and I wish it success.,True

DOVU has close relationships in the transportation ecosystem, adding to its sector expertise. Partnerships are key to gaining market share. InMotion Ventures, the wholly owned subsidiary of Jaguar Land Rover, is an investor and partner to DOVU, amplifying its connections in the mobility space. Announcements on partnerships with other OEMs will follow soon. Also, DOVU is working with KPMG to make sure it’s structured correctly, ready to scale globally.  Secondly, there is a worrying trend in the industry. There are over 1000 ERC-20 tokens, leading to siloed communities – one of the very things blockchain intends to solve. DOVU wants to shift the focus from isolated ecosystems to the underlying blockchain technology, by being interoperable with other blockchain protocols (e.g. IOTA and Ethereum). Combined with intuitive UX, demystifying the benefits of blockchain technology, this positions the DOV token to be the global unit of value for the mobility and transportation ecosystem.  Lastly, the core team consists of entrepreneurs, blockchain developers, product marketers, product designers and legal experts – all with significant experience shipping and supporting products used by millions of people.

The initiative aims to crowdsource high-quality transport data from large numbers of grassroots users, storing this on the blockchain and making it available to developers and companies in return for the DOV token. Access to these valuable datasets will drive innovation in the transport industry.  DOVU’s pre-sale was extremely successful, attracting a significant number of larger investors. This has placed the project in a strong position to go forwards: pre-sale contributions have already met the project’s funding requirements for several years.

There are so many data sets arising from transport and I believe DOVU will make them available on a blockchain-based network so companies and individuals can do research and cross different sets for data insight. At the moment nobody shares this stuff but DOVU will help learning and this is why the government backed them in the early stage as it ticks the box for 'smart cities' agenda.  it is more for companies than individuals but the system will support individuals selling their data to the grid.",True
