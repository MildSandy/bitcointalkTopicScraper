Since we announced the idea for Staking on the exchange around a year ago, it has recently got attention from some exchanges which have started to look to implement this unique feature. However this is not a problem since the way they are implementing is very basic compared to what we are doing.  If you take a look at the Shard website you can find more in-depth information regarding Shard and partnered Shardax Platforms.",False

At the same time we have been implementing the new chain updates and are now testing these before releasing the complete v2 update. This means the coming Shard v2 update will be a mandatory update. This will simplify the update process for everyone, requiring just one update instead of two in succession.  Some of the extra changes include:  Automated Stack Targeting - This is a new unique feature developed by the Shard team to automate splitting and combining of staked stacks, targeting an optimal balance between network stability and staking speed. At current network staking rates this results in an average target stack around 3x greater than previously!  77% reduced maximum supply - This is more in line with the current supply and better represents Shard's scarcity.  Stake % changes - For a more scalable long term future, estimated to take well over 100 years to reach the new max supply.   The team is also making modifications to the github so that community members can clearly view Shard wallet information and more easily contribute to development as an open source project.  We are looking to have everything ready for release over the next couple weeks and then push the new wallet. Once we push the Shard v2 wallet everyone will have around 4 weeks from the announced date to update their wallets before the mandatory change will take effect. This will give plenty of time for all users and partners to update to the new wallet. There will also be announcements every so often during those 4 weeks to remind everyone to update.  These enhancements follow our long term vision for Shard and prepare the way for potential future changes that the team will be looking into, to further increase scalability and usability of Shard as a functional and desirable global cryptocurrency with a strong focus on the future.",False

We are currently working on a few small changes from testing feedback and in the next few days we will be compiling the wallet for Windows, Linux and Mac. Once complete the release versions and code will be available on Github, so that everyone can update their wallet and make use of the new features and modern UI that we are sure everyone will love.    Some of the new features in this upgrade include:  - Monitor the Shard price via a multi-timeframe graph, with 5 minute, 15 minute, 30 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week and 1 month options  - Monitor your Shard balance via either the Daily or Weekly Graph  - Monitor your staking gains per Day or per Week  - View Shard price, market cap, 24h volume and 24h % change  - View your total balance in $USD  - View how much each transaction you send, receive or stake is worth in $USD  - View a transaction on the block explorer by clicking on the txid  - View your Shard balance for each address on the address page    And some display fixes:  - You can once again view estimated potential stakes on the coin control page  - You can now accurately compare your staking weight against the network weight by hovering over the staking icon    We would like to notify everyone that the coming visual upgrade is not a mandatory update, however we have another update planned for the coming weeks that will require everyone to update. We are currently waiting on replies from some exchanges and other partners before announcing a date for that.",False
