We are not selling to our client's technology (ML, NLP) we are selling knowledge or digital skills.  We are building skills store, where our clients can see all skills (this is like the app store). They can download the skill and start to communicate with Hala. Here are examples of skills - SAP. Reset password, SAP. Open new period, SAP. Block user etc, change credit limit for customer etc.  We are building skills only ones. So skill “SAP. Reset password” can be used by any company in the world that using SAP.  The idea with blockchain is to build a trustable and transparent network, that will allow millions of people train Hala within new Skills. People that have participated in Hala training will be rewarded whenever client will use some particular skill.

VC take the long-term risks, they will get back their money in average after the 5 years (if the company will succeed). It is very hard to compare the conditions for VC and ICO investors, as a result, it is very hard to say to whom it will be good or worse.  I think in each approach there is pros and cons and that is why we have two different communities, VC is using the classic approach to invest and generate the revenue, ICO investors are using a new approach to generate the revenue. I mean each VC investor or Crypto investor did a decision where to play.  Even more, we already got small investments last year from the accelerator program, but this not means that with our Token sale crypto investors will get worse conditions. It looks like two different parallels from an ""interest"" point of view, and there are a lot of startups that during the ICO received classic investments from the investors who invested in startup tokens.

Hala brings faster, actionable, more human-like communication back into the daily interactions enterprises have with their systems, workforce, customers.   What is Hala?  Hala serves as a central digital brain when it comes to business. By connecting blockchain, artificial intelligence, knowledge and business, we have created an AI platform with the decentralized knowledge base for business.  Hala automates IT and business processes for business. And saves time that business users spend on solving the problems, getting information from enterprise software and for searching needed information.   Meet the ""Siri"" for business   Hala Digital Assistant is based on the MVP – commercially available AI platform, which is already piloted in 2 countries in Europe during the past 4 months.  Hala currently serves a business that uses SAP ERP - now we plan is to go beyond that and give Hala knowledge to work with another enterprise software: ERP, CRM, HCM, SCM  We want to involve worldwide enterprise software communities through the Knowledge Share Platform on blockchain to train Hala with new knowledge and skills.   Artificial Intelligence  AI Platform Hala brings faster, actionable, more human-like communication back into the daily interactions enterprises have with their systems, workforce, and customers.  Knowledge share platform Knowledge Share Platform is built on top of AI and blockchain technology, which allows communities with millions of people to participate in Hala training.  Skills store We are giving Hala skills to work with enterprise software. All Hala knowledge and skills are available for clients through the Skill Store.   Blockchain  Token economy The token is the main accelerator of Hala network and knowledge share program. The more knowledge miners and digital assets Hala has, the bigger amount of clients will use Hala Digital Assets. The more clients, the bigger load for performance miners for processing AI tasks.  Knowledge decentralization The community of token holders (clients, knowledge miners, partners) lead the training process of Hala Digital Assets. Hala act as a light moderator. Digital Assets available for the client through the Skill Store.  Transparency The decentralized network gives transparent, flexible and trustable settlement mechanism for all participant of the network. Miners can easily identify the usage of digital skills and get comprehensive statistics for rewarding.   Token economy  From one side the rapid growth of decentralized services, including blockchain-based services, and from another side growth of data, knowledge and their distribution among holders of this knowledge force Hala to build its computing and knowledge network. Means of attracting individual owners of GPU resources (Performance miners) and people that hold the knowledge and expertise (Knowledge miners).  Attracting the knowledge miner's to share their knowledge and expertise can extremely beneficial for both the knowledge holders and the customers. Even a simple example is describing this; one person can use the knowledge while working with one customer or several customers. Hala proposes those people move their knowledge into the digital mind and spread this knowledge among millions of customers. A smart contract is signing with each knowledge miner. This contract will be used to accrue compensation for the provision of knowledge, expertise and skills training whenever this set of knowledge will be in use by the customer.  Hala involves Performance Miners to use their resources for performing Neural network training tasks and AI process execution. The size of training data varies from several gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes. There are some services available on the market to cover this task (SONM) that compatible with TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, MLib (Spark) and others machine learning services. If we compare costs of renting GPU servers on AWS to the amount of money paid to miners for block calculations demonstrates a huge difference.

Every day hundred millions of business users are working with this software and every day they faced problems, issues. From another side, each corporate has IT service desk that responsible for solving the problems. Based on real client data we found that up to 35% of all volume users queries are related to routine processes, common problems.  The average prices to solve one routine problem for the company from 30 EUR to 200 EUR (in Norway one big company is spending 200 EUR for solving one routine query from the user). During the year volume of queries can vary from 50.000 to 1.000.000. They are spending right million of euro just to cover routine work. With Hala they will need to pay around 0.40 EUR, so the benefit is understandable.  Regarding the quality of AI, we are training Hala to each new domain, so Hala understands the context of the problem. From another side, we need a lot of label data to be able to improve the accuracy of Machine learning models and that is why we have Knowledge Share Program, we plan to attract knowledge miners that will train Hala and improve here accuracy to understand the natural language and context of the problems.",False
