This is the first celebrity endorsed crypto ICO existed so this one is surely taken into hot seat too. and those who are spreading fud and speculation are also making a demand they've been making a money for it by paying them to stop their accusation on the project i see it myself in a telegram which the guy are asking for money to stop their doing from spreading fud about this project. these days bad people are doing everything just to make money.  lets be grateful for the haters of the project because they are also helping the project to be active in the cryptospace and making a publicity.  i think it is wrong to be happy if your enemy is firing at you. the  true worth of the project is not based on the numbers of haters you have but the amount you have raised during your tokensale. by the way what is the current standing of the sales?  you are correct. haters and bashers are not directly proportional to success. lets accept that the project may have flaws in communication but it is not also the base on how bad the project is. the team have more room to grow and i know that it is a great lesson for them not to leave this page unattended.  it is indeed a huge mistake to leave this forum thread unattended and not replying to accusations because it will reflect in the capacity of the team to handle objections and fraud. yes let the team figure out how to deal with it.  yes it is a mistake. letting your opponent hit you in your back. now that the admin and the team is online, it is now the time asking questions and answering unresolved queries.  the admin must fight back to this accusations and speculations regarding the integrity of the project. buzcoin in my own understanding is a great project that would compete to the current social media platforms, dating app and marketplace. the concept is concrete and it will be a boom if properly handled and executed.  yes this is a complete package of social media. the hybrid form of facebook,tinder, and alibaba in a one project under the blockchain technology. a timely project for the world.",True

Questions to which the team did not respond.  1. How will the social network of this project be competitively better than those already available on Facebook or facebook? Explain so that even if not an average fan of creativity Buzovoy, a person would want to say: ""I want this social network instead of in contact!"".  2. Than the messenger of this project will be competitively better than the already available vysap or telegram or vibe? Or at least why should we use it when there are already the aforementioned giants (to do better, nobody has ever succeeded, although there are a couple of dozen companies with a capitalization of more than half a million and the top programmers - examples of WeChat, KIN, etc.).  3. Why would the project do something similar to video hosting when there is already YouTube? Everyone knows the vain attempts of all Vimeo and Rutuba to take a share of this niche in the market of multimedia content.  4. Why do a service to find a job, when there is already a headhunter, gobro, etc. (in which tens of millions of dollars are invested in development and marketing, and they are worth this money.) And do you want to make your competitor $ 200,000?)  5. On the main page of the site it is written that Olga invited to the project ""real professionals who have already worked in the field of blockbuster."" I ask you to name the names of these professionals, and links to their Linked-In (without water and empty talk please.) We will check these people to operate on facts.)  6. The question of the distribution of money after fees. A capa of 210 million is declared (let's not talk about it, people who establish this amount are obviously divorced from reality, or were under the influence of coca leaves when they compiled a kapa if they believed that they would be given at least 1% of this amount). Let's talk about what is written on the site. 33% of the fees go to equipment. From 210 million 33% is 69 million dollars. I would like to hear WHAT you want to buy for such money if (theoretically) collect a hardcup? Even if you hypothetically assemble IN 10 TIMES LESS than Archie's Wishlist claims, what will you buy for $ 7 million? WHAT? Only, please, without water. We are all pretty well oriented in the prices of equipment in the field of IT.  7. Now go to the road map. If you believe the plans, by the third quarter of 2019, the marketplace, messenger, p2r platform, and video hosting will already be made. For such a volume of work in such a short time, you will need a staff of (NOT LESS) hundreds of professional programmers and designers. And we return to the frames. Show us this state. At least 10 people show out of the hundreds that will be needed. Or show job opportunities for jobs where you are looking for them.  8. After the producer Olga, who is a professional in the show business, but has never been seen in the IT sphere and the blockbuster, a certain Sergei Semin comes next. All that we know about him, he keeps a network of cafes and canteens with an authorized capital of 10 thousand rubles (WOW!). This experience will certainly help him effectively in half a year to kill YouTube and telegrams and facebook for the collected 200k (still a big question whether they are collected, we will return to this below). What for in such project the shopkeeper meal?  9. Some director of investment Alexey Novikov. What kind of investments is he a director? Show us his work. His link-in, or at least a document, where his name and the amount of investments are marked. And then on the site just a name, just a photo of a man, and just a phrase ""director of investment."" I can also write in my contact that I am the Minister of Economy of one of the developing countries of Asia. The level of trust will be comparable.  10. Next we see that the team has three Whitperpe creators. For the first time I see that the project was hanging on a site not by the creators of the beta version, or MVP, but by the writer and the Whitpeper artist. Why do investors need this? Whitepper has nothing to do with the product, which will bring dividends to investors. Show programmers. This concludes the team. Magnificent seven and a lawyer consult that will kill the top multimedia giants of the entire Internet.  11. Well, to the fees. Show wallets, where the real money is already collected. You broke into the world of crypt, where it is accepted that the blockade is transparency. And you hide your wallets yourself. It's obvious to everyone that you are hiding this because the fees are catastrophically ridiculous and useless. And to prove it back without water you can only show us real wallets, where transactions from real users are visible.  12. The githab is empty. At what stage of development?   13. Where is the promised for the start of MVP sales?   14. Why does Olga advertise anything except her own token?  15. Fans of Olga are indifferent to crypto-currencies and they do not try to use them. You can not get from them even the investments you need.  16. Idea of delirium. It is of no interest to anyone.  17. The need for a blockade is overstated. He does not need this project.  18. Your scam only disgraces the domestic ICO industry.  19. If you want to create an application, then apply for investments to funds. Crypto-currency investors will not give you money.",True

In Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa, cryptocurrencies are not only allowed, but their circulation is regulated and taxes are collected from such operations.  A similar situation with the regulation develops in South Africa and Swaziland: here the authorities strongly encourage the development of cryptocurrency business.

This intention, firstly, once again proves Beijing's great interest in the technology of the distributed register-earlier it became known that the authorities of the country registered 41 patents for inventions that are associated with the blockchain and the creation of a single cryptocurrency wallet for charging duties and fees in the provision of public services to the population and business.  Secondly, the accelerated implementation of the blockchain means that Beijing has become aware that further delay in this issue will have a negative impact on the competitiveness of the Chinese economy, which is of particular importance in the situation of a large-scale ""trade war"" with the United States.  MIIT sees the transfer to the blockchain of the financial sector of the country as a priority, including the provision of services for remote access of Bank customers to their accounts.  In addition, blockchain should be implemented at an accelerated pace in logistics and the Internet of things (IoT).  For the implementation of their plans MIIT reportedly begins to create a public blockchain ecosystem that will enable companies to obtain support from the authorities during their transition to the business processes using the technology of the distributed registry.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s7.wampi.ru/2018/08/18/0000002544105372bdf1117.md.jpg",True

The ban on cryptocurrency advertising, which was introduced at the beginning of the year, was not appreciated by the market, as well as the fact that Facebook still has not made a step into the crypto world.  However, the situation is changing: after 8 months as a part of the Board of the American crypto-exchange Coinbase, David Marcus, the chief of blockchain research in Facebook, decided to leave the trading platform, explaining this by ""a conflict of interest"".  Thus, the study of the blockchain in Facebook is clearly moving into a practical plane, and to a large extent this is due to the depressing behavior of the shares of companies: the management of the social network is trying to understand how to return the billions of lost capitalization, starting practical application of the blockchain technology, which has already allowed many companies in the world to achieve significant progress, especially in the eyes of investors.  Meanwhile, in addition to the fact that the market began to discuss what kind of blockchain project Facebook will finally show the world (perhaps the opportunity to buy cryptocurrencies through its own digital wallet or launch its own platform for trading crypto-coins), there was talk that, perhaps, the social network is now trying to grab any straw to stay afloat, since it is possible that new technologies will lead to a fundamental restructuring of the social media market.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s7.wampi.ru/2018/08/17/0002f48aa35737cab2ec.md.jpg",True

It is interesting that for a generation of Millennials, that is, people between the ages of 18 and 37, it is very important that new people with whom they want to have a relationship know something about cryptocurrencies.  This was stated by 75% of respondents representing this age group.  At the same time, only 12% of respondents would agree to reunite their lives with a person who has invested all their savings in cryptocurrency -this shows that the growth of interest in cryptocurrencies is of professional nature, that is, people in the majority of them are responsible for such investment, rightly believing that it is not necessary to ""put eggs in one basket"".  It is noteworthy that the survey showed a very significant percentage of those Millennials that own cryptocurrencies — those were 40%.  From this age category, almost every second man owns cryptocurrency (48%), and among women — every fourth (26%).  However, all this does not mean that the owners of cryptocurrencies do not carry out transactions with them in pairs with ordinary money: every tenth respondent who solved his housing problem, said that he sold some of his cryptocurrency to pay an initial mortgage loan fee.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s7.wampi.ru/2018/08/09/42170a492f4df0dd10.md.jpg",True

What is it?  For some of you, this is still incomprehensible, completely new, and even a strange phenomenon, mistakenly equated to ""pyramids"". For others, it is a complex system consisting of rules and exceptions, catching the course of which you can increase your equity at times. For the third - the ability to freely dispose of their own funds, transferring them to the account holder's interest and without fear that at the most inopportune moment – these accounts can simply freeze or some information about their owner will be disclosed.  Mining, investing in interesting or important projects for the society, cryptocurrency trading-now, these are the main ways to increase personal capital, which opened up to us with the advent of cryptocurrencies. As opposed to traditional financial instruments, cryptocurrencies have become a stronghold of real economic freedom. An environment in which a people can personally manage their finances. Manage without fear of interference from the government or banks.  How much can you earn? The answer to this question is simple: the amount will depend on how well you learn the laws of the cryptocurrency world and how you will manage your funds within it. The volatility of cryptocurrencies can overnight lift you to the skies.  And it's absolutely true!

The exam, which is conducted by the CFA Institute includes three levels. Questions about blockchain and cryptocurrencies will appear in the I and II levels. The Institute decided to take such a step after having conducted a number of studies concerning what employers want from employees-professors in the field of Finance.

However, 60% of the population of RSA, which is the second largest economy of the African countries, know almost nothing about cryptocurrency.  19% of respondents said that they know about cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but only a little.  17% said that they have information on this topic, and only 4% said that they know a lot about cryptocurrencies.  Among these 21% who know about cryptocurrencies, about a third part (38%) said that they regret that they had not invested in cryptocurrencies before.  53% have no idea how cryptocurrencies work.  43% believe that cryptocurrency is in its principles similar to a financial pyramid.  Meanwhile, Google Trends indicators show that Republica of South Africa has the highest percentage of the population among all countries of the world, which searches the Internet for information about Bitcoin.  RSA has formed a friendly attitude of the authorities to cryptocurrencies.  In April, the head of the banking policy Department of the Central Bank, Brigitte King, said that excessive regulation of cryptocurrency activities can lead to a loss of innovation potential, as well as to a ""shortage"" in the economic growth of the country.

This fear takes place because they are afraid of buying an asset that becomes in demand and remains in limited quantities, and due to this has great growth potential.  When investors see that there is a spread of cryptocurrencies and prices for crypto-coins begin to recover, then, as Sadik believes, there will take place an effect of ""snowball"" and the price of Bitcoin will soar to the skies.  This effect will be stronger than in December 2017.  A number of experts say about the imminent and significant growth in the price of Bitcoin.

Speaking in the lower house of Bermuda's Parliament, Prime Minister and at the same time Finance Minister David Burt introduced the new ICO rules.  The new regulation specifies what the minimum information you need to disclose at the initial offering of cryptocurrency.  Burt said that the teams that prepare the ICO in Bermuda will have to provide detailed information about all those who prepare this procedure.  It is necessary to have a description of the project (usually such a document is ""White paper"").  The minimum requirements for such description are set: White Paper should have a product dossier, calculations related to the potential market coverage, a description of the financing scheme for all ICO stages, the amount of funds that are planned to be attracted, as well as technical aspects related to the software that will be used when launching the platform for new crypto-coins, including a description of the features of a particular blockchain.  The Prime Minister stressed that the new legislation should become the most transparent in the world and eliminate any ambiguity in the regulation of this procedure.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s6.wampi.ru/2018/07/19/123fb75e870b9d6099.md.jpg",True

He is sure that the use of cryptocurrency in the world should ""catch up"" the number of those who use smartphones, which means that the growth in this direction should be 6000%.  He cites the following statistics: in the world less than 1% have cryptocurrency, and 63% of population have smartphones.  This comparison has caused controversy in the social network Twitter, but there is a logic in Srinivasan's thoughts: the fact that surveys show that a significant number of people in the world already know about cryptocurrencies, but do not acquire them and not because they do not want to, but because they do not understand how this can be done.  Since now an increasing number of applications for smartphones offer direct purchase of cryptocurrencies, including Fiat and using Bank cards, the interest and desire of a significant part of mobile device users to purchase cryptocurrencies will be growing.

This conclusion was reached by Professor William Knottenbelt, who heads a group of 24 specialists at the College, who are constantly engaged in the study of blockchain and the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies.  The co-author of the study was also Dr. Zeynep Gurgu from the business school at Imperial College London, and the report was commissioned by eToro.  Despite the fact that social networks have talk that the study turned biased, since its customer was a commercial firm, it is worth noting that eToro itself is only taking the first steps in the crypto-currency world and its main specialization is classic finance, that is, investments in securities, currencies, and derivative financial instruments.  The report notes that modern cryptocurrencies meet all the requirements that apply to Fiat money: they can be a measure of value, a means of payment for goods and services, as well as an instrument of accumulation. At the same time, cryptocurrencies have another thing, which modern money does not have: transactions using crypto-coins proceed in a completely different way, even if they are compared with transactions using electronic money, and the whole ""secret"" lies in the blockchain.  🖥 https://buzcoin.io/   Source: https://www.facebook.com/366805253813711/photos/a.369655846861985.1073741828.366805253813711/403139280180308/?type=3&theater",True

This conclusion was reached by Professor William Knottenbelt, who heads a group of 24 specialists at the College, who are constantly engaged in the study of blockchain and the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies.  The co-author of the study was also Dr. Zeynep Gurgu from the business school at Imperial College London, and the report was commissioned by eToro.  Despite the fact that social networks have talk that the study turned biased, since its customer was a commercial firm, it is worth noting that eToro itself is only taking the first steps in the crypto-currency world and its main specialization is classic finance, that is, investments in securities, currencies, and derivative financial instruments.  The report notes that modern cryptocurrencies meet all the requirements that apply to Fiat money: they can be a measure of value, a means of payment for goods and services, as well as an instrument of accumulation. At the same time, cryptocurrencies have another thing, which modern money does not have: transactions using crypto-coins proceed in a completely different way, even if they are compared with transactions using electronic money, and the whole ""secret"" lies in the blockchain.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s6.wampi.ru/2018/07/13/1307-2.md.jpg",True

""Mr. Bitcoin"", as he was nicknamed by local media, recently prepared a report in which he made a number of statements. In particular, it States that the French state ""has neither the need nor the desire"" to regulate cryptocurrencies, since here we are talking more about the new technology.  The report States that regulation threatens to""freeze rapidly changing technology"". This is contrary to the legal principle of French regulation, that it should be impartial, that is, neutral relating to the object of application of legal norms.  Therefore, Landau proposes to regulate not the phenomena themselves, but to deal directly with those individuals and legal entities that are related to cryptocurrencies.  At the same time, he is sure that, for example, crypto-exchanges have the right to exist. Moreover, Landau said that they do not need to make excessive demands — enough that they comply with the ""minimum principles of transparency, integrity and financial viability"".  He believes that cryptocurrencies should be developed in their"" virtual Kingdom"", and France does not intend to interfere with them in this. However, the authorities of the country plan to make sure that crypto-coins do not become an integral part of the existing financial system, which should not be ""infected"" with crypto-coins.  Recall that in January, when Jean-Pierre Landau was entrusted with a high state mission, he said he sees in Bitcoins similar to what happened during the ""Tulip fever"" in the Netherlands.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s6.wampi.ru/2018/07/10/0005.md.jpg",True

Well, are you ready for a new piece of information? Today we have prepared for you a very interesting material.  This time our headline topic is ""an option""  About the option we can say that this is one of the most complex financial instruments traded on the stock exchange. In general, an option is a special type of contract the subject of which is not the asset itself but the right to sell or buy it. Thus, a seller agrees with a buyer to sell a certain asset at a predetermined cost and the buyer has the right to buy the asset at this price, but is not obliged, i.e. he may not make a deal.  The price of the asset specified in the contract is called strike (eng. strike price). It may differ from the market price that has developed on the asset. (spot price).  Types of options are divided into: 1) by action, 2) by the period of execution, 3) by type of asset. Now let's take a closer look at each of them.  It is accepted to allocate 2 types of options on action: 1. Call Options. (To purchase goods.)They ensure buyer's right to acquire the underlying asset. At the same time, a call option is an obligation of seller to sell it. 2. Put Options. (On the sale of an asset.) This type of option ensures the right of buyer to sell the asset. At the same time, put option is an obligation of the seller to purchase the underlying asset.  By the term of execution options are divided into: 1. European-can be presented by buyer only on the LAST day of the option. 2. American. Everything is quite different here, it can be executed absolutely on any working day in the period from the date of the transaction to the date of execution. That is, during the entire term of the contract.  And the last, by the form of an asset is usually divided into: 1. Currency option. It gives the right to buy or sell foreign currency. 2. Stock option. The option holder buys or sells shares. 3. Commodity option. Gives the right to sell or buy a certain amount of goods (for example, oil, platinum, silver, gold)  There are many other parameters for classifications, we have identified only the most basic. https://d.radikal.ru/d22/1806/82/124967d61241.jpg",True

At least, if we are talking about luxury apartments of Dukley Gardens residential complex in Montenegro!  Nowadays, in this complex three luxury apartments have been already bought for a total of 420 bitcoins, which is equivalent to the amount of approximately 3.2 million US dollars.  Dukley Gardens residential complex is located in Budva (Montenegro), which is one of the largest tourist centers located on the entire Adriatic coast.  The complex consists of 202 luxury apartments with an area of 80-212 square meters with 1-3 bedrooms.  The cost of a one-bedroom apartment will cost its new owner 125 bitcoins, and for a two-level penthouse will have to pay 800 bitcoins.  In many ways, the implementation of transactions for bitcoins was due to the efforts of the local company AMIA (Astra Montenegro Investment Association), which is engaged in active promotion of the cryptocurrency and convinces them to accept payment for restaurants and hotels in Budva.  By the way, precisely because today few companies in the world accept cryptocurrencies, AMIA has managed to increase the number of its regular customers.  One of them is a 25-year-old crypto-enthusiast from France, who said the process of buying real estate for bitcoins was very fast.  The transaction was held with the participation of the law firm Prelević's, the cryptocurrency was converted into Euros immediately after the signing of the documents and the implementation of the bitcoin transaction.

The British crypto exchange LBX has published research data for its audience.  It turns out that the number of women traders has doubled within the last 6 months, basically, due to the younger generation.  Potential investors are attracted to the cooperation with the exchange thanks to a lot of currency pairs, the cryptocurrency popularity, and the official registration of the exchange in the FCA.  The platform, in turn, receives an influx of new customers. Thus, this process is beneficial for both parties.  LBX employees note that now each of 8 women (13%) in the country decided to invest in cryptocurrency. Six months ago this indicator was at the level of 6% of the total population of Great Britain.   As statistics shows convincingly, the increase occurred thanks to young people. In the age category of 18–20 years each of 5 women invest in the cryptocurrency.  LBX senior business analyst, Agnes de Royer, said that the crypto market formed a misconception about the lack of potential interest in trading cryptocurrency by females. In fact, this is not true:  “We see hundreds of daily registrations, lots of inspirational stories and excellent successes of women traders. This motivates us to move forward, providing an optimal package of services for our users. “  The LBX report also says that against the background of a sharp increase in the interest in trading by women, this indicator is much lower among the male part of the population. This is due to a different approach to the investment process.  Women:  ✅ are not inclined to pursue the benefits; ✅ tend to consult their friends and family more often.  Male traders have a more aggressive style of trading, which sometimes plays a cruel joke against them.

Blockchain technologies are becoming more popular and occupy more place in life of modern man.   The development of digital information and its protection is improving every day and simply amazes with its complexity and reliability.  The prospect of cryptocurrency development looks definitely bright.   It is subject to the natural laws of supply and demand, and with the increase in those wishing to buy the issue does not increase.  According to 3 famous headliners (Katelin Breitman, Balaji Sreenivasan and Peter Smith) the future of cryptocurrency can be expressed by the following statements:  1⃣ There will be a gradual introduction of electronic money in the lives of ordinary people. 2⃣ Decentralized systems will not replace the Bank but will complement each other. 3⃣ Certain benefits will have to be sacrificed to improve security. 4⃣ The stable situation in the next 5 years can not be expected. 5⃣ Even the best experts cannot predict the exact ups and downs, it is necessary to focus on the available charts.  As for the development of the cryptocurrency market in Russia, at the moment there are still some objections of quite influential forces in the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation and a number of other departments, but the government and leading banks still agreed that it is useful for the economy.  In addition, there were clear instructions to support and develop the industry.  The development is directly related to the General legalization of cryptocurrency in the market.  The introduction of the draft law on the regulation of the CFA in Russia will significantly protect participants from numerous risks.  But at the moment there is no clear legal status and regulation system in respect of this currency system.  As with all technological innovations, it takes time to gain confidence and form the legal and economic prerequisites for development, cryptocurrency is no exception.  So we just have to wait.  According to many analysts of the crypto-currency market, all as one say that this is a new future behind which there are many prospects.  It is assumed that the cryptocurrency will firmly enter our lives, as well as future generations.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s5.wampi.ru/2018/06/14/unnamed.png",True

As we have already said, ICO projects appear literally in all areas from retail to petroleum.  An interesting research was conducted at the Boston School of Management of Wallace E. Carroll. Experts found that investors who have invested in various ICOs receive 82% of profits.  Researchers collected data on 4003 ICO-projects, which raised in total $ 12 billion.  The study says: “…today, investors are already shrewd enough to spot a fraudulent ICO from an honest one. And the average investor really gets 82% of the profits from their investments…”  Experts relied on the following calculations: the price of the token after listing on the crypto-currency exchange grows by an average of 179% compared to the initial one.  By the way, even those who did not purchase tokens before listing made a good profit as prices rose on average by 67% during the first 30 days of trading.  At the same time the income of investors who held their tokens longer increases significantly — by 140% in 90 days, 430% after 180 days, and 1,880% after 360.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s5.wampi.ru/2018/06/13/14-1.md.jpg",True

Very soon our webinar will begin, or rather June 20 at 20:00 Moscow time, where you will learn how you can change your life and turn your dreams into reality.  In the meantime, we share with you useful information that may come in handy.  This time we will talk about the Crypto currency.  What it is?  It's simple, it's the same cash, but decentralized and digitized. This is a special kind of electronic means of payment in the form of mathematical code. When you use money, you use the cryptographic elements (electronic signature), hence the name.  The use of crypto currency is done through the ""block"" system (a single chain of information blocks), which reliably stores information and does not allow fraudsters to change data in any way, etc.  What are the advantages of crypto currency?  1️⃣ It's impossible to steal - you can withdraw money only if you know the private key. Another positive aspect is the transparency of all operations. It is impossible to deceive this system or do anything so that others will not know about it.  2️⃣ Small commissions - for transferring several million dollars to another country will take from zero to $ 5.  3️⃣ There is no central server that can hack or disable.  4️⃣ There is almost no inflation in the crypto-currency world.  5️⃣ Crypto-currency transfers do not know the boundaries. Being geographically in one pole of the world, you can transfer them to the very opposite. In this case, the usual money transfer is not only costly and requires the filling of a mass of accompanying documents, but also takes some time. The crypto-currency transaction is almost instantaneous.  Summing up, we can say that the crypto currency has become a modern universal way of owning a currency, the prospects of which are visible to the naked eye.  https://buzcoin.io/en   reference: https://golos.io/ito/@buzcoin/kriptovalyuta-chto-eto-takoe-i-v-chyom-eyo-preimushestva",True

""If it works that way, then we need to create conditions, and, quite possibly, it can also make good money for us.

However, only units of them manage to reach an audience and popularity comparable to Aliexpress, Instagram, Telegram, WeChat.  The trump card of our BUZAR platform, which effectively distinguishes it from its counterparts, is its founder and brand ambassador, Olga Buzova.  Olga is the most popular Russian celebrity. Her Stories in Instagram are included in the world TOP-3 - this popularity was achieved not all celebrities of world level.  Olga's post at Instagram today is considered one of the most effective ways to advertise your product in Russia.  In addition, our team has great professional experience in promotion - for PR of their brands, many large international companies cooperate with us.  Also in favor of the platform will play the fact that Olga already has her own business experience - she owns the clothing brand ""OLGA BUZOVA DESIGN"".  The BUZAR platform is doomed to success!

Probably, you already know that entries in the blockchain chain cannot be edited.  But do you know why?  Blockchain is a distributed database that is stored in the form of multiple identical copies on a large number of computers.  Any new entries made to the database are immediately distributed throughout the network thanks to the constant synchronization of these copies.  A single and continuous blockchain consists of information blocks, into which all new changes are recorded.  The blockchain has cryptographic protection – that is, each user of the chain can make new changes to it only on the basis of the actions performed by him earlier (thanks to encryption).  It is not possible for one user to write to the block on behalf of another, because each user on the network has his own cryptographic key which is known only to him.  Thus, none of the entries that got into the blockchain can be changed or erased later, since it would require simultaneous action on all nodes of the network, which is almost impossible to do!  Therefore, data that has been entered into the blockchain will not be subject to arbitrary deletion or falsification.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s5.wampi.ru/2018/06/06/1e60cb28e19d67e16.md.jpg",True

It is not difficult to guess that the first 3 letters of the name were borrowed from the name of the founder of the project — Olga Buzova. However, this is not the only reason why we have chosen this name.  BUZAR platform will be a marketplace for the sale and exchange of goods and services.  Previously, the role of such a trading platform in the world played markets. The term “Bazaar” itself is derived from the word bāzār of Persian origin and later became used in other countries.  For the first time bazaars appeared more than 3000 years before our era and initially they developed outside the city walls — often they served the needs of running caravans.  When the cities began to expand and become more densely populated, bazaars moved to urban centers and began to develop along the streets that connect the opposite gates of the city with each other.  Over time, these bazaars formed a network of shopping centers, allowing the exchange of information and products.  BUZAR is a new level trading platform with which you can not only buy and sell goods and services without intermediaries, but also to expand your circle of communication, find like-minded people, old and new friends, arrange your personal life.

It is not difficult to guess that the first 3 letters of the name were borrowed from the name of the founder of the project – Olga Buzova. However, this is not the only reason why we have chosen this name.  BUZAR platform will be a marketplace for the sale and exchange of goods and services.  Previously, the role of such a trading platform in the world played markets. The term ""Bazaar"" itself is derived from the word bāzār of Persian origin and later became used in other countries.  For the first time bazaars appeared more than 3000 years before our era and initially they developed outside the city walls – often they served the needs of running caravans.  When the cities began to expand and become more densely populated, bazaars moved to urban centers and began to develop along the streets that connect the opposite gates of the city with each other.  Over time, these bazaars formed a network of shopping centers, allowing the exchange of information and products.  BUZAR is a new level trading platform with which you can not only buy and sell goods and services without intermediaries, but also to expand your circle of communication, find like-minded people, old and new friends, arrange your personal life.

After Warren Buffett once again criticized bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry the Icelandic company Genesis Mining, which provides services in the field of cloud mining, decided to remind the famous investor that not all his judgments in the past were correct.  A co-founder of Genesis Mining Marco Krohn said on Twitter that his company has installed billboards in front of Buffett’s office, with which they tried to show that in this situation not everything is so clear.  “Warren, you said you were wrong about Google and Amazon. Maybe you are wrong about bitcoin?”  At the beginning of May Buffett and his partner from Berkshire Hathaway Charles Munger did not mince words, criticized bitcoin, called bitcoin “rat poison in the box” and reminded investors that they would be in a deplorable situation, as soon as “the euphoria will evaporate”.  A week before, Buffett said that buying bitcoin had nothing to do with investing, but rather is a speculative game each participant of which hopes that he will be able to resell the cryptocurrency at a higher price.  In response to these statements venture capitalist Fred Wilson wrote that bitcoin is a full-fledged investment, because”it feeds the decentralized infrastructure that exists on the basis of fundamental Internet protocols.”  https://buzcoin.io   Source: https://medium.com/@buzcoin/warren-buffett-youre-wrong-e447229aefc3",True

Do you know that in the early years of Bitcoin more than 9 out of 10 financial experts in the world recognized it as an absolutely hopeless means of payment?  However, for almost 10 years this cryptocurrency continues not only to improve constantly, but also to beat new records for its value.  But if to think about it, what interesting things do we know about Bitcoin?  ✅ Bitcoin appeared in 2008 and its creator is Satoshi Nakamoto. Interestingly that it is still unknown who is this person, or a group of mysterious experts. The most likely version is that the creator of this cryptocurrency is an American of Japanese origin whose name is Dorian Nakamoto, but actually this option has not received reliable evidence.  ✅ As you know, the maximum number of Bitcoins is limited to 21 million coins. For today  more than half of this number  has been produced - the algorithm for the extraction is becoming more and more complex and reduces the total number of created coins every few years. It is believed that the last Bitcoin will be mined only in 2140.  ✅ The first million of BTC was mined by Satoshi Nakamoto and many experts think that it still belongs to him. Many curious users are trying to find the purses of Nakamoto to get on the trail of its creator, but no-one has managed to do this.  ✅ Only 36% of all Bitcoin coins was marked in any transactions and payment transactions. All the remaining coins, about 64% of their total number have never been used. Users are likely holding them with the expectation of an even greater increase in BTC cost.  Of course, these are not all the interesting facts about cryptocurrency and bitcoin!

And today we will discuss how BUZAR is to solve these problems!  Using the technology of smart contracts, our platform will give access to anyone who wants to place the goods on the platform, and at the same time, will be completely transparent.  The advantages of smart contracts will allow to fully implement the project concept. Moreover, users will be able to purchase not only goods, but also services from different artists at BUZAR. Due to this, the platform will combine a wide range of features that will attract and keep users here for the longest period of time.  The platform itself will play the role of a mediator and a guarantor, which, using technologies and smart contracts, will exclude the possibility of fraud during transactions on BUZAR.  We will create a special service of guaranteed transactions, the essence of which is that a client will make a purchase on BUZAR platform and a seller will receive a fee only after the transfer of the goods or the execution of an order.  In case of disputes, BUZAR will act as an arbitrator who will make final decisions.  Thanks to this, BUZAR has all the chances to become a transparent and honest super-marketplace, which will combine a large number of activities and will have the widest possible customer base.  BUZAR site will operate in three segments simultaneously:  1️⃣ C2C (client – to-client);  2️⃣ B2C (business – to-customer);  3️⃣ B2B (business to business).  To make payments between participants a token of the ERC20 standard will be issued on the Ethereum blockchain platform.  With the development of the platform it is planned to connect to BUZCOIN more and more people.  We want people around the world to be closer to each other.  BUZAR is a global online platform that is both convenient for communication and e-Commerce. It is a new generation IT platform.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s5.wampi.ru/2018/05/23/34f94b45b48891b5d3.md.jpg",True

That is, the more products of different categories are presented on your site, the higher the chance that the buyer will buy something.  And this is actually true, and that is why in the modern world marketplace service is developing so fast!  But if everything is so perfect, why do we create BUZAR platform? Because the marketplace has a number of serious drawbacks!  ▫️Problematic withdrawals faced by sellers, as each marketplace introduces its own restrictions on withdrawals and sometimes the process takes more than a month.  ▫️The probability of fraud, despite the strict policy of large marketplaces which aims to protect the rights of consumers, from the purchase of cheaper goods instead of the ordered expensive, or from cases of disappearance of the seller with other people’s money.  ▫️Cheat ratings and reviews complicate the process of choosing really good seller who would sell a product of good quality.  ▫️High commissions, which entrepreneurs are forced to pay, who want to sell their goods using marketplaces. This disadvantage has a direct impact on users, because sellers significantly increase the value of the goods, that is why buyers often heavily overpay for it.  ▫️Ineffective technical support, which, in case of any problems, regardless of the nature of their occurrence, may not respond to the application for weeks, resulting in the problem is solved too late or not solved at all.  ▫️”Tough” policy of the administration towards sellers. Minimum violations of the terms of use may lead to the blocking of accounts and the complete loss of the established client base. Administration of modern marketplaces do not take into account the objective arguments of all parties in order to sort out a situation.

That is, the more products of different categories are presented on your site, the higher the chance that the buyer will buy something.  And this is actually true, and that is why in the modern world marketplace service is developing so fast!  But if everything is so perfect, why do we create BUZAR platform? Because the marketplace has a number of serious drawbacks!  ▫️Problematic withdrawals faced by sellers, as each marketplace introduces its own restrictions on withdrawals and sometimes the process takes more than a month.  ▫️The probability of fraud, despite the strict policy of large marketplaces which aims to protect the rights of consumers, from the purchase of cheaper goods instead of the ordered expensive, or from cases of disappearance of the seller with other people's money.  ▫️Cheat ratings and reviews complicate the process of choosing really good seller who would sell a product of good quality.  ▫️High commissions, which entrepreneurs are forced to pay, who want to sell their goods using marketplaces. This disadvantage has a direct impact on users, because sellers significantly increase the value of the goods, that is why buyers often heavily overpay for it.  ▫️Ineffective technical support, which, in case of any problems, regardless of the nature of their occurrence, may not respond to the application for weeks, resulting in the problem is solved too late or not solved at all.  ▫️""Tough"" policy of the administration towards sellers. Minimum violations of the terms of use may lead to the blocking of accounts and the complete loss of the established client base. Administration of modern marketplaces do not take into account the objective arguments of all parties in order to sort out a situation.

US citizens cannot acquire tokens, although this country is considered the most desirable in terms of ICO and crypto-currency business.  Why so? Let's try to figure it out together. First of all, let's assess the background in the states at the moment. Companies that have opened representative offices in the US for ICO and token release, have to register another company in those jurisdictions where such activities are approved, or this issue has not been settled by the time of the token sale.  Another matter is also that the stock market and securities legislation limited the participation of residents and citizens of the United States in token-seals. In July 2017, representatives of the SEC reported that the tokens could be recognized as securities if certain conditions were met.  For example, a give a share in the company, vote right, profit promise, etc. Whether a token classifies as security determines by Howey Test, Capital Risk Test, Family Resemblance Test and other tests. In addition, the SEC prepared documents designed to warn future investors about risk with participation in the ICO.  All this applies to various ICO projects around the world, because they have to limit the participation of US citizens. Therefore, US projects are forced to opt for other jurisdictions for token sale in order not to complicate the lives of investors and themselves.  To sum up, a conclusion can be made that the development of ICO in the States is rather vague, at least at the start. Most likely, companies, having a head office in the US, will continue to sale tokens through more loyal jurisdictions.  https://buzcoin.io  https://s5.wampi.ru/2018/05/16/22-2.md.jpg",True

On the one hand, the rapid growth of IT-technologies has made our life much easier and more convenient than even 10 years ago, on the other – has complicated it.  Paradox? Not at all. Let's look at the screen of your smartphone and say how many messengers are installed in it? Three, four, or all five?  What about social media? Today, it is the order of the day to have several active accounts for the simple reason that one social network is more convenient to communicate with friends, the other one - with colleagues, the third one has a lot of interesting content and the fourth – free games and so on.  As a result, we need to operate 15 – 20 applications several times a day.  Some time ago smartphones  made a rapid revolution in the mobile market due to the fact that they offered an innovative technology ""All-in-one"". Conservative users, of course, said that the quality of the photos of the smartphone and of any digital camera didn’t go into any comparison, that the size of the screen of smartphones didn't allow full use of the Internet and text editors, etc.We are all well aware of the finale of this story.  Digital cameras are popular only among enthusiasts and professionals. Smartphone screens have reached such a size that no one remembers about tablets, and the power characteristics and functionality of mobile devices today are at such a level that they are able to solve a variety of problems, doing great even without desktop computers, and without laptops.  The unique Russian IT-project BUZCOIN is preparing for exactly the same revolution. BUZCOIN project combines two the most popular destinations among users.  The first is  BUZAR p2p communication platform, where the holders of BUZCOIN tokens will be able to use both the messenger and the social network. Even at the stage of development the platform included a functionality that allowed to share photos, videos and audio files, use video hosting and music service, where it was possible not only to listen to music but download the songs of popular authors, post your own works on the platform on a reimbursable basis, receiving remuneration from BUZAR.  The second part of the project BUZCOIN is a universal super-marketplace of goods and services. The developers say that users will have access to services for the purchase and sale of goods, Bulletin Board, services for rental and sale of real estate, job search, etc.  Thus, BUZCOIN offers the market a functionality which is interesting both for ordinary users and for representatives of the business community. Within the framework of the P2P platform BUZAR will the unit more than 20 different functions, for the use of which nowadays it is necessary to download a separate application for each of the functions. The developers of BUZCOIN project suggest not to do this, and press just one button.  It is interesting that now the creators of the project BUZCOIN declare that the stated functionality in any case will not be final.

Natalia's idea is that the existence of such an application should encourage people to do more charity work.  ▫️Popular singer Basta also launched his cryptocurrency – the base for his Ticket Coin cryptocurrency was Russian platform Sibcoin. Ticket Coin system is implemented in the format of a ""bonus program"" for fans of the creative association ""Gazgolder"": for the purchased cryptocurrency they can access special areas at events held by this association, buy tickets at a discount of up to 50% and even meet with artists.  ▫️By the way, foreign celebrities have not remained indifferent to the cryptocurrency world.

It is likely that at least one decentralized platform will capture the majority of the market and guess which one we are talking about.

Today the Parliamentary Newspaper pressroom saw a round-table meeting on one of the hottest topics on social media and beyond that is the consequences of banning Telegram and Facebook on the Russian Internet.  The round-table meeting took place with the participation of an LDPR party State Duma deputy Vasily Vlasov as well as representatives of Youth Parliament under the State Duma along with academic community.  The main issues put up for discussion were, obviously, the consequences of banning Telegram for business community and ordinary people, the effectiveness of banning social media in the war on terrorism and using social media bans as a response to Western sanction policies.  The general sentiment among the round-table participants turned out to be on the less pleasant side for the Russian authorities and the federal watchdog agency – Roskomnadzor – in particular, considering it has been attempting to ban the messenger for weeks to no avail.  You can create restrictions on the legal level, but in case with Russia the harshness of these bans is inversely related to their observation.  Even if the ban turns out to be effective, at this point of IT development there is no problem in creating a new service that would be similar to the banned one, within a matter of weeks.  In his turn, the founder and coordinator of the BUZCOIN project, Andrey Semin,  not having any claims against the developers of either Telegram or Facebook or their respective products, has expressed his concerns about the lack of Russian software products, messengers and social media.  He believes that the new Russian P2P communication platform called BUZAR whose launch is just around the corner, and if it doesn’t become a 100% substitute for Facebook, it will be able to cover most needs of the target audience as well as fully comply with the Russian legislation in terms of data processing and user data storage.  https://buzcoin.io",True

Blockchain, cryptocurrencies, bitcoin – probably there is no one who hasn't heard these words. The new technology, the new digital economy, and the new ways to make money made a lot of noise... and gave the world a whole galaxy of rich people of a new type - the crypto-millionaire.  TOP 3 crypto-business  1️⃣ Brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. $10 billion. Today they are probably the most famous crypto-rich people in the world. And even besides the fact that they are twins, which significantly distinguishes them from the crowd. However, for the first time they became known not as crypto investors, but as those who accused Mark Zuckerberg of plagiarizing the ideas of the social network Facebook. They even sued him in court.  We can say that the brothers won the case-Zuckerberg went to a settlement agreement and paid the twins $ 65 million, although they themselves are accused of”patent trolling."" This is when for large corporations it is easier to pay off the annoying plaintiffs with relatively small amounts than to work several years in a litigation - any conflict is bad for the price of shares.   With this amount Winklevoss started their crypto journey. They spent about $ 11 million from Zuckerberg's payments for the purchase of bitcoins. Since then the first digital currency was cheap, they bought it a lot. As a result, 5 years later, they became the first publicly known crypto-billionaires in the world. Their investment in bitcoin is up more than 31 000%! Alas, no one has managed to repeat their success. At least not in public.  2️⃣ Roger Ver. $2.7 billion. One of the first large investors who started working with cryptocurrencies. During his stormy activities to popularize the crypto industry he even received the nickname ""Bitcoin Jesus"".  According to various estimates he owned about 300 thousand bitcoins. Today, he actively promotes another currency – Bitcoin Cash and even made statements that he sold out all his bitcoins.   Is it really difficult to say, although the idea to fix the profit in December 2017 with the price of bitcoin of $20 thousand looks quite reasonable. We analyzed his fortune based on the fact that Ver still keep bitcoins with him or has bought a similar amount of Bitcoin Cash.  3️⃣ Tim Draper. $270 million. Tim Draper is a well-known venture investor and founder of Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Despite the fact that his crypto-capital is noticeably less than a billion, he is on our list. Why? Because he has $ 270 million only in bitcoins. And no one knows how many other cryptocurrencies he has managed to buy in recent years.   In 2014, he purchased at an auction of U.S. marshals about 30,000 bitcoins from the number of cryptocurrency withdrawn from the wallets of the semi-criminal platform Silk road.  Tim Draper is still optimistic about the future of cryptocurrency. Recently, he said that the emergence of cryptocurrencies is more important than the creation of the Internet and the industrial revolution. And even gave a forecast of growth of bitcoin to $50 thousand by the end of 2018. It is not clear whether this forecast comes true, but we can say that he is not going to get rid of his cryprocurency.  All these billionaires are either experienced investors and businessmen, or those who stood at the origins of the crypto industry and managed to see great prospects in it. That is, people who already had considerable capital before entering the crypto world.  What about” mere mortals "" like you and me? Is there a chance for an ordinary person to get their benefits from cryptocurrencies?  Our answer - of course Yes!

And she said that the BRICS countries (Russia, China, Brazil, India and South Africa) will soon be able to issue their own cryptocurrency - the discussion is already underway.   She noted that in 2018 the Bank of Russia intends to start negotiations with the EAEU and BRICS on the introduction of the common digital currency into the financial market. So we can say that Russia, as a state, has recognized the advantages of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, and intends to promote them in the international arena!

Blockchain is a database that stores a constantly growing list of records (blocks). These records are organized in a strict sequence, and each subsequent record stores some information about the previous record. Such a database is stored on users ‘ computers (it does not have a single server) and everyone who keeps the database has its full copy and new records are added to all existing copies.  Is it clear? Let’s explain with a simple example:  Sasha bought 6 apples Record this fact in the blockchain (some diary) and get block number 1. Send block №1 to Kolya, Vita, Sveta, Snezhana and Margarita (network users) — now all they know that Sasha has 6 apples.  Sasha gives Kolya 5 apples to divide them between his friends. Write down this fact in block number 2. Block 2 contains the unique identifier of block 1. Send this block to Vite, Sveta, Snezhana and Margarita.  Kolya gives Vita 1 Apple.  Write this down in block #3. Add a unique identifier of block 2 . We send a block to all users.  Kolya gives Sveta 3 apples to share with her friends. Record in the block number 4. Add the identifier of the block № 3. Send out a block.  Sveta, instead of treating her friends, eats all 3 apples in a fit of hunger during the night, and when Snezhana and Margarita come to her for the promised apples (because they received information that Kolya gave Sveta three apples), Sveta is trying to put the blame on Kolya and says that he gave her only 1 apple, and the rest he kept for himself.

Let us talk a little bit about this.  Thus, a smart contract is an electronic algorithm or a condition under which the parties can exchange money, shares and other assets. To implement a smart contract you need to have a decentralized network where all participants have equal rights.  How it works – let's explain by example.  Have you already bought the property?  If so, you probably know that it is necessary to apply to the notary to make a deal, and it is always an additional cost for the buyer. Smart contracts allow you to get rid of intermediaries (banks, lawyers, notaries, etc.), because they independently verify the terms of the transaction and confirm it.  The asset or currency is transferred to the program. After that, it begins to monitor the implementation of the contract. Once the conditions are considered fulfilled, the parties exchange assets. The seller receives a fixed amount and the buyer passes the goods. In other words, everything happens automatically.  It is the Ethereum smart contracts in our project that guarantees transparent operation, security of transactions in the B2C, C2C and B2B segments. This allows us to exclude the possibility of a human factor, and hence any deception.  🖥 https://buzcoin.io",True

First, let's understand what is mining. Mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the blockchain, and also the means through which new cryptocurrency is released.  While computers carry out payload for users, owners of the technics receive the share and earn. In fact, these are computing powers, which ensure the functioning of all cryptocurrency payment service providers.  If  it is impossible to start the cryptocurrency without computing power, then how our BUZAR platform will work? We do not have miners. Everything is very simple! At this stage, the Ethereum network, on the basis of which the platform of version 1.0 will be started, gives us necessary computing power.  It is reached through the integration of tokens of the ERC20 standard, which also have many advantages. Such as an ensuring stable work of smart contracts, the safety of transactions, transparency of transactions, liquidity based on demand, but not at the will of pools of miners, etc.  Such approach allows us to make really decentralized and reliable system for creation of a universal marketplace and other global services!  https://buzcoin.io",True

Olga understands that we live in the era of the Internet and digitalization and therefore decided to create a platform that will combine several simple and important functions for people using modern technology blockchain and cryptocurrency.  Having invited to her team real professionals who have already worked with blockchain projects, Olga decided to create a project - BUZAR and release her own cryptocurrency BUZCOIN.    1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132   Bit of history   A bazar is a marketplace where goods and services are exchanged or sold. 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334 The term originates from the Persian word bāzār. Although the current meaning of the word is believed to have originated in Persia, its use has spread and has been accepted into the vernacular in countries around the world.  Evidence for the existence of bazars dates to around 3,000 BCE. Bazars initially developed outside city walls where they were often associated with servicing the needs of caravanserai. As towns and cities became more populous, these bazars moved into the city center and developed in a linear pattern along streets stretching from one city gate to another gate on the opposite side of the city.  Over time, these bazars formed a network of trading centres which allowed for the exchange of produce and information.    12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334 Buzar is a new online platform where any Internet user can find the most important thing he is looking for in the network: a boyfriend or a girlfriend, arrange a private life, make new acquaintances, find old friends, business partners and associates, get away from loneliness, which is so much in the modern world. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132 On the other hand, we will create a universal trading platform where everyone will be able to exchange values, buy something, bypassing intermediaries, or on the contrary to sell something urgently.     12345678910111213141  Social network 12345678910111213141  Messenger 12345678910111213141  Video 12345678910111213141  App in app 12345678910111213141  Events 12345678910111213  Music service Messaging, calls and video calls over encrypted channels Hosting and video broadcasting Direct user access to the services of hundreds of companies and applications through the BUZAR Purchase tickets for concerts and other events    1234567891011121314  Bulletin Board and online auction 1234567891011121314  Purchase & sale of goods and services 1234567891011121314  Job service 1234567891011121314  Real estate 1234567891011121314  Creation of online stores 12345678910111213  Cryptocurrency exchange service and p2p payments with guarantee of transactions security through smart contracts technology Publication of vacancies and job search service Service for rental and sale of real estate This function will be introduced after the appropriate license is received.        1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132 April 2018.
