We ask the same questions ourselves!  1. From our point of view, we need to show that we have a good business model and the ability to execute it. There are many ways to increase demand and token prices after ICO. The most basic way is to keep your promises to investors and prove that you've met your objectives stated in your roadmap. Keep regular meaningful updates and stay in the public eye. Here at HomeToken, we chose the shortest route to profitability to build our brand and trust. We've seen too many startups failed because they're out of touch and build platforms that no one asked for. There is an unhealthy trend where startups continue burn through investor's funds for years without a year of profit before failing eventually. Just look at Uber struggling at the moment.  2. From what we've seen, token prices fall after ICO because of tokens given during bounty campaigns and high token bonuses during ICO. Too often, developers start getting lazy and go quiet, after raising funds from ICO. Token prices of good projects will recover eventually. We will also have a token buyback program to support the value of our tokens.",False

There are no agreements with any exchanges yet. We are focused on making our ICO successful at this moment.  Our tokens will be listed on Waves DEX from day one, until we get listed on other exchanges. This is the short term solution until we get listed on other exchanges.  We totally understand that our tokens need to be traded on centralized exchanges, and we are committed to list on these exchanges the soonest possible.  Noted that some coins/tokens take too long to be listed on more exchanges and we plan to learn from their mistakes.   Quote from: Cryptotina on September 05, 2017, 09:49:15 AM Did someone say Asian?

Quote from: Fargo on August 02, 2017, 04:19:54 AM Hi - Enjoyed reading about your company.  Quick question - In your whitepaper, page 8, it says that Quote ""Revenue earned by HomeToken will also be reinvested and positioned to expand the overall property portfolio, both in terms of quality and quantity.  We strongly believe that the value of the HomeToken will increase based on the correlative increase of the rental income and investment properties owned.""   So earnings of the properties are not distributed back to the Token holders via a dividend?  Under your HomeToken buyback program - are these tokens burned?  Hi Fargo,  Thanks for your comment!  Earnings will be used to expand the property portfolio and buyback our tokens from open markets, to reduce token supply.  We feel that buybacks are more straightforward than dividends because tokens may be kept at centralized exchanges in the future.  No smart contracts on WAVES yet, to burn tokens but we will disclose the details of the tokens that were bought back and the address they're kept in.  We will monitor the developments of the old and new economy and adopt the best practices because we want to be transparent and repay our investors.",False

Before we even purchase an investment property, we will conduct the necessary inspection, research and comparison to ensure that our purchase is easy to rent, with healthy capital appreciation. We have already done this for many years.  We are targeting small and micro apartments near public transport within the city, which are in high demand in big cities around the world.  As per our whitepaper, we only plan on purchasing completed units to avoid getting exposed to incomplete and abandoned properties.  We also have contacts that will help us renovate and lease out our units at competitive prices.  Naturally, HomeToken will have to monitor the properties owned and local market sentiments closely.  Last but not least, population and economic growth in the housing markets we are in, will only increase demand for the type of properties we want.  Our token buyback program was created to protect the value of our token and investors.  With proper financial management, we will be able to reduce most of the risks normally associated with property investments, and withstand potential economic downturns.",False
