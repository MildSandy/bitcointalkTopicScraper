Because that's what happened when the team decided to extend the crowdsale, they informed the community and gave everyone the chance to leave if they didn't approve the extension of the crowdsale. Also, what kind of massive idiot you have to be in order to do a Ponzi scheme and use your real name?

And we help to validate them. Photos can be easily manipulated on Photoshop. Easy to make a person bold or put blue eyes and change the ear shape, off course people wouldn’t see the same. But the hard now is to bring that person to life and provide a valid evidence of that person existence.    - it is clearly visible that people in the pictures are not the same people and your research has been made using an approssimative face tracker program ‘ clear visible” maybe to you, obviously some members of the community or possible investors are not seeing as the same person, otherwise, they would not have reported to us. Make it easy for all of us now and submit the rest of your team pictures. You can also submit the ORIGINAL photos used of your entire team, high resolution so friends in the community – Photoshop experts and photo forensic analysts, can take a look at them.    FOR THIS REASON: - We are going to report you to a moderator.  Why all this hate? We are asking valid questions and you are acting exactly like a scammer do when they are caught. The other ICOS that we identified as SCAM posted similar accusations, threats, including wanting to know where I lived, etc. And then later, they removed photos, deleted pages, etc.. the list goes on and on.  We are not here to put down a legitimate ICO, but to point out flags that are associated with scams.  You are more than welcome to report to moderator.  We don’t work for Bitcointalk Forum, we are helping to protect the community in general against ICO scams. We make a call and if Bitcointalk forum moderators decide to eliminate our post, we will post somewhere else, including on our website. To us what is matter is to keep the community informed and aware of scam and possible scams.   Pictures of your team raised concerns to the public if you don’t want to provide evidence it is up to you.  People don’t need to click the links. The links are there just for sources in case someone wants to verify the image.  Since you posted your picture, go ahead and post the rest of your team as well.  Thank you!",False
