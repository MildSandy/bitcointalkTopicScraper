Our web site and your user wallets will soon be offered in all those languages too.  And here is more important news of the week. A few days ago the founding council of Cryptaur chaired by Dmitry Buriak held a meeting to discuss results of the token presale and our preparations for the forthcoming token sale. Everyone agreed that the results were very successful as the money raised was sufficient to begin full-scale operational activities, whereas the number of registered users was so impressive that Cryptaur became one of the industry's leaders already at the presale stage. In the course of the meeting brothers Jacobson came up with a proposal to sell Cryptaur to a group of anonymous external investors who got interested in our project seeing the results of the presale. However, Dmitry Buriak made a resolute statement against this proposal as such sale would inevitably mean putting Cryptaur under external control and jeopardizing the future of investments made during our ""people's fundraiser"". His position was supported by the council and brothers Jacobson were offered to sell their share in Cryptaur instead, which they accepted. Thus our project will remain independent and stick to the initial strategic plan of development.  Yet another piece of news is to do with the rules of the forthcoming Cryptaur token sale. As announced earlier, our platform users will be able to re-invest their bounties back into CPTs starting from November 11. It was also expected that for the re-investment there will be a 40% discount for tokens available from November 11 till November 27 and 20% thereafter till as late as March 19, 2018. However, having considered the democratic principles accepted in the crypto industry, Cryptaur management came to an understanding that discount for tokens must be universal for all types of investors—be it those who re-invest their bounties or those who make a regular investment. Therefore, the discount for re-investment will still be 40% from November 11 till November 27, and 20% thereafter till January 22, 2018. On top of that, the re-investment option will be available not only during actual stages of the token sale, but also in between those stages and for a few days after token sale campaign completion—till March 19, 2018. All the details of the forthcoming sale are to be found in the updated Cryptaur Whitepaper that will be released in just a few days.  And we have one more important message for you today. Cryptaur's management supported the initiative from Dmitry Buriak to radically increase the share of tokens allocated to reward Cryptaur users—from the initial 30% to 40% of the overall volume of issued tokens. The reason for this initiative is related to the fact that our presale campaign results clearly demonstrated that the key role in further expansion of the Cryptaur platform should belong to its users themselves rather than outsourced suppliers such as marketing and PR agencies whose primary interest is to sell their services. Also there is a clear trend on the current ICO market that startups are made to invest more and more into marketing and PR support, which in effect means such support gradually loses its positive impact. Therefore, it is expected that the allocation of additional 10% in favor of Cryptaur users should do more good to the platform as compared to spending the funds externally. As of today, these 10% represent about $2.5 million, and this figure may double over the course of the token sale campaign.  Finally, please be reminded that presale bounty allocation is expected to be done on November 11 among all the qualified users. The bounties will be paid out in Ethers with an option to send them to any external Ether wallet or to re-invest them back into CPTs with a generous 40% discount.",False

However, already now some large crypto-industry players are displaying great interest towards our project. As you already know, one of the most respectable exchanges addressed Cryptaur to start talks about the listing of our token. These talks are under way at the moment, and we are sure that Dmitry Buriak will secure the best conditions for Cryptaur contributors from this potential partner.  Quite recently Cryptaur has also been approached by a number of other promising crypto-startups that would like to co-operate with us too. These projects are interested to use the capacities of our future GoICO application whose purpose is to launch new partner blockchain projects. And we are happy to let you know that one of such projects has been admitted to co-operation and become part of our GoICO portfolio. Importantly, while doing its ICO, this new partner project will accept contributions not only in Ether, but also in our CPTs at an exchange rate that is exceptionally profitable to CPT holders.  So, our warm welcome to the first client of our GoICO application and part of our future eco-system, the innovative project called PROVER (https://prover.io) that aims to create a blockchain-based mechanism of intellectual property protection. Its token sale starts on January 30 and will last till March 31. The nominal value of the PROOF token will be $0.01. And all CPT holders will be able to purchase PROOFs at a special rate: 1 CPT = 1.5 PROOF, which means our token will be worth 1.5 times more than its nominal value.

Specifically, Cryptaur aims to create a decentralized ecosystem with a focus on establishing a fully transparent platform for consumers. This transparency is implemented via a blockchain technology, that of which allows for users to maintain their original payment habits, avoid the need to learn about cryptocurrency complexities, and dramatically shallows the steep learning curve associated with this technology.  In essence, Cryptaur is a decentralized applications store with a mission to transform and ultimately allow for the implementation of a reinvented shared economic system. Rooted in its mission to bring person to person interaction to the forefront of consumerism, Cryptaur’s platform is grounded in blockchain, a technology that can be employed to hone in on the benefits of decentralization while bringing it to mainstream audiences. Cryptaur’s ecosystem curates products and services for enhanced consumer and community driven trust.  Learn More About Cryptaur Check Out Our Video and See More About What Cryptaur’s Doing   OUR VISION We believe that technology is more than a means to an end, and should be accessible to all regardless of their technical knowledge. We believe that consumers are entitled to transparent information to make better decisions, and as a result, our socially driven ecosystem ensures that  consumer’s interests are at the core of commercial transactions.  The Cryptaur vision is to make decentralized technologies available to consumers. Cryptaur is building an ecosystem for dApps (“decentralized applications”) that benefits the consumers the most. This ecosystem is owned by the community of consumers themselves.  Features BLOCKCHAIN FOR ALL Bridging the decentralized and traditional economy, Cryptaur allows anyone with a computer or a smartphone to transact on the blockchain without having to change their payment habits, buy cryptocurrencies, or learn about the technology. COMMUNITY DRIVEN TRUST Cryptaur leverages the social connections between users to curate products and services, ensuring that information and reviews come from trusted sources of influence, rather than advertising and paid product placements. MULTI-USAGE The Cryptaur ecosystem is the ideal environment for any commercial activity where trust and transparency are key to protect the consumers. This includes peer-to-peer commerce, business to consumer exchanges, sharing economy applications. FULL TRANSPARENCY Blockchain technology allows Cryptaur to provide users with real-time and fully transparent information on the products and services of our dapps, allowing them to make better purchasing decisions. BEHAVIOR DRIVEN REWARDS Cryptaur used social and behavioral psychology to create attractive user incentives to support the growth of the ecosystem and reward contributions to a better consumer experience for the community. SUPPORTING CONSUMER DAPPS With its developer toolkit and its dapp incubator, Cryptaur opens its ecosystem to existing and future dapps to bring decentralization to the consumers.

Also, they say the remaining part of the pre-sale will last till October 31st with the 40% discount for tokens and 20% bounty for building groups.

They do their pre-sale without any marketing or PR support. At least I have not seen a single article anywhere. Instead, they declared they would aim their message at crypto-laymen, educate them, and make them invite further users onto the platform by the word of mouth. Thus far, their strategy brought them over 10 million bucks within one month of this ""silent"" presale. The number of users who joined seem to be over 70 thousand people (this is what I see from my Cryptaur user account). Well, there's been startups that raised much more in terms of money, but in terms of user numbers what Cryptaur has achieved is not too shabby. Personally, I'm very much impressed by this figure.  Yesterday, soon after having announced reaching their first milestone of $10 million, they released a very eccentric document called ""Crypto-Manifesto"" that to me sounds very Che-Guevarish. )) And I do like that. Here is the text of the release:  ***  Cryptaur's Crypto-Manifesto  Hey, Mr. Middleman, your days are numbered! A revolution is coming. Total decentralization and demarketization will leave you no room in the economy of the future. For many centures you, Middleman, have been telling us your blatant lies about your indispensability. You've been luring us to the market you controlled to perform your shameless ""invisible hand"" trick by grabbing producers by their throats and emptying consumers' pockets.  Your influence has spread everywhere—into trade, banks, state institutions, services, culture and even  personal relationships between people. But now we are telling you: ""Stop!"" We will take you by your ""invisible hand"" and throw you out of the market. We will transform this market, having freed it from your notorious ancestry, into a modern eco-system where people will freely and fairly exchange goods, services, ideas and feelings.  Middleman, your worst nightmare is coming ture. The UnMarket is arriving where nobody will depend on you and will not have to pay your age-old impost anymore. You have been feeding off human ignorance. To conceal knowledge used to be your main trade. You were persuading suppliers that their goods were rubbish and bought them for nothing. But then you went to buyers and told them those same goods were the best. And you sold them at a triple price. And this is exatly what your ""business"" was. Now it is over.  Producer! Join us and you will never have to deal with the extortions and legalized racket from the middleman, be it a shameless trader or a corrupted bureaucrat. If you, as an honest and hard-working person, invent and produce something other people need and want, you can now offer it directly to your buyers and earn your reasonable and fair profit. With us, your success will only depend on your real efforts and good standing.  Consumer! You will no longer have to pay for the advertisements of the goods whose real quality and real price are questionable, to say the least. You will not have to feed the whole chain of greedy parasite-middlemen who line up between yourself and the producer. Now you can buy exactly what you need, and you can buy it at the best price possible from the seller that truly deserves trust. Moreover, while doing your smart shopping, you can serve the community by sharing your personal consumer experience and being rewarded for doing it.  Imagine a buyer paid 4 dollars for a product. Of these, 3 dollars were pocketed by the middleman. Producer got just 1 dollar. That is how it used to work.  In Cryptaur's new economic model the same product will cost 2 dollars, and they will go to the producer in full. Now the producer will have additional resources to improve the product. The result is that the producer gets twice as much and the buyer pays two times less, meaning that in Cryptaur the money of all parties will work two times more efficiently. In our system, everybody wins, except the at last defeated middleman.  Middleman, you must get out! Consumer, you are the master here!  ***  I've already joined Cryptaur and made a moderate investment.

34,msg23771832,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2126728.0,,3171,Announcements (Altcoins),2017-10-30 15:07:45,wilbury,Member,140,10,,[ANN][CPC] CRYPTAUR: BLOCKCHAIN FOR ALL,"Hi guys, here is some big update about Cryptaur (their official news as of October 30, 2017):  As announced earlier, our token presale will end on October 31, 2017, at 23:59 GMT. After that the bounty allocation will be performed. Depending on the final results of the presale in terms of the number of members registered and the volume of contributions made, this process may take approximately 10 to 15 days. After that eligible participants will get their bounties along with two options:  1. To use the bounty freely, including withdrawal to any Ether wallet address.  2. To re-invest the bounty back into Cryptaur tokens on most attractive terms.  Cryptaur Token Sale  Any crowdsale in cryptoindustry typically offers tokens for cryptucurrency only—Ethers or Bitcoins. Our own presale was in line with this principle too. However, a crucial difference of our project from others is that our future platform is to be used not just by a narrow circle of crypto-enthusiasts, but by great numbers of simple consumers.  That is why for a number of months we have been looking for ways to allow our users who do not have any particular experience with crypto to participate in our project and purchase tokens in a simpler and more affordable way. For example, with a regular credit or debit card.  Luckily, our quest has given us promising results. Now we hope to be able to provide such possibility to our users roughly by the end of November 2017. In our opinion, this new functionality would considerably increase the influx of people and investments into Cryptaur, which would give a tremendous additional advantage not only to new participants, but equally to already registered users who want to build their business with Cryptaur.  That is why we took an important and well-considered decision—to re-schedule the start of the Cryptaur token sale for November 27, 2017, and to deploy the sale in 4 stages. This will enable us to better prepare ourselves for the start of the token sale, as well as to demonstrate to our potential investors our real achievements by the beginning of each sale stage. Below is a list of the improvements that we plan to implement by the first sale stage:  1. To launch a completely renewed multi-language web site of Cryptaur.  2. To release a profoundly updated Cryptaur Whitepaper.  3. To publish a more definitive and detailed roadmap of the project.  4. To provide massive marketing and PR-support in specialized media.  5. To provide the option of purchasing tokens with credit and debit cards.  6. To onboard new experts into Cryptaur's team and into the board of our ""legionaries"".  7. To substantially improve the work of our User Support.  Therefore, the following Cryptaur token sale campaign schedule is now in force:      1st stage: Nov 27 – Dec 7, 2017.     2nd stage: Jan 22 – Jan 31, 2018.     3rd stage: Feb 12 – Feb 20, 2018.     4th stage: Mar 05 – Mar 12, 2018.  There will be no token sales in between those stages. However, we are going to offer an option to all those already registered to re-invest their tokens with profit not just during the token sale stages, but between them as well. *** Meanwhile, please be reminded that October 31st is the last day of the Cryptaur token presale when you can buy their tokens with 40% discount.
