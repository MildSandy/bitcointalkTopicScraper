If you’re going check Satoshi Nakamoto’s bitcoin, you’ll notice that it’s rooted on a vision of purely peer-to-peer electronic cash. The Bitcoin creator is one of the first few people who believed that there is a better way to make payment and that societies cannot thrive with fiat money forever.  Ten years after Bitcoin was created and despite the massive growth, excitement ant hype, Bitcoin is still doubted by many. Still, it was unable to gain momentum and has yet to put any significant use in commerce and industries. Experts say that it’s the main reason why there’s so much volatility in cryptocurrency market.  We’ve heard tons of uplifting words from start-up creators, blockchain developers and the cryptocurrency community in general, one fact remains the same….crypto is still currently too difficult to use and many people still find it too risky. We all dream of achieving mainstream crypto adoption but if we won’t be able to solve these problems, we might need to wait a little longer.  The people behind Orbis believe that it’s possible to launch a security token which is faster, cheaper and highly able to handle complex transactions. Honestly speaking, there are other projects out there that have already launched their own versions. However, only few focus on how to make crypto easier, safer and more comfortable for people to use. This is what makes Orbis unique. We understand the technology but we also understand the people who’ll use it.  ORBS coin is not just a coin built on latest blockchain technology, it’s also something designed to be used by ordinary people all over the world. Just imagine being able to tap people in the street and show them what it’s like to send and receive cryptocurrency to crypto addresses. At the end of the day, it’s all about awareness. People need to be aware that something this huge is happening and that there’s an opportunity for all of us to escape traditional financial economy that brings nothing but inflation and turmoil.  Orbis team won’t necessarily go the street and tap people. Instead, we will use AI technology and build Orbis Local branches in key areas, cities and even rural areas in Africa. This simple ATM machine can help anyone send ORBS and other coins to other wallet addresses. It will be designed in such a way that it can easily be understood even by people of low educational background. Our vision is very simple…to bring crypto to the poorest places and help crypto achieve mass adoption.",False

I don't understand why nobody knows any answers. To me personally it is beginning to look suspicious that the PR team doesn't know any answers to my below questions or that I receive no response from my e-mail.  These are genuine questions any investor should have the answer to.  You have mentioned that the insurance company involved is a private matter, however for any large investor it is important. I have stated this in my e-mail.  Any other investor including myself is entitled to know in order to assess financial risk and thought it would be a give in to publicly state this.    I have been in contact with one of the KRM Lawyers and she was semi-helpful but does not know the answer to my questions. Of course as we both know it was only a legal requirement for them to be listed with Orbis Solutions and they no legal liability. In fact it was highlighted that the KRM Advisors have no legality if I was to pursue this further with the SEC.  Again I will ask my questions hoping that someone knows these answers.  Who is the escrow for this ICO? Are they independent, public and transparent? Any correctly structured ICO/STO would have published this so investors know that their funds would be returned if this was a scam or the business model fails.  The white paper mentions an insurance company that backs Orbsi (investment token). Who is this insurance company? Although you mentioned this was private it doesn't give confidence to any large investor.  For any body in the US investing in a security, such as Orbsi Investment Token and freely admitted in the whitepaper as being a security with the availability to US investors. This would mean by law it must be publicly disclosed, and as my research shows it is not. This is a red flag.  So for US customers is this Regulation D, Regulation A+ or Regulation S as in compliance with Section 506C. It must be applied for before the sale of any security.  Is a filing for regulation D public? Yes it is under the SEC website (here: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html). There are 28 companies registered which made this search easy. Nothing here.  Regulation S (info: https://www.isin.net/reg-s-and-144a/). Again this information is public and can be searched here: https://www.isin.net/isin-directory/. I cannot find registration in this database either.  What about Regulation A+ (info: https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib_regulationa.html). How am I informed under this category, well actually thats a rhetorical question as its available on the SEC website using EDGAR (https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html), and I still can’t find them.  This only applies to US residents and is illegal if they buy Orbsi (investment token). Very misleading since the white paper says it’s available to the US, if indeed this hasn't been applied for. I could have easily been mistaken and all it would take is a link to the EDGAR database and all the worries disappear.  Unfortunately with the combination of complete silence to my e-mail, the PR team not knowing this, it's beginning to look suspicious. The biggest red flag for me is stating that anyone in America can be part of buying the orbit investment token yet they are not listed with the SEC! More red flags for me.  On the website https://orbistransfer.com and mentions “all our financial information is online and is independently verified”.  This is not true, no financial information is online - nobody knows where it is, even the PR team, no-one on telegram does. Another red flag?  So let’s recap what I’m hoping to find:  1. Name of the Insurance Company which I guess is underwriting the Orbsi Investment token.  2. The indépendant escrow holding the funds.  3. Who has independently verified the financial information?  4. Links for proof that US citizens can participate with the investment token (Regulation D, A or S).  I know that someone here would have investigated some of this, even if they don't live in the US. Nobody would invest without research, right?  All it's going to take is answering my questions so my mind can be put to rest and I can invest.  For any American investing in this without the approval from the SEC risks fines/jail time while the offshore company Orbis Solutions walks away with all their crypto. It is also illegal not to publicly disclose information pertaining to the the SEC approval - there is ZERO public disclosure.  I am hoping you can expedite a response. I am genuinely interested hence my legal route. If you can read between the lines only a serious investor with considerable investment (although relative) would want these answers.",False

Just google yourself.  Just on a side note all of these owners all have scores and scores of businesses that are currently running and are liquidated. RED FLAG ANYONE!!!??? Im not going through 283 business just registered under ONE name!!!!  I’m now only going to link a business or two to show how these scammers have operated together before.  Merle Paju has worked with the following businesses that Kadri Matlik (OrbisSolutions Owner):  Blockchain Garage: https://www.teatmik.ee/en/personlegal/14384145-BlockChain-Garage-OÜ  Merle Paju Kristine Akopzanjan <———Guess who again Kadri Matlik <-------OrbisSolutions Owner  Wow what a coincidence!!!!!

One pattern I have noticed after all this checking….they LOVE ICO’s and it’s ALWAYS the same format, the same format as Orbis Solutions.  With Known scammers associated with this project do you want to invest?  With owners of OrbisSolutions having previously owned and still running hundreds and hundreds of businesses within a two year period - is this a RED FLAG?  If I was research all of the businesses they are all associated with I can bet most of them are scams that have ended. I'm warning everyone now, the patterns are the same and the people are the same.  You can make your own decisions but I do hope I have kick-start everyone on doing their own research before investing! Too many red flags here.    Another SCAM? You decide.",False

As mentioned by you “no-one besides the team stated on the website is working on the project”. This is great news!  I do have a few questions and welcome all responses.  Who is the escrow for this ICO? Are they independent, public and transparent? The white paper mentions an insurance company that backs Orbsi (investment token). Who is this insurance company? Personally I wouldn’t invest without full disclosure deeming this a very important question.  For any body in the US investing in a security, such as Orbsi Investment Token and freely admitted in the whitepaper as being a security with the availability to US investors (Howey Test) compliance is required -ultimately AML/KYC compliance as instructed by the SEC.  So for US customers is this Regulation D, Regulation A+ or Regulation S as in compliance with Section 506C.  Is a filing for regulation D public? Yes it is under the SEC website (here: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html). There are 28 companies registered which made this search easy. Nothing here.  Regulation S (info: https://www.isin.net/reg-s-and-144a/). Again this information is public and can be searched here: https://www.isin.net/isin-directory/. I cannot find registration in this database either.  What about Regulation A+ (info: https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib_regulationa.html). How am I informed under this category, well actually thats a rhetorical question as its available on the SEC website using EDGAR (https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html), and I still can’t find them.  Genuinely, can someone find the filings? I guess this only applies to US residents and is illegal if they buy Orbsi (investment token). Very misleading since the white paper says it’s available to the US, if indeed this hasn't been applied for.  I have searched with business name and using keywords only but to no avail. If you can find it please publish it. This is VERY IMPORTANT!  On the website https://orbistransfer.com and mentions “all our financial information is online and is independently verified”. I cannot find any information and where online is it? Who is this insurance company where is this information? Anyone? Im after detail here.  So let’s recap what I’m hoping to find:  1.
