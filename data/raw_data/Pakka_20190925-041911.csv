There’s no doubt about it, the last 9 months have been tough for blockchain projects and cryptocurrency investors alike. Regulatory concerns surrounding the space paired with a strong bear market have lead to a significant drop off in ICO investments. According to information made publicly available at ICOdata.io, monthly investment totals in ICOs have trended down steeply from $1.5 Billion USD in January 2018, to $337 Million USD in August 2018. September isn’t proving any exception to the drop-off; $112 Million USD is known to be invested in ICOs so far, with only two days left in the month at the time of writing. Given the considerable shift in investor sentiment, it’s understandable that this reduction in new investments is leading to many startups having to pause ICOs, with some even pulling the pin on their projects entirely.  https://medium.com/nextpakk/nextpakk-community-update-september-2018-5844d28759ce",False

Prior to the invention of the tunnel-style mailbox in 1915, postal carriers would often waste hours per day waiting for recipients to answer the door for their letters. Though it served a need at the time, this poorly-executed, without thought to innovation in delivery, mailbox has remained virtually unchanged ever since.  Fast-forward to today, when letters no longer weigh heavily on sortation systems or require 1:1 interaction across America.  Packages have evolved into the major stressor in the delivery system, especially in the last-mile logistics puzzle, accounting for twenty-eight percent of the total delivery cost for businesses.  With the increased speed of today’s lifestyles and major carriers scrambling to keep up with the demand of e-commerce, package deliveries are often missed. Pick-up/re-delivery of packages takes a toll on major carriers as well as the environment, and packages left to wait for their owners to return home act as an invitation for theft, causing serious problems for the customers and couriers, in addition to the financial strain placed on retailers.  While there exists no silver bullet for offsetting delivery costs, efficiency and planning go a long way. At NextPakk, we’re uprooting the last-mile delivery system so we can build one that is stronger, more agile, secure and efficient while being resilient enough to meet modern-day demands:  *We’ve eliminated the need for warehouses in our ecosystem. Instead, we’re supporting local businesses, as they’re paid per package received in their stores.  *Community drivers have the opportunity to earn income making scheduled deliveries. An a result, while NextPakk is protecting the environment by eliminating the need for not only land consumption and building materials/waste, but also eradicating additional trips for missed deliveries.  *Blockchain technology removes the need for consumer address labels containing personal information, offering privacy throughout; personal information is secure, available only to NextPakk’s vetted drivers who have consumer name and address information on a need-to-know basis.  Blockchain technology is often characterized as “disruptive” for revolutionizing societal interactions. In this sense, its distributed ledgers shake up antiquated business models in the same way parcels challenged the mailbox.  However, this new shift in technology makes deliveries more efficient and secure, utilizing transparent transactions. Maintaining data security, reducing last-mile delivery costs for retailers, and increasing prescription adherence are merely the tip of the iceberg. Yet, properly applied, NextPakk’s blockchain can improve last-mile logistics on both a national and global scale. https://medium.com/@nextpakk/how-does-nextpakk-fit-into-last-mile-logistics-965369807997",False

If someone buys from Amazon and it is shipped by Amazon to the user using their delivery system, will Pakka play a role here? How will you get Amazon to play along with you so that the delivery is done by the NextPakk system? 2.

Will a user have to specify to use the NextPakk system when he purchases online? 4. Where is the recipient's address stored if the package is label less?   Those are great questions. I'm deeply familiar with the team and the project but I don't know all those answers. I'm going to try and estimate the answers.   A few questions:  1. If someone buys from Amazon and it is shipped by Amazon to the user using their delivery system, will Pakka play a role here? How will you get Amazon to play along with you so that the delivery is done by the NextPakk system?  NextPakk is the last mile optional delivery add on. To use it via and Amazon purchase, you just use your NextPakk mailing address and that's all Amazon needs to know.   2. Can a user buy the goods with Fiat and have it delivered via the NextPakk system or is payment for the goods via Pakka as well?   Can you rephrase that question? Can the user pay for the goods with fiat and have it delivered with NextPakk is a separate question from buying the goods via Pakka.   3. Will a user have to specify to use the NextPakk system when he purchases online?   I don't think so, but I am not sure. I believe the user just has to use the NextPakk shipping address, which you can store as your default address on Amazon or any other eCommerce site.   4.

The NextPakk system will store the addresses where the packages are going, I'm pretty sure.",False
