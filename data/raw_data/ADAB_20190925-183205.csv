Token sale of Adab is complete and we want to summarize its results. We view positively the completed token sale and continue working on the project with a great enthusiasm. We were not able to achieve our sales targets, but there were objective reasons for this and our results were significantly better than could be expected in the current market situation. During the time of token sale, we sold 45.5 million tokens and another 13.6 million issued as a bonuses. Additionally, we have accrued about 2 million tokens for the services rendered. Thus, the total emission amounted to 61.1 million tokens. In April and May of this year, Adab Solutions Company and affiliated Adab Solutions Group conducted the IEO on 4 exchanges. The ADAB Token will not be traded on the IDAX exchange due to the incompatibility of the IDAX exchange requirements with the principles of Islamic finance. All IEO members, who already invested in ADAB token on this exchange, will receive back their investment. About 5 mln Adab tokens were sold on the BitForex exchange and about 5 mln Adab tokens on the Bit-M and Bit-Z exchanges. Despite the low level of sales of tokens on these exchanges, the process of selling tokens was as transparent and fair as possible. We absolutely do not associate this level of sales of tokens during the crowdsale and IEO with a fair assessment of the project. There are a number of objective reasons, as the state of the market and the possibilities of the platforms on which IEO was conducted, which were overestimated by us, but our assessment was based on publicly available information and the course of negotiations with the exchanges. The company believes that the real value of the project is immeasurably higher and our performance should prove this in the near future. Summarizing the above, the total volume of Adab tokens issued on the crowdsale was 71.1 million units.",True

There is no authentic Shariah evidence that requires the prohibition of all these types; neither a text nor an analogy. What is prohibited of these types is that which involves acquiring the property of others illegitimately. The Shariah’s reason for prohibiting [a transaction] is the illegitimate acquisition of others’ property, and it is prohibited to acquire others’ property illegitimately even in the absence of risk.  Risk, in and of itself, is not prohibited. In fact, the presence of risk is a fundamental element to profit from a venture. The Islamic legal maxims state: “[The right to] profit [from something] goes with responsibility [for   it]”. Another maxim states: “Liability is an obligation accompanying gain” (al-Kasani, 1986)   Investing in high risk investments such as shares in a Shariah compliant start-up company cannot be deemed impermissible even though there is exposure to high risk. The volatility of such an investment will not impact the inherent compliance of the assets and transaction. Undeniably, trading, investments and gambling are all regarded as speculative risks. However, there are clear differences between gambling, trade and investments which highlight the difference in risk. Trading and investing are positive-sum games whilst gambling is a zero-sum game. Positive-sum games are where the parties gain together or lose together. In a partnership, partners mutually gain or mutually lose if the venture fails. In zero-sum games, one party gains at the expense of another. Considering cryptocurrency transactions, cryptocurrencies are  exchanged for a counter-exchange where both parties anticipate gain from their acquired asset. It is never guaranteed that one party will surely lose. Thus, such transactions are positive-sum games as both transacting parties anticipate gain. Therefore, cryptocurrency exchanges cannot be likened to Maysir and Qimar (gambling) due to the inherent difference between positive-sum and zero-sum games.",True

""ADAB Soutions, this is a rare project, as it is the world's first cryptocurrency exchange, operating in accordance with the principles of Islamic finance."" I really want to know how the principles of Islamic finance differ from general principles of financing. I always thought that finances for religion are irrelevant.  Islam is more than a religion; it’s also a code of life that deals with social, economic, and political matters. Islamic finance, then, is a financial system that operates according to Sharia. Just like conventional financial systems, Islamic finance features banks, capital markets, fund managers, investment firms, and insurance companies. Islamic finance is based on real business deals and real economic activities that bear risk and are open to acquire profits while conventional banks are based on Riba (interest) lending and borrowing activities which avoid risk and thus promote social injustice and later leads to economic crises and depressions. The main difference between Islamic and conventional finance is the treatment of risk, and how risk is shared. Islamic finance requires that finance is provided on the principle of profit and loss sharing.   Quote from: dnsokoljuk on February 12, 2019, 12:07:17 PM I heared many good words about ADAB.

Why did you delete those posts instead of confirming and clarifying the accusations? The action can be considered as evasion and would only further confirming that the accusations is essentially correct.
