We have described the terms in WhitePaper and T&C but we should add it to FAQ section also.  We are a real industrial project so we basically guarantee 2 main things:  1. Buyback.  That means that we have a scheduled buyback program with predetermined prices. The buyback price depends on when you sell the tokens back to us and is up to USD4.00 (with token sale prices starting from less than USD2 for wholesale and early investors). Buyback is the easiest way to get profit. Of course it is not 1000x but it is a good, stable and planned profit.  2. Redemption.  As each HPQ token is backed by a commodity - High Purity Quartz - you can redeem the tokens for a physical product. Or sell tokens to any strategic buyer or product user. This way you can get higher profit but of course it requires more actions.  These are our 2 guarantees according to T&C. As the business model is quite understandable and the plan is very well prepared and stress-tested, we can give such promises.  We can also discuss equity deals with big investors.  And can provide signed agreement if needed. It can be done face-to-face in HCMC, Vietnam, or in electronic form.  And of course we will list our token on exchanges to provide a proper liquidity. We have some good offers but need to finish the ICO first.  Please feel free to ask more questions, and I hope the explanation is clear.",False

We have been preparing the project while working in different companies. As it did not give any positive cash flow we had to have jobs to pay the bills. We did not have any sponsors that time and did not have any special place to develop.  In 2012-2013 we assembled the pilot line in Kyrgyzstan. That time we wanted to sell the technology but after studying the market and understanding the perspectives decided to leave the project for own development.  After that we had a long time to understand the place for the project, we considered several countries like Kyrgyzstan, Russia, New Zealand, Slovenia, Canada, Australia, Thailand, India, Singapore... Finally we chose Vietnam as the best place. You can find some reasons in our presentations.  In 2015-2016 we had a small workshop near d7, Ho Chi Minh City. We started to prepare everything for finding equity investors and starting operations.  In 2016 we opened a holding company for the project in Singapore as recommended by lawyer and early investors.  In 2017 we had another pilot study in Incheon (Seoul), Korea where we got an access to full-capacity test equipment. The equipment is expensive, we can afford having it only when we raise the capital. Actually we will buy the same equipment to start commercial production.  The same year we saw a similar project raising the money for the factory, it was zrcoin.io We decided that we can do the same and keep the equity for the team and early investors.  Now when we are ready to begin we got a project office, chose the place for the factory.  But only after we understand that we have successfully raised the money, all the team members will quit their jobs and focus only on the project.",False

Thank you for your interest in our project.  We have a story about our development in our WhitePaper and promo video above - some of the reasons to choose Vietnam are also stated there. However, please let me also refer to our story on Bitcoin News Vietnam (https://btcnews.vn/cong-ty-singapore-dang-goi-von-qua-hinh-thuc-ico-de-xay-dung-mot-nha-may-o-viet-nam/), here is the translation to English - https://hpq.io/article-about-hpq-on-bitcoin-news-vietnam-translation/.  In terms of your questions, please allow me to answer them one by one.  The main reasons why the team with some Russian members did not choose Russia are:  1. Political risk. Some of our main buyers are located in North America and Europe so we want to prevent any risks of possible sanctions, etc.  2. Entrance ticket cost. Vietnam is the best place to launch the project in terms of total needed financing and easiness of implementation. For example, low labour cost, low electricity cost, incentives for export enterprises (tax holidays, no VAT, no import duties for equipment and raw materials), etc.  3. Raw materials. Local quartz sand is an ideal material for our production. It has high purity, low cost and great supply chain.  4. Thinking about the future. We are ensuring from the first day that the project is ready for a potential IPO in the future. So the project's evaluation and investor confidence will be much higher if it is done outside of Russia, given the current climate.  5. As you can see we do not only have Russians in our team and our early investors and advisors have also thoroughly studied all the places and ways to do the HPQ project. So it is a well-balanced decision based on economic and future development reasons, as well as our buyers' preferences.  For the team roles, as you can see we have strong advisors in our HPQ team - Sami, Henry, Zachary, Dat. They are integrated into the team and also put their own time and money into the project. Vladimir is our core CTO and chemist (he has been working in South East Asia for the last few years), Alexander and Sergei are factory equipment engineers and production shift leaders (also working in SEA for several years), Sami is the project's CFO and planner based in Ho Chi Minh City, Henry and Zach are advisors, investors, escrow and future pre-IPO development individuals. Specifically, Henry will also be developing our sales channels across Europe and North America. Dat is company lawyer and local advisor.  We are also supported by other advisors who prefer to be not public like industrial park leaders, etc.  Hope that is helpful. Please feel free to ask more questions.  We will also add the most frequent questions to our FAQ on https://hpq.io",False
