Cultural heritage bearers can now leverage their efforts with culture mining. IDGO allows culture miners (artists, traditional crop farmers, traditional architects, etc.) to issue their own tokens to be certified by their community. Culture mining is also linked to all the blockchain solutions within the IDGO ecosystem that allows isolated communities to move to an independant financial and governance system: self-sovereign identity, community cryptocurrencies & decentralized credit system.  Tokenomics With the public KINWA token directly pegged to all community currencies, the token holders can use KINWA directly in each community within IDGO ecosystem or keep the token as its value increase with the adoption of IDGO solutions.

The Kinwa token is an ERC20 but the actual coin is called TAOCOIN and there is a IOS wallet if you search ""TaoPassport"" on the app store.  the Taocoin runs on a private chain and the value is 1 TAOCOIN to 1 Taiwan Dollar, transactions are near instant and it is really being accepted at a few locations in Taipei and also all over Green Island which is an aboriginal island just off Taiwan. You can use it to pay for Hotels and food on the island which is mainly populated with aboriginal people from the Tao tribe. It's really an excellent example of how cryptocurrency can benefit local communities.  the block explorer for Taocoin is: https://explorer.idgo.im/token/0x9341EFcB186A16CcEF469313012c3D46d2A63751  you can see there are quite a few transactions per day",False
