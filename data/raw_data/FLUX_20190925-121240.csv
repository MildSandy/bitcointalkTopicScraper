As for our pros compared to other projects, we hope this little extract will be a good answer for you!  FLUX is the first solution in the eSports market that provides decentralized interaction between gamers, viewers and the platform itself.   While some platforms offer their users one or two specific features only (e.g, GilGam or EtherSports), FLUX is an ecosystem that provides multi-level interactivity of the game process. Moreover, FLUX gives players numerous new channels to monetize cybersports achievements, unavailable on existing platforms.   Items economy If you want to enhance your gaming experience, you can use FLUX’s advanced and secure Trading Platform that enables community members to trade items from different games using FLUX COINS. FirstBlood members do not have such an opportunity.   Streaming monetization Live Streaming is one of the key features of FLUX. We offer a versatile system (both mobile and desktop) that will enable players profiting from winning competitive matches and tournaments, trading in-game objects, and conducting gameplay broadcasts.   Transparency and fairness FLUX is secure and easy to use. Smart contracts ensure fair and transparent transactions within the platform. Thanks to our recent partnership with MoxyOne, participants can now use credit or debit cards for transparent and convenient transactions.   One of a kind crowdfunding platform! Game developers can use FLUX crowdfunding platform to upload their games to the Developer Market and verify them. If a developer has raised funds to create their game using FLUX crowdfunding platform, part of the income is distributed among contributors as well.",False

Quote from: bit679 on April 06, 2018, 01:51:33 PM How much will platform pay for completion of 1 daily task in average? We'd like to refrain from such estimates for now. For instance, in the game AirHockey with a $10 bet, Player_1 scores a winning point 1 second before the end of the game. In such scenario, he receives a reward of $3. The system in question should be quite comprehensive, elaborate and account for the differences in complexity and gameplay between various games. We'll be sure to announce something like that in detail once we're further into the development cycle.

For players, it is a matchmaking system. For developers, it is a monetization model with commission share from wagers. Currently we are negotiating on the implementation of our own streaming platform. However, we won’t limit player’s choice. You can use twitch, integrating the broadcast into FLUX. For traders, it is an autonomous trading ground where they can withdraw their digital goods. There is also a crowdfunding platform for gaming projects with benefits for both sides.  You can use any fiat and cryptocurrency to participate, and then use our token to withdraw. This way we create an ongoing demand for our token.  And about partnerships.
