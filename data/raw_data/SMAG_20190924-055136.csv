But when I called the Thomas Klinke Immobilien GmbH it got interesting, because the company owner himself picked up the phone. Since you should be on the same floor, he did not know anything about a company called ""SmartGenie"". He said the only company on the same floor is loqio GmbH which is a call center.  EDIT: The managing director of loqio GmbH just called me back, he saw my number on his phone. He never heard anything about SmartGenie as well.   What now?  What is the legal form of your company? Why are there no photos yet? Why are you not listed in the german company database? What is your landline phone number? So many questions where you did not provide an answer for yet though I asked them many times.",False

And no matter how many times you repeat it, it is not possible for me to visit a non existing company. By the way, office buildings usually have no open door so I have to ring the doorbell but there is no bell with your name, as it can be seen on my photo, because you are not there. Take your smartphone, start video at the front door where I have taken the photo and go upstairs to your office. This will take 5 minutes. Some people reacted on Telegram on my message. They can confirm that there has not been any spam. Who is your community manager, do you have a phone number? What about your own phone number? Let me call you. You probably have a landline phone in your office.  The law in germany makes it a must to be entered into the so called ""Handelsregister"" when revenues go beyond 250k Euros. ""Handelsregister"" is a database in germany where you can easily find any company. Since your softcap is 500k you should be inside this database but you are not. It is not even clear what legal form your company is.

Either you come tomorrow and you film what you want and you excuse us and all here, or do you please keep out of here Smiley Do not forget your ID card, otherwise we call the police and you will like to be interviewed by them.  Ob eine Drohung mit einem Anwalt unter diesen Voraussetzungen der richtige Weg ist sei dahingestellt. (Whether a threat with a lawyer under these conditions is the right way is an open question.) Give me the phone number of your lawyer please so I can call him if he is in the office today this should be no problem.
