However I would like to ask few questions to understand what is the vision of the development team.  1. You tell you are going to help fight poverty by helping people get cheap (or even free) internet, right? Now what makes me unsure - if a person can afford having a smartphone, doesn't it mean he is not in poverty and so could afford a basic internet package too? Or did you make a market research, to find out which countries/cities have the internet price high enough, for the smartphone user to have difficulty paying for it, while still being able to buy a decent smartphone? I assume the internet connection to share, should be limitless (not metered), so the countries where only metered connection packages exist, are out of interest, right?  Here we come directly to my second question: 2. Which markets (countries, cities, communities or business chains) are you going to target? Do you have specific plan, and the research done to show where this solution could be advertised more efficiently? If you have them, can you please list them?  Would appreciate your response.",True

We will try to give you an extensive and comprehensive answer to you questions.  Your point 1.  From the outset when the company SID Limited was registered, where SID stands for Share Internet Data, the company mission basic wording was already set by our Chairman and Co-Founder, namely “To help lift people out of poverty by means of internet provisioning” where internet provisioning stands for internet access, meaning to give access to information & education & e-commerce which are the things that bring people out of poverty”. In short SID wanted to support from the beginning the United Nations Number 1 Sustainable Development Goal “To eradicate poverty” by our modest contribution to give people who can´t afford a regular monthly internet connection a way to access the internet such that they also can access information, education and e-commerce as it´s these last things that lift people out of poverty.  Please read this article as background info on the subject matter or for visually impaired can also listen to the article on the top clicking on playing the article recording in English: https://irishtechnews.ie/sid-supports-uns-sustainable-development-goal-to-reduce-poverty-through-provision-of-internet-access/  http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/sid.frinwo.com/Press/Blockchain%20Based%20Micropayment%20System%20By%20SID%20Limited%20_%20Investing.com.pdf  In order to allow people access to internet for free it requires sufficient access points which can be reached in two different complementary ways: By users entering verified Wi-Fi passwords of public Wi-Fis such that if one SID users enters a password, then automatically from then onwards all users on the SID network can auto connect with their Android smartphones powered by the SID App and manually through iPhones powered by SID to all Wi-Fis added on the SID network. Then another way to obtain internet when a SID user is not in range of a free Wi-Fi is for all Android SID users with no internet access who are nearby by another user who does have internet access, to automatically get internet (be it Mobile internet or Wi-Fi internet) from that user with internet sharing with simultaneously with at least 2 other nearby users that don’t have direct internet access, Another additional way is by SID making commercial deals with businesses such as we did with Dunkin´ Donuts Spain, called Dunkin Coffee, where we integrated our SID SDK technology inside their APP. That gave an instant nationwide 91 thousand active monthly users with whom to share internet with SID users and where all SID user´s Android can auto-connect and iPhones manually to all Dunkin´ Coffee stores Wi-Fis nationwide. http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/sid.frinwo.com/Press/Article_8.1.pdf  Currently SID has >300 thousand Wi-Fis spread globally over all continents and >100 thousand SID app downloads. With part of the proceeds from the Initial Token Sale SID intends to grow the SID global user base and with its partnerships with companies like SENTINEL we will add additional security when our future users connect to the internet through Wi-Fi by adding the possibility to use a VPN. https://irishtechnews.ie/guest-post-sid-limiteds-strategic-value-addition-partnerships-with-sent-and-urallowance/  As for the market opportunity it´s just massive, but it´s with the fund-raising and with future revenue that we will be able to truly fulfil on our company mission of helping the poor get free internet access. If we don´t achieve a sustainable business than we can´t help mid and long term the poor obtain free internet access. Here is the weird thing; people who can´t afford a regular monthly internet subscription or monthly pre-pay for internet most have no PC but many do have a smartphone. For free internet access to the Wi-Fis entered by the SID community smartphones of a few year od are just fine whilst for the internet sharing between nearby Androids it does require a newer phone with Android version 5.1 which was available since about a year or two ago but not wide spread before that. There is however a big misconception in that poor people who can´t afford regular monthly internet only are from developing countries but nothing is further from the truth, even in the most advanced so called advanced economies as Europe and the USA have still a two digit percentage points of poor people with no regular internet access. As mentioned in this press releases: https://thegibraltarmagazine.com/the-internet-a-basic-human-right/  “According to World Development Report 2016, 60% of the world population do not have access to internet. More than 60 million people in United States did not have access to internet while in Africa only 20.7% had access. Price Waterhouse Cooper (PWC) in a recent report stated that if internet access can be provided to the population of 4.1 billion who currently don’t have access, more than 500 million will be lifted out of poverty.“  Your point 2:  The Existing Market and Opportunity  According to Statista there are:  •   279 million Wi-Fi public hotspots around the globe now (2018) •   542 million Wi-Fi public hotspots globally by 2021. According to Ericsson Nov 2017 Mobility report there are: •   5 Billion Mobile broadband subscriptions around the globe in Q3 – 2017 •   5.3 Billion unique mobile subscriptions globally in Q3 – 2017 •   6,1 Billion smartphone users globally by 2020 according to TechCrunch on 3Jan2015 report •   >25 billion connected devices by 2021 •   30 Billion connected devices by 2013 of which • 20 Billion expected connected iOT devices by 2023 SID market opportunity is combining both the smartphone and the Wi-Fi markets all in one •   Smartphones numbers outperforming Wi-Fi hotspots by 5.3B/0.279B = by 18 to 1 •   These figures clearly show the importance we give to Share Internet Data (SID) through smartphones as being the core of our patent pending eco-system technology. •   What SID is doing is enabling to add to the existing 279 Million Wi-Fi hotspots and additional staggering 5.3B moving hotspots (meaning smartphones) globally. And that is already now!!!  As for specifics, what we have an internal >70 page Business plan where we outline the marketing strategy and the financials to grow the user base as well as the marketing costs BUT since that plan will depend on the actual available funds we will once this fundraising phase is over after 31 Dec 2018 adapt the operational internal Business Plan to the actual available cashflow into Q1 of 2019 and beyond.  More information will be released as and when appropriate going forward.  If you have more questions please don´t hesitate to ask!",True

SID (Share Internet Data) is a peer-to-multi-peer decentralized internet sharing system that allows sharing internet from one person's smartphone to another nearby in an automated manner. One of our key missions through the SID project : “To lift as many people as possible out of poverty by means of giving the less fortunate a way to access the Internet”. Certain users will be able to get free Internet access by obtaining tokens in exchange of consuming advertising. Such obtained tokens can then be used to consume internet megabytes from other nearby Users in exchange for tokens OR Users will simply trade some of their tokens directly with other SID Users. Those trades will be done simply through a secured blockchain, on a public exchange to ensure full transparency with the control of the tokens and the control of sharing internet or not fully decentralized, meaning solely under end-user’s control through their post ITO (Initial Token Offering) token Wallet inside the SID App.  About SID Token A peer-to-peer and peer-to-multi-peer internet sharing eco-system (Share Internet Data or SID for short) that will allow sharing internet from one person’s Smartphone to another, specifically offering internet access to those less fortunate in society. This solution will however also allow individual returns to those who share their internet with others. Tokenomics are ensured by allowing users of this solution to trade traditional or crypto-currency into our future SID tokens and vice-versa, trade SID tokens for megabytes of internet data and vice-versa, trade consumed advertising into SID tokens, and trade (send and receive) tokens between users of the SID eco-system.  We propose a solution to the status-quo where internet is mostly obtained from traditional service providers or mobile network operators. Our novelty is achieved by using crowd sourced internet in a peer-to-peer structure between nearby Smartphones as per our fully in-house developed intellectual proprietary eco-system based on: pending PCT patent WO2016124915A1 filed in 2015 and going forward provisional USPTO patent Application Number 62588951 filed in 2017. The Smartphones will automatically share internet with nearby smartphones or tablets, based on a set of parameters, and upload the encrypted users’ trades to BlockChain custodians. Such trades as described above will create future token growing liquidity in line with our company revenue growth.  In this way, the key company mission of SID “To lift as many people as possible out of poverty by means of giving the less fortunate a way to access free internet access” is also achieved. The less fortunate will be able in future to get free internet access by collecting tokens in Summary of the Whitepaper (version of 18th April 2018) exchange of consuming advertising but without paying a penny for it. Such obtained tokens are then to be used to pay for consumed internet megabytes OR users can cash-out token through traded exchanges where other SID users will buy those to consume on the SID eco-system.  One of the key features of this SID eco-system solution is that it will reward everyone, also the more fortunate well-off people of society to share their mobile data or private home Wi-Fi in exchange of tokens:  (i) Till to date any non-consumed mobile data at the end of each month, on most traditional network operator’s contracts, is simply lost. Our solution allows these users to recover part of that in tokens through obtaining tokens for sharing their mobile data with other nearby SID users, not letting those otherwise unused megabytes go to waste each month. (ii) Till to date any non-consumed home Wi-Fi data at the end of each month, on most traditional internet service providers contracts, is simply lost too. Our solution will allow SID users to recover part of that in tokens through earning tokens for sharing home Wi-Fi internet with other nearby SID users, not letting those otherwise unused megabytes go to waste each month.  Please be sure to check your network operator or internet service provider terms and conditions, because some have a small print stating that the internet they purchase is only for private use and thus not for re-sale. Although anyone can activate on a smartphone the tethering or hotspot function, the mobile operator who provides the SIM can disable this option remotely although this is rarely done anymore. SID therefore includes an end-user setting to allow sharing automatically its Mobile data or not with nearby SID users and is prompted to confirm. SID is the ultimate of de-centralization because only the end-user decides if it shares its internet AND if it gets paid in tokens for its shared internet.  In the same way as in the previous case, this SID solution incentivizes users to share their home or business internet data without giving their private or business password to any other person. Actually, traditionally, people used to give the password of their home Wi-Fi to visitors thereby exposing the security of everything connected to their internal Wi-Fi network. In our SID solution the user who is home shares internet with visitors through his Smartphone or tablet, over an encrypted proprietary link and therefore nobody has access to the internal Wi-Fi network at all.  Our technology SID-SDK is available also through a 3rd party APP, Dunkin Donut´s franchise in Spain called Dunkin Coffee, through Frinwo S.L. in Spain, which resulted in 250,000 downloads of which 91,000 active mobile users who in turn will share internet with our own future SID users.

We already have released our product, you can download the app from Google Play Store or Apple Store  WiCoin is nice public WiFi project only covering for now Mexico but like that there are hundreds of projects with the most successful one “WiFi Master Key” with more then 900million apps downloaded by its users. SID is a complete different beast, merging the old world of WiFi hotspots, home WiFi with Samartphones whereby the smartphone becomes center stage. SID has 2 patent pending filings to protect its technology used by the SID community with one of the many key aspects of SID that it’s the smartphones that share internet data between nearby SID smartphone & tablet users. Such shared internet in the SID shared as crowded sourced to the nearby community can originate from good old WiFi hotspot for free, but can also originate from a home WiFi through a smartphone to other SID users in exchange for tokens or the most critical one internet originated from mobile data between smartphones in exchange for tokens. That makes SID stand out from the crowd as there are 16 times more smartphones then there are WiFi hotspots globally according to “Statista” already in 2018 and the smartphones expected to increase even faster the hotspots in the next 5 years.  And last but not least SID’s patent pending technology has been acknowledged by the industry through the adoption of our SID-SDK inside the App of a franchise of Dunkin Donut covering the country of Spain-Europe, called Dunkin Coffee as confirmed in a recent joint press release just over a month or so ago.  www.ShareInternetData.io",True
