Regalcoin is dead. All lending-type platforms are dead (they're now being called ""savings"" program instead of lending programs). The people behind the project are both scammers and brain dead people.  Go back through this thread and you'll see my progression of thought. I really, really wanted Regal to work. I invested in this coin and thought there was a future.  But they scammed everyone.  Everyone.  Every single investor got scammed.  Many of us were at the end of our contracts when these pieces of shit completely CHANGED the contract and forced us into new ones, without our consent.  Someone should start a class action lawsuit against these scammers. I have plenty of information at my disposal, I know the people behind the scam. They're easy to find.

But I know about you.  You're a creep. You live in Hanoi. You think you're red pilled.  But you're a psycho, as your other profiles show. https://cryptocurrencytalk.com/profile/22841-gekko463/  This is what someone on Reddit wrote about you: To the sexpat called Gekko463 harassing redditors on this subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/5rrn37/to_the_sexpat_called_gekko463_harassing_redditors/ Quote Hey /u/Gekko463 you defective fuck,  https://www.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/5qxznx/50_year_old_white_man_wants_to_move_to_thirdworld/dd6x8d8/  I never knew such a huge idiot can exist. I feel sorry for you. You are bragging about paying to fuck hookers. Dude you don't need a superiority complex to fuck hookers. Sorry to break it to you, anyone can fuck hookers, there's no screening for guys. A person doesn't need to be handsome or be mentally sane to have sex with hookers. They don't care how manly you are, they only care about your money. That's why they are called hookers for a reason, you idiot.  You seem delusional, making up a story about a whole group of men not satisfying girl, calling people inadequate. I know for sure you are inadequate. How do I know? Who goes around bragging about having a high sex drive. I bet you didn't have an inadequate sex drive in the first place, probably took too much viagra. How long can you last? Few seconds?  You seem like a loser. You throw the word incel around a lot, I looked it up. It means involuntary celibate. I guess you were an incel your whole life, that's why its engrained in your mentality. You constantly throw that word at other people. You are projecting your insecurities onto other people. You pay to have sex with hookers. In Vietnam and Philippines, these girls already had sex with countless other men, including Asian guys. For you to make a narrative up is hilarious. What's this about ""need actual MEN who can feed protect, shelter and satisfy them"".  Are you joking? You not protecting hookers by fucking them. You seem like those losers falling hopelessly in love with any girl who gives you the slightest bit of attention. Unlike America, the family system in Vietnam is more stable. I'm 100% sure that the women that you claim to fuck, already fucked hundreds of men. Heck, most hookers are usually single mothers raising money for their baby. You still get sloppy second son.  And you talk about hating on white women, especially American and British white women calling them landwhales. You ain't pretty yourself. You may see yourself as manly, protecting women by fucking prostitute. I'm sure the women doesn't even see you as a person, they see you as a number. ONE MORE. One more men to fuck to gain money. They don't even remember you. Because you don't matter. I could pay money to the hookers without fucking them because unlike you, I give a shit about them. You make up a narrative because you yourself can't face the music that you have to pay to fuck hookers and brag about it online to a bunch of anonymous Internet users. That's why I am better than you. I am physically better than you because I don't look like a ballsack. I'm richer than you, I can literally do the same shit you do in Eastern Europe, but unlike you, I don't take the easy way out. You use the term ""cock carousel"", I guess that's what they see you, a cock who can't even control his own behavior, needs to pay to fuck girls.  I bet during your younger years, you couldn't get any girls at all. You then decide to blame it on Western women. It's funny how you call Asian guys incel when many of us can fuck white girls without even needing to pay money. Girls fuck us because they want to, girls fuck you because they need to get the money. That's why people here have stable relationship, except some who constantly whine but they will get some in the future I'm sure, so not everyone is exactly like you.  Do you feel pathetic, that you can't even get a relationship. It seems like even when you MGTOW, you still carry the hatred of white women. I guess white women shot you down like the Ukrainians shot down MH17. They showed you that no amount of money you have can satisfy them. Without money, you are absolutely worthless.  Now I know why people call the millennial white people ""fragile"", because they have been raised by the failing ""Baby Boomers"". You should be happy that you couldn't get a girl, because your nonexistent child wouldn't last long before succumbing to carfentanyl. You can't even keep a relationship, reading your history. I could tell, you are scared of commitment, because you know that women don't love you at all. They would ditch you once they got a hold of your money. You have nothing to live for. You think you can sexpat till you are 70 something 80 something. You are probably going to die alone.  You are probably thinking, ohh I can marry a prostitute. Go ahead, I dare you. Because you can't even walk the talk. You think you provide and satisfy women by fucking prostitute. Being in a marriage, I know you are weak. The women will leave you because you can't satisfy her. Not even 1000 pills of viagra can satisfy her when she sees your flabby stomach, your crusty back, your brown teeth, your liver spots on the side of your head, your leaking earwax, your balding head, your coarse wrinkled skin. I bet you know ""TheRedPill"" where women will go for younger more healthy guy, they are laughing at you.  Even if you do get a kid, genetics shows that having a kid at old age would mean a lot of mutation for the kid. Your unborn kid will probably be mentally retarded, mentally ill, autistic, damaged. I'm sure it's not only the gene, but how you raised a child. The kid will probably commit suicide because the father, or you, ain't shit. Even single mothers have more balls than you do, you lack masculinity. Your legacy dies with you. Your future is bleak. All you do is going around fucking prostitute. You call yourself superior, you can't even control your sex drive, you have no discipline or self control.  http://imgur.com/a/GQ8Ai  Sorry, your mother is already dead, no women will give you undivided attention unless you pay them money. That's a fact. When you brag about your sex drive to men online, everyone is laughing. You are 53, act like a man, stop acting like a spoiled child. Even us millennials are more mature than you. No wonder you are a FAILURE.  No amount of money will make you anything more than the pathetic person you are.  No amount of Ethereum will solve your deep-seated issues.  You need help. Fifty+ year old men who are successful with women don't spend time on forums talking about being ""red pilled"" when it comes to women. That's the excuse you give for the fact that no woman wants to be around your Eliot Rodgers-type creepy ass.  Keep pushing. I'll post more.",False

The problem is that they haven't been up-front with their decisions, on top of making bad decisions. I know they're trying to prevent a massive sell-off, but there wouldn't be that need to prevent a sell-off if things had been done properly in the first place.

Lending is probably done with the collapse of Bitconnect. They're trying to be frontrunners in what most, if not all, lending platforms will have to become to survive. So I like them being progressive here.  The problem people are having is that our initial contracts are now finished and we would like the CHOICE to do what we want to do with our money. Of course, that would trigger a sell-off, which would kill the platform... but that's not really our fault. We didn't lock people out of contracts, not answer support, and change contracts without approval.  All I can say is, at this point, it's time for Regal to show it can be sustainable. I'm pissed that I was forced into a new contract without my approval, but I will give Regal one more chance to prove its worth IF they can keep the program running.  Investors have every reason to wonder whether or not they'll keep that program running. What happens in 99 days, when everyone who is in a contract now decides to mass sell-off then? Right now, it looks like they're just kicking the can down the road. But we'll see. I hope the new program is sustainable (but I would be surprised if it lasted).",False

I don't know.  The interest rate box for tomorrow is empty for me.  So this is the exit scam, or the new beginning, from my understanding. It's hard to tell what they're saying, and again, this underlies a problem with Regal. This information should be on Regal's own website, not posted on Facebook where only a few select Regal investors can see it.  So I guess we'll know tomorrow if it's the end or a new beginning for Regal. Honestly, they're at the point right now where a rebranding can do nothing but good. Other posts indicate that an internal exchange is on the way.  We'll know tomorrow.  Edit - Just to add further, it seems as if they're doing something for the 14th of January. What's going to happen till then, I don't know. But they're saying the people who buy and hold at this point and have those coins on the Regal website will get double the amount of Regal coins on the 14th, supposedly with the launch of the internal exchange.  Not sure about this move. Doubling the supply will give people even more Regalcoins to sell off, which has the potential to hurt Regal if people decide not to hold.",False

It sucks that they don't post updates on the Regal site. You have to follow the team members on Facebook to get good updates.  All expired contracts should be unlocked within the week, but I think they're going to try to keep that money in the system by rewarding you with double tokens if you hold.  I don't think the plan is a good idea, if I'm understanding the plan correctly. If the team is trying to pump the price of Regal, why double the supply? You're essentially cutting the price in half.  I don't know, maybe there's something else planned. I guess we'll see. There's supposedly a sort of renewing of the Regal brand happening this week.

I wouldn't lend those coins yet, I would hold onto them till the price inevitably goes up, and then either decide to do a loan or sell REC for profit.  I think the price will start climbing once an internal exchange is implemented.

Davor is not only the next Bitconnect, it's better than Bitconnect. Or at least it has the potential to be the best lending platform out there. Right now, the only test Davor has to pass is letting people cash out, which really hasn't been tested since Davor is roughly a month old. However, Davor has the potential to be at least as good as Bitconnect, even better. I think the rise in Davor's price has everything to do with investors taking money out of Regal and putting it into Davor. No one can touch Davor's rates.  I would encourage anyone who thinks I'm bluffing to just sign up to Davor and check it out. The website layout is slick and intuitive, and the rates are the best: https://davor.io/Account/Registration?r=52FB41  I still haven't given up on Regal but I won't post my referral link until the team implements an internal exchange. After that, Regal has to work on building investor trust back. The rise in Davor shows that the market has a major demand for lending platforms.

I think it's more than worth the risk to buy Regal while it's cheap. It all depends on if/when they implement an internal exchange.  If they don't implement an internal exchange, the price of Regal will drop below a dollar and it will be hard to keep the program going.  If they do implement an internal exchange, then they can control the price of Regal and the price will inevitably rise.  So it really depends on what you think about the internal exchange. Are you betting that the devs are lying about the internal exchange? Then don't buy. Are you betting that the devs will implement an internal exchange? Then BUY NOW, because the price will definitely increase once the exchange is up and running and the Regal team can control the price of the coin (which they will definitely increase).  So far, Regal has done most of what it said it was going to do, so I'm betting that they will implement an internal exchange this month. When it opens, the price will climb again. I can't tell anyone else what to do, but I'm betting that the internal exchange is on the way.",False

On the other end, Regal has the most user-friendly terms of contract, only being locked in for 99 days. However, this is backfiring, as the price of REC has crashed since the team did not work on an internal exchange that would allow them to control the price, and contracts are now expiring, causing a further sell off and lowering of prices. Still, whereas you're locked in for at least a half a year for Bitconnect and Davor, all contracts are only locked in 99 days for REC. Regal has its problems, but that is one advantage for the end-user it has over the other lending platforms (but it's coming back to bite the REC team).  Rates always start out high, and they inevitably have to drop as more people come into the program. More people = more payouts = smaller interest rates. It's inevitable for every coin. Regal was the best for awhile, but their rates have really decreased with the price of REC. I think Davor has a better means of controlling the price since Davor had an internal exchange BEFORE releasing the platform and it's working smoothly. So IMO, if someone was interested in doing one of these lending platforms, the strategy is to get in early, while the rates are high. That's why I like Davor, and it was the reason I invested into Regal in mid-October.  It's up to the individual person if he/she would rather just hold bitcoin and gain in that manner over risking getting lower returns in the short-term but profiting more in the long-term (provided the lending platform is still around in a year). If the lending program is around in a year's time, the compound interest makes the investment worth it, to me. It's a gamble, as everything is in crypto.  For those who are interested in Davor, use the link below, sign up for an account (unlike Regal, you don't have to be approved by another member, so the application process is simplified and quicker), and take a look around. Davor is crushing it right now because they had their platform ready to go BEFORE starting their lending program, which is why REC is low in price right now - they didn't have their website together before starting the lending program. https://davor.io/Account/Registration?r=52FB41  Compared to Regal: https://regalcoin.co/ref/FIATNAM  I like some of Regal's layout, but they have to get to work on an internal exchange. The question now is, how low will REC go until they get the exchange running? It could be cheaper than a dollar by that time. If so, I'm taking the plunge and buying more, betting that the price will precipitously increase once the internal exchange is up and running.",False

The website is offline till January 9th, at least.  Westerncoin has had its own problems.  Bitconnect had problems, too, but to their credit, they've worked on all of them. People tend to forget they had some pretty bad problems at the beginning as well.  Davor has been the best lending platform so far. After seeing REC rise up so quickly, I'm a bit weary seeing Davor go from $10 to $100 in a matter of about a month. But as for the product itself, I've had no problems. The best lending platform right now.  Regal made a series of mistakes, most notably locking people out of their accounts, but I think investors would have been more forgiving if the Regal team had communicated its plans on the Regal website. Instead, investors felt like they were out in the cold, and once unlocked (something the Regal team spent a lot of time doing, to their credit), those investors chose to sell off, frustrated with their experience. I can't say I blame them. Regal, like pretty much every lending platform (including Davor), has terrible communication and support. The only way I know anything about Regal's plans is because I follow a few team members on Facebook.  If Regal wants to turn things around, they should spend more money hiring support, be more responsive, and do a better job of communicating what they're doing, what they've got planned. And of course, the number one thing they need is an internal exchange. I was fearful that the price of REC would be less than a dollar by the time they got the internal exchange working, and now it's looking like an inevitability.  Regal has to earn back trust. That's not an easy thing to do. But I also have to say that I've personally not had a problem with Regal, and compared to most lending platforms, Regal has been better than the others except for Bitconnect and Davor. Credence was a straight-up scam. So was Bitpetite. Hextra looked good for awhile, but their recent problems scare me. Same with Westerncoin. Despite Regal's problems, they haven't pulled the plug on their servers, unlike Hextra. When Regal was fighting off hacking attacks in its early stages, they locked accounts to protect them. Which one is worse when dealing with hackers: locking accounts, or taking the entire site offline? Regal did the former, Hextra did the latter. It sucks for the accounts that were locked, but if I had to choose which one of the two actions is preferable, I would say Regal handled the situation better than Hextra.  But Regal needs to step up its game. Like I said before, it's simply inexcusable to not have an internal exchange at this point.",False

This coin was so in-demand at one point that it crashed an entire exchange (Coinexchange). REC was in demand so much that it went from less than a dollar at ICO to over $90 at one point in time. People were desperate for a competitor to Bitconnect, and Regal had a golden opportunity to be the Pepsi to Bitconnect's Coca-Cola.  It's obvious that the Regal team wasn't prepared to meet such a huge demand, which is understandable. Millions of dollars poured in from investors all across the world. I can give Regal a pass for not being able to handle such a HUGE demand, along with hackers trying to attack Regal's website on a daily basis. To give Regal some credit here, they require a higher degree of security to access their site than other lending programs. The Regal team fought the hack attacks and built a secure website.  However, Regal then began numerous useless promotions to keep money inside the Regal network, as well as trying to attract new investors to invest in the lending program. This is where things turned south for Regal.  Instead of working on an Internal Exchange that would have allowed Regal to better control the price of REC, the Regal team decided: To host events across southeast Asia, including a trip to Thailand at some point Do an absolutely useless hard fork of Regal that they called Regalcoin Cash, which wasn't implemented to the parameters they stated Christmas and New Years bonus program for people promoting Regal, which is the only thing on this list I think is a positive REC bids, something I still don't understand what it's supposed to do More promotion bonuses for the top lenders A promised Visa card, which no one seems to care about Regal Codes, which I guess is a means to send Regalcoins to other Regal holders  I understand the purpose behind all of these plans is to get new people invested into Regal and for current investors to buy and hold REC, but one look at the price shows it isn't working.  Why isn't it working?  Because Regal is focusing on all the wrong things.  As an investor, I don't care about more promotions. I don't care about Regalcoin Cash. I don't care about Regal Bids. I don't care about the Visa card. I don't care about events.  I CARE ABOUT A FUNCTIONING WEBSITE.  There's simply no excuse to not have an internal exchange at this point. None. The free-fall of Regal's price has everything to do with the Regal team not implementing basic features on their website, most notably the internal exchange.  I give Regal credit for doing most of what it said it was going to do, and allowing people to withdraw instead of blocking them (though the early investors are now past their 99 day loan and some of them haven't been able to cash out, since the Regal withdrawal limit is 50 REC a day, which is reasonable to keep Regal afloat but wouldn't have been necessary if the Regal team had spent more time working on their website instead of all these secondary programs that should have been implemented after an Internal Exchange). Every lending program has had to lock people out for a temporary period of time to keep the programs afloat. Plus, Regal still has some major advantages over other lending programs, most notably the length of the lending contract (only 99 days) and most of all, being able to buy Regal using Ethereum, which is a major positive over other lending platforms that have coins that can only be bought using Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin transactions are super high right now. In order to do a simple $100 loan on lending platforms, people buying and transferring in Bitcoin have to buy at least $120 to cover the ridiculous transfer fees. So it's not that Regal is without some positives, even with the price crashing. There was a spell when Regal was paying out less than .1% a day, but the interest rates have been better the past four or five days, which hopefully is a good sign.  However, if Regal doesn't implement an internal exchange in the next few weeks, people are going to stop reinvesting in the coin. It's time for the Regal team to show it's serious about being in this for the long-term and implement an Internal Exchange. Without this, the price of Regal will soon be under a dollar and investors are going to look elsewhere.  It's turbulent times for Regal. Either right now is the absolute best time to buy and hold Regal, since the price has never been lower, or investors are going to keep selling off and it's going to be hard for Regal to keep the program going. I still think Regal will bounce back from this, their team on Facebook is more approachable than any other lending platform out there (and we know more about the Regal team than any other lending platform, so they're more transparent). But it's time for Regal to show it is serious about their program. The longer an internal exchange is delayed, the more people are going to sell off. I bought some Regal for cheap, and I'd love to stake the coin while the price is low, but Regal hasn't even implemented a staking program yet.  I understand the demand was so huge at the beginning that Regal had a hard time dealing with it. However, Regal has been doing almost everything wrong since then, focusing on reward programs and hard forks instead of working on the Regal website. There's still time to save Regal and to have it bounce back up, but the Regal team has to get serious about working on the development of the site, most notably the internal exchange. We've been told that an internal exchange will happen in January (sooner rather than later), and when it does, Regal needs to buy up most of the remaining Regal coins and put those coins on their internal exchange so they can better control the price (more like the price increase) of Regalcoin.  Please stop focusing on hard forks, promotions, REC bids, VISA cards, and all of that useless stuff.  Focus on an internal exchange, price controls, and the website in general.  If you do the latter, investors will hold their REC and prospective investors will give Regal a chance.  If not, Regal is on borrowed time.  Here's hoping the price crash has made Regal realize that they need to take their website more seriously.  Internal Exchange  Internal Exchange  Internal Exchange",False

The problem is the market is now oversaturated with such programs. People have become extremely picky and impatient. Most people don't even buy into these programs to lend but to dump their coins at their targeted price. When you have a team that shows any sign of incompetence or unprofessionalism, the dump will occur much sooner. Thus, the project is almost certain to fail, because people will panic sell and move on to the next lending platform.  You will never see another Bitconnect if that's what you are looking for.  The people who profit most from these types of programs are Youtube affiliate marketers, they use your money to become wealthy.

I believe cause of many accounts are unlocked and investors just got angry and sell off...  When alot of accounts are locked, investors cannot sell therefore the price shoot up attract more investors however those locked  accounts cannot lend as well when the price is very high like 70 dollar and resulted the investors are angry so maybe once unlocked they sell them off and get another one.  Nowsday, there are many lending platforms are coming out and give incentives like hextra gold etc.. and also internal exchange + lending platform launched at same time but regal coin still no internal exchange instead they do outside marketing like giving trips etc..  These kind of platforms too common now and dev has to remain competitive to attract investors but nowsday investors just spend little buy ICO and sell off during launched to earn quick bucks and then go to the next ICO maybe they think that is the faster way to earn more.  But alot of scams are coming too which exited even before launched so is pretty unsafe now.",False

Like you, I was apprehensive about some of the things Regal has done. But let's be fair, the people who weren't locked really haven't had too many problems, and now everyone is unlocked.  It was a rough start, but Regal looks primed to reverse course. I'll post this again - a guy who was locked out due to safety concerns, someone who was an ICO investor, finally unlocked and dumped the coins... only to find out Regal is actually working. https://youtu.be/sOH0aTLtVlM  Bitconnect is the safest, since it has been working for about a year now. Regal had a golden opportunity to pass Bitconnect, but struggled early on. Right now, Davor has the best interest rates, by far (and it's not really close). So I wouldn't have any problem putting money in any of those three.  One advantage Regal has over the others is that you're only locked in for 99 days, meaning you can pull your initial investment after 99 days locked in. No other lending program really comes close to matching that, and since people have been able to cash out of Regal (see the video above), Regal is becoming a better option by the day - especially since the price is still low right now. For new investors, by the time your 99 days is up, Regal will surely be above its current price (right around $15), meaning when your loan is unlocked, you could choose to reinvest at the price of Regal as it is at that point after 99 days, or you can cash out at that price.  It's been awhile since I've been comfortable putting my referral link in this thread, as I was worried that Regal was on its way out. But they've done almost everything they said they were going to do (sans the internal exchange, which should be out within a month), and there's good evidence that they are still financially solvent, so I can finally recommend Regal again. If you're reading this thread and want to risk a hundred or a thousand dollars on a compound interest plan that will pay out handsomely in six to eight months time, please use the link below. https://regalcoin.co/ref/FIATNAM  I would also encourage people to check out Davor. Right now, it's barely two weeks old, and up to now, it's been the best lending platform in my personal opinion. Just use the link below, sign up, and check it out. Davor's setup is more like Bitconnect and not like Regal. https://davor.io/Account/Registration?r=6B1E39  Davor has the best rates bar none, and you can lock up your initial loan for another 120 days to earn a .1% bonus per day.",False

Even though the price of REC is falling again (what crypto isn't right now, though?), I finally feel confident that Regal will be around for a long time. I admit to having doubts the past few weeks, which is why I didn't post much during that time, but Regal could have cut and run when the price fell from $90 to $10, but they didn't. They've had a few self-inflicted wounds, most notably the lockouts and not having an internal exchange, but all accounts are unlocked now and an internal exchange will be here within a month. They could have abandoned the project and kept people locked out of their accounts, but they didn't. They bit the bullet, unlocked everyone, and weathered the downward price storm.  Regal is getting closer to Bitconnect territory when it comes to trustworthiness in a lending platform, which honestly means more than interest rate returns.

There is a huge internal problem that is causing the theft within the exchange from USD interest payments to REC coins to result in an unauthorized transmission to an unknown REC coins wallet address.  My account and all of my friend's accounts are experiencing this stealing of REC coins when converting USD to REC.  The support cannot locate the hacking routine that is causing this.  Having 2FA and changing passwords does not help since the security routine of opening the wallets is being bypassed.  The only thing that works is the reinvest, but since you can not convert the interest of any of the loans to REC without the REC being sent to a unknown address,  even having the reinvest working is of no use.   Also, the REC cash is worthless since it has no utility or a value of even one cent.  And the XMAS bonus pays in USD, so if you convert that to REC, it could be stolen also.  You would think that after locking up many accounts for over one month, that this kind of problems would be resolved.  But ever since the hardfork, these hacking routines are now in place to steal your REC coins when you convert.   NOT A MERRY XMAS and the low, low price of REC coins is reflecting the low-interest rates and the worthless REC Cash and the hacking routines that steal your REC coins.",False

You can’t just pass money from hand to hand around in a circle and make it magically grow.  There is no such thing as “High Yield Investment Programs”.  They simply do not exist.  Another fancy name for a Ponzi structure.  If such a thing legitimately  existed—free money and nothing gets created, nothing sold, no value added and nobody gets hurt, don’t you think it would be on the news as the greatest invention in the history of the world?  So the answer is 0%.  Anything that promises any income at all without selling something and having revenues is a child’s fairytale.  If you own any of these shitcoins, you are childlike in your gullibility.

Bad news - the price keeps crashing.  I think the two are directly related. I believe the people who were locked out have had enough and are selling off en masse. I can't really blame them, but it would be best if they took their frustrations out of the equation and waited for the coin to bounce back. That's easy for me to say, though, since I was never locked out.  Now, most of the problems associated with Regal seem to be the people who don't know how to work the website. Some people are complaining about having a negative Regal balance, but they are not using the Refresh button on the dashboard, they are instead using the refresh button on their browsers. Little things like that.  For now, it seems as if the Regal team is FINALLY listening to its investors. The locked accounts have been unlocked, and the team has announced on Facebook that the internal exchange has been tested and will be implemented soon. Although it's two months too late, it's still better than not having one, so hopefully the Regal team will be smart and implement the internal exchange soon - and not have to rely on CoinExchange. Without an internal exchange and a trip switch, any lending coin will have a hard time lasting, since external factors can crash the coin (such as people selling off right now - the Regal team can't do anything about it since there is no internal exchange).  With all of the bad news, it's good that Regal has allowed everyone to sell their coin and cash out in BTC. They've never blocked anyone from doing that, from cashing out. So Regal should be working properly. No more locked accounts, internal exchange soon.  It's tough to say this since the price of Regal is about to be less than $10, but things are finally looking up.    I finally put a small loan into Davor and I can say without hesitation, it's the best lending platform out there. It's easy to use, the payouts are great, and unlike Bitconnect and Regal, you can reinvest any amount over $10 (including fractions, such as $10.14 - you can lend the entire amount). That makes the compound interest go even faster. The website is easy to use, and it's incredibly fast.  That being said, I have more money in Regal and I want to see Regal succeed.

I worry they have been a tad frivolous with the parties and trips to thailand... etc. I think they can come back hopefully.    Here is some info on Hextra gold, which is coming out next week.  Hextra gold(HXG) is a $30 loan token.   You get One HXG per 2 Hextra coin you loan, thats equivalent to a $15 bonus per coin you loan. Currently HXT is at $22, so that bonus is huge(66% at the current price).  You can also get 1 HXG per 4 Hextra coins you hold, thats equivalent to a $7.50 bonus each.

Makes me wonder if the tank in price was part of the plan - drive down the cost of Regal as to not crash the entire program when everyone is unlocked and selling off. In a way, if that was the plan, it was a really smart plan.  Hopefully this upward swing in price is the new trend. I'm a little bummed that I didn't grab more Regal when it was in the $10 range.

I heard davoir was limiting whale sells to 600 coins.   It seems to be an effective strategy.  Although Regal coin is looking pretty bad at the moment.  I signed up to Davor, just to check it out (as I did Bitconnect and Hextra). Being fully honest, I was surprised at how easy the site was to navigate, and Davor's interest rates are way better than any other lending program's rates. I had no plans to put any money into any other lending platform not named Regal, but ended up throwing $100 into Davor, just to see how it pays out.  As of now, Davor is my favorite lending platform. I still have love for Regal, I have more money in Regal so I want the platform to succeed, but Davor is simply the best. Easy and intuitive to navigate with the best returns out there.  I would suggest signing up for an account and just checking out the website. That is what convinced me to give it a try. https://davor.io/Account/Registration?r=6B1E39  One extra thing Davor does that I like is that you can lock in your initial investment for another 120 days and get a .1% bonus. That's something I bet Bitconnect and Regal wish they would have thought about doing.  One advantage Regal has over every other lending coin is that Regal only locks you in for 99 days. No other lending platform can come close to those user-friendly terms. I do think that Regal should add the .1% bonus for locking in your loan for an extra 99 days, akin to Davor.",False

But the price of REC is going down every hour.  This is why an internal exchange was needed from day one, to have a trip switch like Bitconnect has, to prevent a massive sell off and downward spiral of coin price.  Meanwhile, Davor is skyrocketing because they had a fully working platform before opening up their lending program.  The Regal team announced yesterday that an internal exchange would be implemented in January but by then, the coin might be worth less than a dollar. They need to focus their entire effort on an internal exchange and preventing such massive price swings. Let's face it, this was a failure of the Regal team.  That being said, the buy orders on CoinExchange ($665,700) outweigh the sell orders ($188,500) by $477,000, so it has to bottom out and start gaining at some point. The Regal team has unlocked a lot of people and they are deciding to sell off, dropping the price.",False

I don't post very often. The first was about Regal Coin and everyone who got involved made a lot of money. The coin is still doing well and is far above ICO price. The second post was calling out BitBase as a scam. I also had been waiting for more lending platforms to come along since bitconnect have a great model. Do you not think these coins have a higher chance of growth than most other cryptos? Bitcoin itself is more of a ponzi in any sane person's view as that is simply a coin with no safeguards against dumping the price and no protection for coin holders (the only reason it is growing is due to all these new lending platforms and itself being used as the main trading pair for all other coins). Lending platforms prevent owners dumping the coins (as it will cost them more coins in interest payments if the value doesn't go up so rather than making profit through the lending rates, they lose money in the end if their coin value plummets) and give value in guaranteeing capital investment in cryptos. What stops most other coins from being dumped on by developers or whales when they have decided they have enough profit? Bitconnect even halt the exchange if there is panic to protect coin holders although the coin price is never guaranteed, only the investment should be (although they have recently updated their terms to say otherwise). I'm not saying bitconnect created this good system by design but it is more likely to have been an accidental side effect of creating their own coin.  Secondly, the criminal aspect is greatly mitigated by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as they will be less violent against other people if they do not fear their money being taken by authorities when caught. There will always be these type of people in the world, so it is better that they are less aggressive due to the privacy of cryptocurrencies. It is still not going to be easy for them to withdraw large sums of cash due to KYC policies when dealing in fiat currencies.",False

This is insane. Bitconnect is smart, it has an internal exchange and a trip switch to prevent massive sell-offs, which ensure Bitconnect will not have a massive downward swing in value.  Right now, Regal does NOT have an internal exchange, which means they don't have a trip switch, which means shady people who want to sell off the coin en masse can drive the price of REC into the ground - which is exactly what's happening.  There's no excuse at this point for the Regal team to not have an internal exchange. They shouldn't be partying it up all across the hemisphere, or doing useless hard forks. They should be focusing all their efforts first on an internal exchange with a trip switch, then unlocking everyone who is still unlocked.  As of this moment, the price of REC continues on a downward spiral and will continue to do so until the Regal team decides to address those two issues (internal exchange and unlocking of ICO investors). I can't even recommend my friends buy into Regal right now because the coin might not have value by the time the internal exchange rolls around, which is said to be 2018. The way the trends are going, I don't even know if REC will be worth $5 by January 1st, 2018.  Let's face it, these are dark times for Regal. Either the price of Regal is an absolute steal and the coin will bounce back up, or things will continue on a downward trend. I personally grabbed a coin for cheap yesterday in anticipation of an upward swing in price, but it's up to the Regal team to show they're in this for the long run and fix the problems facing Regalcoin right now.

I do see that some people who hounded the Regal team on Facebook are now saying they're unlocked, so problems are being worked on. That's a good thing, definitely a good sign.

You have made a poor argument about not investing, trying to turn things personal, deflect, and try to ""win"" via attrition.  So I challenge you to two things: 1. Post what your authority figures (Buffet, Dimon, and Blankfein) have to say about BITCOIN, and then rationalize how you can use their opinions about Regal on one hand but ignore all the damning things they've said about Bitcoin itself on the other 2.

That should be the top priority and it's a mark against Regalcoin that it's been over two months and there isn't an internal exchange (meanwhile Hextra and Davor are newer than Regal and both have working internal exchanges).  My advice for the Regal team: 1. Internal exchange 2. A systematic unlocking of accounts that are still locked out. This can be done in a way that doesn't crash the price of Regal due to massive sell-offs. Unlock people in increments, but do it soon. Those people invested in your coin during the ICO stage, there's no reason they should still be locked. Just do it in a way that doesn't collapse the entire system. It can be done.  Despite all of this, I have personally cashed out of Regal before, so I know Regal is working - at least for me and new investors into Regal (the lockouts, which have went down since Regal started unlocking accounts after safety concerns were met, seem to be individuals who invested during the ICO stage - it does not affect new users, so don't worry about signing up if you didn't invest in September). I'm still comfortable with Regal but I admit, I was very uneasy last night. To prevent a dip like that from crashing Regal, the Regal team needs a working internal exchange as a trip switch to prevent REC from collapsing, and to be able to better control the coin's price (buying the sell-off at the bottom and selling it when Regal recovers, just like Bitconnect does).",False

It's obvious that Coinmarketcap has lending platforms on their blacklist, and that's hurting Regal. Regal should be listed on the front page of Coinmarketcap. Kudos to Coincap.io (and Worldcoinindex) for at least not putting Regal on a blacklist.  But Regal needs some tough love to get off their rears and implement an internal exchange. It should be top priority, and although I still believe in Regal because I have been able to lend and withdraw without issues, Regal's price will continue to dip until the REC team shows they are going to put forth a better effort. That means unlocking accounts and implementing an internal exchange.  From what I hear following Regal's team on Facebook, the internal exchange will happen in 2018. We can only hope.  Despite all of this, Regal itself is still working for those who aren't locked. Every lending platform has done something similar so we can only hope these two issues are corrected and Regal becomes the best lending platform out there, which I still think it can be.",False

So you really have two choices here, you can take heed of this free experience based knowledge being so generously handed to you, or you can continue to be thick headed and when regal coin continues to shit the bed you'll eventually come to accept this knowledge as truth anyway.

Don't get me wrong, I understand why people feel that way, but these programs are paying interest out right now, so as of now, they're working. You might not like it, but people are being paid out, and as long as people can trade lending coins for BTC (and maybe one day fiat), these programs will continue to work. Have there been lending schemes that were straight up scams? Of course, just look at Credence. But just because some of them are doesn't necessarily mean all of them are. Some cryptos are straight up scams (remember Onecoin?), that doesn't mean all of them are. A lazy scam would be Credence - they didn't even open up a website, one of the devs secretly sold his stash and the coin crashed a few days before the site was supposed to go live. That's a lazy scam. Regal has its problems (locking people out - every lending program has done this at some point in time), but they've also worked on those problems (unlocking accounts and letting people cash out of REC even though it hurt the program because of massive sell-offs). Credence was a straight-up scam. If Regal wanted to cut and run, they would have done it before now.  And yes, I still believe in Regal, the program. I will until they pull their web servers or people can't cash out. I've been critical or REC as well - not having an internal exchange at this point is pretty inexcusable. But every time Regal was supposed to end before, every time people predicted Regal would be no more... well, up to this point, they've been proven wrong. Time will tell if REC will last in the long run.  As I said in the post above, everyone going into these programs should understand that they could lose everything. Again, if crypto is high risk, high reward, then lending programs like Regal and Bitconnect are the ultimate epitome of high risk, high reward. It's only right to acknowledge the truth. You could lose everything you've invested in these programs, or you could end up not having to work for a long time if the programs pass the test of time and pay out handsomely in six months to a year. If you don't want to invest, I understand why. But I chose to take a portion of my portfolio and add more risk. Will it be worth it? I guess we'll know by next summer. If not, I knew the risks involved.",False

If you “lend them” your coins, NOW they have the bitcoins, AND THEY HAVE the coins they sold you.  You have a receipt.  And your dick in your hand when their website stops working!  All they have to do before the big finale is slowly sell off your lent coins into the market for more bitcoin, and switch off their website forever.  The music is over, and everybody’s bitcoins and magic beans are gone.  The rest of the magic beans go to 1 Satoshi.  Could be today.  Could be next year.  Could be 20 minutes ago.  Have you checked?  They already have at the very least $10 million of bitcoin.  Plus your magic beans.  They sold 5 million coins in the ICO out of the 27 million that can exist...so they have more than 5 free coins behind every coin they sold...  So they have:  1. The Bitcoins from the ICO 2.  The coins they sold you but you lent back to them and... 3.  They have 5 more Regal coins for every one they sold...so paying out 1% a day interest in Regal coins is no big deal for them because as the price rises (due to the pyramid marketing and targeting gullible low sophistication markets like Vietnam) they have to pay out less and less Regal coins to give a an illusion of 1% per day USD returns  You have:  an IOU for the coins you lent them.  That’s it.  And your dick in your hand when the website stops working.  Meanwhile they can sell as many Regal coins into the demand they are creating for...more bitcoins.  Even the ones you lent them!  Because everyone is not going to ask for the coins back at the same time.  In effect, they did a premine.  They share the premine with you.  That is the bait to create more demand.  You say loudly “hey, I am making 1% a day!” So the price rises.  New dumb money comes in, they keep sharing the premine until the premine is gone...  They begin running on “Fractional Reserve”. Selling or giving away the coins you lent them.  That’s another way they steal from you.  This model collapses from inflation the minute the amount of new money being brought in to support th price is less than the amount of backup coins they have on hand.    See, scammers want bitcoins, and to get them, they give you magic beans.  You THINK you are getting richer, but really, every time you post your affiliate link, you BECOME one of the scammers.  This time they took the bitcoins, got you to give them the magic beans back, and they gave you an IOU for your beans!  You making money depends on finding another poor fool to bring more real money into the market and then that fool must convince a new fool to bring in more real money so he feels like he’s making a profit...  The sad thing about Ponzi/pyramid schemes, especially sophisticated hybrids like this one, is that not only are the scammers criminals and guilty of stealing from people.  Every person in that pyramid who expects to get rich MUST rob the next person down the line.  Or make happy positive postings convincing someone, somewhere to bring in more real money.  You are a thief if you are taking this dirty money.  I have heard about this in Vietnam, because there are promoters here putting on seminars and stealing from these poor people whose GDP is $2000 per year.  So sad.  Vietnamese people are very susceptible to get rich quick schemes.  They bought a lot of One Coin too.  Fact is, legitimate coins like Bitcoin, ETH, OMG, LTC do NOT have sales seminars.  They do not have affiliate links.  Thye don’t use MLM sales scams, They do not “promote” their coins in poor developing nations, and they do not engage in financial trickery:  they solve technical problems and create actual useful things.  YOU, Mr, Fiatnam, are deluded.  You hurt people.  You don’t care if this is a scam as long as you make money?  Your money comes from the fools clicking on your affiliate link.  You are no better than the scammers who started this and Bitconnect and the rest of these “magic lending platforms”  Bitconnect and Regalcoin are the same people.  If you didn’t know that before I just told you, you are not paying attention!  Because you do know that, Regal Coin money is just feeding into Bitconnect now because there’s not enough going into Bitconnect anymore and the other 6 dozen lending platforms are all...the same Bitconnect people.  This is ALL run by the same people.  It is the same scam over and over so the same guys can get you to cough up your money more than once because you “think” you are diversifying, but...you are playing right into their hands.  So Bitconnect REALLY is the “granddaddy of them all” as you say:  these “lending platforms” are one big family writ by the same auteurs:  one big con, so they can con the same people over and over!  They have linked together a pyramid of Ponzi to make the game last longer!  They ain’t stupid!  Further, there is a lot of background noise saying this is actually an Eastern European Mafia running this.  Just like One Coin, but with better devs.  Math is the same as in 1901.  So, be clear:  you gave money to the Mafia and are supporting everything they do.  And you help the Mafia make more money every day with your affiliate link.  You are a Mafia pawn.  If anything I have written her was news to you, you are not to be trusted with your own money.  You are going to lose it, and you are helping to steal other people’s money before you go down.  Have you ever noticed that actual business people—people who understand finance and accounting because they studied it in university never buy into things like this?  To someone who has ever read a financial engineering book, things like this are transparently clear.  The idiots that buy into things like Regal Coin and Bitpetite etc...are invariably baristas, hairdressers, English Teachers and Walmart cashiers because anyone with an economics background understands perfectly what the value proposition here is:  there is no value being created.  The price is just hype meeting gullibility and is temporary.  You are no better than a guy who hits people over the head in a dark ally and steals their wallets.

The vast majority of what you wrote was specious at best.  So Regal has the BTC from the ICO? Big whoop. That means nothing. If they wanted to cut and run, they would have taken the BTC from the ICO and ran, like Bitpetite did and like Credence just did. Instead, they have a working platform that still needs some work, but the system itself is up and running. Can it last forever? I don't think so, but it can last for a long time, and they can adjust rates based on reserves, if they so choose. But they would have already exited if they just wanted to scam people. It's one thing if you think the lending process is a scam, but your argument that Regal is a scam because they already have BTC from the ICO is laughable at best.  As for the selling of Regalcoins, they don't have a working internal exchange (which is a huge flaw), which means the value of Regalcoins isn't being manipulated like in BCC. I actually wish they would model their internal exchange to mirror BCC. Besides, you don't seem to know how supply and demand works. If they're selling Regal for BTC, what happens to the price of Regal? It plummets. I've already made this point before, but I'll walk you through it. Hold my hand tight and pay attention. Regal shot up to $90 and has fallen to the $30 range. Somewhere in the middle is the true value of Regal. We won't know until all accounts are unlocked (which by the way, why would they lock people out of their accounts if they want to sell those people's Regalcoins for BTC? That doesn't make any sense). So the $90 price was inflated because of the scarcity of coins due to locks, and the $30 wasn't the true value either since people were being unlocked and selling off, not staking, lending, or holding Regal. Somewhere in the middle is the true price range. We won't know until Regal unlocks everyone.  If Regal really wanted to rip people off, they would have an internal exchange where you can sell your BTC for their Regalcoins, then lend/stake. That's what BCC does and it's pretty smart. So for the Regal team to benefit from BTC, they HAVE to go through Coinexchange, Yobit, or BTC Alpha and sell those Regalcoins, which is much more laborious than BCC's model and doesn't allow them to manipulate the price (thus, Regal's price - once all accounts are unlocked - will be much closer to true value than BCC's). Speaking of locked accounts, Regal isn't benefiting from those coins that are locked because they can't sell them off. So that's another knock on your argument. Not only that, it would have benefited Regal to get those coins to the market so they could then sell them off. Instead, those coins are now more valuable than they would have been right after hitting the market, which hurts Regal.  Your whole spiel about Ponzi/pyramid schemes and IOUs sounds very much like the arguments made against Bitcoin in its early days. ""They're selling you funny money that's digital for real cash!"" It's laughable to think about now. Time will tell if your argument is as laughable. It all depends on Regal.  As for the money I make with referrals, I've made zero with referrals. So there goes that argument. You don't have to have people under you to profit from Regal. It helps, it expedites the process, but it's not necessary. So it's retarded to say that ""I"" am scamming anyone. Besides, there we go again, another argument once made about Bitcoin itself when it hit the market, that it's a scam because it has no intrinsic value, nothing tangible backing it up.  As for the same people running all of these lending programs, I have wondered about that. It's possible, I certainly think the people behind Regal are the same people behind Hydrocoin since their websites are almost similar. The thing that separates Bitconnect from Regal, and the thing that separates Regal from all other lending programs I know, is that we already know some of the people behind Regal. I've posted their Facebook accounts in this very thread, take some time to read through the thread and check the veracity of that statement. Still, I have wondered if the newer lending programs are made to put new money into the pipeline to pay the older lending programs, and whether or not every lending program is a pyramid microcosm of a much larger pyramid. That's a fair point and one to consider before investing in one of these programs, that Regal itself might work great but could go down because another lending program tied into it collapses.  What's your source on the Eastern European mafia? To say people are consciously trying to rip people off to benefit some esoteric mafia that you pulled out of your ass for the sake of argument is retarded. I will retract that if you have a source, otherwise you can get off your high horse.  You compare Regal to Bitpetite. Do you even know what you're comparing? Regal is up and running, and I've been able to pull money off the site and cash out into BTC. Bitpetite didn't last a day. It scammed people from the get-go. The two simply aren't comparable, even if Regal goes down tomorrow (and there's enough demand to keep Regal running for awhile).  I've already stated that this can't run forever, but I intend to profit while it does. If you choose not to, then don't get involved. It's that simple. But it's working right now and that's what matters. If you want to stay poor, go ahead. I intend to enjoy the ride however long it lasts, whether it's another week or three more years. If other people want to risk that money, I say good for them. There's no guarantee that your money will be safe in ANY cryptocurrency, even BTC. It's all about what risks you are comfortable taking.  ""You are no better than a guy who hits people over the head in a dark ally and steals their wallets."" This is where you are as emotional as a menstruating teenage girl and not thinking clearly. I've laid out the facts as best I could in this entire thread, and even though I've had referrals, not one of them has put money into Regal, so I've made nothing from my referrals. I don't have to - I'm still making money every day. Stop acting like a child throwing a temper-tantrum and try to think rationally about this.  What's the number one rule for cryptocurrency? You never put in money that you can't afford to lose. That bodes even moreso for Regalcoin and other lending platforms. I've made that statement clear over and over in this thread. Maybe you should read this thread more. I've been honest about Regal, you seem to think the people who invest in Regal don't know what they're getting in to and are trying to ""trick"" others into investing. I have been saying over and over that Regalcoin and other lending programs are truly the highest risk/highest reward possible in cryptocurrency. What part of that are you having trouble grasping?  Are you another jsnip4 who got burned by Bitpetite so now you're making it your mission to try and FUD the other lending platforms, even if they're working?",False

They don't even have an internal exchange working. Right now, to lend in Regal, you have to buy Regalcoins at Yobit or Coinexchange.

That would only kill the price of Regalcoin - which is the only coin held on the Regalcoin exchange at the moment.  In that regard, Regalcoin is MUCH safer than Bitconnect and other lending platforms.

However, unlike Bitconnect, Regal does not have a working internal exchange right now, meaning the Regal team would be shooting itself in the foot if they were to cut and run. Bitconnect can pull its servers and still have made a lot of bitcoin, and the inevitable price collapse of Bitconnect would only hurt those who bought, lent, and hold/stake the Bitconnect coins they traded for their Bitcoins.  Regal can't do that, since in order to buy Regalcoin, you have to purchase it on Coin Exchange or YoBit. So if Regal went down, the team wouldn't benefit because they don't have an internal exchange where you can send your Bitcoin to the Regal team. If Regal cut and ran, all they would have would be Regalcoins (which would be worthless at that point).  Just remember this if Bitconnect goes down for good within the next month or two. I don't want Bitconnect to fail, I want it to succeed, but there's so much drama right now behind that coin.

We already know some of the people behind Regalcoin: https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100008281260013 https://www.facebook.com/abdo.tatan https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100016492397688  So at least Regal has two public faces behind the coin.  Aziz has been trying (and succeeding) in getting people's accounts unlocked. I've never had a problem with a locked account, for the record.  The fact that we know a few of the people behind Regal's team, and none behind Bitconnect, makes me feel like Regal just might be the safer bet. That's the first time I've been able to say that. I will feel much better about Regal once the first 99 days are up and people are able to withdraw their initial funds. I will feel really comfortable about Regal when people are withdrawing daily - but all of this will take some time.  So far, the payouts have been really good and consistent. As of now, the only problem I've had with Regalcoin is getting the site to properly display my Regal balance, which was an easy fix - simply log into your wallet using the code from the email that Regal sends you when you click on your wallet link on the Regal site. After that, your balance is updated.  Anyway, if you have any questions about Regal, send me a PM.  If you want to sign up to Regal, please use the link below: https://regalcoin.co/ref/FIATNAM",False

This guy had been locked out of his account for awhile, and was ready to give up on Regalcoin. His account was recently unlocked, and he was able to move $65,000 out of his account without problem. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOH0aTLtVlM&feature=youtu.be  I once said that Bitconnect was safer than Regal because people had been able to move their money out of the exchange. With the man in this video able to withdraw such a large amount, I now believe Regal is a better option than Bitconnect. It's just as safe when it comes to withdrawals, but locks your lending deposits in for a shorter time and gives better payouts. The one knock I have on Regal is that their customer service needs to improve, but I still have to give the Regal team credit, they're working hard on getting people unlocked.

Instead of hard forking and doing events, Regal's team needs to update/upgrade their own website to make it easier to use and more intuitive. It's not hard navigating the Regal website, but I can see how it would be off-putting for some people. That would be my constructive criticism for the Regal team.

There are negatives, the biggest of which are people who have been locked out of making certain transfers from their accounts. Granted, some of these people found an exploit and didn't notify the Regal team, so they deserve to be locked out of their accounts for trying to game the system. However, there are people locked out from doing simple things like converting to USD when they shouldn't be locked out.  That has been changing. More and more people are messaging the Regal team (most notably Aziz on Facebook, a member of the Regal team), and the team has been working hard at unlocking accounts. So they're slowly moving towards more honesty, transparency, and most importantly, trust. I personally don't think this type of program can last for five years unless they tinker with the lending program and have lower payouts, but I do think it can last for at least three years - IF the Regal team is committed to running the program that long. The good thing is, even Bitconnect has changed its referral program to have a more realistic payout structure, so Regal can do the same if push comes to shove.  A lot of YouTubers said that Regal wouldn't last past the beginning of November, that the devs would pull their web servers and run with the money. Since then, Regal has unlocked many accounts and even more are being unlocked daily. The fact that we at least know one person behind Regalcoin (Aziz) means we already know more about the people behind Regal than anyone knows who is behind Bitconnect. I would still say Bitconnect is somewhat safer, but that's only because Bitconnect has been around long enough for people to pull out their initial investments. We haven't even reached the 99 days for Regalcoin investors to pull their initial investments. That will be a huge barrier as to whether Regal is going to stick around for the long run. The fact that they've been working on unlocking accounts, as well as being transparent as to the happenings of their site (something they sorely lacked until recent weeks), leads me to believe that Regal will be around for years to come.  As I said before, Bitconnect will be safer until Regal hits the 99 day barrier and we can see if people pull out their initial investments. If that happens, Regal will be just as safe as Bitconnect, but will be a better lending program to invest in, since the returns are better than Bitconnect.  If you have more questions, send me a PM.  If you'd like to join Regal, please use the link below and if needed, send me a PM and I'll guide you through the process (you'll have to buy Regalcoins on Coinexchange, then transfer them to your Regal wallet).

Your reasoning sounds like a lot of people who didn't invest in Bitcoin when it was $100.  Then $500.  Then $1000.  ""I'm too intelligent to buy internet funny money, I only invest in stocks.""  It's your choice if you want to miss out on the gains. I don't care if these lending coins go belly-up as long as I make money in the meantime. In that respect, they're no different than Bitcoin - you don't put money in that you can't afford to lose, because nothing is guaranteed. But the upside is worth it.  Quote from: kingmoneymastery on November 06, 2017, 01:32:03 AM REGALCOIN OWES ME 690 USD!  This is the 5th time this has happened. I converted USD to REC but transaction records only show a minus in 120 USD but no transaction record of a gain in REC. REC balance remains zero.  If you do not get your rightful earnings, this is the definition of a SCAM.  You WILL lose most of your capital lending to Regalcoin. That is a guarantee. If yields can just ""disappear"" into thin air, your initial capital can too.  May the buyer beware.

My balance is zero, but I sent some REC from coinexchange. Check your Coinexchange transaction/withdrawal history. If it shows the withdrawal was completed, then whatever you sent over to your wallet on Regal's website is there, it's just not showing up for some reason.  I had the same problem. Check above, and if the withdrawal from Coinexchange went through, log into Regalcoin, go to Lending, and then enter the amount (in multiples of $10) to lend. It should go through, even if you have to do it a few times. The value of Regal has fluctuated, so if it says you don't have enough balance to lend, drop your lending total down by $10 and try again.  This is one thing the Regal team needs to fix - transactions aren't always showing up on the site's wallet, even though it's really there.

It depends on whether the Regalcoin team works on the problems with the website.  Some ICO investors are still locked out.  I'm personally over a grand into Regalcoin and I've had problems of my own, the biggest of which is buying Regal from Coinexchange and then transferring it to my Regal wallet on Regal's website. It's not that the money doesn't transfer, it's that more often than not, it has not shown up in my wallet. So the money is there and I can lend (in multiples of $10) the money I sent over, but it might give me a negative Regal balance because their website hasn't updated the transaction properly. The Regal team needs to do a better job of communicating with their investors and upgrading their website. It's entirely possible that they were overwhelmed with volume, because Regal skyrocketed. A lot of people wanted in, and it's possible the team was just not large enough to deal with the volume.  The upside is higher than Bitconnect, which is why I think it's worth it, but as of now, Bitconnect is safer. That's where we're at now - Bitconnect is safer, but not as much upside, whereas Regal is not as safe as the moment, but you have the ability to earn a lot more than with Bitconnect.  I'd suggest putting money into both, even though I'm not personally invested in Bitconnect. Remember the #1 rule of cryptocurrency is: Never put in money you can't afford to lose. Putting money into Regal or Bitconnect makes that statement way more true.  At least both of these HYIPs are safer than Bitpetite...  If you want to see what you could do with Regal, why it has such massive upside, I suggest watching this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxfk-VRI7q8",False

I wouldn't give up on Regal on it because I think they got WAY more (like exponentially more) demand than what was expected and the team is overwhelmed at the moment.

They wouldn't spend time fixing accounts (and the site itself) if it was just a quick scam, like Bitpetite.  As with all HYIPs, the best time to get in is at the beginning. The longer you wait, the less gains you get and the more you come to an end to the program's breaking point. There's still time now and there will be until Bitcoin stops gaining for a very long period of time, but I'm not concerned about that because I believe Bitcoin will reach $100k in 10 years time.

Has Bitcoin hit its all-time peak? If so, the lending programs are over because there's no ""trading bot,"" they're just pinning their lending programs on the price of Bitcoin (at least there's a 95% chance of this). But I don't think we've reached the peak. I think we've barely scratched the surface and Bitcoin will grow exponentially over the years. As long as Bitcoin grows, the lending programs that hang in will pay off for their investors. That's the gamble. I just think it's well worth it.

These are their original investors, they had time to update the website with pumpkins and ghosts but hundreds of their investors are locked out from their coins and money for a very long time and not updated at all.  The growth of the coin is completely unfounded as well, if you have millions of ICO coins locked down then this will inevitable inflate the price. They have gone about this all wrong. Coin holders now will sell everything when (if) they are released as they don't have any trust in regal anymore, it would have helped if they kept everyone informed and have a set time of when they would be released.  I suggest that if accounts are still locked by next week we need some people to boycott the singapore promotion event in November!!! We need to keep pushing and highlight this to new investors.

My advice, if you are already invested in Bitconnect or RegalCoin is to convert your interest to BCC or REC and then let it sit as BCC or REC before converting out to BTC.  As you'll probably end up with more BTC by holding the REC/BCC as it increases in value.  Obviously you need to cash out to BTC and to your wallet from time to time incase anything happens with the sites and your money is lost.

Yes, buy it from the exchange and lock it away for 99 days earning around 1 - 1.5% interest per day (which is crazy really).  RegalCoin, like Bitconnect, claim the interest comes from their 'trading bot' which buys and sells BTC on the exchanges multiple times per day making small profits each time.  Then they distribrute these profits to investors.  In reality, does a trading bot really exist?  Possibly but probably not.  So, my advice is get in early, make your money back and then re-invest once you have gotten your return back.  Every man and his dog is spamming referrral codes for RegalCoin here so pick someones as you need it to be activated(mine are below if you want them).  I personally would recommend investing 50%/50% RegalCoin/Bitconnect to cover your bases.  I've done some guides on both RegalCoin and Bitconnect - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7BmdRVbNew  Happy to return back the full commission on Bitconnect that I would get and I can do 3% on RegalCoin.",False

On another note, I deposited $250 as a test on my account after his and it went through no problem. I got the bitcoin on the site. However you guys didnt tell me that the exchange isnt live yet! lol So I had to transfer my btc to coinexchange to buy regal and back. I thought that was pretty funny since you guys are getting so big so fast congratulations. But please fix this answer I am waiting for some reasons on why this happened. Before I put in my bags I want to know what happened and how it got corrected.  Thank you Good doing business with you",False

Regalcoin is a crypto currency. This currency is like the Dollar, but it is only available in the digital world. The concept may sound like Bitcoin, and is actually not much different from bitcoin.     Regalcoin is not controlled by institutions or governments Regalcoin that uses the Blockchain database is not controlled by a party, but is so open to the public that it is impossible for someone to forge transactions in Blockchain. All transactions are recorded live, transparent, and spread across multiple servers. Those who want to change or falsify Regalcoin transaction data must hack multiple servers at the same time.     The number of coins is limited Regalcoin supply will only have 27 million coins worldwide, this resembles an economic system based on deflation and with increasing supply coin, Regalcoin prices tend to rise, when demand is high and the number of coins that remain is not increased.   “Initial coin offering”  ICO Pre-sale 5.000.000 REC  START  22nd August 2017 00.01 GMT+8 HONGKONG TIME  END 22nd September 2017 00.01 GMT +8 HONGKONG TIME  Regalcoin Specifications Coin Type POW/POS Hybrid Algorithm X11 Coin Abbreviation REC  Premine 5 Million  Maximum coin supply 27 Million    Time between reward 120 Second Min stake age 15 Minutes Max stake age 360 days POS Yearly interest 10%  Price Rate of Change 0-1 Million USD 0.85 1-2 Million USD 0.88 2-3 Million USD 0.91 3-4 Million USD 0.94 4-5 Million USD 0.97  Github Link : https://github.com/REGALCOINS Explorer : https://regalcoin.info  ICO ENDED   THE RECORD OF WORLDWIDE COIN [/quote]",False

Why did Regalcoin not show up after the ICO? Mobilization of capital without knowing who the owner is individual or unit is not acceptable.  2. Why did Regalcoin change wallet on 17/09/2017? Regalcoin, according to the online community, gave some people everywhere the source of the regalcoin-qt.exe (rpcport=40181 port=40182) purse, so that they would have the motivation to develop a multi-level group.  3. Why ICO finished many days have not opened POW? And when we open up with the x11 algorithm that only uses before 5.000.000REC then the diff will be how much? The community is waiting for that .. and many individuals are speculating. ""Regalcoin will seek to sell 6,000,000 POW and aim to sell 27,000,000 FULL.""

Currently they are disabling the submit button but if you use a modern browser you can right click and inspect the element and change the setting from disabled to enabled (just by removing the disabled word in the html). You can also copy the HTML page but this is the easiest way to enable the submit button. So sometimes it might help you to buy tokens if there are any available.   EDIT: They've now increased the limit to 360,000 per day and they opened it up just now too but I think it may have sold out. The submit button is not disabled, though, so maybe it's a limit per user.  Just found out the third phase is at 16.00 GMT+8   (8am GMT or 9AM London time)",False
