Thank you for your expert comment. We suggest just like you studied Reforestation a bit, you continue & study a little about Carbon Capture Technology. The machines that we have to buy Absorb 135kg Of CO2 per day & cost around $800k each. Our goal which is 100 Tons Of CO2 absorbed every day will need 1000 of such machines. This doesn‚Äôt consider the cost or timelines for converting the absorbed CO2 to Fuel or Diamonds which is also possible but very costly. Mining 1 Block of Bitcoin needs around 20,000 Servers / Miners & around 27 MW Electricity which needs 2,70,000 Solar Panels to implement. Now you can do the mat. Again goal is to plant 10 Million Trees in a year which needs around 28,000 trees to be planted each day. And we haven‚Äôt considered cost of land. The way this works is little underestimated. We are trying to earn Carbon Credits through our Activities & not only plant the trees. You  are welcome to join us in this effort in any way possible to you. And suggestions are welcome at enquiry@greenhashes.org  Regards, Team GreenHashes",False

Thank you for your comment. 1) We are totally aware that Mining using Green Energies/ Renewable Energies is not a new concept. But Responsible Mining can achieve close to Zero Emissions. 2) We are not stopping at limiting our Emissions, we are taking it a step ahead and doing Negative Emissions using Carbon Capture Technology. Then we would be converting Captured CO2 to Diamonds or Alternative Fuels. 3) Reforestation activity will be done with deep study of the local landscape and environmental factors. All these activities will help us in creation of Carbon Credits which we believe is going to be an extremely important Investment Class in coming years. A big difference in other projects & is is that we won‚Äôt be holding on to any Tokens. All remaining GreenHashes will be burnt after the ICO Ends. Only salaries will be paid to the Team Members. I hope we have clarified your doubts. You may give us some feedback or suggestions at enquiry@greenhashes.org  Warm regards, Team GreenHashes",False

You are asking for 1 Billion dollars with nothing more than smiling faces, a simple web page, and a noble idea.    I did look at your webpage and your entire proposal is pretty hollow especially given your fund raising goal.  If you are a potential investor and miner, suggest you find a credible non-profit to buy some tree planting.  e.g. https://onetreeplanted.org/   there are so many known organizations out there.   This proposal looks to be a dev retirement plan. Just consider this-- the amount of carbon they propose to sequester is equivalent to buying 365 acres of US forest land and leaving it to do the photosynthesis thing ....

We are currently looking for strong support from different Governments & Institutional Investors  for tie ups in Research & Development along with starting of the Carbon Capture (Absorption of CO2 from Atmosphere) at different cities & Reforestation.  GreenHashes Project comprises of following key Goals: 1) Responsible Mining 2) Carbon Capture 3) Reforestation 4) Build Platforms for Trading GH with Carbon Credits & Mining Power 5) Build Blockchain for incentivising Green Efforts  We will build ApnaCarbon.com & ApnaMiner.com for Trading GreenHashes with Carbon Credits & Mining Power.  We are working on a new Algorithm called Proof Of Green which will not cause Pollution instead it will create Negative Emissions. Once we are ready we will launch a Mineable Cryptocurrency based on Proof Of Green called Tulsi which will incentivise all Green Efforts. All GreenHashes will be replaced by Tulsi in 2019. All these activities need great deal of funding and hence we are having Crowdsale of GreenHashes (GH) to raise funds for this beautiful project. If we reach our funding goal which is $1 Billion, we can target tie ups with 10 Governments this year & start capturing around 100 Ton of CO2 each day by 2019. GreenHashes is a Token based on Waves Platform. It is represented as GH. Total 300 Million GH are issued. ICO is in progress on Dex Exchange inside Waves Wallet / Client. GreenHashes Tokens can be bought using any of the following 6 Cryptocurrencies: 1) Bitcoin 2) Litecoin 3) Ethereum 4) Bitcoin Cash 5) ZCash 6) Waves There is no limit on the minimum quantity to be purchased. Investors can buy even 0.1 GH. The most unique thing about GreenHashes ICO is that no Tokens will be held by the Founders.
