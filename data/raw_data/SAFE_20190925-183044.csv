Currently there are no suitable implementations of blockchain, that completely covers our needs. But a lot of them are in development stage at the moment.

Lets look at out calculations:  To complete the road map tasks we need $1M-$2M, for development and integration. But our main target is the fast growing clients base, so the main part of the rest funds will be spend to promotion & advertising.  So, if we raise $3M, (- % for bonus program, team bonus, referral program etc.), we will spend on advertising $500k - $1M.  So, in this scenario, we can spend only 15% - 30% directly to advertising purposes. Our clients base will grow difinetly, but not fast.  From other side, if we raise $20M, (- % for bonus program, team bonus, referral program etc.), we will spend on advertising ~$15M.  In this scenario, we can spend 75% directly to advertising & marketing. Our clients base will grow very fast. $15M spent will bring us 1-2 millions of payable users, and all you should know about the token economics - that 1 million of active users need to buy 1 million tokens every month, or 12 million of tokens every year. So, it's not hard to understand, what will happen, if 12M of sold tokens (more then a half in one year!) will be bought back.

The next step is to make it absolutely decentralized. Read for detailed information in our whitepeper, there are a lot of features already implemented.  Quote from: Bayuvivi90 on February 06, 2018, 05:22:47 PM So your project for safe e-mail exchange. Who do you see as your customer, corporate or private clients?  We strongly advise to use our email service for any private information, like (but not limited to):   • Any data, that can bring you a profit, if not stolen;  • Any data, that can save you LIFE, if not stolen;  • Any data you need to save securely in 1 minute;  • Banking or financial data;  • Passwords recovery / accounting details;  • Development communication with secret project/product details;  • Medical cards/reports etc.;  • News agency reports, reportages etc.;  • Scientific researches / discoveries;  • Secret intelligence;  • Just a private life info;  • This list is endless...  Of cause you can use our mail as a main regular box. We understand, that its not so easy to change your current provider - a lot of resources are linked to your current mailbox. But we strongly advise you to think who and how can use your email messages in case you receive them is raw (not protected) form.  More then this, safe.ad is a great place to store any files/archives with fast access in case your current device is broken, lost or stolen. Any life-critical digital assets that you want to store secured. No installation is required, so you'll get your data from any geographical point, from any device, fast, guaranteed and untouched.  So, regarding your question, we think any client can be interested in service we provide.

We believe this is the main proof of our project stability and success.  Thinking about free membership - it's free for the first 3 months.

Quote from: Crypto Girl on February 08, 2018, 01:35:54 PM How could we be sure that using your platform is safer than the other of the same concept project, how would you protect our e-mails and how could we be sure that our e-mails are safe with your platform? What are the special features of your projects aside from it is using the blockchain technology.  The main proof of our platform dependability is our open-source strategy.  1. Any person, without professional knowledge of programming or cryptography can install our client code from sources on their local device. And check that the code we provide online is absolutely the same you got locally.  2. On other side, any professionals can analyze the source code and confirm it is correct and provides a strongest cryptographic protection possible. More that this, we invite all the programmers community to study the client-side code, improve it and make it better!  3. In our road map we have ""Independent security testing for all components of our system""  4. All our encryption methods are based on native (built into OS) libraries, which considerably increases speed, reduces the use of system resources, and ensures that there are no backdoors or errors in the algorithm.  5. We are encrypting any and every piece of data, transferred to our servers. Even messages that come from external email providers, are immediately encrypted before the entrance, and stored encrypted. All personal user data (settings, contacts list, folder names, messages metadata etc.) is also stored encrypted.  6. We use the longest possible keys (256-bit AES, 4096-bit RSA).  Quote from: mahmutyes on February 07, 2018, 05:24:31 PM Hi. Do you use your own or ETH blockchain?  In our project we have at minimum 3 independent fields of development, that required blockchain. It's no so obvious, so lets describe them more detailed:  1. Tokenization. Here all is clear and simple - ERC20 standard ""SAFE"" token, based on Ethereum Main Network. 2. Distributed public keys storage. The are a lot of choices to integrate with, but we think Ethereum will be nice also. 3. Decentralized storage. Currently there are no suitable implementations of blockchain, that completely covers our needs. But a lot of them are in development stage at the moment. So, we believe, that entering the corresponding stage, we will have a lot of choices. Currently, the most promising blockchain is TON, but it is to early to make any decisions.  Quote from: bitbitmax on January 22, 2018, 06:24:22 PM Where are your servers located?  Currently our servers are located in Germany, but we use end-to-end encryption of all the data, and its not really important where to store it.  Quote from: lubing7683 on January 24, 2018, 06:39:36 PM A very interesting project, I applied for a mailbox, but I found it didn't have a password recovery mechanism, and I don't think it's very good.  The main target of our service is to provide maximum security & cryptographic protection to all our user's messages. In this case, the password is the only and the most important key to all the stored information. You should be aware, that all the services, providing a ""password restore"" feature knows your password, and therefore, can access all your data. Our architecture excludes any possibilities of data access without the private key of data owner. Even we, the owners of the service can't access any of your data, including meta data, messages subject, attached files, settings, even folder's names. And we do not afraid that any of the stored information will be stolen or got by third-party, because its just a trash mashup. But we pay a lot of attention to our servers availability, up-time and response speed, until all the data will be decentralized (see our roadmap). And in this case, the members should care of only one thing that is important - their password strength and safety.  This is the same situation like with your cryptocurrency wallet - will you ever lost the password from it or let someone knows it? We think not.  Quote from: wphyolinn on February 06, 2018, 08:50:20 PM How are you planning to make use of funds ?  Great question. Lets look at out calculations:  To complete the road map tasks we need $1M-$2M, for development and integration. But our main target is the fast growing clients base, so the main part of the rest funds will be spend to promotion & advertising.  So, if we raise $3M, (- % for bonus program, team bonus, referral program etc.), we will spend on advertising $500k - $1M.  So, in this scenario, we can spend only 15% - 30% directly to advertising purposes. Our clients base will grow difinetly, but not fast.  From other side, if we raise $20M, (- % for bonus program, team bonus, referral program etc.), we will spend on advertising ~$15M.  In this scenario, we can spend 75% directly to advertising & marketing. Our clients base will grow very fast. $15M spent will bring us 1-2 millions of payable users, and all you should know about the token economics - that 1 million of active users need to buy 1 million tokens every month, or 12 million of tokens every year. So, it's not hard to understand, what will happen, if 12M of tokens sold (more then a half in one year!) will be bought back. The only important addition, is that we give 3 months for free, so this is a involuntary delay.  Turn on your imagination  Quote from: ludmila79 on February 07, 2018, 01:44:25 AM Will this 30% be the same during the whole period of the ICO? Are you going to decrease the bonus percent?  Our tokens bonus shedule:  1 Feb - 28 Feb: 30% discount (Pre-Sale) 1 Mar - 31 Mar: 25% discount 1 Apr - 30 Apr: 20% discount (Sale) 1 May - 31 May: 15% discount 1 Jun - 15 Jun: 10% discount  Quote from: banivur on February 11, 2018, 05:51:39 PM What wallet should I use and when I receive my tokens?  You will receive SAFE tokens in a few seconds after the ETH transfer to our contract. No waiting, without any delay. But the transfers of our tokens are blocked until main sale event finishes.  Any wallet with ""custom tokens"" feature can show your SAFE balance correctly. To add SAFE token you your wallet, use our token contract address: 0x056a2a091a7d2f2624638d1b80d38a39a6dffa69  We are working on adding SAFE token as a default token for the wallets, that support such feature. Stay tuned for the news!  Quote from: romul1972 on February 07, 2018, 01:39:46 PM The modern standard of e-mail communication is hopelessly out of date, you say. What are the main features that makes you different? Security and size of attachments?  According to our whitepaper:    Plus dozens and dozens of additional small tools and improvements. You have better just try to use it...  Quote from: rzevskiy on February 07, 2018, 05:36:25 PM You said that you use end-to-end encryption of all the data. Can you explain what is it?  End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) same as Point-to-Point Encryption (P2PE), is when all the data is encrypted on your device before any transport layers and is decrypted only on the device of a receiver. There is no way (if we are talking about a clear and not infected devices) to decode these blocks at the transport or storage steps.

It is great but hard to believe! Can I really send 2Gb attachments?    Easy. But of cause you can send so large files inside our ecosystem only, current email providers are not progressive enough to accept such sizes. In this case you can send a link to encrypted letter, read our FAQ for details.  Quote from: dorada60 on February 07, 2018, 01:23:14 PM Will you have a technical WP?

Desktop version?  Current realization of our product is completely compatible with all modern web browsers, including mobile versions (WebKit). MacOS & Windows perfectly working with Safe.ad's web client code. So we don't need an urgent need to waste the time for the compiled application for any desktop. But we are planning to make our application as an extention of all the browsers, that support plugins. This will increase the security level of the app.  From other side, we already have iOS application and we are working on Android & Windows Phone versions, because it's much preferable for usability.  Quote from: MakesMe on February 11, 2018, 04:24:47 PM What parts of your service/system will be paid in future? Maybe disclose some additional features.  All the parts will be payable, and there will be no difference between the subscription plans - all the features are available without any limits immediately after signup process (even during the test 3 months). But the prices will be as low, as possible, starting from $1 for a month of subscription. And we will try to provide additional space for $0.25 per 1Gb of disk space. This is really cheap, and we hope there will be no clients, who can't pay $12 yearly for such service.",False
