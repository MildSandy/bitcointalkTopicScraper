Team is focused on changing wider behaviors and incentivizing change across existing platforms. For this to be effected team do not see the need to create a set of tools or services that consumers must engage with to benefit from this. Rather they should be rewarded for existing behavior. MEDIA Protocol has been created to allow brands, publishers and content creators to better understand, and change the way that value flows around content.  As MEDIA Protocol is platform agnostic, the open source approach benefits all parties as it allows audience/consumers to move freely across these different platforms. Interaction, value and reward becomes universal and frictionless. This freedom means consumers are free to do as they wish, and that can lead to more engagement.

MEDIA Protocol provides the data publishers need, the reward creators deserve and the relevance consumers desire.  Transparent We’re freeing creators, distributors, promoters and consumers from third-party intermediaries and hidden algorithms. MEDIA Protocol offers an open transparent ecosystem with an unencumbered, multi-directional exchange of data, value and reward.  Direct MEDIA Protocol dis-intermediates the content relationship between content creators, publishers and consumers, so each maintains control and is valued and rewarded for their part.  Sustainable With MEDIA Protocol, there is no additional ‘toll’ levied on creators or publishers, and control is maintained by each actor. Content creators and publishers are directly rewarded for the content they create and push, incentivising each, and consumers are rewarded for the personal preference data they generate.  Disruptive Traditionally, an intermediary, such as a newspaper or content distribution platform, sits between and disproportionately benefits from the relationship between creators, publishers and consumers. MEDIA Protocol disrupts this paradigm – providing a scalable economic foundation that ensures directness, transparency and security.

Thanks so much for the comment on MEDIA Protocol.  Just to shine a light on your add regarding the consensus algorithm, given the current, but temporary, constraints around Ethereum cost and scalability, MEDIA proposes a hybrid on-chain and off-chain solution, similar to that being operated by Kin and by UnikoinGold.  The off-chain service will expose a subset of the Ethereum RPC JSON API, with the hosting costs absorbed by MEDIA Protocol, and will regularly (at least daily) settle with the Ethereum blockchain.  If you're interested in knowing more, take a look at page 27 and 28 of the whitepaper, it will surely offer you an in-depth explanation of the protocol's mechanics.
