The regulations being modified in China and Singapore are examples. Therefore; and in order to comply to the ongoing changes; we are adapting our project to avoid possible legal problems.

Thanks for asking,  1) Why do not you update the topic of this thread?  We do not yet have any staff to take care of PR.  You know our ICO didn't reach the minimum, so we refunded most of the investors.  The business continued funded privately and by the founders.  We will start hiring for PR and marketing in the near future, so this thread will get the attention that it must have.  So far our efforts and money have been focused on getting our technology and legal status right.    2) Why do not you publish detailed information about the tokensale?  It is not a tokensale or ICO.  It is our ongoing operating business.  There is no minimum or maximum.  Neither there is a time deadline.  Just as Tether issues more tokens when more people buy dollars, we will issue more gold tokens when our investors buy more gold.  As long as the business goes on, we will sel gold tokens for the market price of 30 grams of gold plus our fees, and we will buy them back at the market price flat.  3) Have you forgotten about hunters? Or did I miss the promised lottery?  Not at all!  We will have the lottery for the bounty hunters that helped with the ICO a year ago.  Again, it is a question of resources and hiring the personnel that can work on it.  4) Do you start a new bounty campaign? No.  As said, this is an ongoing business.

What about 2% above and below what Orocrypt would pay for a 100g bar? I.e a 4% spread/profit.  & What if the minimum gold token size was 1 gram but the minimum amount of gold tokens you needed for physical delivery/withdrawal was 100 + KYC (Example: Orocrypt buys 10, 100g bars and can now sell & buy back 1000 '1 gram gold tokens' backed by physical gold based on the current price of 100g bars - That way no 1 gram physical bars with a huge mark-up are purchased only 100g and up.)  Regards fractional banking. I'm not suggesting 1% gold reserves. I'm suggesting 99/100% gold reserves & 1% of that total value in ETH reserves. So if you have sold 100kg worth of physical vaulted gold, so 100 000 gold tokens on the market, the ETH contract should have at least $40 000 worth of ETH so that 1% of the gold tokens can be redeemed for ETH on a daily basis. In the event more people wanted to exchange their gold tokens for ETH, Orocrypt would sell more of their fully backed physical on the market, buy ETH with the proceeds and replenish the smart contract.  Regards dividends, I'm not familiar with the various laws surrounding them but I know many cryptos offer/will offer it in some form such as VSL, WAGR, TKN and the ones listed here https://www.investitin.com/cryptocurrency-dividends/ Perhaps one of those approaches would be a feasible & legal method for Orocrypt.  Regards KYC, pretty difficult, what if Orocrypt or a trust was the owner of the gold (for this particular product offering) with some measures put in place that would require the gold to be sold and ETH bought & sent to the smart contract in the event of a bankruptcy/other. That way the token holders are just owners of digital tokens, no bad actors could actually get physical gold because they have to pass KYC and have at least 100 1 gram gold tokens to get delivery.  (The OGC one gram backed token will be redeemable for physical & I 'believe' will be tradable on regular exchanges, ie the digital token can be bought and sold without KYC. (I don't like their model because their token issuance is limited, so the tokens will be valued at 'Gold + large speculative/volatile premium, like XAURUM which has some small gold backing but most of the token value is speculative & volatile which defeats the point.) Xaurum is also traded on regular exchanges, no KYC and there is a method to redeem the underlying physical I believe. Hopefully one of those offerings is using a legal solution to the problem that can be emulated.)",False

We will be part of it because if the ICO fails to reach the minimum, we will finance the company through traditional financing venues, and Orocrypt will continue with its plans.  We have Andrey Zamovskiy, CEO of Ambisafe and Oleksii Matiiasevych as advisers.  These are well known in the community. You can google each one of us to see our background.  Our company registry is available to the public.  We are not using nominees for directors or shareholders.  We have a corporate account in Orocrypt's name at Paysera in Lithuania, an e-payments intitution regulated by the Central Bank of Lithuania.  In order to open a corporate account in Orocrypt's name we had to provide extensive information about the founders.  Notarized copies of passports, company registration, etc.  We are using an e-payments institution because their fees are 2 euros per transfer instead of 40 (regular bank fees) and they are part of SEPA.  If anyone has tried to open a corporate account at a bank or an electronic money institution he/she will know that they go through an intense KYC process.   Furthermore, we are publishing a detailed roadmap shortly.  If you can suggest which other information we can submit, we would be very grateful.  The founders have the view that digitised assets will grow and present many opportunities.  Profitable opportunities.  This is why we are here.  Perhaps we are not doing the best job communicating our vision and our plans, therefore we would welcome advice.  Thanks!",False

Thanks for your comments.  They allow us to present our point of view.  To clarify your comment about dividends, we are only not committing at this point to declare dividends.  That doesn't mean that they may never be paid.  Our perspective is that if the company in one year from now, has one million in profits and there is an investment opportunity that may give 500,000 in future profits, our owners would be better off by not receiving dividends and would benefit a lot more from the increase of the company value by investing the million in the new deal. On top, dividends are taxed as ordinary income in most jurisdictions, whilst capital gains from selling tokens held long term pay taxes at a much lower rate.  I don't understand what you mean we burn $2.459.000 dollars and that token holders have basically nothing.  Please remember that we are euro based, not dollar based.  Also please look at our proforma balance sheet, also in our prospectus.  It shows that after the ICO, the company will keep most of the 4.5 mm in cash, bitcoin, ether and gold.  Our expected first year expenses are approximately 1.2mm equivalent to 100,000 a month.  Lets say that the gold-token we will sell in September is a flop.  Then the silver token we will sell in October is another flop, and the un-mined gold token for December is also a flop.  We would probably at that point stop operations and close the business after six months.  If we had only spent 600 thousand during those six months, and had zero profits, there would be 3.9 million euros left that would belong to the owners.  Tokens outstanding would be 655000 (the founders only have 155,000 tokens with the rest accrued over three years).  Dividing 3.9 million euros into 655,000 tokens (500,000 ICO +155,000 founders) leaves a value to be returned to each token of 5.95 euros.  So under that scenario, each token owner would lose 3.05 euros if the company fails to make one cent during its first six months and decides to close.  Yes, any investment in a startup is very risky.  Most startups do not make it past their first year, and we have been very open about it. An investment in the company is risky!  But to say that investors have nothing is incorrect.  Now, add the managing team value.  That is very important.  Remember what happened to Apple when Steve Jobs went back?.  For instance, Digix is valuing their team at approximately 30 million dollars (136 million in eth in their wallet and a total value of market capitalisation of 167 million}.  When you are investing in Orocrypt you are also getting the managing team.  A group of experienced and successful individuals.  Investors in the company are getting the team's capacity to generate profits, to find profitable investments and to manage Orocrypt very well.   Finally, we do hope to succeed in our ICO.  If we do not, then Orocrypt will get financing from traditional sources and therefore continue with its plans.  So come what may, expect to see our gold-token in September!  Many thanks!",False

If you look at the top 12 by capitalisation, 3 are exclusively focused on privacy, XMR, DASH & ZEC. In their Metropolis update, ETH will introduce Zk-SNARKs for privacy (which ETC can adopt too.)

The majority of ICO's these days are incorporating in Crypto Valley, Zug, Switzerland, still always ranked in the top 3 jurisdictions for privacy.  You have incorporated in Panama, not in anyone's top 10 AFAIK, you require KYC from investors & customers of your main product. So there's not much USP for investors or customers vs. using/investing in existing gold holding services. I know you have said you are looking at a gold token product which only requires KYC if you claim the physical which is great but to extend that idea further you could...  Through the use of a price oracle, create a smart contract that If you send ETH to the contract it sends you back 1 gram gold tokens at spot +2%. If you send gold tokens to the smart contract it gives you back ETH at spot -2%.  The contract is funded with enough ETH to cover 1% of outstanding gold tokens & replenished if needed every 24 hours.  50% of the fees charged above/below spot are sent to another smart contract and distributed to ORO token holders.  - The 1 gram gold tokens will likely trade on exchanges within a tighter range than the +-2% - In the event of an Orocrypt bankruptcy token holders can claim gold directly from the vault with a minimum of 30 grams & with KYC.  That way customers have a private gold product they can access simply by sending ETH to a smart contract & investors have a private share that provides consistent returns from 50% of fees regardless of whether the 10x voting shares 'think' they have a more profitable use than dividends for the remaining revenue.",False

If you charge 2% you would be losing money.  KYC.  If you do not have a solid KYC process you will not be able to have fiat currency bank accounts or be able to buy gold from reputable providers, or store it at reputable vaults. Regarding dividends, it is illegal in most jurisdictions to distribute dividends without KYC and investor registration.   Fractional banking.  1% in daily reserves is too little.

Class A shares have 1 vote per share while class B shares have 10 votes per share. Therefore the total number of votes are 1 x 845118 + 10 x 266882 = 3513938, of which 10 x 266882/3513938 = 75.95% is the class B voting percentage. I made a mistake in my previous calculation.  So in actual fact the number of shares being offered for sale (500000) only have a 14.23% vote.  I just cannot see the reason for the different classes as the 500000 shares on sale have such small say in the company. In fact the class A shares which represent ~76% of the total number of shares have a combined ~24% (including the allocation to treasury, rewards, payments for services and employees participation) say in the direction of the company.

It is not a gesture.  There are several reasons for the founders shares having 10x1 voting and the Class A 1x1 vote. 1.In case of one or two investors buying the entire ICO offer, they could take over the management and control, which the founders are not prepared to do at this time. 2. The founders do not necessarily all will vote as one block.  For instance, if in three years there is an offer to buy the company at 500 euros per share and half the founders do not agree, then the 45% Class A together with the half that agree could accept the offer.  The same with any other time where a shareholders vote is required and the class B shareholders vote is split. 3. Class B shares cannot be sold or transferred.  Only held by the Founder who owns them.  If the Founder wishes to sell or give them, they are automatically converted to Class A.  If the Company is sold, as in the above example, then there would only be non voting shares. 4.  Non-voting shares are less valuable.  If in the future there is a new round of financing, the new investors may require the issuance of a new class of voting shares.  This new class would be more valuable than Class A shares.  If subsequently the Company is sold, the new buyers may not be interested in any of the Class A shares. 5.  The two largest investors with over 56 000  Class A shares, will each have the right to a Board seat.  This gives considerable power in the affairs of the company and allows them to contribute towards the growth and success of the business.  The founders together with the ICO investors have all equal rights apart from voting rights.  If the company declares a dividend or is acquired, both classes A and B will receive the same amount.  Hopefully, this clarifies the offering share structure.",False
