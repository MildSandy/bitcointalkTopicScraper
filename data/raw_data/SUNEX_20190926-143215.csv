BUT WHY..... Generating electricity from fossil fuels is the number one cause of climate change. And this matters. Trust me, I'm a climate change scientist.   Solar power is THE solution but it is too expensive or impractical for most people to access. And this is unfortunate because optimized solar energy systems can earn the owner a 10% annual return.  Introducing you to Sun Exchange – monetizing sunshine  WHAT IS IT..... Sun Exchange is a marketplace where anyone can purchase and then lease solar panels that get installed in the sunniest places on Earth. The sunniest places on Earth often happen to be the least developed regions of the planet with the greatest need for clean and affordable electricity. So these are places that are great for your pocket, people and the planet.   To make going solar accesible to everyone, we’ve broken solar panel ownership down to a single solar cell. It used to take over £10k and days of research to go solar…. Now it takes less than £10 and a couple of clicks   Your solar cells go on to power businesses and communities of your choice that get to benefit from solar with no upfront costs.  On average, the users of Sun Exchange solar power plants enjoy >10% savings compared on existing energy costs, and considerable carbon reductions. As they consume electricity from your solar cells, their pre-paid meter credits your Sun Exchange account with crypto-currency which you can withdraw into your local currency at any time. Our useage of blockchain payments systems enables you to directly own and earn form solar panels located around the globe     The combination of micro-leasing and digital currency has created a quantum leap in what is possible with solar power. The result is that Sun-Exchange is effectivly streaming monetized African sunshine around the world.    Sun Exchange also has it's own rewards currency - SUNEX. Sun Exchange users earn SUNEX as they complete tasks to build a socially impactful solar portfolio. The more SUNEX accumulated, the greater the discounts and bonus lease payments received. SUNEX can be pre-bought here.  HOW FAR ALONG IS IT.... In March 2016, Sun Exchange built the first crypto-currency funded solar project in history, and has now grown to over 5000 members across 70 countries who have made 5 commerical scale solar power plants totalling 200kW happen in South Africa, now powering schools, wildlife reserves, NGOs and factories",True
