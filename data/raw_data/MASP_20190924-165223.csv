To start with, we have slightly modified the website to set a business-oriented course. Now it comprises more details on our cooperation with Rapidgator, system advantages and use cases. We’ve also extended the FAQ section. Check it out 🙂  Now that we’re past the busy distribution time and listing bustle, we can focus on the three main directions.  1) As you know, we got down to the MASPC blockchain. The engine we stopped at is the latest version of Graphene, the one used by Bitshares and Steemit. We are presently testing its compatibility with our system.  2) We concentrate on the ‘Exchange — Host’ part and the baseline software for it. If you are wondering how we can test its interoperability with the Miner software, the answer is simple: with the help of the blockchain API mockup.  3) The UI prototyping of the Client software is in progress. Our team is currently enhancing the UX performing numerous split tests with the target groups. The most challenging thing here is to keep it intuitive and concise while providing all the options available (types of encryption, number of chunks, multiple hosts, opting for proxies, to name just a few). Here come some UI drafts for you to take a look:       Last but not least, we are currently on the lookout for the talented blockchain and JS engineers to work with (the Job Openings section will be added on the website soon).",False

We'll deliver basic functionality if we raise soft cap (or even 85% of it) and there's going to be much more depending on how much we raise.  Judging from the previous reproaches, it's easier to copy and paste the corresponding passage from the White Paper here, so pardon for the lengthy quote below:  8.2 Projected expenses $25M  — Massive expansion including engagement of the largest hosting providers  $35M — Integration with third-party cryptocurrency services — Elaborating customer software for mobile platforms (Android, iOS) — Creating a fund to finance intense promotion and active engagement of new participants — Signing contracts with the largest record labels and film studios as well as independent artists so that audio and video content is delivered to Market.space customers at lower prices — Developing a subsystem for interaction with the record companies and film studios (statistics and analysis system) — An interface for artists/performers to join thematic groups depending on the content, which would facilitate the search for customers and augment the target audience for artists — Engagement of music and film critics (for independent artists) — Legal support — Operational costs (for instance, management)  $50M — Investment fund for integration of third party services and/or projects into Market. space system — Integration of the major equipment vendors of “smart city” intellectual services into Market.space. Priority is given to public safety (e. g. video surveillance), financial transactions, tourism, real estate.    If we don't reach even 85% of soft cap, we're going to issue refunds or extend the token sale period - if the Community agrees. We set a very tight timeline for the fundraising at first, and there was no pre-sale, so we have to make up for it now.  In this article you may find more details on the new strategy we've decided to follow when we saw the initial one doesn't work: https://medium.com/@Market_space_/four-weeks-of-the-ico-passed-what-now-76bf17d674d5  To put it short, we now focus on working with private investors and funds, and the first big deal ($4M) has been recently finalized.

It’s been more than four weeks since the start of the ICO, and we’ve raised nearly $3.2M. “Not so bad” indeed, but we’ll hardly reach $15M soft cap moving at such a pace.  We had to review our action plan. It was decided to steer a course for B2B orientation and focus on working with private investors and funds who expressed interest in our project. Things being what they are, we need more time than is left till the end of the ICO in order to proceed with rebranding and formalize the agreements. Thus our team had to extend the token sale period till June 30. No need to say, it was a hard decision, as we take to heart all the promises given to our Community. We’d love to thank you, Market.space supporters, for your loyalty and patience.   Ivan Kurnavin appointed as Market.space COO From now on, Ivan will take over business operations, overseeing branding strategy and partnerships. We congratulate Ivan on his designation and wish him good luck with his new responsibilities. His welcoming word to Market.space Community can be found here.  Media Coverage The professional approach to data storage we preach has been covered by Bitcoin Magazine. Feel free to check the article here. The last week also brought us a review by Legit Crypto.

Also we may consider on extending of the ICO period.  Voting to launch the project anyway or to refund the participants? Or do you mean something else? Is a refund and not launching the project a possibility if the soft cap is not reached, or in other terms, what is the soft cap actually for?  I mean voting for either extention of ICO period to reach the soft cap or refund. Launching of the project is the most important thing.

So what has been happening on the market of late and what is the coming time hold in store for the cryptos?  One of the pre-dominant features of the cryptocurrencies market is its volatility — some of the highest, as compared to other finance spheres. This is mainly due to the relative novelty of the topic itself — cryptocurrencies are a different kind of financial instruments than are assets, currencies, and collectibles all at the same time. Arising from a sphere that is initially not finance, they have little connection and codependency with the good old global financial system. That is another factor that makes the market unstable.  We’ve seen Bitcoin rise and fall dramatically over the recent years. But the global value of this most established cryptocurrency is only about 43 billion dollars. If Bitcoin is to crash totally, it will have more of a social impact than financial. Sure, some people will lose money, others might go to jail, but if or when this bubble pops, nothing global like the transatlantic crisis after the fall of CDOs in 2007–2008 will take place. So far. Steps influential governments take to regulate cryptocurrencies are yet still either cautious or prohibiting. All these factors stand as reasons why the events on the crypto market are usually tumultuous and at a scale that would devastate the global economy if they were to happen to established financial structures.  Let’s look at some numbers. At the beginning of 2017, the estimated volume of the global cryptomarket was about $18B, with Bitcoin having an 87% share in this. By the beginning of 2018, this changed to almost $600B, which is more than 3000% rise. Bitcoin’s piece of the pie reduced to 37% in June 2017 and then went slightly up again in December. We could definitely say that 2017 has been a year for altcoins.  So far the pattern is, that all the major coins, such as Ether, Cardano, Litecoin, Monero and some others are following Bitcoin in their rises and falls, with Monero having a slightly more independent graph. But this demonstrates that although there’s very little interdependency between cryptocurrencies and other global financial instruments so the crash of one will have little effect on others, cryptocurrencies themselves are extremely correlated. Which is not a good sign for them.  When asked about the future of Bitcoin and other existing cryptocurrencies, most analysts are skeptical. Goldman Sachs’ Steve Strongin predicts most cryptocurrencies falling to zero, not unlike dotcom bubble of the late 90s. Nouriel Robini, the economist who predicted the 2008 crisis well ahead, calls Bitcoin ‘the mother of all bubbles’. Few analysts deny though, that even if cryptocurrency market were to collapse, there will emerge at least a few key players, like Google and Amazon were born from the dotcom crash, but fully transformed. Can we be looking at such players now? Bitcoin is the pioneer and all pioneers have technical limitations, so does BTC, with its low transaction rate and high cost, and low emission cap. Ether seems to have more potential, being a utility token at the same time and having quite a few co-dependent projects which are built upon it. Telegram’s TON has been announced and Telegram’s ICO has already beat the current ICO record by a several times, and TON’s plans sound very ambitions, this seems to be the coin that may just pose an alternative for existing exchange systems, such as Visa and Mastercard.  Many view this as exciting news but also as a potential threat. Cryptomarket is developing much faster than adjustments in government regulations are introduced. Incoming of such a player is referred by many as a potential cause for uncontrolled trade, rise of black markets and grand-scale money laundering. Some even speculate that this was the actual cause behind Telegram’s ban in Russia.  However, as we have seen of late, governments are starting to turn a more friendly face towards cryptocurrencies, with South Korea leading the way in introducing more crypto-friendly policies. And even though Bitcoin has been destined to fall and crash by all and sundry in the world of business analytics, it has fallen and crashed and climbed back up and is still standing. Still the trend for altcoins eating away at the market cap of the veterans like BTC and ETH is outlined quite clearly.",False

What Now?  Market.space Launching A New Strategy  It’s been four weeks since the start of the ICO. We’ve raised more than $3.2M so far with your help. Well done, you may note, but trivial calculations would suffice to say that we can hardly reach $15M soft cap moving at such a pace. We’ve recently heard quite a lot of concerns voiced as to the actions course in case we don’t reach soft cap. It’s high time we threw light on the new course of action we’re offering to our Community.  What went wrong? We believe the main error was to jump straight to the token sale, omitting the private pre-sale round which 90% of projects do, and thus a whole bunch of work with private investors. The market is generally benevolent — we see that from the website analytics, community reactions and the feedback the project meets at the premier blockchain and crypto events.  We should have allocated more time for the token sale period. As we now see from the experiences of other projects (we mean large-scale ones, not these where $1M would suffice), more time is objectively required.  What next? We are going to make up for this oversight and concentrate on cooperation with private investors and funds. We are inspired to see the interest already expressed by some of them, but we’ll need more time than the 2 weeks left in order to go through the due diligence and seal the agreements with them.  We would like to extend the ICO period for 5 more weeks during which we’ll be constantly keeping you updated on our progress.  What about my contribution? It would be logical to assume that the aim of it was supporting our crusade for the new, professional data storage and getting hold of our tokens. We understand that it may look to you that things have got out of hand. We also understand that waiting 5 more weeks is quite a long time.  The truth is that we are simply performing a paradigm shift to reach our common goal. We are not going to disappear in the thin air — here the reputation of Rapidgator as an established file hosting company along with the good names of our team members are at stake. Therefore we ask for your patience and loyalty.  So will I get MASP tokens? Absolutely! But later than you (and we) initially expected. Why not give you the tokens during the two weeks after May 27th? Because we won’t be able to reward our further supporters with these tokens then. That’s because we chose a model without a fixed supply. We would need to issue tokens again, and that would be another token, not MASP. Exchanging would be rather a confusing process for quite a lot of our clients, we believe.  What about Bounty participants? The same goes for our Bounty participants. The more funds we raise, the bigger your stakes (and thus the amount of tokens you get) will be. We leave it up to you whether to quit our Bounty program on May 27th and give us some time to increase the weight of your stakes, or keep supporting us and earn more stakes.  https://medium.com/@Market_space_/four-weeks-of-the-ico-passed-what-now-76bf17d674d5",False

If you take other decentralized storage projects like Sia, Storj, Geens, the main difference is that we engage hosting professionals while they rely on ordinary PCs, laptops or other devices that are not made for 24/7 work and high load.

It goes without saying that renting disc space from the inveterate hosts instead of amateurs reduces the risks that are inevitably associated with the consumer devices.  If we take power efficiency which is calculated as storage volume to electricity consumption ratio, the equipment used by hosting professionals proves far more efficient than consumer devices (see the table below).    To weigh up the carbon footprints, we took an average HDD with capacity equaling to 1 TB. A brand new personal computer might have up to 4 such HDDs, although it’s not the case for the vast majority of PCs. Generally, they have only one HDD (maximum two) HDDs. However, we give consumer devices a head start in this example taking the number of HDDs equaling to four. At the same time, a hosting server normally contains up to 30 HDDs, but let’s take a modest one with 12 HDDs.  The power of PC is around 300 Wh; for hosting server it makes nearly 500 Wh. I want to make a caveat that these are the ballpark figures I’ve got from our technical team, so they reflect the big picture, but if you want to find exceptions, you definitely will.  As we are looking at decentralized storage systems, we also take into account that the PC of a system participant must work all day long (yes, that’s what is meant by an uninterrupted service!). So the monthly use of energy will total to 300 Wh * 24h * 30d = 216 kW (for all the 4 HDDs. That is 54 kW per HDD).  For hosting server monthly energy consumption makes 500 Wh * 24h * 30d = 360 kW. And that is for 12 HDDs, or 30 kW per HDD. Given that 1 kW costs about $0.12 in the USA (that’s also an average, see the caveat above), we get the total costs of energy per month, which are then divided into 4 and 12 correspondingly.  Overall, the energy consumption per HDD and consequently the cost of storing 1 terabyte speak in favor of the professional hosting equipment. As we’ve arrived at this conclusion, This cost effectiveness means much more than , but also takes less energy for storing the same amount of data.  https://medium.com/@Market_space_/professional-web-hosts-vs-consumer-devices-b749d88f9080",False

What makes Market.space stand out from the crowd is our p4p model – “professionals for professionals”  Now let me highlight our competitive advantages: Engagement of experienced hosts and data centers means that clients won’t face problems with data access or security which occur when amateurs store data on consumer devices (that’s actually the case for decentralized storage services). In fact, consumer devices are not adjusted to high load and 24/7 work. The system will function as a marketplace. The unlimited number of customers will get access to professional hosts who have unused capacities and want to utilize them. This will result in the best suitable pricing. Market.space won’t impose any fixed packages or pricing, nor will transaction fees be charged (the system will be built on its own blockchain).  Let’s assume that a host new to the system wants to store some data free of charge just to get the rate. In Market.space he/she is free to do that (benefits for the customer are obvious) while they’d be restricted by the pricing in other systems (even if the charge is not high, like in Sia or Storj, it’s still fixed).  Direct distribution of content functionality is embedded in Market.space architecture. In other decentralized storage systems it may be feasible too, but they’d either need centralization for it or some additional apps.",False

There is always a threat of hack attack. Cybercrime is evolving along with technologies.  Why do we think Market.space is going to be a way more secure and reliable than analogous services? Market.space works as an aggregator of professional hosting providers. Your file is split into chuncks in the memory of customer's device, each chunk is encrypted. Then the file (in the form of encrypted chunks) is sent to the servers of a professional host. You may also use proxies, by the way.  Even if someone hacks your host and locates the chunks, they'll find undecipharable encrypted pieces of something they can't decrypt. If you don't provide the private key to anyone who shouldn't have access, you can be sure the file is absolutely safe.  Another point is that professional hosts take care about uptime and redundancy, so it's more reliable than storing your data on consumer devices, but I don't want to digress.",False
