The 100 million was just a (marketing) number and it reflected only the value of the funds from the Envion ICO at the very peak of the cryptomarkets in January 2018. In reality around USD 50-60 million was immediately converted to FIAT and kept in banks in Liechtenstein, thanks to Woestmann. The remaining crypto was never transferred to Envion (thanks to Michael Luckow, Trado GmbH), who kept the crypto as hostage for no obvious reasons known to the public. This is highly criminal and will be subject of courts in Germany.   -------------------------------------------------------- In total, Envion had maybe around USD 80 million. Now there is around USD 43 million in banks and the outstanding amount of (stolen) crypto by Luckow.  That's around USD 50 million left for a possible refund. --------------------------------------------------------   The courts in Germany and the liquidator in Switzerland are now the once who will bring more light into the case, after FINMA has reported and closed the probe. Another (not so) small detail: The former member of board Cyrill Staeger (LinkedIn: https://ch.linkedin.com/in/cyrill-a-st%C3%A4ger-71357073) took for himself around half Million out of the bank on his very last official day.

The regulator (Finma) did not finish the investigation. What we have on the table is a decision of a swiss court to liquidate because of missing auditors. Liquidation is not a ""refund"". What the process (simplified) includes is handle all liabilities before the company gets closed. When it comes to identifying all liabilities, it gets pretty complex and different stances are possible. You could also argue that the contract says in the case of liquidation the token holder gets nothing -> no liability there -> most of the money to Aubel/MW. But would that make sense? The good news is that common sense is also applied. In our view the distribution of leftover assets to token holders (in case of liquidation that includes the give-up of the project) is reasonable, fairest and has a very strong chain of reasoning. Like stated before all has to be decide by the liquidator and all could still change with the decision of Finma at the end of their investigation.  Michael: I do not know which ""normally"" you mean but please remember, that liquidation does not mean any refund in the first place. It could mean many things and hopefully tokenholders will get money and if you paid money for your tokens beforehand you could kind of call the fact of getting money a ""refund"" but please be careful with the word while discussing the liquidation. ""Refund"" or ""money back"" is not really directly what is on the table. I do not want to scare you as I believe there will be a fair solution but in the worst case scenario MW/Aubel find a way to make happen what is written in the contract: ""It is expected the Tokens qualify as a bond instrument (Anleihensobligation). Further, the Tokens carry no right to receive any dividend nor any liquidation proceeds in case that the Company will be liquidated for any reason."" - I asked some lawyers about this and they assured me that it is not realistic that it gets decided in a way that token holders / investors do not get anything but keep in mind that liquidation means giving the decision in the hand of someone totally new whos first contact might be MW.

It is important to conceptually seperate ico investors and token holders when looking on the situation. For the liquidation we have at the moment the ico investors should not be relevant. Relevant should be: who has the rights? As the token was created to make those rights transferable by transfering the token all rights are usually at the token holder. Not every ico investor is still a token holder and not every token holder is an ico investor.  The easiest way to stay up to date concerning how to get money as a token holder is to visit https://envion-founders.org/liquidation/ - we might also install a newsletter there to make it even easier.  We are speaking to many lawyers who are deeply into the topic and sending the money to those who have the rights is the only thing that makes sense. In case you have bought the right to participate in all mining profits and the company messes is up and uses the money that is exclusively bound to your rights for anything else then giving it to you as the person who has the right to get all profits out of the money that is bound to those rights, you would suffer wrong. Every court would most likely see it that way. Based on the current situation we are confident that in case of the decided liquidation the owners of the rights will get the money that is left after liquidation. This is not exactly written anywhere but this is the only thing that makes sense and legally and morally. Do not forget your very strong rights that the prospectus gave you!   Please do not get confused of the ""90%"" that MW communicates. Whatever he means by that could not mean you get 0,9 USD per token. Some people asked us whether they should buy until 0,9 USD which shows us that there is confusion. The amount paid per token might be much higher than the price at exchanges at the moment but we do not expect it to be 0,9 USD per token as the total amount of tokens and the total amount of money would have to change a lot from that what MW gave in the past. t.me/EnvionFounders/102911   We do not speak of returning money to any buyer but giving money to people that hold rights. And the right that is usually behind one token is always the same. That is why everyone has to get the same amount for the same ""amount of rights"". As discussed before while and after the ICO it would be the same in case of paying out mining profits: the amount is always based on the number of rights, not the amount paid.",False

Might also be of some interest for investors:  Quote TRADO GmbH, Michael LUCKOW, and the Swiss ENVION AG have been represented by the Berlin law firm DWF. TRADO and/or LUCKOW have transferred many millions from the ENVION ICO to their own wallets and bank accounts. Most of ICO proceeds were exchanged for FIAT during the good times of the cryptocurrencies. According to various information in the files at the court and public prosecutor’s office, Michael LUCKOW and/or his TRADO GmbH are said to have received between EUR 10 and 17 million illegally. Although LUCKOW argues in court that TRADO also provided corresponding services for ENVION AG, in view of the non-existing assets and a never commenced business, payments in the millions cannot be justified before any judge in the world.

As we manage several farms and use our inhouse software (which basically puts those farms on autopilot), we know, that it mostly comes down to reliable software to keep maintainance interaction low.

Many of them with discounts. At a price of an average of 80 cents, a volume of $ 68 million is expected. The difference between deposits and existing values is about $ 8 million. Accordingly, investors can assume that a large part of their deposits still exists. That's the good news.  The bad thing is that there are even more tokens whose legal claims are unclear. Investor-signed tokens should include 5 percent of Envion itself, 10 percent compensation to founders, and 2 percent advertising to Blogger and others. Another 12.6 million tokens were placed as part of a pre-sale with larger discounts. The management accuses the founders of having created additional tokens without authorization. It is undisputed: Thanks to favorable prices, values of around 100 million dollars were temporarily available.  Now threatens liquidation  The PWC and BDP auditors both refused to step in as auditors of Envion because they did not have access to ICO data. Without data, the suspicion of fraudulent manipulation can not be dispelled. The founders confirm that they have retained data to prevent hostile takeover by senior management.  Without auditors, there is an organ deficiency. So the placement of the tokens would only be allowed with a banking license. The suspicion of a missing permit is also the reason why Finma has intervened. Now there are three options: First, obtain a banking license, which is unrealistic, simply because of the lengthy procedure. Secondly, use an auditors - the necessary solution to the blockade, however, does not stand out. And third, the liquidation.  Due to the lack of organs, the Zug Commercial Register Office has already made representations to the cantonal court Zug. The court set Envion a deadline to appoint an auditor. This expired on September 13th. The court will soon decide on the liquidation. According to authorities, this is a formality if no solution has been found. If another four-week deadline expires unused, the Konkursamt Zug is charged with liquidating Envion AG.

ABO+05:39:00 GMT+0800 (PHT)  Envion-Gründer werfen dem Geschäftsführer unredliche Absichten vor  Die Gründer des Blockchain-Start-ups Envion sagen, der Geschäftsführer habe versucht, die Anleger um ihr Geld zu prellen. Dieser widerspricht.  Michael Luckow möchte das Blockchain-Start-up Envion vor dem Konkurs bewahren. Foto: Thomas Egli  Bernhard Kislig  Der Fall um Envion mit Sitz in Zug ist ein prominentes Beispiel, das zeigt, was bei Start-ups in der noch jungen Blockchain-Technologie alles schiefgehen kann. Anfang Jahr legte Envion einen Start hin, von dem andere Jungunternehmen nur träumen können: Bis Mitte Januar investierten Anleger innerhalb eines Monats 100 Millionen Dollar, obwohl nicht mehr als eine Geschäftsidee vorhanden war. Bis damals war es weltweit erst fünf Unternehmen gelungen, in einem Initial Coin Offering (ICO) mehr Kapital aufzunehmen.  Envion wollte Container produzieren, die mit leistungsstarken Rechnern ausgerüstet nahe bei Stromkraftwerken platziert werden. Dort sollten sie mit überschüssiger Energie kostengünstig Kryptowährungen wie Bit-coin «schürfen». Doch das Unternehmen ist nie operativ tätig geworden. Weltweit bangen mehr als 30000 Investoren um Ersparnisse, die sie einbezahlt haben.  Blockierte Geschäfte  Was die Idee taugt, konnte Envion nie beweisen, da ein interner Konflikt das Geschäft von Beginn an lahmlegte. Es kam zu Prozessen, einer feindlichen Übernahme, Morddrohungen und Einbrüchen. Auf der einen Seite steht Michael Luckow. Der schlaksige und meist leger gekleidete Zweimetermann vertritt die Gründergruppe, die über das technische Know-how der Umsetzung verfügt. Auf der anderen Seite ist Matthias Woestmann. Der ehemalige ARD-Korrespondent wurde von den Gründern zum Geschäftsführer und Verwaltungsratspräsidenten ernannt. Er tritt elegant auf, ist rhetorisch versiert und in der Energiebranche bestens vernetzt. Er sollte – so die Idee der Gründer – Envion gegen aussen ein Gesicht geben, während die Gründer das operative Geschäft umsetzen. Dafür erhielt Woestmann viel Einfluss: Um in der turbulenten Startphase unbürokratisch handeln zu können, durfte er den Aktienanteil der Gründer von 81 Prozent an Envion treuhänderisch verwalten.  Der Streit beginnt mit einer Lappalie, wie beide Seiten heute unisono feststellen: Luckow hat bei einer China-Reise mit Herstellern einen zusätzlichen Termin vereinbart, von dem Woestmann nichts wusste. Woestmann reiste mit dem bereits gebuchten Flug allein und verärgert zurück nach Deutschland. Das war Mitte Januar, nur wenige Tage nach dem ICO. Ab diesem Moment ist das Vertrauensverhältnis zwischen Gründern und Geschäftsleitung angeschlagen.  Am 27. Januar folgt ein Paukenschlag: Am Ende einer Sitzung erwähnt Woestmann, dass er die Zahl der Aktien des Unternehmens erhöht hat. Mit diesem Schachzug werden die Aktien der Gründer derart verwässert, dass ihr Anteil von 81 auf 31 Prozent sinkt. Die Mehrheit besitzt neu Thomas van Aubel – ein Wirtschaftsanwalt, der bereits in mehrere feindliche Übernahmen involviert war (Balda, Q-Cells). Van Aubel ist ein langjähriger Freund Woestmanns und wurde von ihm zuvor schon als Rechtsberater zu Envion geholt. Woestmann macht für diesen Schritt hehre Gründe geltend: Er verweist auf Unregelmässigkeiten beim ICO – ihm gehe es um den Schutz der Anleger.  Die Gründer suchen darauf das Gespräch. Gerichtsverfahren wollen sie vermeiden, da diese zu viel Zeit und Geld kosteten. Doch wie Luckow erzählt, war es schwierig, eine Lösung zu finden: «Ich habe um Termine gebettelt.» Und wenn es doch einmal zu einer Aussprache gekommen sei, habe Woestmann zwar Kompromissbereitschaft signalisiert, aber anschliessend den Worten nie Taten folgen lassen.  So kam es, dass die Anleger über Monate im Ungewissen gelassen wurden. Aus Verunsicherung entstanden Frust und Wut. Eine kleinere Gruppe von Investoren begann sich in Internet-Channels intensiv auszutauschen. In Gesprächsprotokollen, die dieser Zeitung vorliegen, wurden auch Morddrohungen ausgesprochen. Verantwortliche erhielten auch per Mail Drohungen, teils mit Bildern von verstümmel en Menschen. Bei Gründern wurde mehrmals eingebrochen. Bei Luckow nahmen die Diebe nur die Festplatte aus dem Computer und das iPhone mit, während sie Bargeld auf dem Schreibtisch liegen liessen. Mitglieder des Gründerteams wurden bei Arbeitgebern mit Schmutzkampagnen verunglimpft.  Unlautere Pläne?  Luckow hat die Hoffnung aufgegeben, gemeinsam mit Woestmann eine Lösung finden zu können. Deshalb erzählt er erstmals von zweifelhaften Angeboten Woestmanns. Ein Vorschlag sei gewesen, Envion an ein kanadisches Unternehmen zu verkaufen. «Dieses sollte zu überteuerten Preisen die Hardware liefern und Woestmann ein Aktienpaket von zwei Millionen kanadischen Dollar geben.» In einem weiteren Gespräch habe Woestmann angeboten, Envion aufzulösen und den Investoren ihr Geld in Kryptowährungen zurückzuzahlen. Das Problem dabei: Die Kurse von Kryptowährungen sind stark eingebrochen. Envion hat das Kapital der Anleger grösstenteils in relativ stabilen Dollars angelegt. Wird das Geld zum tieferen Kurs in Kryptowährungen an Investoren zurückerstattet, bliebe ein zweistelliger Millionenbetrag zurück. «Woestmann schlug vor, dass wir diesen unter uns aufteilen», sagt Luckow. «Ich habe beide Vorschläge abgelehnt, da sie moralisch verwerflich und wahrscheinlich auch rechtlich problematisch wären.»  Inzwischen hat die Finanzmarktaufsicht die Kontrolle über Envion übernommen undWoestmann die Geschäftsleitung entzogen. Er betont deshalb, dass er nur als Aktionär und «nicht als Organ der Gesellschaft» sprechen könne. Als Aktionär habe er mehrere Angebote anderer Unternehmen erhalten. «Grundsätzlich hätte man mit einem Verkauf die Konfliktstellung in der Envion AG entschärfen können, deshalb habe ich das mit den Gründern auch so diskutiert.» Aber alle Angebote seien so gestrickt gewesen, dass die Investoren indirekt den Übernahmepreis bezahlt hätten. Deshalb habe er alle abgelehnt.  Den zweiten Vorwurf Luckows weist Woestmann entschieden zurück: «Die Vorstellung, dass ein Verwaltungsrat unter den Augen der Schweizer Behörden ein überschuldetes Unternehmen auflöst und einen Grossteil des Kapitals an die Aktionäre verteilt, ist völlig realitätsfern.» Die Verteilung von Geldern an Anleger bei einem ICO sei Neuland, weshalb es da offene Fragen gebe. Darauf habe er Luckow hingewiesen.  Doch keine Liquidation?  Woestmann geht davon aus, dass das Zuger Konkursamt Envion demnächst liquidiert. Der Grund: Die Wirtschaftsprüfer PWC und BDO lehnten es ab, als Revisionsstelle einzuspringen. Diesen Fehler konnte Envion nicht beheben, weil es Konflikte um die Aushändigung von Daten zum ICO gab. Nun liefern die Gründer der Finanzmarktaufsicht alle gewünschten Informationen und hoffen, die drohende Liquidation im letzten Moment noch abwenden zu können.  Gründer erzielen vor Gericht Zwischenerfolg  Die Envion-Gründer schürten unter Anlegern Unsicherheit, weil sie diese nicht informierten. Für die Zurückhaltung gab es zwei Gründe. Erstens hofften sie zuerst auf eine rasche einvernehmliche Lösung und mieden deshalb die öffentliche Auseinandersetzung. Zweitens untersagte es die Gegenpartei per Verfügung,dass sich Gründer im Namen von Envion äussern dürfen. Als Folge drohte dem Gründer Michael Luckow bei jeder Kommunikation mit Anlegern eine Geldstrafe oder Inhaftierung. In einem bisher nicht veröffentlichten Urteil hat das Landgericht Berlin nun beschlossen, diese Verfügung aufzuheben. Das Urteil ist sofort wirksam, kann aber angefochten werden.  Bereits im Juni gab es für die Gründer einen Erfolg: Das Landgericht Berlin verbot Geschäftsführer Matthias Woestmannund Mehrheitsaktionär Thomas van Aubel Anteile von Envion an Dritte zu verkaufen oder massgebliche Geschäfte ohne Zustimmung der Gründer zu tätigen. Die feindliche Übernahme durch van Aubel und Woestmann kritisierte das Gericht ungewöhnlich scharf als «besonders verwerflich» und «sittenwidrig». Dieses Urteil wird angefochten. (ki)",False

Laurent:  Main points:  Woestmann has made multiple offers to settle which enrich him at the expense of investors. Including:  * Kickback scheme with Canadian company which would have made profits for investors impossible * Liquidation and paying out shareholders with cash leftover after refunding crypto investments at lower exchange rates  Founders are complying with Finma requests to avoid liquidation.  Founders have been threatened and had their homes broken into.  Berlin court lifted injunction against founders. Woestmann’s only court win was built on false pretenses. (More on this later.)  Laurent:  We have not yet received the full judgement and we are not yet sure what the full legal consequences are, but it demonstrates that Woestmann was wrong and trying to intimidate the founders at the investors’ expense.  Investors will pay the full cost of the court and Trado’s legal fees as well as Trado’s legal fees and van Aubel’s legal fees for lawsuit against Trado for violating injunction.  Laurent:  I can’t imagine how exhausting it is to have to keep track of all the lies. That’s one reason the founders have no problem talking to the press whenever they ask or communicating here.  It’s very easy to tell the truth over and over again. Nobody will ever mix you up. There is no liability in telling the truth.  Laurent:  You seem very confused. I do indeed know exactly how the founders have been targeted.  The point of these crimes is not the phones.  The point is that the thefts are not related to money—they are to intimidate, delay, and hurt the ability of the foudners to pursue their case against Woestmann.

BERLIN — Matthias Woestmann, CEO of Swiss crypto-mining company envion AG, has been hobbled by a Berlin court’s sweeping judgement preventing him from making business decisions without approval from the company’s founders.  The decision stems from a June 21st hearing for an injunction won by the founders’ company Trado GmbH against majority shareholders Quadrat Capital GmbH, led by Woestmann, and Sycamore GmbH, led by co-CEOs Thomas van Aubel and Jutta Freifrau von Falkenhausen.  The court further confirmed the dilution of the founders’ majority ownership resulting from a capital raise executed by Woestmann was an illegal breach of contract, calling van Aubel and von Falkenhausen’s complicity both “immoral” and “especially reprehensible.”  “This judgement is an important victory for the founders as well as for envion’s investors,” says Michael Luckow who has publicly represented Trado and the founding team’s interests since the injunction was filed in early May.  “Anyone who thinks they can do business with envion while Woestmann is CEO needs to be aware of the risk that no deals will be valid unless the founders have given our prior approval.”  Berlin’s District Court judges ruled that Woestmann acted with “malicious intent” when he broke a contract between his company Quadrat Capital and Trado signed at the time of the envion’s founding.  Envion went on to raise $100-million-dollars in an Initial Coin Offering (ICO).  The agreement stipulated that Woestmann’s Quadrat would hold shares owned by the founders’ company Trado representing 81% ownership of the company and explicitly forbade any actions threatening their majority ownership or voting rights.  Woestmann held the remaining 19% and was to return the founders’ shares before the end of the ICO in January 2018.  Woestmann instead carried out an illegal capital increase without the founders’ knowledge which diluted their ownership down to a 31% minority share.  New shares created via the capital increase were given to Sycamore GmbH, a company owned by Woestmann’s longtime friend Thomas van Aubel and his wife Jutta Freifrau von Falkenhausen. The judges ruled that van Aubel and von Falkenhausen “knowing acted illegally by receiving shares” and share responsibility for the serious consequences to the founders.  In addition to ruling that Woestmann committed a “clear breach of duty” against the founders, the judges rejected the justification Woestmann presented to the court in his defense.  His false claim that the founders illegitimately created extra tokens was not accepted by the three-judge-panel.  The judgment published by the court states that the existing number of tokens corresponds to the specifications of the investor prospectus, thereby confirming the founders account of the matter.  The judge’s decision invalidates Woestmann’s entire public campaign of false accusations aimed discrediting the founders which he spread via newsletters, media interviews, and a hastily launched website.  The “40-million token fairy tale”—as it’s known to envion’s investors—was meant to justify the capital increase and undermine the founders’ credibility, but now represents a further liability for making false statements about the founders.  The judgement states that Woestmann violated his contractual obligations to the founders by increasing the company shares “without consent” from the founders, damaging the interests of the company and its investors with a share price well-below a valuation pertinent to envion’s ICO success. “The capital increase weakened the economic content of their shares.  This follows from the fact that they lost their majority stake and with it the majority required by section 12 of envion AG’s by-laws to make decisions [for the company].”  A further breach of contract was established as a consequence of Woestmann’s failure to inform or obtain approval from the founders for his capital raise.  “The breach of contract is not justified because Woestmann believes the capital increase was carried out in the interests of creditors and investors and that the plaintiff (founders) allegedly withheld the proceeds from the ICO without reason . . . .  Irrespective of the fact that defendant  #1 (Woestmann’s Quadrat Capital GmbH) has not credibly established business-damaging behavior on behalf of the plaintiff (founders), a capital increase without prior notice and behind the back of the plaintiff is not justified,” states the opinion of the court. The court therefore grants the founders “a right to injunction against all debits or other activities [which] could have an economic impact on the plaintiff’s shares held in trust.”  The court issued a stinging rebuke to Woestmann’s friend Thomas van Aubel and wife, Jutta von Falkenhausen, who are now the illegitimate majority shareholders through their company Sycamore GmbH.  The judgement determined that Van Aubel knew the capital increase was unlawful, stating, “This was obvious.”  He and von Falkenhausen “deliberately inflicted damage in a manner contrary to common decency” by acquiring the illegal shares.  “The defendant caused this damage in an immoral manner.  Behavior that violates the sense of decency of all proper and just thinkers in terms of content and overall character is objectively immoral, i.e. incompatible with the fundamental values of the legal and moral order.  There is especially reprehensible behavior [already determined by the court, in which Sycamore] entered into a legal transaction violating clear contractual provisions between the plaintiff (founders) and the defendant (Woestmann/Quadrat Capital) and thus, in cooperation with the defendant, intentionally harmed the plaintiff.”  Envion co-founder Michael Luckow explains, “We understand the assessment made by the court to be the basis of a claim for damages against both Woestmann and van Aubel for the harm to investors as well as envion’s founders.  The court has clearly stated that we have suffered damages resulting from their actions.”",False

But after some google work, I came out on a court website with this message. Read it below.    Scandal at Envion AG 22.06.2018 | Istvan Cocron Deadline to respond expires without success – CLLB Rechtsanwälte prepare first lawsuits against Envion AG and other responsible persons  Berlin, Munich, 19.06.2018  As already reported in the press, the Executive Board of Envion AG, Matthias Woestmann, commissioned forensic IT experts Blockchain Intelligence Group (BIG), to investigate the circumstances surrounding the 40 million extra tokens produced. According to the board of Envion AG, the allegations have now been confirmed technically.  At the end of February 2018, the Envion AG Executive Board became aware that, in addition to the 100 million EVN tokens planned in the white paper, around 40 million additional „illegal“ tokens were generated without informing investors. Of these, apparently in excess of 20 million tokens were sold on crypto trading exchanges and thereby converted to cash. Investors have now informed CLLB that they would not have acquired EVN, if they had known that „behind their backs“ another 40 million tokens were being produced, which had the effect of diluting the market value of EVN tokens.  Now a recent and extensive technical analysis of the ICO, performed by experts from BIG in Canada, is available. The allegations of the investors have been confirmed by BIG.  In recent days and weeks, a large number of investors affected by the Envion scandal have reported to CLLB Rechtsanwälte, a Munich and Berlin-based law firm, to have their claims for compensation assessed against Envion AG and the persons responsible there.  In its letter of 04.06.2018, CLLB requested on behalf of its clients that Envion AG, among other things, pay back the capital supplied by investors to Envion AG, incrementally, against return of the received EVN tokens.  Envion AG was set a deadline of Friday 15.06.2018 to respond.  „So far we have not received any response to our letter of formal notice, despite the deadline,“ explains CLLB. Therefore, we will now, according to the mandate of our clients, prepare payment claims against Envion AG and other persons in charge,“ continues CLLB.  Since the allegations concerning the EVN token’s infringement of the prospectus have been publicly admitted by Envion AG management, CLLB cannot understand why the company declines to respond to legal letters from its investors, explains Attorney at Law István Cocron, of the law firm CLLB.  Once again CLLB contacted the Executive Board of Envion AG, Matthias Wöstmann, on behalf of a number of its investors in a letter dated today, 19.06.2018, this time at his residential address in Berlin.  At the same time, CLLB is currently evaluating all documents from the Telegram groups of EVN investors and other publicly available posts and reports in order to further complete the claim that is already in progress. If in the future Envion AG refuses to deal with its investors out of court, corresponding lawsuits seem inevitable in order to clarify the already existing scandal.  Insofar as ENVION AG and any other responsible parties are obliged to pay damages by the presiding court, they must also reimburse fully the legal fees and court costs incurred by the investors, the CLLB Rechtsanwälte team explained further.  Investors in Envion should therefore check whether they may also be entitled to compensation. The law firm CLLB Rechtsanwälte is also grateful for all information and documents that can be used for further clarification of the matter.   https://www.cllb.de/blockchaincryptocurrencies/scandal-at-envion-ag/",False

Discrepancies exist between prospectus and whitepaper re shareholders and founders. Why the secrecy about real structure, shareholders and founders?  2) *Corporate Raiding* by CEO Mathias Woestmann and accomplices, abusing an inadequate corporate structure and allegedly trying to secretly sell Envion. Woestmann claims to have justification for his capital increase (which undoubtedly breached a Quadrat-Trado contract) but no hard evidence has been brought forward yet. Why the strange silence? Fraud?  3) *Insider Trading* by undisclosed ‘founders’ using a backdoor created via modifying the previously audited EVN smart contract. Tokens worth millions of US$ sold before end of an earlier in place and communicated 6 months lock period, via an undisclosed 3rd party. Investors were not informed upfront about smart contract manipulation or token sales. Exact amounts, use and whereabouts of resulting funds unknown. Why the secrecy? Fraud?  4) *Misleading Communications* towards investors overselling positive news (‘hardware arriving’, ‘production started’, ‘mining started’, LOIs etc.) and hiding factual ‘negative’ news (Enel and PWC drop off, fallout between CEO & founders, founders’ selling of tokens etc). Critical voices are banned from Telegram channels and critical media reports arrogantly dismissed as ‘irrelevant’. Complicit in fraud?  5) *No Mining, Huge Losses*. To date, instead of hundreds of mining units generating the heavily promoted 161% ROI, investors face up to 85% losses of their investments. Court cases between parties and investor protection lawsuits are underway, making it impossible to assess if there ever will be Envion mining payouts. One of the biggest ICO fails in history?  Unless a major breakthrough surprisingly would happen, the conflict could go on for years. Looks like courts will now determine the fate of Envion.

Today we announce that the owners of the Envion token project can exchange their EVNs for MNP tokens !! In this case, EVN tokens will be accepted at a price of $ 0.9 per coin without any bonuses!  So, let's calculate, the owners of EVN will receive: Suppose that someone changed tokens 1000 EVN ✅ 1000 EVN tokens * 0,9 $ (at this price the project accepts EVN tokens) = 900 $ (the amount that the investor should receive tokens, but do not forget that at the preview stage there is a 100% bonus, so we multiply this amount by 2)  ✅ $ 900 * 2 = $ 1800 - the amount of investment in the project Monopoly  ✅ Today, at the EVN exchange, traded at $ 0.19, that is, selling 1,000 tokens, their holder can  receive only 190 dollars, whereas in our case he gets 10 times more!  ✅ But that's not all - if the amount of investment in the project ""Monopoly"" exceeds $ 100,000, the client will receive another bonus - 20%.  🚀 Correctly, just 5 minutes investments are x10!!!  https://t.me/mnplive",False

BERLIN – The legal team defending envion’s majority shareholders, Quadrat Capital and Sycamore GmbH, were caught by surprise at a Berlin court proceeding over charges that CEO Matthias Woestmann illegally took majority control of Swiss-based envion AG from its founders. Investors and witnesses packed the courtroom, sitting alongside the company’s founders—plaintiffs in the case represented by their company, Trado GmbH—but conspicuously absent were any members of the defense.  Court proceedings were interrupted by laughter when lawyers for the defense attempted to prevent documents from consideration, dismissing them as “scribbles from the internet.” They were apparently unaware that the documents under discussion were an official investor newsletter from the CEO and a press release published by envion AG, both released a day prior to the hearing. News that the documents came directly from their clients left the lawyers blushing amid chuckles from the court benches.  Woestmann and Sycamore’s co-CEOs, Thomas van Aubel and Jutta von Falkenhausen, were not present to testify for their own defense. In their absence, the published documents expose a defense based on a fabricated legal construct and prove a critical point for the founders. The press release states that ,“Already in late February 2018, suspicions arose that more than 20 million tokens more than authorized by the prospectus had been created and distributed.”  The public record in the Swiss business register shows otherwise. The illegitimate capital increase took place on January 21, 2018, immediately after envion closed an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) which raised $100 million from over 30,000 investors. The capital increase took place approximately one month before the alleged suspicions reported by Woestmann, van Aubel, and his wife Jutta von Falkenhausen.  Envion’s latest press release brazenly admits that Matthias Woestmann and friend Thomas van Aubel planned and carried out a coup-like takeover of the company. In the process, CEO Matthias Woestmann diluted shares held by the founding team, led by Michael Luckow, from 81 percent to 31 percent. Woestmann admits in his newsletter that the unjustified capital increase—which was concealed from major shareholders and founders—only served to destroy the founding team’s voting majority. Thomas von Aubel and his high-society wife, Jutta Freifrau von Falkenhausen, now hold the majority of envion’s shares (61.5 percent) via their company Sycamore GmbH.  Woestmann’s press release further discloses that longtime friends and business partners van Aubel and von Falkenhausen helped shape the illegal takeover, stating, “As a result, Woestmann and his lawyer Thomas van Aubel acquired a majority stake in envion AG through a capital increase in order to protect the accumulated assets from Michael Luckow’s access.”  The founding team claims that the breach of contract and subsequent failure to operate the business inflicted serious damage on envion AG and its investors totaling many tens of millions of dollars in losses.  Luckow argues that, “Van Aubel and his wife, Jutta von Falkenhausen, are clearly behind the envion coup. Woestmann is just a henchman, a lackey. Woestmann finally admits in his press release precisely what van Aubel tried to cover up—even in court—that van Aubel had the company hijacked by his friend Matthias Woestmann at the expense of investors who have now lost a lot of money. Woestmann and van Aubel have thereby destroyed a lot of investors’ capital.”  These facts laid bare in the defendant’s publications were not lost on the 3-judge panel of the district court who spoke during the proceedings of “collusion behavior by the two managing directors [Woestmann and van Aubel].”  Woestmann had previously claimed that the founders had illegitimately generated millions of tokens for themselves. Originally, he claimed the number was 40 million tokens, but that number has been whittled down to a claim of only 20 million tokens. The alleged creation of these tokens was offered as justification for carrying out the illegal capital increase from which van Aubel and von Falkenhausen profited.  “This is the highest degree of self-contradiction. Woestmann uses an overproduction of tokens to justify the breach of contract and unlawful capital increase in January 2018, but which he claims in his press release to have learned about in February. It makes no sense. Woestmann would smoothly defy Einstein’s space-time continuum with a move like that. It’s just the latest in a series of changing justifications from Woestmann and van Aubel.”  “I’m not aware of that,” responded the visibly-irritated attorney Dr. Saskia Au from van Aubel’s law office when presented with her client’s press release. She offered no explanation for the changing number of extra tokens nor why the defendants avoided the hearing. The judges’ ruling is expected Friday June 22nd.

Most of it has just come true     I wrote few things:  Envion is no scam This I now give a yes and no. Envion has been robbed in this case and can not be mistaken as a scammer. Mr. Woestmann has taken away all investment money from the investors, without notifying investors for months. Woestmann can call his action a scam  KYC has nothing to do with this.     I was right that this had nothing to do with KYC   You set up a company purely to make yourself rich.    I was right here. By selling during the period that envion could be illegally created tokens that had to be burned. To be able to get rich quickly    As the owner of the company you are the king. Every person around that you have to pay monthly you would rather lose. So Envion vs shareholders. Yea, Woestmann ""the king"" takes off with the complete ico funds. More and more Hodlers step out of it now. maybe they buy the tokens sneaky to become a bigger shareholder   If the revenues flow in you have to reduce the flow of funds as quickly as possible. For example, in a production factory, workers are replaced by automated robots. Envion also does this with a well-thought-out business plan. They know that they can make the token price very low by deliberately not giving updates, waiting with paying dividends to create as much silent unrest as possible, but this is suspiciously noticeable. This case maybe does not need more units than they actually say. Now they try to work out as many tokenholders as possible by getting the price as low as possible to fill their own pockets  To earn back the investment a production factory where the workers have been replaced for robots is quickly reclaimed because no money goes to the workers. If they have almost all tokens in their possession, they no longer need to pay dividents to hodlers  Envion is buying a lot of shares back with the profits of the mines that had to be paid to the holders. (Someone who hides nothing playing open card with current mining results, someone who hides something will avoid everything as much as possible) Almost right. Because the EVN tokens for the team themselves were locked for a certain period of time, they did Dumps with the millions of extra created tokens instead of buying token with mmu revenue to crash the price. Much cheaper and more effective. Especially by placing on very bad exchanges and low volume exchanges      For every  illegal token they sold, envion can now buy 6 tokens if envion sold all for $0.70. multiply that by 20.000.000 tokens = 120.000.000 tokens. With that, envion can now buy up all tokens while they do not have to spend a penny on it. It can still be a big tactic, which is part of the buisness plan. So watch out",False

A couple of years later it was worth ~$300 million. That is when Woestmann exited. Months later it went bankrupt.  The city of Berlin and the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern pumped €146 million of free money into Solon in that time.  Woestmann profited. Investors lost. Taxpers lost.  Thomas Krupke was the CEO of Solon. He was installed on the board of directors of Clere AG.  The majority shareholder of Clere AG is Thomas van Aubel. Van Aubel took over Balda AG, falsely accused board memebers of fraud and replaced them with his lackies, then renamed the company Clere.  Last summer van Aubel tried to get Clere AG delisted from exchanges and offer shareholders the market price for their stock which was severly undervalued after the chaos he caused. He would pocket the tens of miillions of Euros remaining in the company.  Thomas van Aubel and his wife Jutta von Falkenhausen are now the majority shareholders of envion.  They and Woestmann have suggested delisting EVN and offering some kind of replacement while crashing the token price. They have falsely accused envion's founders of fraud.    Envion  To everyone: We completely understand your frustrations and concerns during this tumultuous time. At the present moment, there is only so much we can reveal publically about the status of the legal actions taking place: mostly because we can't have this sensitive information getting into the wrong hands. We delete posts that insinuate we are a scam. We are most certainly not a scam: everything we have done has been within a legal jurisdiction and every contract we have drawn up as been to the highest legal standards and to prevent the worst case scenario happening. It could be argued that we have made some mistakes along the way, but, we have token contracts and EVERYTHING we have done is supported by smart contracts and is recorded on the blockchain. And everything we are doing now is to protect our investors and to resume MMU manufacturing. We know it is asking a lot for you all to continue having faith in us: the ICO world is full of scammers and pump and dump schemes. Unfortunately even though we took every step imaginable to prevent this from happening with our project, there was a wolf in sheep's clothing in our midst. The difference, however, is that Woestmann and Van Aubel are using old-school tactics that don't fly in the blockchain economy: this is exactly why we all are in this world, right? The blockchain makes sure that every step taken is traceable and verifiable by outside sources. We appreciate posts that are about dialogue, not posts that spiral into conspiracy theory or gross mis-speculations about the actions we are taking, all of which are to preserve the original aim of the project and to protect the investments and our investor community",False

Instead of asking the CEO for parts of the 100 million USD to pay stuff, they just created 20 million tokens with 1 mouse click, without written permission of the board and the auditor.

Those tokens should have been in a trust or something its fine that they would get the benifits but they should not have been allowed to sell them thats a huge insentive for them to work hard to make the tokens valuable gone now they are paid employee's and stock holders in the company instead of beeing in it with their investors that bought the tokens.

The lack of communication was a first sign. So the statements of the CEO are good news.  You have to understand whats happened. PWC has quit contracts because they have seen a fraud. They wanted to prevent damage to their name if they continue to audit envion, so they had to quit.  Now the important thing: The CEO took over the company AFTER the fraud was detected (thats what the tech guys called a hijacking or a fraud to them).  But this was the only way to ensure, that only a small part of the money (some millions) is gone. He saved the money of the investors. The money is still on envions bank account available.  The only problem (for the ICO investors!!!) is now, that dividends will be created later as planned.  So the money is saved. Envion will probably become real (later as planned) and dividends will be created in some months. Maybe end of the year. But the money was saved.  So I can only repeat. Consider this as GOOD NEWS. Because somebody tried to steal money and the CEO detected it and saved a huge part of the money.  If the tech guys would be right, the money would have been gone.

Why all this lies about KYC and ongoing audits we have seen in the last announcement? There was nothing about a disagreement between CEO and founders team. Now they show up with video try to explain themselves. So from the first day, there was a problem and nobody said a word about this until yesterday. Why?  I think because founders hoped on agreement and CEO don't. Founders did something wrong and against the law, so CEO is holding all cards now. It will be good if somebody from members has a knowledge and experience in such cases, especially from Switzerland.  I would like to know how the next months will look like. What are the next legal steps and how long this would take? I will be glad to hear possible scenarios for investors.

I will address some of the misunderstandings, so maybe people will not ask the same questions over and over again and understand how things work:  1) Bounty payments  Bounty payments WILL NOT be paid in the first six months after the ICO was over. Since the ICO was over on January 16, there is zero possibility to receive the bounty tokens before July 16. No matter how much FUD bounty hunters will spread, and no matter how many times they will ask about their bounty, it is impossible for bounties to be distributed before July 16.  The technical reason why bounties cannot be distributed before the date is simple: credit card ICO investors. Credit card payments are reversible in the first 6 months since the purchase. They are not Bitcoin or Ethereum, where once you spend there is no turning back. This is why the tokens of credit card investors are locked and cannot be released. Before the 6 months period is over, there is no way for Envion team to know how much money has been raised in the ICO and how many tokens must be issued to investors. Credit card investors can still ask for chargebacks from their banks, and it is still possible for some of those investments to be cancelled, resulting in less money from the ICO and less tokens to be created.  Now, since the number of EVN tokens that will be given to Bounty Hunters is proportional to the total number of EVN tokens issued to investors, it is impossible to calculate the bounties before all tokens are released to investors, and the additional tokens burned.  So, for all the bounty hunters asking about their bounty and why are they not paid yet, the answer is simple: it is impossible to get paid before all investors are paid (this was clearly stated in the whitepaper), and credit card investors cannot be paid before 6 months are over since the ICO. Bounties can be calculated and paid only after July 16, and not before.  2) Another question people are asking since the last Envion update is why the ICO funds were still not used for the building of MMUs, and why the CEO is not giving approval yet.  There is a very logical reason for this situation. Envion AG is a company that wants to maximize returns for shareholders (token holders), and this is why it must spend the ICO money in the most efficient way. Building MMUs one by one as if they were hand crafted (the prototypes) is very expensive, and the price per MMU would be very high. In order to greatly reduce the cost of each MMU, Envion first had to prepare everything for mass production, which results in economies of scale and greatly reduces costs per unit.  The CEO must first ensure that mass production is ready at a very efficient cost rate, and with a very high quality control standard, in order to avoid errors, defects and cost overruns. Only once the CEO is confident that mass production is ready to be implemented in an efficient manner he will give the green light for the ICO funds to be used.  It is only 4 months since the ICO is over, and it is absurd to expect Envion to be able to start mass production in such a short period of time. It would have been irresponsible from their part to hurry things up just to give updates to the community. What is important is for the ICO funds to be used wisely and in an efficient manner. If setting up an efficient mass production for MMUs will result in halving the cost per unit, it would be insane to start producing right away instad of setting up the mass production efficiently.  This is a real business, and the way they presented the situation in the last update shows that the Envion team is on track with everything and they are doing things in a professional manner instead of hurrying up just to appease investors who don't understand how a real business is run.  3) There is great concern about the falling price, and people ask Envion to release announcements in order to manipulate the market and pump up the price.  This is a crazy idea, since Envion AG is a real company that must respect the laws. Artificially pumping the price of securities is illegal, since it is considered market manipulation / insider trading. Doing this can result in jail time.  Remember that EVN tokens are securities, not coins.  Also, the purpose of Envion is to run the company efficiently and generate profits to distribute to token holders. The token price doesn't matter at all for the company, since they stated in the whitepaper that they do not intend to rise additional funds by issuing new tokens. If they don't want to raise more funds from token sales, the price is totally irrelevant for the company.  There is also another opportunity for Envion if the token price goes very low. The company can proceed to buy-back some of the tokens from the market with the ICO proceeds, or with the mining profits. Buying back tokens at low price and destroying them can be a great way to increase revenue per token for the remaining token holders. Large companies do this all the time (buying back and destroying shares) in order to increase the Earnings per Share. I hope Envion will do the same if the token price becomes extremely cheap.",False

I'm pretty sure that Envion is not a scam.  A security token only has a different method of making money as a normal ERC20 token. With this token you get divident paid based on the profits of envion. Envion token price will never be more than delivered.  Only envion must give more openness to the investors. I find them very closed with giving information.  Would like to know something about the amount raised by the ico. I think that almost half of the original raised money amount is gone.  Not that Envion could do anything about that. The whole crypto market was crashing after December. Because the bank also put heavy demands, the lot is extra delayed.  I think that they should give more open information about financial matters to the investors. How much has been converted to fiat money and at what prices. Also how much still needs to be converted to fiat money. How much fiat money is currently spent on hardware and units. If half of the raised money is gone because of that market crash, Then the half of the units will be able to be built, and the ROI will only be able to stay the same if the token price continues to fall.",False

It's just the facts. I only have 0.57envion in my wallet.   You think Envion is going to be worth $ 10. Do not believe in that. if bitcoin doubles in price, you can expect the price of envion halved in btc.  Also do not forget the used mining hardware. What is still fast is next year junk and in 2 years it can be calculated to antiques. difficulty level only goes up to solve the puzzle. As a result, your income will decrease. Prices of the miners are going to rise (Why the prices go up you can find out in my previous post)  Dividents are paid in ethereum if you still knew. so if the bitcoin is mined with outdated equipment, you will hear it a bit harder because you get paid in ether.  Besides, envion is also not a coin at all. This will also not become a currency for payments. They are simply securety tokens. Comparable with shares that you can buy from, for example, apple or a bank or a small business. You must have patience   With the ico, the website or white paper stated that you also had voting rights with the tokens for various decisions. You do not have voting rights. everyone who has made their purchase also has no voting rights.  Envion also scraped $ 100mil. and are too cuddly to pay 0.01% of their total revenue to a normal exchange. They do nothing themselves with tips. So is just all a business tactic.  The whitepaper also states that dividents are paid weekly or to those who own envion.  Because Envion is a security token that you can compare with a digital certificate as proof of shareholder but then built on the blockchain.  Simply fiddled: You can buy each week just before the payout of the divident envion and then immediately after the divident payout dump them again.  It is not a question of how long you have an envion. But if you have envion at the time of payment, it matters.   why almost everyone has not yet been paid a dividend because you have not yet earned a dollar with your half-year holding. While you can also simply buy envion when the mining units are ready Envion has clearly told that. https://medium.com/@envion/how-and-when-evn-token-holders-will-get-dividends-6c01f9c5ed59 that they pay out divident if the gas costs can be taken out. So if you want to receive dividents every week, you should buy more with minimal revenue  I do not know how many units are ready, but I think they use 2 units. If they are working, arround 127.000.000 securrety tokens have to be paid. weekly. Since they also do not even work on solar energy, high energy costs will go away.  Im not going to calculate evrything but weekly earnings from these 2 units. You then have to distribute this amount over all tokens and convert it to ethereum. I think with 1EVN per week that you earn $ 0.00001 micromilicent x your number of envion. then multiply this by the number of weeks you have envion in your wallet. So do not think that suddenly you can expect your double money from your investment. No. Your profit is still so low that it is still too little to be able to pay the gas price.",False

Looks really interesting, and the price looks quite tempting at least in comparison to the ICO price. It was love at first sight until I started to read the discussion here. Therefore, I would like to ask, are there any schedules, plans, and estimates on the profitability available? I would also like to know if the costs/incomes etc been publicly announced or if someone has calculated the ROI of one token. All I was able to found was a medium post by the company from february. The post used numbers from october 2017 to make the future estimations and promised to make everyone filthy rich, which made me extremely suspicious. Why would you not use current numbers? Obviously, the difficulty of mining is not the same anymore as it was in october.  Based on my current understanding, no one knows how many mining containers these guys have, when the payout is etc. I really want to invest into this but with the current knowledge it just does not seem to make any sense to take a leap of faith.

Envion is a Swiss company that offers POW-based cryptographic security (mining) for blockchains such as Bitcoin or other more profitable.  The company uses Ethereum-based token (EVN) as a modern version of traditional stocks/shares. The tokens generate dividends for their owners and thus have a capital gain function to them. The value of the token can go up or down, depending on how potential the company is considered - just like it works at the stock markets.  Envion is a physical operation (mining with hardware) and just set up so don't expect things happening overnight. Likely summer/fall will show how much there really is to the company. Those who think that blockchain and Bitcoin +other cryptocurrencies have come to stay and believe demand for mining will remain, they invest in Envion. Also many of the Envion investors seek something that's value is not 100% speculative. Those alternatives are quite scarce in crypto space. If you are considering to invest I really advice you the read Envion's white paper. Thank you for reading.",False

If Envion will deliver, now it is a good time to buy because you can get two tokens at the price of one during the ICO.  I believe one of the factors for the price drop is the huge 19 EVN fee for withdrawals at ShitBTC. For every buyer that withdraws his EVN, ShitBTC earns 19 EVN and spends a small fraction of ETH for the transaction. ShitBTC will then sell the EVN it earned in order to get ETH which it uses for gas. ShitBTC makes a profit in ETH since the transaction price is much lower than the value they get for 19 EVN, but the effect on EVN price is a negative one, since ShitBTC is a constant seller of EVN.  For everyone who buys EVN and withdraws, there are 19 EVN to be sold back into the market by ShitBTC. That puts a constant negative pressure on the price.  The upside to this is that lower prices means more weak hands selling their EVN at a loss and giving us the opportunity to buy more EVN cheaper.",False

The timing of EVN's ICO was an unfortunate perfect storm that destroyed huge amounts of value as ETH tanked to its current price.  Around $450.  Nobody will sell you mining equipment for a fixed amount of ETH.  Raising all your mining equipment funds in ETH at a price of:  $1400 USD and then having them now sit at $450 USD (current price) means that approximately 68% of the ICO purchase power has been wiped out assuming they received it in ETH and have not hedged or protected themselves after the raise.  Can anyone confirm they sold the bulk of the ETH ICO proceeds at $1400 to dollars ??   I highly doubt it.  I suspect that this project has lost about 68% their funds since the $100,000,000 ICO.   Which means they probably have around $32,000,000 USD left at current ETH prices to purchase mining equipment.  Which is to say that the token price should probably be at $0.32.   But then mining profitability has also more than halved.   Which means it should probably be priced no more than $0.16 per token.  Thoughts?   You agree?  Disagree?  All comments welcome!",False

Their whitepaper said that the ICO funds are used to start building MMUs. You don't get dividends right away, they need to build infrastructure first. With GPU's in their MMUs they can mine whatever they want and they wrote about MMUs which can be used by corporations to maintain their own blockchain infrastructure. This means Envion is not necessarily dependend on just mining Ether but they would also be able to generate profit by getting paid for delivering infrastructure. The fact that the payout is based on tokens and not on investors is important to mention! We have a fixed amount of tokens with payout. If you compare this to a usual mining pool, as there are more people getting into the mining operation by time, the mining pool effectively decreases your payout compared to a tokenized payout structure. Profits don't have to be spread on more people.  The fact that Envion tokens go by SEC regulations is also valuable as more and more exchanges will need to follow regulation. This will come sooner or later.  At current prices I am wondering how people are still so damn negative about Envion. You can see it all over the places. The same questions on and on.

The envion team has been hard at work collaborating with our production facility on our mass-production line and pre-installation mining, meeting with potential new customers, and organizing the process for dividend distribution.   Production The news everyone wants to hear about is MMU production. Things are humming along at our EU production facility where pre-installation mining, container production, and pre-deployment MMU mining will take place.  The pre-installation mining facility is complete and ready for hardware delivery. A dust-free warehouse has been made ready with the power connections necessary for large-scale mining and the hardware racks for the GPUs and ASICs are being completed by the factory production line.  Just to recap, the plan is to install all hardware on the racks and begin mining as soon as hardware arrives. This will allow maximum profits as no mining time will be wasted while the containers are being built. The racks themselves will just be loaded on to the MMU containers as they roll off the production line.  The containers themselves are in production as each section of the mass-production line, which includes both human and robot construction, is optimized and new workers are onboarded and trained for each task.  With the electricity supply and power connections necessary to start mining with finished MMUs in place, MMUs will begin mining on-site as soon as possible before deployment. The factory is capable of hosting up to 70 MMUs with competitive energy prices that assure profitability at every step.  The search for production facilities in the Americas to reduce transport costs — and mining downtime — for customers in North and South America (see below) is underway. The current work done optimizing mass-production at the first factory should lead to even speedier scaling for new factories.   Hardware Hardware is on the way! Our first order of GPUs have left the factory in Asia and will soon be on a plane heading for our production facility. This initial order of GPU mining machines (not even on the market yet) should arrive in the middle of next week which coincides with when the warehouse, racks, etc. will be ready to receive them. The first orders are small and will be used to create the workflows for pre-installation mining and train workers to accommodate even larger orders which are in the pipeline.   Customers Envion has 10 EU locations for Proprietary Operations MMUs offering power prices between $.04-$.06 per kw/h. We are currently determining which will get the first batch of MMUs from the factory, but with 50MW of capacity on the table, we expect over 600 MMUs will have a home among these first customers.  Discussion with potential Third Party Operations customers on the other side of the globe are also underway. The total value of the deals under discussion would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars with the first cooperation starting as soon as TPO MMUs roll off the EU production line.  A second production line in North or South America is in discussion to service further projects starting later in the year. Most of the capacity under discussion in the Americas is in North America — Canada and Texas specifically.  These potential customers are offering envion dedicated capacity with competitive electricity rates and are asking for long-term contracts to operate and maintain MMUs purchased via the TPO program. Dedicated capacity and decades-long contracts are a bit different from the types cooperations envion received in the first months of the business and we see this as a huge vote of confidence in our business — especially from publicly traded companies who must answer to shareholders and financiers.   Dividends Second only to questions about production are questions about dividends. As we said in our last update about dividends, all mining activities will be audited and a report will be published verifying our accounting before any payouts are made. We can now announce that Big Four auditor PWC is our auditing partner.  Now that PWC is onboarded as our auditor, we must first identify and agree on all the relevant costs and metrics associated with mining operations and establish the reporting procedure. After that, PWC will collect data which we will publish for our token holders verifying how dividends are calculated. Dividends will be paid to all wallets holding EVN tokens only after the report is published.   SEC, crypto bank, etc. do things the envion way Envion has taken a lot of criticism for a long KYC process, waiting for an audit to distribute dividend payments, and a slower pace of news than many in the ICO world are accustom to. While it might be satisfying to get everything you want right now, recent developments in the crypto world are demonstrating the value of taking the time to do things right.  In the USA, the Securities and Exchange Commission has asked that all exchanges register with the SEC and comply with their rigorous financial regulations. While that has sent many investors into a panic, envion is well-positioned to be one of the few coins that could be traded under such circumstances. We’ve already done the hard compliance work and transparency is already part of our business model. Our security token which seemed exotic in 2017 will be one of the only ones trading by the end of 2018.  We hope that these developments show our token holders that our commitment to professionalism is paying off — even when that means asking for a little patience from our token holders. It’s a reminder that value investments can take time to mature, but that it’s time well spent.   Events Laurent had a great time meeting with ~20 envion investors at the Beverly Hills Blockchain meetup last week. It was nice to talk directly with investors and see some of the faces behind the usernames on Telegram. We look forward to seeing you at more events in the future, starting with the Blockchain Technology Conference tomorrow, March 9th, in Berlin.

""TOKEN DISTRIBUTION UPDATE:  Dear investors,  As envion nears the completion of the KYC process, we want to inform you about the process for destroying excess EVN tokens. Background: for the distribution of tokens to investors who paid with credit card, Bitcoin, bank transfer, and for pre-ICO investors, envion is in the possession of bulk accounts that hold EVN tokens. Any tokens not needed for this purpose will be burned afterwards.  Overview of the burn process:  Envion will publish final numbers about total tokens sold and KYC-verified investments once the KYC process is terminated. The cut-off / termination date for the KYC process has yet to be determined and will be communicated in advance.   Envion will then burn excess tokens in bulk accounts by sending them to the Null address. Based on the final number of EVN tokens, envion will recalculate the exact number of tokens for envion AG (5%), founders (10%) and bounty program (2%). Based on this calculation, envion will burn excess tokens in these accounts (see step 2).  Envion will then publish the utilized scripts and transaction logs of this burn process in a medium article and upload all process data to envion's github.com account.""  I hope this helps answer few questions as for now. We have to be careful and watch closely Envion and keep putting pressure on them.",False

I'd like to share my experience about EVN and ask some questions accordingly, please.  My situation is: I got some EVN tokens during ICO. Having purchased EVN either by ETH (sent from my MEW address) and by BTC, at some point after the ICO was completed EVN sent the tokens purchased by ETH directly to my MEW (I checked transaction on Token Explorer), while for the tokens purchased by BTC they created another wallet (ethereum compatible) to be unlocked by the given PIN in order to have access to the tokens stored inside that wallet. Eventually on 3rd Feb. I received the PIN (no support contact was needed to ask for it). After signing in to my EVN dashboard I could unlock the wallet and then both its private key/seed phrase were shown (they can be also downloaded for print/storage as .pdf file).   My question is: to get dividends should I hold my EVN tokens in the wallet provided by ENV or can I move all the tokens to my MEW without losing any future dividends?  Some considerations: Among their EVN wallet access information (given with the PIN) they say: ""Envion recommends transferring your EVN tokens to a wallet that is completely controlled by you"". What does it mean? Maybe that the wallet they gave me (where my tokens are stored) can't be considered ""completely controlled by me""? Could they access my private key/seed phrase somehow? If so, that would explain their recommendation above.  Hence the reason of my question: if I have to move my tokens to another wallet ""completely controlled by me"" to ensure full security and control, will I lose dividends for not keeping tokens in their wallet?  I hope to have been clear enough and that my questions make sense, especially for those investors still waiting (unfortunately) to unlock their tokens.     Many thanks Luca",False

I used a basic calc today to work out that if I went to Hashflare (Only a 1yr contract agreement)  to buy the same 'mining power' today I have at Envion, id be paying $70k vs. $100k I spent on Envion, however, Envion effectively tops up your mining power with 3rd party MMU agreements and also has a 30yr token life.

It started mid December 2017 when i bought some tokens with a credit card with discount - 0.7$ for token. I'm not going to mention the exact amount because i think its irrelevant - you either do what is necessary for your customer or you just don't give a f... On the other side - stealing 500 or 500k is still a theft. Anyways, the amount was not something i can't afford to lose, but i decided to write here just in case someone wants to read my few lines of frustration. And so - there am I, buying some coins and receiving a message - ""functionality for buyers with BTC or credit card will be available in a few days"", or something like that. Their system said i need to go through the KYC program and after a few days i will see the transaction details on the dashboard. I sent all the pictures of ID they wanted, some selfies and so on... Then i thought ""Hey, that was pretty easy, i own some EVN already!""... Yes, but nooo... The next time i tried to sign in i was unable to login. This thing kept happening for a few days and finally i decided to write to the customer support. At first they were quite fast - 2 day and i got an answer, although they were ""very busy"" with the ongoing ICO. They managed to solve the issue (idk how) and i was able to login to my dashboard and guess what - still no info of my transaction. ""No functionality yet"", i thought. The days passed, weeks passed - no info of my transaction in the dashboard of their site. Then i decided to write again and ask what is going on. They were quite fast gain, but still... ""very busy"". I got asked to send more pictures of me and more ID pictures. I got asked to point the exact date and time of the transaction and all the details i have. I did it. Sent the pics, sent them the information of the transaction from my bank, sent even the number of the bank account i used. I was assured everything is fine with my tokens, since they are reserved for me and everything is going to be fine, once the ICO is over... Guess what Riiiight, it was the last time i actually had some sort of a conversation with someone from the staff. I wrote a few more mails after that and all i got was some sort of automated messages about merging mails to the first issue and no real answer or a solution for this issue. As of today it takes like 10-14 days to get some sort of an email from them which is not even related to the issue i have. Thanks, but no thanks. For me those guys have the worst attitude ever, or are just a bunch of crooks who made quite some dollars on their ICo, stealing from regular joes. I hope I'm wrong for the sake of all the investors, but i have a feeling about it and it doesn't feel right. So, that's it from me.

If ROI does indeed become $1.61 in a year, in traditional markets this sort of annual return would command a token valuation of $20+ (like getting an 8% annual dividend on a Google share for example). So in essence the sooner and lower people buy/top up the higher return they stand to make per token, starting with ICO participants.

From a technological point of view the container is worthless (bad hash rate) and I don't think it will survive many transports, so they will have huge maintenance. But you are right, it's just the first one, maybe they get better. Another point is the German electricty cartel, which isn't confined to price rigging (as usual), they do really weird things, e.g. water plants that produce electricty during daytime and then pump the water back during the night when electricity is cheap. Most of them are just not willing to sell their electricty cheaper, even if they lose more many when shutting down the plant. Same in France, Austria and many others.  And how can they guarantee a profit? What if market drops, like it did in the last weeks? What do you think where the money comes from?

You think they need envion to deliver the containers or what? nvidia has no reason to sell cheap mining rigs that are 160% ROI/year to company's, they would rather use those GPU's to mine themselves or sell them to gamers so they won't lose the gaming market.

The accusations that you are doing are totally wrong and despicable. First of all I want to tell you that I am in no way affiliated with the bounty managers or anything. I joined this bounty campaign as one of the first persons to join and after reading the rules I decided to dedicate a lot of my time into this bounty. I did so for 2,5 months, every day. You are saying that I will eat up all the tokens, but please do the math before you state anything. Its just about your personal post count how much you will be rewarded with. The difference of tokens that each participant will receive wont change much if my stakes wouldnt been taken into account at all. Do the math before writing bs.  The rules of this campaign were given intentionally to incentivice people to post more to promote more. I did post a lot more than other people, but this was my decision to take this opportunity. Everybody had the same opportunity to do so. Now trying to prevent me from getting my fair share just because you are jealous is despicable. I have worked on this bounty 24/7 and followed all the rules 1:1. You wont find even one post in my history that doesnt fits the rules. But there are a lot of other accs with really low quality posts, or even mainly twitter links that have been shared and those posts are counted. But do I, as someone that has put in so much work complain? No, I dont, because Im granting everyone their share, even the lazy ones.  To be honest I see myself as one of the top promoters of Envion that did put a whole lot of effort in promoting the project and as the rules were from day one, I should be rewarded for the work. Your post implies to me that you didnt even bother to look up my account, because my actual post count is over 2300 and not 2040 (yes, Im also missing stakes), and henceforth also didnt bother to look at my post quality. (By the way,I have the bonus stakes, because I participated in every bonus opportunity there was, so whats your point?!)  If anything is unfair in this bounty its that translators who only had to translate the ann + boutny thread of Envion (not the WP) will be awarded with a lot of tokens accordingly. In the time that I spent on this forum, posting every day and night, I could have done 100 or more of those translations. Just think of it.  Actually I didnt wanted to post anything towards those people that dont grant the reward to people that have really put in a lot of time and effort, but being attacked personally is too much. You should be ashamed of yourself and think (do the math and take a look at the persons account) before making any accusations.  Just as a side note: our bounty managers are not just some random dudes managing a bounty, they are from a professional firm, so they wont scam anybody around here.  As a second side note: I just checked your posts, and most of them dont even contain 5 words, so please...",False

It could still be a very good project though and I invested in it based on the concept, but please, don't have that 17,7x ROI on the front page it is just screaming SCAM. But hey, that's how to attract people. I'm sure 50% of the investors don't even know what mining difficulty means. They might not even know the difference between mineable and nonmineable coins. But they do know what 17,7x 'conservative' ROI means. Especially when you have the drag bar. Even the title of this toppic is ""most profitable crypto intrastructure"". Where are the calculation sheets? What are the assumptions they made to get to that 17,7? What independent universitys or experts have verified those sheets and commented on those assumptions? The answer is simple, they don't exist. But still, the idea of getting concerated miners near power plants is not bad.",False

Hello guys, I've been monitoring complaints about the projects and I write on the forum if I find something.  The bounty manager of Envion project is probably scamming people. I'm saying ""probably"" because I wait for his explanation. I read many complaints about their signature campaign and lots of people are complaining about the mistakes in post counting.  I checked the posts of people complaining about post counts and they're mostly correct! The bounty manager is making a huge mistake, I don't know why. Maybe he makes this on purpose.  ONE QUESTION: WHY YOU COUNTED PEOPLE'S POSTS INCORRECTLY ON PURPOSE?  If a person exceeded the minimum post count of 30 within the ICO period, you wrote something below 30, probably randomly, I don't see any logic behind this. It shouldn't be that hard to count people's posts.  I remember that there were post counts on the spreadsheet 5-6-7-8 days prior to the ICO end. What is the point of this? You should have counted the posts after the ICO ends only.  Please correct the situation and provide an explanation to the public or Envion project will be a subject to a scam just because of your incredible mistakes.  Answer this immediately or I'll gladly report this situation to the scam monitoring websites, organizations and platforms.  NOTE: This post will be edited if the problem is fixed by the bounty manager.",False

Its a projection anyway and I ll be more than happy with way less than that.  Quote Quote Quote One of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, HitBTC, will trade EVN tokens after the envion ICO completes   This thing has 1,5-2 star reviews on all crypto exchange review pages. World's largest and mediocre reviews arent mutually exclusive features.  That doesn't matter, fact is they list one of the worst exchanges ever. Whatever deceiving name they give then doesn't matter. No they didn't lie, so what? It is a bad exchange so it's still bad. Worst or not, it IS one of the world's largest and for a token straight off the ICO I wouldn't expect a heavy-hitter exchange listing it already anyway. Progression to larger/better exchanges is always gradual.  Quote Quote Quote Another aspect is that they assume GPU/ASIC mining is the future for at least the next 5 years. If tomorrow the main coins are going proof-of-stake or proof-of-capacity, this whole project goes to the drain. From the ""main"" mineable coins only ethereum has declared intention to transition to PoS and thats still without a precise ETA. Bitcoin, LTC, Dash and their forks/clones of the SHA256/Scrypt/X11 algorithm family are years away from even initiating such transition and even if say they were hypothetically PoS tomorrow mining altcoins would still be profitable. Ethereum is 20% of the main mineable coins, it is even running this token. Power consumption is an issue. The issue is not solved by putting miners next to power plants. The issue is solved by using less wastefull algoritms. That is what will happen and what is happening. 5 years is forever. What is happening is smaller cap and/or new coins that are still in their infancy/proof of concept phase switching to PoS. The implications of switching to it solely are far greater than you perceive, especially for a 100B+ coin like Ethereum that is also a utility platform used by thousands of tokens etc. Thats why we have only a letter of intent from them declaring a switch to PoS sometime in the future. Plus there will still be 80% remaining that hasnt even declared any intention for such a switch, let alone implement it or release it on their main nets.  Quote Quote Quote Even the fact they reached exactly 100 million dollars with this ICO starts to ring a bell now. On the contrary, such an amount can and will lead to economies of scale that will make it easier for them to achieve their goals. I meant that I am not sure they 'really' got 100 million dollars. They can very much artificially say that. They wouldn't be the first ponzi scam artist to do that.  They can only inflate the fiat deposits they got if they wished to do so, deposits in crypto are transparent though and even you can view them and judge for yourself. Direct deposits in ETH in their smart contract alone account for 46.735 ETH or a value of ~67mill $ during the time of ICO close (14th of January) so yeah I do believe they really got the totals they claim.",False

I would like to see the first 100.000.000 $ that has been raised to be invested in MMU working for ENVION alone and not to put into the hands of third parties. Ofcourse there are tradeoffs to be made.  So you have multiple LOI's. What are the agreements you made with them. How are you able to deliver to all of them?

In addition to profits from units operated by Envion,  EVN tokens will also receive dividends of profits from agreements with third parties in regards to their mobile units so to measure it with a hash power per EVN token metric isn't really spot on. EVN token is NOT mining power.  If the company is profitable and returns a decent ROI month after month when they start rolling out units you can bet your ass token price will rise.

The cost of electricity can not increase at once several times, the market is fairly stable. Therefore, if I theoretically pay for one s9 for electricity, say, not 50 dollars, but 200, then nothing much will change from this. If we look on the other hand, that the complexity of production will increase greatly, and s9 will be practically at zero by profitability, then the sense of moving the container to where or will not be.

After going through all their social media with a fine-toothed comb, I counted seven seemingly intelligent people fudding Envion with passion. I cannot validate their claim of hoax. I can however validate their skepticism.  So you are talking about experts like you, right? The hacked.com author lost every reputation after this post. He openly insulted and threatend envion staff members. Then this article was written.  Quote CWhat’s the name of the production company that is building the MMU’s?”  Why should they reveal this information? #1 This is a topic just about man-power. Not about expertise. That's why they used industry standards to make production as easy as possible. So why caring about this? If you believe this is too difficult, then please don't make this assumption just because you are not capable of doing this. #2 Why exposing their production place? Why exposing to the competitors?  Quote “Who is going to supply Envion with thousands of ASIC miners, aren’t they always sold out?”  Bingo! You got your first valid point. This is still not known and yet to be determined. It's tough. Definitely Let me try another approach: Let's assume you have huge capital, it might be possible to approach certain chip supplier directly and get charges through other connections. But still - This is a valid concern.  However. The whole business model is not just based on ASIC miners.  Quote I asked many other questions but persisted with these two for about 36 hours straight. Their reps just delayed answering, and still haven’t except for saying, “you may not get an answer at all, because like I said, we do not comment on our supply line.”  And they do not comment on why they do not comment. They’ve clearly been instructed not to reveal any actual information relating to the project.  Oh no, you are back to your old habit. This accusation makes no sense at all. Have you heard yourself? ""..they do not comment on why they do not comment"" ?!  You already revealed a full valid answer of them: We do not comment on our supply line"" - Guess what? because of competition. You don't tell your sources, if you want to compete in such a tough market.  Quote Another area of questioning they can’t get into is mining stats. They have their one MMU supposedly running in a warehouse somewhere (they won’t reveal where) and it’s confirmed that it’s not actually mining.  I keep it short: This MMU was showcased live in Berlin - Germany. There is even a video about it. Real people could go inside the real MMUs seeing it in action and noise. By the way there is also a video showing how good the MMU is at mining. Nothing to worry.  If you keep questioning the mining at all you are embarassing yourself. Just saying. Mining is far away from being rocket science. Furthermore, if you also questioning profitability, you might wanna take some classes in crypto mining. It will take you about 5 mins. to understand, that it's profitable.",False

I just realized I cant see the chat anymore because it looks like they banned me.  Some young investor was talking unrealistically about the Envion ICO going 10x or 20x when it hits the market and i tried to educate him and explain to him the difference between an ICO that might do that and Envion which is backed by Assets with a defined possible revenue and focusing on dividend payouts. Funny because I am a big supporter and investor in Envion and I have defended their business plan and spent more time to research them than most and it looks like they didnt like what I said, even though this person really might have benefited from some information and I talked positively about the companies outlook. Thats not cool, no mod even spoke to me. I guess they liked this guy pumping the 10x. I'll leave you with a quote from our young pumper, and again, Shame. Not sure if it was Laurent. Anyways, I am still an investor in the company. I'll just chalk it up to a mistake on Laurent's part.

An LOI is usually non-binding and contains a non-binding clause.    CAUTION:  If the LOI is binding, then it should be reviewed very carefully by an attorney, and the reasons for such a commitment need to be reviewed with extreme caution since the Letter has now become a contract.  The Scam: A Letter of Intent is just about always used in a High-Yield Investment Program scam.  The purpose of the Letter of Intent (LOI):  It provides the swindler with a means of eliciting a commitment from you.  Although the LOI is virtually useless since it is produced with the intent to defraud, nonetheless it is a means of forcing you to commit yourself to an action since you don't know fraud is involved.  It allows the swindler to use the LOI as a threat you start balking or is not moving fast enough.  It is used in Daisy Chains ad nauseam.  A Daisy Chain is a chain of brokers or intermediaries, especially in the UNDERGROUND NETWORK.  Each so-called broker, from the swindler on down, passes out LOI's like candy, supposedly to protect his spot in the commission structure.  It's all hogwash, but apart from the swindler himself, most of these people don't know that.  With each LOI comes a NON-CIRCUMVENTION NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (NCND), also as worthless as the paper it's written on since once again, the entire purpose of all these agreements is intent to defraud.  Just as a side note, any commissions received by one of these brokers/intermediaries are derived stolen funds.  I'm not saying Envion is a scam, but I would't get my hopes up on LOIs either. As I read it they are worth less than promises. More like reserving a spot for a possible investment, like whitelisting.",False

They can start so long with the money they already have, and thus they will have a few MMUs up and running by the time the ICO ends.  But I guess it is difficult as to who gets the funds raised then. When is the cutoff date to make sure you get the rewards of the MMU they build now? Surely those rewards must go the first couple of investors and not the later ones.

That's well known.  Segwit, Casper, etc. are intended to relieve the problems caused by things like Crypto Kitty. That doesn't really affect our business though.  First of all, this change will take place gradually, over a long period of time before it propagates to every different blockchain.  For example, the Casper PoS changeover for the Ethereum blockchain which is already underway will only affect single-digit percentages of that network through the end of 2018.  In the meantime, there will be years of profitable mining for many different coins.  Envion’s MMUs choose from a long list of coins to always mine the most profitably based on real-time market data.  Changes related to difficulty, PoS, etc affecting a single coin don’t affect profitability because we just switch to mining a different coin.  Looking into the future, we also see an opportunity in the massive wave of investment from enterprises in blockchain-based products and services.  When these projects come online in the next 2-5 years, they will need computing infrastructure to support their blockchain technologies.  That's where envion can provide a strong value as a blockchain infrastructure provider that is audited, regulated, and global.  Bosch, GE, etc. are not going to ask a mining farm in Mongolia to provide their computing infrastructure when envion can provide enterprise-grade service and the best pricing in the industry.  That is still a long-term outlook.  In the meantime, there are still years of profitable mining to come.",False

I would agree about getting a statement from them about how exactly they are getting them, that would be nice.

There was a previous post from one of their advisors that i read that said they had their miners already secured.

GPU's i dont think there are a shortage of. I just bought about 15 of them on black friday at a good price. I think a few key statements from them would be good. My hope is that they will announce something during the ico (probably when the coin cost is 1.00 not .70 cents because they want to maximize $ per coin), to boost sales. For instance they just announced the partnership with the royal family of Dubai. ENVION, we would appreciate any comments you could provide on specifically if you have secured ASIC miners specifically. (If they are actually reading this post)  -FOLLOW UP - so the company wont comment on wether they have ASIC miners, but do comment that they have GPU miners secured.. so that means they probably do not have them.

The Issuer is obliged to deduct this withholding tax on each payment and to forward the withholding tax to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration  That has nothing to do with the corporation. It has to do with YOUR taxation, they may withhold that tax because they assume you are paying taxes in Switzerland.

Apparently a company called Affinity Mining recently did an ICO. It had similarities to envion in that they intended to use renewable energy, use algorithms to calculate the most profitable coin, and distribute a certain portion of profits to token holders. What happened to this company?     See more here: https://affinitymining.io/  One could argue that Affinity made a mistake in investing in too many D3 units and that envion won't make this mistake. While that may be true, this brings up an important concern that will also affect envion. The vast majority of mining is done with industry standard equipment like Antminers or GPUs, and there is a worldwide shortage of these components. Antminers have been completely sold out, and GPUs are in tight supply with retailers limiting sales to only 1 or at most 2 per household. In order for envion to fulfill its goals, they'd need to somehow have not only priority access to these components, but priority access to a large volume of these components. How can envion, a newcomer with zero past experience in this space, be able to secure such priority access to such highly sought after components? What makes them so special compared to all the other retailers and mining companies, many who have been doing this for a long time? It just doesn't seem realistic to me.",False

Giga-Watt is a mining operation based in Washington state where there is access to cheap hydro-electric power. A big advantage of hydroelectric power is that it is a green energy source with 24/7 availability. As discussed earlier, other green energy sources like solar and wind will need to be supplemented with grid or diesel power, at least until battery technology comes down in cost.  In envion's whitepaper, they claim an average energy cost of $0.03 kWh. That's pretty cheap, but interestingly, Giga-Watt's energy cost is actually slightly less at $0.028 kWh (per page 9 of their whitepaper: https://wtt.cryptonomos.com/white-paper.pdf). Both these companies have essentially the same power costs, but Giga-Watt has all their facilities at one location. This is a huge advantage as it makes building, management, and maintenance of the miners vastly easier and more efficient. One of envion's supposed competitive advantages is that with their MMU pods, they can go anywhere in the world to where energy is cheapest. But why go through the risk and expense of chasing cheap energy costs around the world when you can just set up in one place and have an ultimately lower energy cost?  Giga-Watt also has a huge head start as they are already operational and continue to expand. They also seem to be much more transparent with investor communication - between their website and YouTube, there are literally dozens of photos and videos of their existing facility as well as expansion progress.  One of their biggest problems is... securing access to miners. They simply can't get enough of them. The lack of mining equipment supply is definitely a recurring theme and I don't see how envion will be able to overcome this.  I was originally planning to put a relatively large (for me) investment into the envion ICO. I was all prepared and ready to go (MetaMask set up, sufficient ETH secured, required documents in place including having to pay to get investor accreditation since I am in the US). Last night I went to bed with enough doubt that I decided I was willing to let the initial $0.70 window pass. Now with the additional info I'm finding this morning, I feel delaying my decision was the right thing to do. Unless someone (ideally directly from envion) can address what I feel are serious concerns (specifically, how does envion expect to gain priority access to a large volume of mining components?), then I will likely pass on this ICO.",False

Mining is very profitable. The thing about capitalism and supply and demand is that this gap is closed, in time. Unless there are barriers to entry such as patents that prevent this. This is looking down the road, at when the gap is closing - when that happens it will be about who can minimize their expenses to keep that margin. For now, all miner are gold. We don't know how long that will last, but I think its safe to say that there is a hefty profit that will still be there in 12 months. With increase in crypto value comes an increase in miners which causes an increase in the difficulty, which brings down the profitability of mining. It is this fine balance that we will carry into the future and will determine who makes money and for how long. Envion's business plan is to stay flexible and have ingenuity in their approach. They are funding this with an ICO to speed up the process and be first to market. The are looking to secure contracts that are win-win and will stay in place and hopefully grow over the next while. These contracts will lower the expense to a much lower amount than your typical mining farm and i believe this will allow Envion to remain in the mining game, perhaps above other typical mining farms. They are working on scenarios where companies pay THEM to mine in order to heat their facilities... with the narrowing of the gap though, profits decrease and other miners that cant compete will go offline, which increases profits, and such is the delicate balance. But for the near future, there is profit for everyone, and their speed will help them in growing an in returning our investment in a relatively short period of time. Its in Envion's hands now to execute. I'm pumped for it!",False

Also Tangle is proof of work still, its just built into the transaction when you send, as opposed to separate. I think blockchain is just in the beginning stages and will be around for a while.

You are invested into this ICO which makes you stand in a defensive position regarding very obvious facts.  A word about my background: I worked for 2 BIG4 companies in strategy/operational excellence within 6 different industries ranging from heavy manufacturers to financial services providers and I own a decent mining farm myself. Excuse me if I don't believe facts like ""well you know they said that they have..."" or ""theres an article on their website saying that..."" - these are no facts (especially for a person with my background), its just a bunch of words with no hard evidence behind them. I can make a website and type any statements in there - will you also believe all you see there?  Also, the majority of your arguments follow some broken logic, which makes me doubt your background and hence credibility of most of your assumptions, although there are a couple of valid points to take... It is obvious to me you are not miner yourself and your background is arts or economics at very best, you don't sem to completely undrestand core functions of a mining operations, you have little understanding of how mining brings money over the span last 2 years, so why continue this conversation, really, I don't intend to get personal here I'm just stating my point of view and facts that I know.  An example of what I mean: Me - ""Energy is not a deal braker for any serious mining operation, Envion is trying to solve the wrong issue, that was never there in the first place"" You - ""good, so we know envion has plenty of access to energy, check!""  I'm sorry, what?  Our conversation logic so far: You - ""How do you know what miners they are planning on using?"" Me - ""Read the whitepaper, it's all in there"" You - ""Tell me who needs to do his homework""  As you may remember (if you are really following Envion that closely) they promised audit on 1st of December and the ICO was supposed to start on 1st of December - this is a good practice gone wrong. I do wish you luck with this investment and I do believe Envion will make some profit, I'm just saying they have too ambitious goal to make up to.  Honestly, give me $2.7k and 3 weeks of time, I will assemble a rig that does make 177 mh/s in Ethash and you will start making 240% ROI/yr given current prices/difficulty in ETH (if we're talking ETH that is). I will assemble it from top-notch components (not the sheitteh 460s and unknown unstable mobos) and post-market consumables like RAM/HDD but I will never promise u a good return if the rigs are assembled from god knows what by some dudes in China. I have reviewed over a dozen of manufacturing contracts with Chinese ops and they usually result in about 40% manufacturing defects. This is an actual benchmark btw.  But... again, we can go debating for hours and its totally not worth it. Have a good day and good luck with this, just know there are better ways of spending your money.",False

Because this project is NOT like a normal ICO, where reaching the hard cap is needed to fully fund all the planned projects, Envion can buy more MMUs with more money raised, but whether they end up buying 50 MMUs or 150 MMUs, it does not impact whether the project can move forward.",False

If you say you follow Envion closely, look at the reviews they are given by profesesional ICO community (at best, reviewers give it 3 out of 5, some call it sketchy, its all in google, mate). What stops me from being invested in this is the fact that I have not seen a single person who is an actual miner on their team. Engineers? yes. Consultants? yes. Marketers? Hell yes. Miners? ... + the fact that they are compiling tons of low hashrate gpus + the fact that they want to buy millions of dollars worth of s9 (which as some forum mebers pointed out before is impossible due to shortage of supply we already have), how do you still believe they will make up to their promises? Have you seen a mockup of a business model? Geographical destinations for ""low-cost energy""? Cost mitigation plans (i.e. new more powerful asics on market, heavy increase in difficulty of mining, switching to lower cost grids, etc)? All I see is 1 mini-demo and a lot of marketing with broad words but no specifics (been discussed many times like hundreed pages ago).  3 more risk factors: - They promised a big4 audit by Dec1 like several months ago - where is it? - They promised a patent on their ""cooling system"" - where is it? - They just made about $21 mln in fundraising, but they got only a couple of engineers on board, who is going to assemble all of this in time to give you first payout in the end of January?  ""huge profitabiliy in mining"" - imagine what happens to profitability if someone pours $150 mln's worth of tech into the pool of 5-6 most profitable cryptocurrencies that yield 30-40% more than their lower-margin competitors. Do u even know what mining difficulty is? In just 2 months my etherium generation dropped by 20%, this is just an example. BTW, their current calculations do not account for crypto rates fluctuation and assume they are flat  Now, again, I'm not saying Envion is a scam, but I'm saying these people have no idea what they're doing and the promised 161%/yr ROI is not possible with this team and with this approach AND with these deadlines.

Yes, I know how to Google and I'm also aware of the various way to compensate for the sun not shining at night. I said as much in my post (e.g., batteries, grid, diesel). My question pertains more to what envion specifically plans to do.  A big part of the appeal of envion, at least for me, is that they are trying to use green power for mining. Solar is of course one of the leading sources of green power and is the main source that exhibits the ""excess capacity"" that envion references in their whitepaper. But if, for example, envion intends to use diesel generators at night to keep the miners running, then their operation won't be as green as I'd hope.  The best from a green/environmental standpoint would be to use batteries that would store excess solar energy from the day to use at night. However, as I mentioned in my original post, it doesn't appear that they've factored in such batteries into their cost of operations (as a data point, Tesla's 10 kWh Powerwall costs $3,500). This additional cost wouldn't necessarily mean that they can't be profitable, but it would mean that they won't be as profitable as initially expected if they didn't account for this.  Similarly, if they use electricity from the grid at night, that would be an additional cost which they may or may not have factored in.",False

Also, your other points are good ones. I've been mining for a little bit with both Hashflare as well as a home miner, and it does seem that it can be profitable even without super cheap electricity.

Part of conducting a securities-compliant ICO means there are VERY high security requirements from our credit card provider.  All cards must be enabled with 3D Secure authentication — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Secure $100 minimum transaction $5000 maximum transaction Card must be authorized by issuer  If you would like to make an investment over $5000, please contact us directly at ir@envion.org.  If you are still having trouble paying with credit card, you can contact support@envion.org.  Due to the high volume of requests, there might be a delay in responding and it might be faster to purchase ETH via Coinbase (https://www.coinbase.com) or Shapeshift (https://shapeshift.io) and transfer that to your MetaMask wallet (https://metamask.io/) prior to purchasing.  Envion is a rare ICO to accept so many payment types including fiat.  We hope you appreciate the efforts we've made to accommodate card purchases and we're sorry for  the inconvenience. ",False

I'm working in the field of renewable energies and therefore have been following this ICO regularly.  Today I told my coworker about the current hype with ICOs and he, who has been working with banks for the last 20 years, told me that it reminded him of 1999/early 2000s when people were throwing money at anything. He told me there was e.g. a company from Hongkong that said had invented tracking systems for trucks and were already selling products with a cash flow worth millions.  In the end it turned out the company had faked a great percentage of sales to their ""customers"" and hadn't even bothered to set up letterbox companies with the respective names they allegedly had sold these products to. The formerly acclaimed global yearly turnover of 93 million $ turned out to be more something like 1.5 million $.   With Envion what I have seen so far is that they don't have a working product yet.  Therefore there a few factors to consider if you want to assess the potential of their product: First, it's just a prototype at the moment, which therefore cannot have been tested under the many different working conditions yet that it has to endure if it is to be distributed globally. What about dusty, dry, hot, cold environments or everything in sequence within 24 hours, which happens if you put up a container next to a solar power plant in the desert.  Then the costs: - of the Envion mining equipment itself - the costs for transportation - the costs for maintenance if something stops working  The availability of: - cheap electricity - of trained people who maintain the equipment  and if there are no trained mainentance staff available: - the costs to hire and transport the staff to and from the mining site  Not even considering the initial investment cost, the advances in new mining hardware or the possible increase in network size and difficulty increase for many cryptos, the overall costs for running and maintenance will decide the profitability.  In my eyes this is why mining companies are located in Iceland and China. There is cheap electricity AND trained personnel available that does not have to travel around the globe to provide their service.  - And if there are other spots with even cheaper or nearly free electricity, why is it that they haven't been claimed yet? They have to be small niches which until now have not been interesting enough for the major players.   So either the niches Envion wants to exploit are small and if they are not the other factor, the costs for providing proper maintenance, is the reason that no one else is there yet.   If they put up their containers in Europe or the US they will find enough people capable to keep the systems running, but then, how are electricity prices there?   If you truly want cheap electricity it has to be produced at the lowest marginal costs possible, which in the long run means you have to go for renewables. However, medium and large power plants, like solar and wind, are only built if the demand or state subsidies will make this project economically feasible. In Germany, for example, the ROI for photovoltaic plants is around 12-14 years with the current state subsidy of around 0.11 €/kWh if you sell the electricity to the grid or even lower if you do not meet the criteria to receive the subsidies, which depends on the size of the plant.  So I wonder why a plant owner, at least in Germany or Europe, would want to sell electricity to Envion at a price which is lower than the one guaranteed by the state, which still is above market prices. And even if he doesn't receive the subsidies there is still a huge market he can sell electricity to at current market prices.  There is no reason why the plant owner should sell Envion electricity below market prices. Envion, of course, could buy at market prices but what would thein their edge be compared to other miners?  The next question is, how many plants there are that are desperate enough to sell their electricity below market prices or even below their marginal costs? This would entail e.g. power plants that were built without meeting the conditions of economic feasability in the first place, state projects that had to be abandoned due to increased costs, for example.  Envion doesn't provide any information where they think these potential niches are located. And if they know where they are, how big are they? As Envion wants to reinvest 25% of the returns into growing their infrastructure how long will it be until they run out of these yet unclaimed sources of cheap or free electricity.  Of course, if new niches appear on the planet, they can ship the containers to the other side of the globe. But how much is this going to cost compared to the earnings generated by their equipment during the available amount of time until that niche is closing again, e.g. as local demand in electricity goes up and the owner of the plant can charge other consumers higher prices than Envion? Does Envion hedge against this kind of risk or do they simply pack up under these circumstances and move somewhere else, which in turn causes new costs for transportation and set up at the new location?  The only long term feasible solution I can see at the moment is that Envion's (and any other) cryptomining is only profitable if marginal costs are driven as low as possible and stay that way. And places where these conditions are met are already occuppied (at least to a certain extent). So if Envion wants to be more profitable than other miners, they have to have lower costs than others and they have to avoid the additional costs, like moving and setting up equipment over and over or costs of transporting trained staff for maintenance.  Therefore, I see Envion's advantage against other miners, the mobility of their system also as its biggest Archilles heel as these additional costs will bite into their earnings. But if they want to reduce these costs, they will lose their advantage against other miners and will be just another mining company that moves to Iceland and buys electricity at market prices.  The only other feasible solution I see for profitable cryptomining is that Envion ensures low electricity prices by owning the power plant themselves and running their equipment on their own power. This would be the solution with the lowest marginal costs.  But then, why should you even bother with long term crypto mining using your own electricity when you could as well sell the electricity itself?   For me these questions are not answered or even asked.   What is definitely true is that the founders/members have already made a huge amount of money so far and I have to congratulate them on it. And if their product will prevail only time will show. It's just like in the good old dotcom times.",False

I agree, there are a lot of bogus ICO's out there, with some horrible white papers, Envion is not one of them   With Envion what I have seen so far is that they don't have a working product yet. They don't have a working product? I saw videos of their mining unit working, and also they mentioned testing it in a few environments  Therefore there a few factors to consider if you want to assess the potential of their product: First, it's just a prototype at the moment, which therefore cannot have been tested under the many different working conditions yet that it has to endure if it is to be distributed globally.

Then the costs: - of the Envion mining equipment itself - the costs for transportation - the costs for maintenance if something stops working  So I do GPU mining personally, and its pretty profitable and I don;t get good prices for my units. Envion will be getting much better pricing and also ASIC units that are more profitable in general, so they are off to a good start, I also pay horrible city prices for electricity and i still make good money. So Envion will at least be cutting costs from electricity and from hardware  The availability of: - cheap electricity - of trained people who maintain the equipment  and if there are no trained mainentance staff available: - the costs to hire and transport the staff to and from the mining site  Not even considering the initial investment cost, the advances in new mining hardware or the possible increase in network size and difficulty increase for many cryptos, the overall costs for running and maintenance will decide the profitability.  I agree, the one cost i dont incur that they will is the cost of staff and of transportation, and it is up to management to keep the minimal. I know for myself, i have barely touched my miners, they are fine once they are up and running, i do everything from remote management  In my eyes this is why mining companies are located in Iceland and China. There is cheap electricity AND trained personnel available that does not have to travel around the globe to provide their service.  - And if there are other spots with even cheaper or nearly free electricity, why is it that they haven't been claimed yet? They have to be small niches which until now have not been interesting enough for the major players.  Perhaps Envion is first to market in this regard, and even if they cant claim these cheap energy spots, they can just park the units where the other mining companies have their units and incur no additional costs, right?  So either the niches Envion wants to exploit are small and if they are not the other factor, the costs for providing proper maintenance, is the reason that no one else is there yet.   If they put up their containers in Europe or the US they will find enough people capable to keep the systems running, but then, how are electricity prices there? as I said, even with high city prices of electricity i am making decent money, it actually amazes me how much money is in mining, there are not many businesses where u make back all of your liabilities in less than a year and then some  If you truly want cheap electricity it has to be produced at the lowest marginal costs possible, which in the long run means you have to go for renewables.

There is no reason why the plant owner should sell Envion electricity below market prices. Envion, of course, could buy at market prices but what would thein their edge be compared to other miners?  Im not sure of the energy companies' motives either, but Envion already has LOI's from several companies, unless they are flat out lying which i find hard to believe given the quality of well known people involved   The next question is, how many plants there are that are desperate enough to sell their electricity below market prices or even below their marginal costs? This would entail e.g. power plants that were built without meeting the conditions of economic feasability in the first place, state projects that had to be abandoned due to increased costs, for example.  again, im not sure about this, i guess this is the gamble we are taking, but its not much of a gamble because they can just park the units anywhere,  as i said the profit margin is high... unless im missing something.. instead of 100% ROI in 8 months it will be 10 months.. not so bad  Envion doesn't provide any information where they think these potential niches are located. And if they know where they are, how big are they? As Envion wants to reinvest 25% of the returns into growing their infrastructure how long will it be until they run out of these yet unclaimed sources of cheap or free electricity. not sure, but im happy with my return even if they only fill the $130ish million  Of course, if new niches appear on the planet, they can ship the containers to the other side of the globe.

But if they want to reduce these costs, they will lose their advantage against other miners and will be just another mining company that moves to Iceland and buys electricity at market prices. again, that was my whole point.. go to iceland then, its crazy progit margins still  The only other feasible solution I see for profitable cryptomining is that Envion ensures low electricity prices by owning the power plant themselves and running their equipment on their own power. This would be the solution with the lowest marginal costs.  But then, why should you even bother with long term crypto mining using your own electricity when you could as well sell the electricity itself?   For me these questions are not answered or even asked.   What is definitely true is that the founders/members have already made a huge amount of money so far and I have to congratulate them on it. And if their product will prevail only time will show. It's just like in the good old dotcom times.  Bottom line is the profit margin is huge.. so any further benefits they deliver from just baseline mining is just a bonus. Im mining in a garage with cards bought from the local radioshack, per se, and my profits are a joke compared to other businesses (ie: not a 10% profit margin per year). I look forward to any further comments. I realize you are the energy expert, but they have experts on their team as well and i dont think they could have gotten this far and lied about contracts if they dont have something substantial and they have declared they are ready with assembly line and contracts",False

Right from the start, Envion did not state any restriction or exclusion for SG investment. In their write-up on the supported document for KYC submission, they even indicated SG Passport, National Identity or Driving License as relevant supporting documents for KYC submission. When the ICO open, Envion only then released the Subscription Agreement and Prospectus which state that SG investor is not allowed to participate. During ICO process, most SG investor may not tried to read through the  100 plus pages of subscription agreement and prospectus thoroughly to find that SG investor are to be excluded. The worst thing is that ICO payment setup process allowed the deduction of the ETH from the investors’ wallet before the completion of KYC process and document submission.  The questions to Envion are (1) why can’t Envion stated clearly upfront that SG investor are to be excluded from this ICO? (2) why can’t Envion release the Subscription Agreement and Prospectus earlier before the ICO open so that SG investors can read through the documents thoroughly and notice their ineligibility for participation before joining in the ICO? Would Envion have compromised anything to have these documents released earlier? (3) why did Envion allowed the deduction of the ETH funds from investors’ wallet before the submission of KYC documents and completion of verification check? SG investors have the the ETH payment upfront deducted from their wallet only to have their application rejected later for refund (which we are not even sure for now when the refund would take place)? There are also additional gas fee incurred for this transactions to the SG investors. This is a very silly ICO workflow design which incur unnecessary work and cost for the refunds later if the KYC profile failed.  We are extremely angered and disappointed by the entire ICO process that Envion have managed. For SG investors who have been following closely on this ICO, it has been a big waste of time and effort to follow and standby this project even when there are a lot of FUD surrounding it. For those Who joined the bounty program, they could also end up promoting this ICO for nothing in return! We strongly feel that Envion team do own an apology to all the ICO participating SG investors for the MISLEADING INFO!!  For now we demand that the Envion team read this message, respond fully to these queries with transparency and process our ETH refund as soon as possible for us to move on. If not, this episode would reflect badly on Envion team and its investors relations!  From a group of very angry and disappointed SG investors   ",False

I'm reasonably convinced at this point that envion is not a scam (of course you can never know for sure), but am not yet convinced that it will be a good investment.  One of the things that has bothered me is how envion plans to utilize solar. Solar is great of course, offering plentiful (in certain areas) and cheap electricity, but what happens at night? Even if you can use cheap solar power during the day, the business can't afford to have miners idling for half of every day.  One solution would be to use battery packs to collect and store electricity from the solar panels for evening use. However, this would require additional and costly equipment (for reference, Tesla's 10 kWh Powerwall costs $3,500). I don't think this is factored in to either the fixed or variable costs listed in the white paper (page 60).  Can the envion rep on this forum help shed some light on this concern?",False

ICOs don't really exist in the legitimate financial world right now, but envion worked with our legal team to find terms that would make an ICO possible now and viable into the future.  The redemption is not a buy back or a repurchase per se. It allows a refund to the purchaser up to 99.9% which means that you would be refunded your investment, but you would keep the ownership of your token and hence continue to receive the full value of the dividends entitled to you as the owner of that token.  We will elaborate on this concept in a blog post so that it's very clear how the financial instrument works and relates to the concept of ICOs.

In general, a hallmark sign of noobs being played is when you get these outrageous proposals for ROI that your average person buying an ICO token would have no clue how to interpret because they lack sufficient technical and economic background to understand what's going on.  In a perfectly competitive environment there will be zero profits. That means you put in 100% you get back 100% due to a perfectly competitive environment. That doesn't mean nobody makes money. It just means at the end of the day the aggregate profits and losses in the market add up to zero. Given that Envion is competing based on energy costs, there advantages are slim due to the high number of entities using energy arbitrage as an advantage. In order to truly gain an advantage you would need to develop the next ASIC or the next node for a graphics card, both of which are insanely difficult and costly and also highly competitive.  In a low or negative interest rate type of environment, such as where your funding comes from an ICO at little to no risk from the founding party the competitive environment could be a ""negative"" surplus environment where everyone puts in 100% and on average everyone gets back less than 100% due to excessive competition. For example, if the market supports $0 profit in a perfectly competitive environment with 10 players you might invest $1000 and get $1000 back. But if even one more entrant enters the market then you suddenly have 11 players competing for $10,000. Unless the market grows to $11,000 then your average return per player becomes $909. Many markets suffer from this deflationary expectation and with crypto you generally don't have this problem, but over the short term, should too much competition enter the market with too much funding/easy money supporting it you could see a very problematic situation, aka a mining bubble (not a crypto asset bubble).  In order for mining to increase in profitability you need increasing levels of transaction volume. So if volumes stay at X but miner hash rate goes from Y to 2Y the difficulty level will increase and returns will go from Z to Z/2, i.e. half. You can see for example how Antminer D3s (and their competitors from Inno and Pinidea) significantly distorted the market from around July 2017 to now by exponentially increasing the hash rate in a way that far exceeded the growth in transaction volume. Miner profitability is dependent on a high rate of transaction volume growth.  Envion cannot control transaction volume growth. There are NO GUARANTEED returns in mining. They can take your money, build MMUs and if their competition is simultaneously increasing network hash rate in a similar manner mining the same coins while transaction volume stays flat or declines then profitability will stay flat or decline.  In a worst case scenario, which we have seen before, mining collapses entirely as you get a combination of 1) rapidly falling prices 2) rapidly declining transaction volume 3) rapidly declining mining profitability.  We have seen very significant and sudden price declines in the past year due to liquidity issues and if such a decline were to be sustained you could see serious problems with the Envion model.  Just think about it. Russian players want to invest $100 M in mining. Japanese players are probably investing closer to $500 M in mining and mining hardware.  This project is up against a lot of competition. Unless someone has done the calculations showing probabilities of these various outcomes and scenarios I think generally speaking, investing in an ICO for mining is much higher risk than say, buying cloud mining or investing in a few machines and throwing them into a colo data center or your basement where you can start generating a return IMMEDIATELY.  Time is critical when mining. You shouldn't bet on something that doesn't exist yet because as we've found out from the past (google KNC miner, CoinTerra, Butterfly Labs) if you're not putting your money to work right now, the risks change in crypto so fast that by the time your money is going to work, it could be worth a lot less than when you had originally invested in it simply due to changes in market conditions that you failed to anticipate.  I have no problems with concepts like this but I think they're much higher risk than what most people understand due to the extremely high capital intensive investment required and the time, labor, and transactional (i.e. hiring/HR/admin/licensing, environmental, permitting) cost needed to develop that capital. There are serious supply chain (logistics) hurdles that I haven't even discussed, but I can assure you that if you are missing even a power cord, ethernet cable, PDU, PSU, circuit breaker, etc. then you can't do anything with the rest of the your equipment or you suffer losses or diminished returns while waiting for whatever you need.",False

You have to have an ambitious goal to drive the success of your business. I think envion is starting at the right time with the right size. Everything below would mean they are just too small to be considered by energy supplier/plants and so on.  You are right: They have to deliver, they have to prove themselves being capable of doing this business. This team will proof everything. They will deliver. I am highly convinced.  Why not building more MMUs? I think it's always the question of time, budget, performance/quality. Having a dozen of MMUs already up and running could have caught attention.

I have built mining containers myself and, it takes a while to build them and you need to order electrical appliances that are not available easy at all times.  To build 200 pcs/month is total nonsense, you would need about 700 people with experience  to do that and there is no hardware readily available for them, especially transformators.  Also they act like every powerstation has transformators ready for theyr mining containers. This is untrue, almost no power station has this available because there is no need and the invetsment can be up to 30K USD for a transformator and cabling.  On top, in most countries there is no way you could put up a container somewhere, either because in northern developed countries you are not allowed to do so, and in southern countries its to cold to do this, no matter what cooling system you use because if outside temperature is 40, asics want work no matter how much air you move,  Last but not least, excess energy, give me a break, this happens like 50 hrs / year and you can check this on EEX, its nonsense, do they realy believe people are so stupid to build a powerstation for millions and then find out nobody needs the energy ? There is an exchange for electricity and energy has its price. Also the highest price for energy is paid for regular electricity which is what they need.  Also the standard way to build a container as done by many other companies holds about 150 miners with like 1200 GPU and not 60 with only 500 GPU. . About the 161% I have posted earlier, there is no f.. way to make these returns for you guys, please use your brain, there is a reason they ban everybody and do not allow to check or discuss the calculation",False

Because if you do not build up and have it running by say January, you will need to pay dividens from your capital and then what you become is a ponzi scheme, If you only raise 10 Mio USD, you will need for example 6000 s9 miners delivered in January, in order to do so, you must have paid and ordered them back in October, otherwise you need to buy on the secondary market for double the price, then the calculation does not work anymore.

This ETH will then be paid out to the ENV tokenholders on a weekly basis according to the amount of token they hold. ICO's that have a profit sharing model have different ways to share the profit with their investors.

Laurent will welcome you. He can answer every question. Study the whitepaper and ask whatever you want.  https://t.me/Envion  Summing up some FAQ:  - ROI is always based on the initial 1$ per Token. No matter how far the tokens dropping when hitting exchanges (they won't) you will receive the same ROI - Tokens considered to be the first real security. BaFin and SEC compliant. - Neither Tokens will give you shares of the company nor you possess parts of the hardware. - The tokens will give the right to get profits from the mining. Based on how much tokens you are holding envion will pay you dividends (profit of the mining) - These dividends will be paid in ETH. So you basically give Envion your ETH public wallet address and ENVION will pay dividends automatically through a smart contract,False

Laurent was so kind to handover the questions and I will just post them here:  Quote 1) Your MMU has a patented airflow design. Looking over the people on your team, I cannot figure out who has the technical expertise to come up with this. Did you license this IP from a third-party? If you developed it in-house, can you answer who on your has the expertise to come up with this design?   Our IP for the cooling system and our other innovations was all developed in-house.  Our cross-disciplinary teams worked closely together during the initial stages of development with many team members contributing to a number of different features, including the cooling system.  The team leaders you see on the website were supported by additional engineers and industrial designers—with everyone pitching in wherever it was needed.  Quote 2) Was Jonathan Koch the one who programmed the Envion OS?  As far as I know, he was not deeply involved in that team.  Quote 3) Are you manufacturing the MMUs yourself or do you have a contract with a third party? If you cannot disclose the identity of the third party, can you notarize that this infrastructure is in place and terms are already agreed?  Different third-party manufacturers will be responsible for different aspects of production according to the very specific work that must be done for each part.  We will not be notarizing every part of the production line, nor do we think that is necessary.  An intrepid member of the Telegram channel did some great due diligence and followed up with team member and global supply chain expert, Seif Mousaied Shieshakly, to discuss the envion production line.  His comments demonstrate our level of preparation for January production.   https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2348435.msg24716291#msg24716291  Quote 4) Is your ASIC and GPU supply chain secured with terms already agreed? If so, can you release a notarized statement to that effect?  We have agreements with a number of suppliers.  As with the last question, we will not be notarizing every part of the production line.  We have not experienced any difficulty whatsoever in sourcing GPUs and ASICs.  The shortages you may have heard of are retail shortages; supply is plentiful for buyers with multi-million-dollar orders.  Quote 5) It seems like you have been working on this project for a long time, yet your corporate registry shows that you came into existence in October. Can you explain this discrepancy?  I have been working with envion since October and have not represented anything other than that.  There are numerous posts on Telegram where I indicate this. My involvement began just prior to the ICO to help manage the community relations.   Quote 6) Who is Cyrill Alexander Stäger and why is he not listed on your team page?  Cyrill Stäger is responsible for compliance with Swiss laws and regulations.  He manages the communication with the Swiss financial regulator, coordinates accounting and auditing, and is responsible for administration and back office.  The team page doesn’t show every single employee at envion.  It gives you an impression of the quality of the team leadership and main contributors.  Many team members prefer to concentrate fully on their work and without the distraction of outside contact requests.  Quote 7) If your prototype is really functional, why are you unable to provide realtime mining statistics on your dashboard?  The dashboard is just there as an example of what the dashboard looks like—not performance data.  We have provided statistics on the functioning of the MMU and invited community members to see it live in operation.  The envion team uses the functional MMUs for further optimization and the testing of new configurations for more specialized installations and applications.  Live statistics would not necessarily be representative of the performance expected in normal operations and could be confusing for those without mining expertise.  We have provided normal performance data here: https://medium.com/@envion/exemplary-hardware-specifications-kpis-of-envions-mmu-ff5fb77cd5da",False

See the CEO's background. Envion hasn't provided the exact details of the deals they've signed, claiming it's for business reasons. This seems like a reasonable claim to me, but its up to each and every person to decide if they want to trust Envion on this. K3 - The 23% price difference you pointed out can be explained when thinking of large batch orders. K13 - The key to solving this is signing deals with miner suppliers to secure next generation miners first and fast. Envion claims they did this, and again it's plausible considering the high volume of purchase orders they will expect to make. Regarding switching - they claim that their software will be able to monitor mining profitability on all coins and switch between them as needed. It's not that complex to implement and I'm sure all big miners do it. It's true that they will need to mine large coins mostly but if BTC/ETC falls and there is no other large coin around to take their place, that probably means that the whole cryptocurrency world collapsed. The common ground of all investors should be a belief in the future of blockchain technologies. I'm saying blockchain and not cryptocurrency, because even if cryptocurrency will not be mined directly anymore in the future, there will still be blockchains around that will need mining for other reasons (to run decentralized apps most probably) and these will have to award miners with different coins. F - I'm not an energy expert, but regarding the shipping - the first containers will be shipped to the nearest sites around Germany, probably by truck, so $1000 transportation and insurance seems reasonable.  Again, I'm not from envion, so admins will need to confirm and fill the holes.  Remember that Envion also calculated BTC price of $8K/BTC while we are over $11K/BTC now. If this price persists or even rises, it would lead to a higher profit than 161% ROI or at least will cover some of the other issues that worry you.",False

We were discussing this very exact issue yesterday and wanted to post/ask it - but now we have the answer.  I do have one other question if you don't mind answering: As we have more MMUs running, the difficulty level of mining will probably increase. If we sell more MMUs to third parties, the mining difficulty will increase more and more. Is there some ""sweet spot"" where you will level off with the selling and production of more MMUs in order for your existing MMUs to remain effective and profitable? I know its difficult to answer as we know difficulty will increase anyway - whether Envion is there or not, but obviously we don't want to hang ourself with our own rope. If this questions has already been asked, I apologise for the repetition, just show me the link and I will read the answer there. Thanx  ",False

I think the issue is less of a sweet spot in terms of planning for difficulty than the eventual growth in other blockchain infrastructure needs.  As mining becomes less profitable, other uses for our computational infrastructure will be more cost effective.  Whatever service the PO MMU's provide will bring profits to token holders.  Billions of dollars are being invested into blockchain technologies and they will all need reliable, enterprise-grade hardware infrastructure.  However, that's still far in the future.  We have already calculated difficulty into our model and you can see the Mining Excellence section of the whitepaper for more details.  Since we are capable of mining many different coins, we can also just mine what is profitable with the equipment we have.

I have no time to go every over every aspect of calculation so I just pick a few:   A3) Average local energy prices, very very unlikely, on EEX ist 0.0435 on average and taxes are not included here so why would anybody offer you energy for less, anyway it will not make a large difference.  K3) Cost of an ASIC miner: 1945 USD, at least in Germany its impossible, since, including the PSU this is the price in China if you are very lucky. Then you need to fly it somewhere, pay customs, and especially VAT within Europe which you do not get back because the end product (cryptocurrencies) has no VAT on top. So the price of an ASIC is currently or a month ago more like 2400 USD.  K13) This is total nonsense, the mining profit decreases every month and will most probably reach zero profitability within 2 years. I am mining for many years and on average your profit will be about 50% per year and this only after quite some time when you dealt with many problems already. When the next generation of miners comes to the market earlier your hardware will be useless even faster than 2 years. https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty  Also when profitability for ETH or Bitcoin drops dramatically then, with a large mining facility you cannot just switch to other coins.  Sure you can mine Einsteinium, no Problem, but with 1000 MMUS not, you cannot do it with some small coins you need to mine large coins and you will run into this problems just like now.  F) These costs are very unlikely, shipping a container 1000 USD ?, from where to where, usually even insurance cost more just for a short ride. Energy components, if you want to be safe is definitely more and don't forget, power stations don't have 50,100 or whatever KW plugs hanging around, you need to install transformators there for this purpose and long cables with large diameters made from copper, they can cost 20K USD easily for a single container. What about the cost of disposing of the units after lifetime, where is the insurance for transport, for the container and for the power station in case your equipment destroys it?  X) 1000 MMU´s that will require a shitload of people, handling, and organizing, bookkeeping, legal departments, monitoring and more.",False

Always looking for good investment, but I am still not convinced. Just wanna say that I am blocked to on your Telegram, your people there are very impolite, they do not answer my question and kicked me out. I was very friendly, but I guess you have something to hide.  I do not think your company is a scam, but I am convinced you are in over your head. I expect delays and broken promises. Maybe in one year your company will be interesting to invest in...  Postponing an ICO is a very bad sign in my opinion... Serious business keeps its deadlines.  That is very nice that you have a ´big bank´investing in crypto, good for you. Would be nice to know which bank! Especially when we in the crypto world know how banks are big fans of cryptocurrency.  Secondly still no answer on where your metal boxes with hot miners will be stationed. Are you planning on putting some next to solar power plant some where with a lot of sun? Where it is hot and not 26 °C, the temperature you mention in WP. Before you say, read the white paper, I have. You talk about using the heat for other purposes but how about performance in hot and humid area´s. Do you have any test done? Where are the results?  WP says: ´Converting our MMU’s waste heat into a system where thermal energy is useful provides savings which are directly proportional to the amount of electrical energy being converted by the MMU. Heating expenses, before and after installation of a MMU inside a heated warehouse or greenhouse, can thus be easily assessed and the savings on heating the building can be directly deducted from the MMU’s electricity bill. This creates another unique competitive advantage for the envion MMU over conventional mining farms, which are typically installed in remote areas and thus unable to recycle their massive amounts of thermal energy.´  So you gonna put the MMU inside buildings? Who is gonna pay for that?   Secondly, are you putting people, engineers in the containers for maintaining the facility? WP says ´There are fully automated systems in place which detect defective rigs, based on IP address and rig denotations, so that any maintenance worker is able to locate defective hardware within a very limited amount of time.´  So if you have ANY mining experience you should know that a person on the ground is mandatory. All your WP says, you have fancy sensors, but who is going to fix the miners that are broken? Where are your engineers located? Who is paying them?  Last, your WP claims you can fit up to 96 ASIC miners in one MMU( container), so what is going to happen when this miners are outdated? In the current situation it is very likely that every 6  to 9 months new companies will come with more efficient miners. So if a miner would cost 1000$ (very optimistic projection) you will have to spend 96 000 $ to update your MMU. Who is paying that?      ",False

The answers to all these questions are on Telegram. You would still be able to look them up if you hadn't been hostile and had group members ask that you be banned.  It's an unfortunate trend that people who cannot be civil on Telegram come to bitcointalk to air their grievances. Asking nicely is a much easier alternative.  But here we are, so here goes:  POSTPONING Postponing was a no-brainer. We're looking at deals that could rival the size of our ICO and bring greater returns to every token holder.  Nobody who manages to get a token on the 15th is going to second-guess that decision.  BANK INFO We'll give evidence of the cooperation in the coming days even if we can't give the bank name.  This is big news for us and a top priority.  TEMPERATURE EXTREMES Our MMUs work at VERY low temp with outside temperatures in a normal range.  Our testing shows that it will work in 40C. Also, if we need to retrofit a container for a special installation location, then we'll do that.  We plan on a number of customization to deal with environmental factors, not just temperature.  For example, our latest innovations have to do with shock since micro vibrations can affect chips in the long term.  Right now we have the luxury of choice of where in the world we install. These edge cases are a non-issue to profitability. For some reason, people think the company can't make money because there exist places in the world where X occurs.  We just won't take those deals if we can't figure out a way to make money. There are plenty of offers where we can do just fine.  HEATING Our operating unit is currently inside a factory providing winter heat.   MAINTENANCE Anyone can put GPUs in a box and call it a mining unit.  Our innovation is that we use the same processes that industry uses to design for maintenance, for production lines, and for remote operation.  If you are comparing envion to random miners operating in a random corner of the world and not enterprises like Bosch or Samsung, then you don't grasp how we operate.  The MMUs are designed to be as low maintenance as possible.  Even thought they are close to zero maintenance, our first customers will host large arrays of dozens of MMUs—places where it will be cost effective to have maintenance personnel on duty or where power plant personnel can be trained to perform routine activities.   Eventually, we will engineer all of the remaining manual maintenance activities out of the design and it will be possible to install a single unit somewhere where maintenance personnel is not available.  Again, for now we have the luxury of choice and all the calculations for this are in the ROI details we've published.  HARDWARE REPLACEMENT Our calculations include regular hardware replacements due to bad miners or occasional burn out.  More importantly, our mining software makes those replacements much less likely.   When the hardware is no longer able to mine profitably, then we use it for something else.  Large enterprises as well as startups are investing billions into blockchain technologies and the computational power from these miners can be used to provide the physical infrastructure these businesses rely on.  The cost of the container itself is marginal compared to the GPU/ASIC price.  When they are completely obsolete and cannot provide any more value, the entire unit will simply be replaced.  That's part of what the 25% reinvestment is about—growth and deprecated MMU replacement.  That is all part of the ROI calculations.  CLOSING In the future, when you come to our community channels, be polite.  Search the existing content for answers and ask any unanswered questions nicely.

All they keep reapeting is, and I will put it in simple words:   ""read the white paper, everything is in there. We are professionals, we know what we do, stop asking stupid questions. Trust us, give us our money.""    It is fine to explain to noobs  on Telegram how they can transfer their money to you, but I want answers to my questions. __ POSTPONING Postponing was a no-brainer. We're looking at deals that could rival the size of our ICO and bring greater returns to every token holder.  Nobody who manages to get a token on the 15th is going to second-guess that decision.  --> no real content here. So one day before the ICO should begin, you have new deals, but no info on what deal. We should just trust you and wait for it. Will do! Very curious. I think you didn't´t get enough fishes. ___ BANK INFO We'll give evidence of the cooperation in the coming days even if we can't give the bank name.  This is big news for us and a top priority.  --> again no content. So we will never know which bank it is. We will just have to trust you. I will be waiting for your evidence. __ TEMPERATURE EXTREMES Our MMUs work at VERY low temp with outside temperatures in a normal range.  Our testing shows that it will work in 40C. Also, if we need to retrofit a container for a special installation location, then we'll do that.  --> I will repeat my question form previous two posts. Where are these test? Where are these results? in you white paper you have fancy sketches and pictures. Why can´t we see these tests? This is the deal breaker for me. I want the data, show it if you are legit! __ Right now we have the luxury of choice of where in the world we install. These edge cases are a non-issue to profitability. For some reason, people think the company can't make money because there exist places in the world where X occurs.  We just won't take those deals if we can't figure out a way to make money. There are plenty of offers where we can do just fine.  ---> So let me quote your white paper in case you forgot:  ""...This process has gone even further. In India, Chile and the Middle East, PV plants get paid as little as $0.03 to $0.04 Cents (USD) per kWh generated, which is only a slightly more than the price of dirty coal power..."" and  "" ... Once built, they are tied to their location and might lose competitiveness to other locations if price structures change. While new market conditions might be lethal for traditional data centers, they offer vast opportunities for the global,  exible and intelligent mining operation that envion is launching now...""  So I read: in India, Chile, Middle East and also California, there is cheap electricity for now, and your MMU will be moved to location where this cheaper power is available so to this hot countries. And you are saying ""we just won´t take deals if we can figure out"". What is it now? Have you or have you not figured it out? It reads in the white paper as, you have figured everything out, and you´re willing to move your MMUs to places like this. Why use this places like an example if you re not gonna move MMUs there.  Now you are saying ""people think the company...."". Yes I think, I am people. ___ HEATING Our operating unit is currently inside a factory providing winter heat.    --> Do you have a big demand on heaters for factories? Do you have deals? Can you provide more info on that? __ MAINTENANCE Anyone can put GPUs in a box and call it a mining unit.  Our innovation is that we use the same processes that industry uses to design for maintenance, for production lines, and for remote operation.  If you are comparing envion to random miners operating in a random corner of the world and not enterprises like Bosch or Samsung, then you don't grasp how we operate.  ---> Yes, correct. I don´t grasp how you operate. That is exactly why I have asked you this questions. Furthermore just so you know, there are already many multibillion industrial mining farms around the world. I know this because I have seen them with my own eyes or footage of them. From your company I have seen two youtube videos of a container with holes in it and two small fans on the sides... ___ The MMUs are designed to be as low maintenance as possible.  Even thought they are close to zero maintenance, our first customers will host large arrays of dozens of MMUs—places where it will be cost effective to have maintenance personnel on duty or where power plant personnel can be trained to perform routine activities.    --> This is my favourite part of your reply. So your answer to my question, where the engineer or IT guys will be, inside the container or sitting outside somewhere, or traveling. Your answer is, power plant personal will be trained? lol And I also like the part where you have customers who will put miners in dozens of MMUs. One MMU fits about 90 ASICS so >1000 ASICS will come your way. Do you have a timeline when this dozens of MMUs are going to be released? Do you already have such customers who have over 1000 ASIC ready to put in a container? ____ Eventually, we will engineer all of the remaining manual maintenance activities out of the design and it will be possible to install a single unit somewhere where maintenance personnel is not available.  Again, for now we have the luxury of choice and all the calculations for this are in the ROI details we've published.  --> I can not believe my eyes! So you are telling, you are going to monitor (realistic), control (realistic) and maintain (NOT realistic) over 90 miners from a distance? But until you get there ""eventually"" you will have the power plant guys do it? Hmmm good very satisfying response. ____ HARDWARE REPLACEMENT Our calculations include regular hardware replacements due to bad miners or occasional burn out.  More importantly, our mining software makes those replacements much less likely.    --> This is maybe the biggest invention and news. So you have software which will compensate for inferior hardware? So if GMO manages to make 7nm chips and miners come out. You have 100 000 USD ready for replacement ? Or is your software going to compensate? ____ When the hardware is no longer able to mine profitably, then we use it for something else. Large enterprises as well as startups are investing billions into blockchain technologies and the computational power from these miners can be used to provide the physical infrastructure these businesses rely on.  The cost of the container itself is marginal compared to the GPU/ASIC price.  When they are completely obsolete and cannot provide any more value, the entire unit will simply be replaced.  That's part of what the 25% reinvestment is about—growth and deprecated MMU replacement.  That is all part of the ROI calculations.  --> Yes throw some more ""billions and millions"" I guess the greedy noobs really like that. 25% will cover the cost of 100 000USD new mining hardware you will need every year for each MMU? You probably have heard of technological singularity ? Yes Blockchain is big business now already and everyone wants a piece. If you are in crypto for several years and have witnessed the parabolic growth, not just of price of crypto, but advances in mining hardware. Then you will get my point, your MMUs with a price tag of 100 000 are too expensive! I expect hardware updates will be needed at least once a year. This means the cost of a MMU will be double of what you expect it to. So all your calculation and 25% is not going to make it.  My Conclusion: This is all my personal opinion.  Everyone is free to invest in what they want. Everyone is free to their opinion. This is why this kind of forum exists. If you do not want people asking questions or being critical, then you do not know the mindset of the core supporters of crypto. Then just ran adds on google as click bate.  For people new in crypto, watch out, do your own thinking and invest only that what you can afford loosing. I do not think Envion is a scam. The idea of mobile mining solutions sounds nice. But the question is, when there are already big mining facilities function and offer   0.03 or 0.04USD power cost and offer maintenance of miners, offer professional engineers working on the project. People who mined before some of this guys of Envion even knew what Bitcoin was. Why take the risk with Envion? For me this guys do not bring real answers, they are common salesman. Just repeating sentences with no reals content, trying to get a piece of the cake.  I rather by coins and HODL!   P.S.

The ICO is essential to the success of envion, but the envion machine has more moving parts to it.  Envion distributes 100% of profits from Proprietary Operations (PO)—where envion owns and operates Mobile Mining Units—with our token holders.  If that were the only line of business, there would be no money to run the company.  The other part of the business is Third-Party Operations (TPO)—where a customer purchases MMUs and envion operates and maintains the mining units.  Envion distributes 35% of profits from TPO mining operations.  This has always been where envion's operating revenue comes from.  There are some important things to note about the difference between these two revenue streams:  First, the growth rate for PO is more or less fixed because there is a one-time investment, the ICO, and a 25% reinvestment policy that written into the smart contract.  Once the production run of PO MMUs financed by the ICO are deployed, growth will be steady at 25% forever.  Second, the growth rate for TPO is not fixed.  The more customers that want to purchase MMUs, the greater the growth of profits for envion AND for token holders who earn 35% of the TPO mining operations revenue.  This growth rate is infinite and PO is isolated from it.  That means if it grows, token holders earn more money. If it shrinks, PO will never be threatened—they are two separate business arms and, as indicated in the whitepaper, a separate business entity—a subsidiary of envion AG—will even be created to manage PO.  Lastly and most importantly, these are not two competing business divisions.  The PO MMUs will be the first to roll of the production line and the first to be deployed and installed.  The TPO units will only help to further corner the market and assure that envion gets the best deals, continues to innovate our product, and becomes and indispensable service provider to blockchain-dependent industries.  So this is a positive development for token holders.  More investment in the company means a healthier envion and a larger TPO operation which will increase dividends.  That was always part of the plan and now it's just happening faster than we could have imagined.  Tl:dr Token holders profit's are fixed for PO.  TPO growth is unlimited and token holders get 35% of TPO mining operations—that's the part that will scale much faster via these new deals.  There is no competition between the two.",False

We encourage everyone to be skeptical and to do their due diligence.  We hope that includes reading all the information we publish.  You have a certain idea of how mining should be done and it's clearly very different from the enterprise model that we have created.  Our goals are different and our team and designs reflect that.    Our approach is a very German approach to mining with a laser focus on efficiency, simplicity, and thorough design of processes and components.  We don't just have data center engineers, but professionals who apply their expertise to every aspect of the business from logistics, to parts design, to business data processing. That doesn't dilute the expertise we bring to mining, it enhances the viability of our mining expertise to be profitable in the long-term and with more diverse use cases and operating conditions. We are creating an industrial product and not trying to convince anyone otherwise.",False

Tokens are generated instantly when your payment is received.  If there are no more tokens, then your transaction will not be completed and your ether will be refunded to you instantly.   I have an update on KYC process and registration:  Whitelisted users should be able to pre-register by the end of next week.  You will also be able to start KYC process.  For 90% of users, that will be almost instant.  For the remaining 10%, that could take 1-2 days depending on the number of requests congesting the system.  A very small number might need to be manually verified and that could take longer.  The accreditation process for US and German investors will take a bit longer as eligibility will need to be manually reviewed—that could take 1-2 weeks.  For users coming to the website for the first time on the day of the sale, the registration process will not include a verification email and you can go straight to purchase.  After you've made your purchase, you can follow the status of your purchase on your dashboard.  It will be clear that your tokens have been generated for you and are locked until you pass all the KYC/AML (and possibly accreditation) checks.",False

Large institutions, among them sovereign funds and one of the largest banks of the world approached us with very large deals in the weeks following envion’s ICO announcement. A prerequisite to these partnerships is that envion meets the same high level of compliance with securities laws that these customers are used to. We decided to meet even higher standards and an international, cross-border old economy compatible prospectus to take advantage of these offers.  We are still coordinating with different law firms in many jurisdictions to prepare our prospectuses. Even though it is not required to have these prospectuses to conduct our ICO, envion has decided to act in the best interest of token holders and change the ICO start date to ensure that the deals described above can be closed without delay. Advantages for token holders:      • Swiss users can take part in the ICO without restriction     • EVN tokens should be tradable at official and licensed US exchanges     • Banks and other financial institutions can more easily create cooperation models with envion and increase token holder profits     • envion lays the foundation for top-level cooperations     • EVN token on the way to be the best regulated security token so far — broader market — higher value potential     • Even better ROI due to Third-Party Operation business  NEW ICO DATES FOR THE ENVION ICO  Envion is sure that the inconvenience of waiting a few days to invest will not outweigh the great positive factors. To make sure our trusted ICO community does not get overshadowed by these big players, we will not involve them in the ICO, but instead have them participate later to follow through on our approach of decentralization by widest possible participation. Also, production and deployment of MMUs from the ICO will come first, before any others. We want to remind you that the start date is the only change to the ICO. Everything else will remain the same:      • the terms of the ICO     • tokens and smart contracts     • dividend payouts     • envion’s Mobile Mining Units     • the dates for production and payouts.  Moving up the compliance ladder will attract larger tickets and strengthen envion and your investment. Future top level cooperations are advantageous for token holders because it increases envion’s competitiveness and expands the potential of Third-Party Operations to grow in scale — the business division with the largest potential for long-term profits where token holders get an additional percentage from, which is not included in the calculations we have shown. Top-level cooperation benefits      • Greater global market share attracts better deals for higher profits     • More resources to invest in innovation     • Finance business development  Envion is a startup on the path to becoming a global enterprise. The envion team has faith that the 70,000 investors registered for the presale, the 7,000-strong Telegram community, and our one million website visitors — in just one month! — will see the wisdom of this decision and meet us for an even bigger ICO pre-sale on December 15th.",False

BUT if we believe that somehow they have solved this problem, then comes point 2. 2. so how is this gonna work went you put your metal boxes next to solar panels, I presume this will be somewhere where there is a lot of sun (again hot outside, hot inside). 3. the limitations or exclusion of citizens of countries that can sue their asses.

And you lie here many peoples with a children Storry. So stop kidding and be honest, or see end of this Week a Mail to the FINMA and a Display on the swiss Police!

If you have ETH that is worth $100 and one token = $1 (discount not included) you will get 100 EVN tokens. Therefore this model is far better than 1 ETH = 500 EVN tokens because of the fluctuation of the price.  So if you want to invest $100 you will get $100 worth of tokens. Easy as that.  At time you buy the actual rate of market price will be used.  Yes, you buy BTC or ETH at kraken, send it to a ERC20 compatible wallet (myetherwallet or metamask for example), send it from your etherwallet (no exchange wallet) to Envion, get EVN tokens into your etherwallet.  ETH (dividend) paid out to the wallet that holds EVN tokens. You can send that ETH to any exchange and change it in fiat or whatever you want.   If you buy with credit card there will be a locking period. Once you pay with credit card, the tokens would be blocked for you. Once you pass  KYC, they would be on hold until the charge back period elapses. The chargeback period may be up to a month (or longer) as it depends on your card company.

Here's what I mean...  The cryptocurrency mining industry is an extremely competitive one. This is clearly visible when looking at the scarcity of GPUs and ASIC miners - you need to order these months in advance to get your hands on one. Mining is becoming more and more lucrative every day, and will only become more lucrative with the rise in Bitcoin's price.  So if you were running a company like Envion in a competitive market like this, and you struck a deal with a supplier to get preferential treatment for thousands of GPUs, or you found great interest by a solar farm who wants to sell you cheap electricity and house your mining hardware, would you make that information public for everyone to see (including competitors)?  The moment you do that, competitors will flock to those institutions en masse and negotiate deals that could undermine Envion's success. What if some competitor contacted that same solar farm and offered to buy the electricity for double the price Envion negotiated? The competitor would still make enough profit even with the higher cost, and Envion would lose out on business.  At the moment, none of us are shareholders yet. Envion is under no legal obligation to reveal this kind of information to us. It's true that investing in the ICO is a risk.

We love hard questions, but bad attitudes are not accepted and many group remembers called for you to be removed.  Now let's talk about compliance with financial regulations.  By issuing a security token that is compliant with Finma and SEC regulations, we are protecting your investment and the future of envion.  Finma and other financial regulators around the world are taking a closer look at ICOs.  New ICOs and even previous ICOs are being reviewed for compliance with securities regulations.  The EU has just indicated that they will be cracking down on ICOs for violations regardless of whether or not they have *called* their token a security or not.  Our legal team works closely with Finma and they have indicated that a similar review is already underway.  Source: https://cointelegraph.com/news/according-to-key-european-regulator-icos-could-be-derivative-activities  It's unfortunate if these regulations prevent some people from participating in the ICO.  Purchasing tokens on secondary exchanges after the ICO is something everyone can do without restriction.  Furthermore, because envion will be releasing prospectuses and working to have our EVN tokens traded on regulated exchanges (not just token exchanges), participation will be open to an even larger pool of investors in the near future.  The irony of accusing envion of being a scam by following government regulations has not gone unnoticed.",False

Its always better to be open minded than block someone who give to understand thats not all 100% match in his opinion. That just shows you are to quick annoyed about this all critical Questions or u just cant understand the Market Situation. There was not just your ICO who is with many Questions. Peoples from everywhere invest here money. Im sure you can by your own invest your private money like 150Mio Dollars in this Project if I see who u are. And 500 CHF or 5000 CHF are nothing for you. But there are many democratic buyers who invest important part of them money. I for example just see the sence to buy me in a ico pre-sale than after in the exchange.

But the reason u tell its the protection for me! But lets talk honestly, its more the protection for you becauze I can invest as swiss citizien in any ICO, I will not have any problems with the FINMA or Law. The only one who could have further Problems, is the Company who launch the ICO. So thats why I still not understand why Peoples from Switzerland cant just send you in the ICO Ethereum in the smart Contract and get their Tokens?

They are planning their mass production for January 2018. That means they will be busy buying Antminer S9 in big volumes. That’s the best miner money can buy now, but it’s more than a year old! Another miner producer is ready for mass production of 16TH miner in March 2018 and $1350 price tag and better power consumption. That means in 3 months all envion’s equipment will be outdated!!!

I'm not being a stickler, I just figured you'd like to know so you can fix it.  5) The MMUs have a 100 KW intake?

Envion would you care to address these please? Many thanks.  —   Good evening envion,  Thank you for taking the time to answer most of my questions, very useful. Please understand that if something SEEMS too good to be true, it usually is, so I have a couple more questions I need to be addressed before I can invest - and obviously with this rate of return I REALLY want to invest - I would appreciate your thoughts on the following:   1) The discounted token purchase price is US$0.70 - but the dividends will be paid in Ethereum. You do not know what the exchange rate from USD to Eth will be on December 1st, and certainly have no idea what the exchange rate will be each week from the end of January when dividends begin. You estimate 161% but when Eth changes in value against the dollar, this return could be far higher, or far lower. If my token holding entitles me to X number of ETH per week - and it's the same number of ETH each week - the value of this return is completely dependent upon the value of ETH at the time. For example if I invest $10,000 you anticipate a return of $16,100 in Year One, but you're paying in Eth which could be worth any amount.  How can you calculate what the rate of return will be?   2) You have only tested one MMU, in a warehouse in Berlin, with a reduced number of processors inside. Deployed MMUs will be in direct sunlight, at 100 degrees Farenheit, or zero degrees in snow, with rain, desert sand, dust, salty sea air, at very high or very low humidity, varying altitudes and air pressure, levels of pollution etc.  How do you know MMUs will perform OK in these conditions without testing?   3) Why is your prototype dashboard only showing a simulation? Where is the real data from actual testing?   4) You will be running Proprietary Operations and Third Party Operations. POs will pay 100% of revenues to token holders. TPOs will pay 35% of revenues to token holders.  What is the benefit of TPOs? Why not run all MMUs as POs?   5) The ICO closes end of December. Dividends begin end of January. This gives you ONE MONTH to clear funds, source components, contract out the manufacture of MMUs, find premises for assembly, purchase and transport containers and components to the factory, find staff and build the MMUs. Then you need to find suitable locations, negotiate and sign contracts with power suppliers, transport the completed MMUs to these locations around the world, test, configure them, complete diagnostics, remedy errors and solve problems which will occur and then begin mining currency and arrange for dividends from these to be paid. All in one month.  How is this possible?   If these questions are satisfied, then I look forward to visiting your operation in Berlin in a couple of weeks and will bring my wallet Smiley   Many thanks,  KaiBosh",False

They need to eject all that heat to the outside and using two small fans to do it is just impossible. They even say one of the fans is used for backup, so one small fan should cover the cooling requirements which is just silly.  Even if they have figured out a way to keep the air separate from the electronics (to avoid filtrating the air) they still need to eject all the heat.

I answered your questions on Telegram, but I'll repost them here.  1.) The ROI is projected in dollars which correspond to the full token price of $1 USD.  Regardless of payment method, you will receive tokens based on the exchange rate of your local currency in the case of fiat or crypto to USD.  That amount will be the dollar amount invested.    The payout will be in ETH and consist of proceeds of mining converted into ETH.  If you’re unclear on how the value of Ethereum fits into that, I suggest reading page 51 of the Whitepaper which explains the application of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process to model the price of Ethereum.  2.) We perform the same real-world testing and software modeling that hardware designers around the world use when testing their products. By using industrial grade materials and processes, we ensure that our performance benchmarks will work under the same operating conditions as the hardware found in solar parks and wind parks etc.   3.) Our technicians have run additional tests and optimizations during the weeks since going public—in some cases, improving the performance of the mining operation.  It would be disruptive to investors if they were to arrive at the website and find the MMU working at below optimal performance or powered down altogether, so we decided a snapshot of the live data would be better than taking the chance of a visitor encountering no data when they came to the page.  4.) The ICO pays for a certain amount of MMUs.  25% of the profits will be reinvested in growing the PO network.  That growth is fixed.  TPO allows even more growth beyond the number of MMUs built from ICO funds and the 25% reinvestment.  In short, it’s an additional mechanism to scale even further beyond the level dictated by the performance of the ICO.  5.) The production line and hardware suppliers were put in place long before we announced our ICO.  They are ready to roll starting in January.  The user Andy on this channel even contacted one of our advisors to get his input on our preparations and you can find the response reposted on Bitcointalk here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2348435.msg24716291#msg24716291",False

I have a few more of my own after rereading the whitepaper. I apologize if these questions are redundant. I've done my best to keep up on the Telegram and Bitcoin Talk but there is just so much happening.  1) Can you clarify this statement: ""Neither the Swiss FINMA nor the United States Securities and Exchange Commission nor any other foreign regulatory authority has approved an investment in the tokens.""  2) I believe that you are eventually looking to get approval from the SEC in the United States?  3) Do you have an approximate number of the energy companies that have agreed to be Third Party Operators?  4) On page 14 of the whitepaper youforgot the ""E"" in Envion as the first word under Unique Selling Proposition. I'm not being a stickler, I just figured you'd like to know so you can fix it.  5) The MMUs have a 100 KW intake? Am I understanding that correctly?  6) You refer to ""our partner network of firms"" which has allowed you secure and prioritized access to components such as large numbers of GPUs. Can you name these firms?  7) You have a diagram of containers stacked in a pyramid shape on page 16. Have you considered cooling issues that will arise from stacking containers?  Can you confirm the chemical defense system will be included in the final products?  9) In addition to investment funds, what else will be needed on December 1, 2017 to secure token?

Please understand that if something SEEMS too good to be true, it usually is, so I have a couple more questions I need to be addressed before I can invest - and obviously with this rate of return I REALLY want to invest - I would appreciate your thoughts on the following:   1) The discounted token purchase price is US$0.70 - but the dividends will be paid in Ethereum. You do not know what the exchange rate from USD to Eth will be on December 1st, and certainly have no idea what the exchange rate will be each week from the end of January when dividends begin. You estimate 161% but when Eth changes in value against the dollar, this return could be far higher, or far lower. If my token holding entitles me to X number of ETH per week - and it's the same number of ETH each week - the value of this return is completely dependent upon the value of ETH at the time. For example if I invest $10,000 you anticipate a return of $16,100 in Year One, but you're paying in Eth which could be worth any amount.  How can you calculate what the rate of return will be?   2) You have only tested one MMU, in a warehouse in Berlin, with a reduced number of processors inside. Deployed MMUs will be in direct sunlight, at 100 degrees Farenheit, or zero degrees in snow, with rain, desert sand, dust, salty sea air, at very high or very low humidity, varying altitudes and air pressure, levels of pollution etc.  How do you know MMUs will perform OK in these conditions without testing?   3) Why is your prototype dashboard only showing a simulation? Where is the real data from actual testing?   4) You will be running Proprietary Operations and Third Party Operations. POs will pay 100% of revenues to token holders. TPOs will pay 35% of revenues to token holders.  What is the benefit of TPOs? Why not run all MMUs as POs?   5) The ICO closes end of December. Dividends begin end of January. This gives you ONE MONTH to clear funds, source components, contract out the manufacture of MMUs, find premises for assembly, purchase and transport containers and components to the factory, find staff and build the MMUs. Then you need to find suitable locations, negotiate and sign contracts with power suppliers, transport the completed MMUs to these locations around the world, test, configure them, complete diagnostics, remedy errors and solve problems which will occur and then begin mining currency and arrange for dividends from these to be paid. All in one month.  How is this possible?   If these questions are satisfied, then I look forward to visiting your operation in Berlin in a couple of weeks and will bring my wallet   Many thanks,  KaiBosh",False

I've been posting on the Telegram forum for Envion (poster Andy)  I contacted Seif Shieshakly who is one of the consultant Team members at Envion. He specialises in Lean Management (i.e. how to run logistics & production in the most efficient way) and I asked him his view on the capability of Envion to deliver. He is the managing partner of Four Principles a well known Lean Management company in Dubai (I used to work in Dubai) - he has a great reputation outside of Envion to protect. I would highly doubt he would put his name against an organisation that is out to scam people and unable to deliver.  He was happy for me to post, on this forum, his written comments to me, quoted verbatim below:  ""The Envion team has spent a long time engineering every detail of the mobile mining operation with the goal of mass production in mind. This has been thoroughly discussed and anticipated since day one.  The team is very experienced with regard to what they do. Envion has a mix of very talented people that have to a large degree worked together before and know how to run a mass production operation like this. They have existing connections in China for the mass production of hardware, and already have secured hardware supply of GPUs and coupled with their intimate supply chain knowledge, particularly in Asia, along with their access to high skills sets available in Germany, I believe the capability to ramp up production as well as remotely manage the anticipated high volumes of containers are both there.""  On the telegram forum I've asked a number of penetrating questions.  I've checked their business formally exists in Switzerland - yes, its been open for a relatively short time - given you have to state the nature of your business I think this short time frame is not unexpected. I've also run their hash numbers through a mining calc to see they dovetail with the earnings quoted - which they do. I've run some calcs on the number of MMUs and earnings per MMU which convey that once they are all up and running they can deliver the stated ROI. I've confirmed they intend to make fully working MMUs all in China and get them running and earning straight off the production line even before shipping - this one fact makes the ROI much more attainable. In addition they have stated their intent of producing dozens of MMUs in parallel and having all the required MMUs completed within 2 to 4 months from January - the aim being 2 months but 4 months to be sure.  I was very sceptical at first and initially believed this was a scam but scammers do not put their name on the website domain whois, they register domains anonymously and companies offshore out of prying eyes. Switzerland has a reputation for being strict on regulations - you would be nuts to set up a scam company in Switzerland. Scammers do not get a prominent business man such as Seif Shieshakly to give a great open endorsement of their capability - such an endorsement if Envion goes in the crapper or is a scam would kill his business.  Also scammers would not choose to create a security token requiring the listing of the token on a regulated exchange and not on an unregulated crypto exchange. The only reason for creating a security token is because you expect to be making regular payments to the owner of the token - which would definitely get the company in big regulatory trouble if they registered as a crypto only. If it was a scam it would be a crypto token only not a security token with, ironically, a down-played ROI to avoid suspicion ( low ROI to start in year 1 and big promises in years 2 and 3 to give them a year to disappear!).  Lets face it, most people would be interested in a crypto offering ROI of 30%. There are many crypto icos with a 10 page whitepaper and using a free copy of existing publicly available source code and just an idea of developing a coin - these companies have $200M+ valuation on exchanges without anything tangible.  Another aspect to consider is that a company with a security token listed on a regulated exchange can be bought by institutional investors (institutional investors shy away or are prevented from their charter from buying on unregulated exchanges). If Envion are successful in establishing an income stream of anything above 40% the institutional investors will want to buy this security token and will pay a good premium above the $1 (or discounted 70c) buy price, which will only increase if payments continue in years 2 and 3.  Once I see evidence of the letters of intent and notorised confirmation from one of the big4 auditors -  I am ready to invest!!! All this ""tyre kicking"" confirms to me that they are in it to win it and can deliver on their promises.  Of course, this is my opinion and everyone should obviously also do their own due diligence.

Except I'm not saying mine is the truth I'm saying my point are more logical and make more sense!!  Firstly, yes, defrauding Swiss investors does get people many years in prison. If they were scammers why did they pick one of the most severe countries that does not tolerate investment scams - there are plenty of offshore places you can set up a company?  Secondly, why launch a security token - which will bring down the scrutiny of regulators on your company - seriously as a scammer you want to be under the radar - you would go with a crypto token only surely?  Thirdly, why bother with a well-written 56 page Whitepaper when a 10 page one will do? (The writing is sophisticated and complete)  Fourth, how do you get a prominent business man (Seif Shieshakly) with a reputable, established company that focuses on Lean Manufacturing techniques to vouch for capabilities to run an operation of this scale, if you are a scammer ?  Fifth, why claim a high ROI in first year, when a scammer would claim low ROI in first year and then higher ROI in second and third years ? Surely a scammer would claim low ROI of 20%, which you can pay from investor funds in the first year, whilst making off with the 80% whilst no one is the wiser. Why claim 161% when you know you're going to look like a scammer within 3 months if you dont start making serious earnings payments.  As scammers, they sure are crap at being scammers!

You can check the live mining results here: https://www.envion.org/en/mobile-mining-unit/  The best way for a hobby miner to participate is to purchase tokens in the ICO.

The simulation tab shows $577 USD OF AVERAGE DAILY REVENUE...but I have no idea what the real live data would show or if the unit is operational, but if roughly $18K of GROSS REVENUE per month is the simulated level, what would be the expected pre-distribution NET REVENUE per month per unit?

I am in the datacenter biz and while your white paper is compelling, is there video of the operating unit, rather than just of someone looking into the door of a container in the field which is clearly mocked?  Also, can you post your LOIs with the names redacted so we can get a sense of how many you have and at what value?

I want to believe but there seem to be more questions than answers at this stage in your development which seems contrary to the claimed maturity of the project. [/quote]  The equations used to calculate ROI are complex and would be shared soon. However it translates to 161% averaged over a year. The electricity market is highly fragmented, consisting of thousands of regional subsystems in various jurisdictions where overcapacities alternate with shortages. Due to its nature, electricity overcapacities have been inaccessible and useless to date. Even the smallest overcapacity at a decentral transformer station (>50 KW) can be efficiently used by our units. These factors have been included in the financial model to calculate ROI.  Envion is sending a document to be notarized confirming calculations for performance data, i.e. ROI.  It includes hashpower, power consumption, exchange rates for currencies mined, etc.   It's all set and going out for approval, so that you can see a third party has seen proof of the data.

Some important questions that need to be answered are:  1. Why would power-plants want to host these ""Mobile Mining Units?""  2. Are there currently any power-plants that are exclusively on-board with Envion right at this moment? . . . I ask these questions because of the fact that it could be years before any power-plant agrees to do business with Envion. There could literally be no return on investment for years and years. That's why this token will be categorized as a Pump n Dump, it will only be able to make money from being traded. There can be NO DIVIDENDS if there are no power-plants that are hosting the MMU's . . The fear is that these MMU's will be sitting for months and months awaiting a power-plant to allow them to tap into their power sources and be parked on their Private Property. . .",False

Congratulations also for your patience when dealing with the less polite/sane questions on this forum.  I have read your white paper but have some more questions I hope you can address.  1) Can you confirm you have only created and tested a single MMU so far, and this contains far fewer processors than your intended final product? Does this mean that your next few MMUs will basically still be prototypes? What design challenges and required alterations do you envisage when tested at full capacity, which will obviously require far greater cooling? Can you say how long testing will take before you are happy to deploy full MMUs in the field?  2) Will your published team members be working solely on this project full time, or will they work on other projects at the same time? Do they have ownership of or executive positions within companies that will be working with envion? Can you please tell me how much of the company is owned by the published team, and how many other people are involved and how much of the company they own? Are there other founders whose identities are not being published? If so, why is this?  3) I am having trouble finding references or reputable financial commentators giving opinions on your project. I realise this may be because it is a newly formed (or newly-revealed) company. Do you happen to have links to reviews or opinion pieces from independent sources? Any particular write-ups you are pleased with, or reviews you are not happy about?  4) There is little detail available regarding the financial structure of deployed MMUs. Am I right in saying you will be leasing the MMUs to third party companies, who will be paying your company 35% of the MMU's profits? Can you explain why you would give away 65% of the spoils of your units rather than own them 100%? Would the lease income be included in the profits calculated for token holders?  5) When will the first monthly dividends be paid out?  6) The dividends paid to token holders: how will this be calculated? A hypothetical example: on month 1, ETH is worth US$300 and envion pays me 1 ETH for my token holding. In month 2, ETH is worth $150. Will my dividend be 1 ETH or 2 ETH?  I have more questions but will leave it there for now.  Thanks in advance for your help.  Kind regards,  KaiBosh",False

Yes the prototype is fewer stocked than the final working MMU. After ICO production will start. It depends on the regions where the MMUs will be deployed. Envion has 3 different configurations. The Medium Density Implementation is well suited for regions with high ambient air temperatures. So for colder areas a fully stocked MMU running at full capacity won't be a problem.

Do you happen to have links to reviews or opinion pieces from independent sources? Any particular write-ups you are pleased with, or reviews you are not happy about?  There isn't much. But that is the same with many other ICOs that even do not have a working product. Here is a reply from an admin in the support chat:  Quote It's normal for a company to work in stealth until they are ready with their product.  We are no different.  A lot of companies also incorporate new entities in their ICO jurisdiction when they decide they will use an ICO to fund their project.    We couln't possibly have developed our IP, written our whitepaper, gotten laywers, secured deals, etc. in in one month.    As for what our innovation is, there are many: from using Industry 4.0 controls, to the mining software that dynamically chooses coin, algo, etc. from real-time market data, to the patent-pending cooling system.    If it were just throwing some ASICs in a box we wouldn't have one of the world's premier research institutions working with us, the Frauenhofer Institute (they invented MP3s too!).  http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/envion-ag-envion-and-fraunhofer-to-start-research-cooperation-20171109-00299  Quote 4) There is little detail available regarding the financial structure of deployed MMUs. Am I right in saying you will be leasing the MMUs to third party companies, who will be paying your company 35% of the MMU's profits? Can you explain why you would give away 65% of the spoils of your units rather than own them 100%? Would the lease income be included in the profits calculated for token holders?  The envion business model for mining has two components:  1 Proprietary Operations (PO) where envion invests in, owns and operates the MMUs. Token holders are the 100% beneficiary of the earnings of proprietary operations.  2 Third-Party Operations (TPO) where an independent company, such as a utility or an investment fund, acquires the MMUs while envion operates them. For this operation, envion will be rewarded with a share of the mining revenues. 35% of the earnings of this business model will be distributed to token holders.  Earnings in Proprietary Operations are comprised of the total rewards minus operation costs: such as, but not limited to, costs for electricity, rent/land lease for containers, hardware replacements to ensure the continuity of envion’s mining operation (stabilize the MMU’s performance and counter e.g. difficulty increases or other efficiency losses directly connected to the mining process), depreciation and a handling fee for the company’s overhead). The calculation of earnings in Third-Party Operations depends on the agreement with the third party, but will exclude depreciation.  100% of PO and 35% of TPO will make up the fund that is ready for distribution to token holders. But that’s not enough in our eyes. In order to accelerate earnings growth, we have decided to invest one quarter of the annual earnings fund to build new MMUs and lay the foundation for more earnings - and for exponential growth.  Three quarters of the earnings will be distributed immediately - and that means on a weekly basis.  Quote 5) When will the first monthly dividends be paid out?  First payments expected by end of January. Payouts are on a weekly basis.  Quote 6) The dividends paid to token holders: how will this be calculated? A hypothetical example: on month 1, ETH is worth US$300 and envion pays me 1 ETH for my token holding. In month 2, ETH is worth $150. Will my dividend be 1 ETH or 2 ETH?  I have more questions but will leave it there for now.  Thanks in advance for your help.  Kind regards,  KaiBosh  The token is mined so the amount won't change if the hashrate is the same. Thus, the payout remains the same. The MMUs are capable to mine over 600 cryptocurrencies. A switch to a more profitable coin isn't a problem to meet a high profitability.",False

However it translates to 161% averaged over a year.

Due to its nature, electricity overcapacities have been inaccessible and useless to date. Even the smallest overcapacity at a decentral transformer station (>50 KW) can be efficiently used by our units. These factors have been included in the financial model to calculate ROI.

First of all, for the sake of investors Envion should prove immediately that they are a real company. How to do that? Give legal adress and especially whareouse adress so they can invite potential costumers to take a tour. Make videos and photos of the team working, videos and photos of people actually working on the container not fake interviews of Matthias talking with a greenscreen depicting Fankfurt financial center. Second: why the f**k a seroius company like Envion keeps the owners of the company in shadows? Do you know why Envion is giving up the names of the team members? Because they will have no penal responsability if everything goes wrong. Third: if the so called CTO Matthias is half of what he claims to be ( investing 300ml € in solar energy) why the hell should he need tiny random investors from bitcointalk. A man of his caliber, with a strong financial background has, for sure, ties with the german financial hub and does not need 1000 people investing 2-3k in his enterprise. Envion wants to collect money from as many people as possible because people who invest 2-3k is not going to risk to hire a lawyer to get some saved money back. Fourth: Where does the money go? From as far as I know it could go into a bank account called charity and end of story. Envion should give IBAN or bank wire account of the destination. Here we go with the fifth. Fifth: Envion is a swiss startup operating in germany...why is that? If everybody reads the whitepaper carefully it states that American citizens and green card holders cannot participate to ICO. The reason behind this is simple, swiss bank account holders have something called professional secrecy wich protects the account holder( ex. Banks do not have to give id of their costumers to law enforcement agencies) The only way to bypass that is to commit an action that it is considered crime in both US and Swizerland and that the owner can be prosecuted in one of these countries. Hence, if he commits fraud to a US citizen and it is sued by him/her, its bananas in the dark hole for the account owner. PEOPLE PLEASE RAISE YOUR AWARNESS, SAME GOES FOR THE MODERATORS",False

I've read your whitepaper carefully and I'm interested in investing on December 1, 2017. I fall into the category of investor who is living outside of Switzerland and the US. I would therefore like to know what (if any) process there may be to verifying identity, setting up a credit card account, etc. I ask because I do not want to be ready to pay on December 1 only to find out that I am unable to pay because I am lacking a document or I cannot verify my identity because I do not have a utility bill or passport handy.  How has Envion prepared for increases in inevitable difficulty increases in the various blockchains you plan on mining within? While I understand that this can be projected and hedge for over the short term, five years is a long time!  Thanks, Jimmy  P.S. It would be nice to have a video tour of the container and the currently operating facility and perhaps another video posting of your team at work. I hope this isn't too much to ask  .   ",False

I do believe there is a lot of potential in this and I will be joining your ICO.  A very important point that needs to be reiterated to potential investors is the following analogy of a two way street: In the one direction we have the Envion team who has a responsibility towards its investors to sort out any problem that might arise, expectedly or unexpectedly. I do believe they understand the gravity of this responsibility. In the other direction of the proverbial two way street, we have the investors who have to accept the fact that some things might not go as planned, but hopefully the majority of items will go as planned. As investors we have to choose the investment we are most comfortable with taking the analogy above into full consideration. Personally, I believe this model can work.  I am eagerly awaiting the stats for Envion in one year's time.",False

The hardware will be built based on the monetary of the ICO and this hardware is of course independent from the second market price of the token.  gembira: Thank you for your question, I think cybercash has already answered it.  Crankautist: There were links to Solon and Matthias Woestmann in previews long posts of envion. The involvement in a company does necessarily not leave marks at google. In case you want a confirmation about his involvement from a third party you should please ask a third party like the CEO of Solon at that time. (Please do not use excessive font size & capslock.)  Nick P: I think cybercash has already answered your question.  MarkX2: Envion agrees with you just in one point: we also encourage our investors to be careful and ask question. Besides inappropriate statements like blaming us we would steal money we see one relevant topic: what will happen with the investors’ money? Please have a look at our whitepaper, especially page5 to page8 concerning this. You will find a transparent and binding explanation of what is done with the investors’ money. In very short: 91% of the ICO monetary goes into MMUs. The rest goes into research, development, admin, etc. Nothing goes to shareholders of the AG. We have a new economy in the Blockchain world: tokens. The tokens are the relevant thing when it comes to holdings of the team behind everything. 10% of the tokens go to the team. The share is based on involvement of the team which you mostly see on the website. The AG was chosen as it gives a good starting basis for a stock market launch. An ICO is similar to that which also supports the choice. Not least it gives more trust than other company types because there are more supervisory authorities in an AG. You will find out that many of the big [Suspicious link removed]panies have chosen this type of company in Switzerland which is also based on a vast number of legal  considerations.  lagur: We decided to not announce things that are not written and signed. We have dozens of remarkable news but to bring it to written contracts or LOIs always takes some time. Also big companies like international banks or energy provider often do not want to be mentioned in very early stages. For example: we have a contract with one of the Big Four audit companies now but they always have a clause saying that mentioning the name is not allowed. Instead of that we are now working on implementing a procedure to to announcements indirect through a notary. Yes, many companies would just publish anything but we want to be exemplary even if this sometimes means to be be modest. We often do not like that but hope to get the appreciation to act like that.  markX2: We will not answer to his questions again. We did in Telegram many times before we had to ban hin out of the chat after many warnings. We also answered in one posting https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2348435.msg24417500#msg24417500 We ansered to one of his questions in this posting. In case somebody sees any of his questions unanswered and interesting/important please ask us here or in Telegram, we will be happy to answer you. To not waste the time and by that harm the envion community we might ignore mark2x or at least not treat with the same efforts we bring for everyone else. In case someone thinks this decision is wrong we are also open to talk about that.  alex_liu: Thank you for supporting us in this matter.  Ukraine2020: The token helps to realise divdend payouts.

This is a project with the aim to decentralize mining infrastructure, please read our whitepaper. This is a project coming from a big team not just from one person. - Your assumption that envion would have fraudulent aims is not true. Please do your research. The team members give their names and you can find out a lot of things about them but nothing like you want to impute to them. - Where does the money go: please read the whitepaper, p5 to p9. - envion is incorporated in Switzerland like many many other [Suspicious link removed]panies mainly because of legal considerations. - your statement concerning the US investors is not true. US investors are not excluded. It is clearly stated under what circumstances US investors are allowed to invest. Respectively all your constructing assumptions based on that are also wrong.

""It's definitely not my cup of tea, but who knows, I might be wrong on this one. It wouldn't be the first thing that I'm wrong about, that's certain. I'm a serial entrepreneur, blogger and ultrarunner. You can find me mainly on my blog at Dragos Roua where I write about productivity, business, relationships and running.""  His claims are partially wrong or not very accurate (for example when it comes to proof of stake). But nevertheless he points to important topics. Here are some words on those topics:  1) A copy&paste from Telegram: ""The thing is, our MMUs can accommodate a wide variety of hardware configs: asic, gpu, mix; and choose the coin, algo, etc dynamically based on config and current market conditions.  So if any protocol is overwhelmed, they switch to something more profitable in real-time. We've also got a killer team of blockchain experts that are in the trenches with the devs from the big protocols. Ethereum is on the other side of town, you know. We are ready to meet any changes on both the hardware and software side."" Information might be a few days old but Ethereum things of bringing 1% proof of stake. That has no relevant influence on mining rewards. Maybe in case that system works (and as there are thoughts to just bring 1% as a test it does not look certain yet) there might be bigger amounts of proof of stake but still there is a billions of money invested into ICOs the last two years and a lot of companies working on Software that should work based on Ethereum. In case all this interesting projects the community trusts in come to live there will be need of infrastructure. It is not very likely that this infrastructure will be 100% proof of stake. Maybe someday the mining profit for ETH goes down but that is where envion profits from as envion market share should rise as soon as profits go down as envion has best position due to aways lowest possible energy costs, extremely low cooling costs and the low overhead due to simple and cost efficient container infrastructure. After Ethereum there are a lot of other projects that need infrastructure right up to private blockchains. 2) We will not pick what is left, we are in competition with those existing mining companies not being behind but ahead with a mobile mining infrastructure that could settle for example next to existing operations in Iceland and easily move to Norway in case the price in Iceland rises which could happen. Doing mining in Iceland for example as competitors do is a tradeoff. Price is not cheap but around double the price you could get at other places around the world. But as a stationary company you have to do a tradeoff between electricity price and a forecast for the region. And also this forecast in Iceland is not 100% safe as for example Stefán Gislason, environmental advisor and lawyer in Iceland once explained that nobody knows for how long geothermal energy will be still available. Envion could is a lot more flexible here and could go more for the electricity price when it comes to the decision where to do the mining.",False

Hi, I think this is a really interesting concept, and a great ICO.  What is the timeline for one MMU to be deployed? You mention 73 to 91 MMU per 10M invested in your WP, if you get 150M invested from the ICO, it would mean at least 1095 MMU's. How long would it take for these to be deployed and in production from the end of the ICO?  Do you have sufficient energy contracts to cover up to 1095 MMU’s? If not, what is your current coverage, i.e how many would you be able to power at the end of the ICO, and what is the time line and plan to get the rest of them into production and to scale up?  You mention that you have partner firms through which you have secured a large quantity of GPU’s, can you show more regarding this? Are there any guarantees that you will be able to source the necessary amount of GPU’s for up to 1095 MMU's?  We would try to incorporate new data at the earliest. Our MMU's consume more than 100Kw of energy. The prototype MMU consumes approximately 61181 Watts. If our ICO reaches the hard cap, the least we would be able to raise is $105M . 91% of the ICO proceeds are used for the production of MMU's. An MMU costs approximately $150,000. So that translates to a minimum of ~700 MMU's if we reach our funding goal with 48 hours of the first round of our ICO. We can complete the roll-out in a matter of weeks. Production of each MMU should take only hours. We have built up the supply chain long before announcing our projects. Components are in stock at our supply chain partners and we have priority access to them. We have LOIs from energy industry customers. Our CEO has been negotiating for last few months. I’m very limited about what I can say about customers and new deals. However, just what has come in during the last 3 days will change ROI for better and mean transport will be waiting to pick up finished units. Large arrays at large providers.  Still handshakes, but looking very good.  Outstanding questions:  Are there any limitations for the team with regards to when they are allowed to sell tokens?  What is the typical operating temperature of one MMU, and the equipment in it? You mention that your MMU can handle over 40C outside temperature, what is the operating temperature inside the MMU, and the equipment there, when the outside temperature is over 40C?  How does the communication, and information, flow look like after the ICO is completed? Will there be some page where one can follow the progress, and also see generated income etc?  Thanks in advance!",False

From page 10 of the WP: For every $10m of capital raised during the core ICO, $9.1m will be invested in hardware, translating into 73 to 91 MMUs at present conditions  73 MMU's costs roughly 10M which is 1 unit, therefore, 150M /10M = 15 units, i.e 15 x 73 = 1095 MMU's.

And I took the time to read the whole 57 pages of the whitepaper as I find that the concept sounds good and there will be regions in the world where electricity is cheap and modular mining farms will be a viable concept.  However, I found more information on the team itself, which I'd like to share with you. I added the links to the LinkedIn profiles of the team in case anyone wants to verify them. The descriptions of the members below are either taken from the whitepaper or from the homepage:  On page 53 of the whitepaper they describe the team: https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthias-woestmann-b87922119/ ""Matthias Woestmann:  an investor in renewable energies since the early 2000s.

His investment vehicle Quadrat Capital GmbH has also invested in technology and service startups in Berlin. He is an expert in energy markets not only in Germany, but across Europe and beyond.""  On page 54 of the whitepaper it says: ""In 2015, Matthias Woestmann met an entrepreneur from the PV ecosystem, an experienced professional, co-founder of one of the largest solar companies in Germany and an experienced investor in PV parks globally.""  What they do not mention: It is true that Matthias Woestmann co-financed a 300 million company, it was named Solon AG and went bankrupt in 2011/2012, was rebranded and finally sold off the the United Arab Emirates.

On the homepage is says: Entrepreneur, strategy consultant, IT professional. More than 10 years industry & top management consulting at A.T. Kearney  According to his LinkedIn profile has he only been at A.T. Kearney for 5 years and 8 months -> the information on the homepage is wrong, suggesting he has been with A.T. Kearney for more than 10 years. Why do they still claim this on the homepage?  More interesting is even Jonathan Koch: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kochjonathan/ On the homepage it says: ""Jonathan Koch: Software engineer with 10 years of experience as a team leader at Rocket Internet & wooga.""  According to his LinkedIn profile he was been with Rocket internet for 1 year and 1 month and with wooga for 1 year and 4 months, all in all 2 years and 5 months. I can provide screenshots, if necessary.  The description in the whitepaper however says that he was for 10 years with these companies in the role of a team leader.  -> this information is CLEARLY wrong.    further team members are: https://www.linkedin.com/in/seifshieshakly/  https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasperhellmann/ ""Jasper Hellmann: a serial entrepreneur and founder of several eCommerce companies. His expertise is in the field of social media marketing. Hellmann founded an eCommerce company in 2016 and scaled it up to 30m euros in revenue within 12 months."" -> he has been with the company for 3 months now  https://www.linkedin.com/in/eminmahrt/  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kay-bucksch-10470198/ He has been with the company for 6 months according to his LinkedIn profile, since June 2017.   https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikita-fuchs-19286213/ He has been with the company since October 2017, that is 6 weeks now.  https://www.linkedin.com/in/jan-ole-malchow-67368a107/ He also has been with the company since October 2017.  https://www.linkedin.com/in/moritz-strube/ Has been advisor since November 2017, that is 12 days for now.

Furthermore, twice, there is clearly wrong information in the whitepaper/on the homepage concerning the experience of two of the team members, suggesting they have more experience than they state on their LinkedIn profiles.  I have made screeshots of all the profiles on LinkedIn just to be able to provide them in case should the information on the profiles be changed after this post.

We appreciate your positive approach of constructive review of our communication. On the one hand we could say “hey, please let us do our job and not work on every detail of team history” but on the other hand I think that we are one of the few companies that has nothing to hide so that we want to encourage you to ask further by giving you a response to your detailed topic:  Matthias Woestmann was entering the company in 2003 when it was worth about 10m USD. He then brought it to about 300m USD in 2007 and left the company in a total positive situation. The reason for his exit was that he was not sure whether the more conservative government that came instead of a more green government would extend the green roadmap. It turned out that it did and the company had a good further trend.  When the solar crisis hit the country some years later Matthias Woestmann who brought the company from a small one to a big player was not involved anymore. We think that based on that fact his communication concerning Solon is correct or at least understandable at this point.    More informatiion about Solon AG:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon_SE ( more detailed but in German language: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon_(Unternehmen) )   https://www.linkedin.com/in/krusenbaum/ ""Felix Krusenbaum: An IT-professional with over 6 years of experience as a strategy consultant at A.T.

On the homepage is says: Entrepreneur, strategy consultant, IT professional. More than 10 years industry & top management consulting at A.T.

Kearney for more than 10 years. Why do they still claim this on the homepage? We just spoke to Felix and his long version of his history was not good formulated by the texter who had to shorten it. It was meant that he has a sum of 10 years industry and management/consulting experience including A.T. Kearney. There will be an update of the website short text to correct it/make it more clear.   More interesting is even Jonathan Koch: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kochjonathan/ On the homepage it says: ""Jonathan Koch: Software engineer with 10 years of experience as a team leader at Rocket Internet & wooga.""  According to his LinkedIn profile he was been with Rocket internet for 1 year and 1 month and with wooga for 1 year and 4 months, all in all 2 years and 5 months. I can provide screenshots, if necessary.  The description in the whitepaper however says that he was for 10 years with these companies in the role of a team leader.  -> this information is CLEARLY wrong. Jonathan has 10 years of experience as a Software engineer. That is correct. He also worked as a team leader at the mentioned companies. Before discussion whether the sentence is correct or mistakable ( which it is at least ) we will also tell the texter to change it a little bit so that it is clear.   further team members are: https://www.linkedin.com/in/seifshieshakly/  https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasperhellmann/ ""Jasper Hellmann: a serial entrepreneur and founder of several eCommerce companies.

That is why everyone has decided to set a date based on what he or she thinks fits. It looks like everyone tended to use a very short timespan to make sure there is less criticism. Because of the face that the company does not exist very long it is difficult to answer the question ""since when are you working for envion?"". This topic is on envions list but not with highes priority. At the end it counts what envion has to offer which is a lot more than bringing a good decision concerning the start date communication. Jasper Hellmann for example works for the project since the modest beginnings.    In my opinion it seems strange that the information in the whitepaper doesn't always match the information on the homepage.  Furthermore, twice, there is clearly wrong information in the whitepaper/on the homepage concerning the experience of two of the team members, suggesting they have more experience than they state on their LinkedIn profiles.

I wanted to share it with you guys in case anyone considers investing. Feel free to draw your own conclusions and do your own research. I think most of your questions are answered. To repeat the most important thing: there is no rule giving from envion to its team concerning the start date so that everyone picks a conservative date to not provide a target because of the newly opened envion AG. Please understand what we do not have big marketing teams like big companies so that there are details from time to time not 100% perfect formulated and updates on whitepaper and website not within hours. We are a startup in a very fast developing industry and there are a lot of important things to concentrate these days. We do not want to say those things are not important but to find a priority we sometimes have to say that we focus on those things that bring forward the idea, the exiting investors and the people that already believe in us. Of course those marketing details are at the end also important for the idea to get more participation but all just have two hands and are recruiting new people almost every day.    Again: We appreciate your positive approach of constructive review of our communication. Like we said: on the one hand we could say “hey, please let us do our job and not work on every detail of team history” but on the other hand we think that we are one of the few companies that has nothing to hide so that we want to encourage you to ask further by giving you a response to your detailed topic. Thank you for helping us in being more exact when it comes to the topic team as it looks like we should have spent a little more time there.

I like this project and did my research  but also I made simple calculation.  If there is an maximum Token Issue Volume from 150,000,000  /  83 % are going to Token Holders  / 5 % Reserve. Let’s say during the ICO all tokens (83 % ) sold out  to token holders and the holders just hold it for a couple of years  , how do you want to cash out the 161% Per year if there are only 5 % reserve inside the Envonic AG ?   If I understand it well, you will cash out in Tokens like airdrop for the token holders .  What do you mean by token holders in that case?  Just people who were registrated and invested during the ICO, made invests and hold there tokens, or also people who buy the tokens at exchanges after the ico?  I would like to know how the cash out will happen ?  Next question: Your company Name „ Envion AG „. There is a company based in Berlin with the same Name „Envion AG“  „AG“ in this case being the legal form / Aktiengesellschaft . But this Company has nothing to do with your project ( I did my research) http://www.envion-ag.de  So how is it even possible that your Project can use their Name even though your Projekt is not an „Aktengesellschaft“ ?  Please answer,  Andonexx",False

Airdrop is free. You are buying Envion Tokens.  If you bought Envion tokens and have it in your wallet, then you are a Token holder.  Also if you are buying Envion Tokens on an exchange, then you are a Token Holder as well.  Cash out = dividens you will get weekly in Ethereum (ETH).

You were warned repeatedly and many people asked for you to be removed.  I answered your questions on Telegram and I will answer them AGAIN here.  1. Are you SCAM? No.  But we encourage you to do your due diligence and find out for yourself.  That means you have to look at our website and whitepaper at the very least.  You can learn all about what Envion does on our website, but if you want to be sure we're not a scam, I suggest you take a look at our team.   You can also see that we are in partnership with the Frauenhofer Institute, one of the premier science research institutes in Europe: http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/envion-ag-envion-and-fraunhofer-to-start-research-cooperation-20171109-00299  2. Where are founders and co-founders? Where are no info about founders on website! All the info on our team is on the Team page, visible from the top navigation: https://www.envion.org/en/team/  The entire Envion team have been working on public projects in the German business community for years—we are entrepreneurs with easily-accessible public profiles.  3. Where do you mine? NO INFO about your minig!!! We have a Mobile Mining Unit in operation not far from our Berlin offices.  We will have a second unit coming online in the next two weeks. Info about it and a view of the operating dashboard is available here: https://www.envion.org/en/mobile-mining-unit/  4. Website was open 1 month ago!!! It's normal for a company to work in stealth until they are ready with their product.  We are no different. Learn about stealth mode here: https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229461  Furthermore, we couldn't possibly have developed our IP, written our whitepaper, gotten lawyers, secured deals, etc. in in one month.   Now that we are public, we will also be announcing our external auditor from one of the Big Four auditing firms who will oversee our ICO and business operations for full transparency and accountability.  5. Where is technical characteristics for power ? I don't know what this means and you refused to clarify in our discussion on Telegram.  6. Where is info about mining power per container& There is considerable information on the technical specifications of our mining units in our 60-page whitepaper: https://www.envion.org/en/whitepaper/  In addition to that information, we are coming out with supplementary data that shows more detail on our projections and different operating scenarios. That is a need that arose from user requests here and on Telegram and we are responding to it.  7. Where do you locate& We are a Swiss company with operations in Berlin, which is where our mining unit is.  This information is on our website and has been confirmed by DigiCert to get our SSL license: https://www.envion.org/en/imprint/  8. To color a container is it your real technology? As for what our innovation is, there are many: from using Industry 4.0 controls, to the mining software that dynamically chooses coin, algo, etc. from real-time market data, to the patent-pending cooling system.  If it were just throwing some ASICs in a box we wouldn't have one of the world's premier research institutions working with us, the Frauenhofer Institute (they invented MP3s too!).  MORE OF YOUR 'QUESTIONS':  1. Your company was created October, 5, 2017! (Info from Zug, Switzerland register -  we can provide a paper). Again, we were working in stealth mode.  A lot of companies incorporate new entities in their ICO jurisdiction when they decide they will use an ICO to fund their project.  2. Website was created in October, 2017! We hope you are not using our website to determine if we are legit—please do more research.  Yes, it went public when envion went public with our company and project.  3. In White Paper you told about  Envion technologies GmbH what will cooperate with you, but no any info about this company! Please, send me a link to this company! Here is the text from the whitepaper: ""After the ICO, we will found a 100% subsidiary for R&D and the management of container production: envion technologies GmbH, located in the German blockchain capital of Berlin.""  I'm not sure how we can make the word AFTER more clear or to better describe the purpose of creating that subsidiary.  4. Account in Linked In was opened 1 week ago! Stealth mode, dude. Not sure what else to say.  5. Your CEO is journalist and  was hired in October, 2017 like all their team! Our CEO has spent two decades in the energy industry after his career as a journalist, leading an energy investment fund in Berlin and advising many energy startups: http://www.quadrat-capital.com/management/   Mark, please stop the harassment.  I've answered your questions many times over now.  I welcome hard questions and don't even mind a bit of conflict, but you are scaring away other people from asking their important questions.  I hope this suffices.",False

It's a very good question and one we take very seriously (thought it almost makes us wonder what's on your mind ).  There are many layers to the security stack:  The first barrier is that our mobile mining units will be deployed in the close proximity to power plants (e.g. PV) that offer already a high degree of security. The available security at a location is one of the criteria that is taken into account when choosing a location  The second barrier is that for the first sites, we will deploy a large enough number of mobile mining units that allows to have a small dedicated staff on location that will provide security and execute service/maintenance tasks. This might for example then include an external security company that provides this service for let's say 50 units.  The third barrier are standard physical barriers like barbed wire and our automated doorman system that includes heavy locks that are operated by our servers. This level includes motion sensors, etc. that all report directly to our cloud application. The software part is actually already running in our first generation!  Last but not least, our mobile mining units are insured against theft, damage and natural disasters like floods. So even if something happens, they are insured.  There's a lot of detail on our physical as well as network security in the whitepaper.  Please check it out: https://www.envion.org/en/whitepaper/",False

You've got some great questions.  Most of them can be answered by reading the whitepaper here: https://www.envion.org/en/download/envion_whitepaper.pdf  The whitepaper contains detailed information about the design of the cooling system and results from our tests on thermal efficiency.  I think you'll see that German engineers are not satisfied designing something that only works if there is wind outside the container—the unit we have up and running is cooling just fine inside a factory.  Our MMUs connect to power using low-voltage connections found at most power plants.  The units are profitable despite micro fluctuations in costs like night-time grid costs from PV installations.  Our operational unit in the factory is providing winter heat and offsetting the price of grid energy.  There are also myriad other types of installations where there are no such fluctuations like when the units use overcapacity from new plants that are not yet on grid or the grid has not yet capable of using the full capacity. The point is that envion units are flexible enough to be profitable in any such situation and can be moved to a new place when conditions change.  If you want to geek out on the calculations, then the whitepaper is going to be a lot of fun.   If you are still convinced envion is fake after reading the whitepaper, I suggest you come pay us a visit.  We invite all of our potential investors to come visit us in Berlin and see the working unit. ",False

If the Container costs 100k to 150k USD and you can use 80KW per envion-Container, then make a calculation: It will be 700000kWh per year. If you want the return of investment for the Container back within one year, then it will be: 100000k usd / 700000kwh = 14,28 Cents It means, if you are able to buy cheap Green electricity for just 6 Cents, you need to add another 14,28 Cents for the ROI of Container. It makes 20 usd Cent per kWh for the miners and with that price you can go home Even if you want a return of investment in 2 years, then it will be 6 Cents + 7,14 = 13,14 Cents. And then you need to add always the extra costs for the more expensive maintenance. If you have 10 containers in different locations, you need a lot of time to drive to them to do a reboot and so on... Also the risk, if someone coming night time and pick up the Container is very high! Sorry guys, but this is not a ICO I would invest money...",False

Envion has some big advantages in terms of flexibility, scalability, and stability.  Envion mobile mining rigs can be infinitely scaled to take advantage of cheap energy using large arrays of MMUs. Envion can be installed to a large variety of power sources and can deploy in large arrays as fast as we can build the MMUs.    This flexibility also means the output is very stable because the MMUs can be moved to places where pricing is advantageous.  Envion can be moved from a solar farm to a wind park if there is a better price on electricity.    They can also be installed anywhere power is cheap, not just at power plants.  We currently have a MMU operating at a factory outside Berlin where it has access to cheap power and the heat exhaust is providing winter heating.  We are sure customers will find even more uses for them in the future.",False
