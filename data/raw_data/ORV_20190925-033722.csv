I think this kind of analysis are very beneficial for both the community and the team. It helps us to see your point of view and understanding of the project and also raise the discussion in the forum. I'd like to add some comments and hopefully, give some clarity to the mentioned risks.     Orvium doesn't enforce any practice on how personal LinkedIn accounts have to be managed. It's up to the employees or advisors to decided on wether they want to list Orvium or not within their public profiles.       Orvium 1.0 is expected to be released in Q1 2020. (-1.5)  In Orvium's website (orvium.io) under the roadmap section you'll see phase called Supernova. This phase starts at Q4 this year and contains the first release of the platform in Mainnet where everyone will be able to use and play with the solution. The reason why you can see releases up to 2020 is because the tech team will be adding new platform features incrementally during that time, ie: decentralized autonomous journals, open big data analytics, public APIs, fully social platform... (see more in our whitepaper)  On that note, we understand that the roadmap might be a bit technical and this might be confuse. That's why we're currently working on improving the roadmap readability to make things completely clear to everyone.       Although radical changes are required in the sector, it is not evident why another centralized entity with a different working mechanism cannot solve these problems without appealing to a blockchain. (-2.5)  I think the blockchain is key here. By removing that ""man in the middle"" and introducing a transparent and immutable mechanims you allow researchers and instituions to decide on what license model they want, and more importantly to keep the copyrights of their work. Besides that, there're more features researchers and institutions can benefit from like: optimal publication costs, transparent peer-reviews, reviewer recognition and reward, sharing research data, subscription freedom, zero-delay publication and more. Finally, one of my personal favourite features that can only be achived thanks to decentralized technologies is Orvium's Decentralized Autonomous Journals where scientist can organize themselves creating organizations with a set of rules all agreed upon.    Orvium is a platform aiming to change the academic publishing sector. It has many academic advisors, which can create a network effect and help adoption. But the success of the platform purely depends on adoption, which is not academics‚Äô most known trait.  Orvium receives a 2.5/10. Regarding this last quote I'd like to address you to our website as today we've released a very interesting update regarding network effect, adoption and institutional relationships which I feel very proud. See ""The Orvium movement"" section where we show institutions, companies and universities joinin the Orvium effort.  I hope you find this message well and looking forward to reading more reviews.

Orvium's team doesn't set the focus on clinical trials, but, as you know (and I think it is also the reason why you ask), there are many market inefficiencies in scientific and medical publishing. Orvium's goal is to eliminate these inefficiencies and to give power back to the research community instead of a few major publishing players. This way, everyone including non-researchers will benefit from the platform (in a direct or indirect way).  Often, it is not known who reviews works of published pieces which means that this sector is open to manipulation. One of Orvium's goals is to change exactly that. Orvium's platform will also have social media functions and publishing and editing rights that can be set by the researchers themselves so this space will become more transparent. May I ask if you are in the clinical trials space yourself?  I recommend checking out the picture on page 23 of the whitepaper here because it clearly shows Orvium's publication model's advantages compared to the current industry model: https://orvium.docsend.com/view/nvr6ywj And also read page 24 to 31 as those pages show Orvium's business model.

Also, the peer reviews done by these publishers/journals are not transparent, and there can be incredibly long delays from submission all the way to the publication (12 months is average!)  Rather than the publication owning copyrights and licenses of their research, it will be owned by the researcher themselves. Again, the long delays that researchers experience will be mitigated by using the Orvium platform.  Simply put, because it's open, transparent, and cost-effective.

Orvium‚Äôs business development plan have pay special focus on this aspect by a number of defined adoption incentives to this regards. In addition, the partnerships and deep knowledge of the scholarly publication market and scientific collaborations frameworks is essential. Orvium team with members from NASA and CERN works natively within this environments and have the right knowledge and connections.  Orvium‚Äôs team is pretty strong with key people from CERN and NASA such Tom Soderstrom, Alberto di Meglio, Chris Mattmann. Bernd Lapp as former member of the ETH foundation and with deep business experience.  Our Team is a reference in Big Data and Machine Learning. We have an extensive experience as responsibles for the Big Data initiatives at CERN scale. To illustrate this we have served as advisors for Big data and machine learning initiatives for global leading companies such as Bank of England, ASML, UPS, Gasco, ENI, Nespresso, BMW, in this area.  Based on this extensive experience Orvium integrates Blockchain data with Big Data and Machine Learning techniques to improve the scientific production efficiency and enhance the required scientific content validation.  Also the expertise in databases and storage solution is outstanding. Team members are responsible for CERN databases services and storage (to illustrate the complexity of those services CERN generated 1 PB per sec, which far beyond any other company such as google, facebook, etc.).  Orvium is totally agnostic in terms of licensing and copyright,  this empower researchers and users to have full control over these aspects  We also provide a decentralized platform for creating and managing scientific journals. This reduces drastically the cost associated with journal operations and allow everyone to create their own journal.  Orvium does not enforce any restriction in terms of costs per action, researchers and users define, based on factor such as the need for peer-reviews or urgency, the price to pay for each of them.

The world‚Äôs largest academic publisher grew its profits to more than ¬£900 million last year. Moreover, the existing publication model has several problems affecting science, including high publication costs (thousands of dollars); copyrights don‚Äôt belong to authors but to publishers; a long, non-transparent and often biased publication process and peers; lack of reward and recognition to reviewers.  What is Orvium?  Orvium is the first open source and decentralized framework for managing the life cycles of scientific publications and relevant data. Orvium opens the whole potential of a decentralized, fair, transparent and competitive market without prejudices, oligopolies and private interests.  Orvium uses blockchain technologies and decentralized storage to create a completely open, trackable and credible record of the publishing process. Each relevant action in the publishing process will be recorded in a blockchain and available to everyone, which will make science more transparent, universal and open than ever before.
