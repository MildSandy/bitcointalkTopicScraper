No news updates or communication from the team.  They keep saying that updates are coming, updates are coming, but they never actually come out with anything.  It's been months now.  By now, the DICE team should have probably figured out that their investors don't want to be left in the dark.  But then again it seems their tenacity on normal business practices is inexistant.  They tried to pull the rug from under early investors by switching to the waves platform (something they tried to sell everyone as being SUPER positive), when in fact it was really just fucking everyone over, when they realized the backlash they pissed backwards into staying an ERC-20 token.  TALK TO YOU INVESTORS.  There is no excuse for the team's lack of communication or updates.  The only excuse is to realize that they are exit scamming.

It is hard to imagine any higher level of decentralisation than this. There could be a billion small databases, and each one different from the others. Consensus between them is not needed since each one holds information only about a small fraction of the entire system. However the generated data units are the valid medium for exchange in all clusters at once. And from a user perspective the choice is very simple – they can move in a different cluster at any moment, so the natural selection rules apply on the market as well. Regarding deployment – any basic computing system, even a $5 embedded module, can be an operator node in the global ecosystem. The deployment costs are practically zero, and the transaction costs are an absolute zero since the incentive for all sides comes from elsewhere, not from costs.  ",False
