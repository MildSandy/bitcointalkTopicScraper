As before, we see priority only in the full implementation of the declared product, and not in meeting the immediate interests of speculators. It is very important to understand that before the launch of the platform in the regular mode and the lack of demand for coins from real users, the price will be formed solely through the actions of speculators. This will in no way contribute to the successful implementation of the project, but on the contrary will harm it. ===========================  2) The legal aspect. Today, most of the major trading floors with which we entered into a discussion of cooperation, refuse to sign official legal documents regulating the relationship of the parties (this is about TOP 15). The only exchange that provides such an opportunity is Kucoin. It is with this platform that we intend to continue the dialogue in the future and issue a token on it when the platform is launched. Timely start of trades on the top platform, finished product and organic demand for coins from the users of the company's products will have an impact on the positive dynamics of OKOIN's value growth in the market and will attract new tokenholders. =========================== 3) Team error in the estimation of volumes and terms of work with exchanges. The lack of an opportunity to start negotiations with exchanges before the end of sales (they do not consider such applications in principle), stricter requirements and long expectations of responses to inquiries from exchanges did not allow us to carry out these works in the earlier planned time. Despite this, we did not delay the deadline for our part, filed applications, provided the necessary information and documents to all conditionally free top-end exchanges. With some of them we continue to communicate and discuss cooperation.  We strongly recommend not trusting information about the activities of VR Technology, which is located outside the company's official communication channels. You can quickly track information about all updates, exchanges, products and results of work in our official group in Telegram and on the site.",False

The user puts on the virtual reality helmet VR OKO and sees the broadcast from cameras in a real casino (viewing angle of 180 degrees). The cameras only capture the table and the dealer, so they do not violate the casino rules regarding security and privacy. If desired, the user can make a bid using the OKOIN tokens. OKOIN token is actively used in the infrastructure of VR OKO and OKO Pay projects, developed by VR Technologies company. The same token is used for betting in the online casino system of VR Casino OKO OKOIN is a liquid means of settlements.

Since May 2018 anyone can accept OKOIN for payment within the program of the OKO Pay project. And, there are at least 10 good reasons for that.  1. Expand the reach of your target audience and sales growth OKOIN holders are solvent potential consumers. When the business starts accepting OKOIN, all these people are notified. As a result, new customers come to you, and the token becomes stable, liquid and constantly growing in price. So, everyone wins.  To set up OKO Pay, please, send an application to the e-mail: parthner@vrtechnology.cz  2. You attract younger clients The majority of OKOIN users are young, technically literate and well-off people with incomes above the average. Hardly anybody use OKOIN by mistake, so those who do will try to find new and interesting options for using it.  3. Status of a leading store Customers love when companies from whom they buy goods and services do their best to keep up with the latest technology trends. When you accept cryptocurrency, your status and credibility grow.  4. Transaction security OKOIN function on blocking technology, thanks to which it is impossible to falsify transaction reports. As a result, both you and your customers are effectively protected from fraud.  5. Reduction of commission fees Using of the OKO Pay service and the OKOIN token as a means of payment is much less expensive than servicing of a credit or debit card. While large sellers from traditional business areas negotiate with acquiring companies to reduce transaction fees, the adult business and gambling are not in a position to do so. These business segments always have the status ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù at banks and are charged with additional and very significant commissions from payments. OKOIN eliminates commissions and improves profit margins of your business.  6. Simplicity You do not need to be an expert in cryptocurrencies to set up OKO Pay. The interface is user-friendly, and the technical support of OKOIN works around the clock and always helps with integration if necessary.  7. A good reason to remind about yourself Sometimes it is difficult to come up with a reason to write to customers who have not bought from you for a long time. The announcement that you started accepting OKOIN for goods and services on the site is a very good reason. So, you keep in touch with old customers, increase LTV and revive the contact database.  8. Simplification of international payments International transaction fees can lead to high costs of doing business in other countries. For OKOIN there are no borders and no difference where, when and to whom to send. That is how you expand the geography of your business and make more sales.  9. Transactions without the risk of ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù Another serious advantage for sellers accepting OKOIN (especially important for gambling and adult businesses) is the speed at which they will receive money. At the moment most payments made with a credit card can be withheld for more than a week. As a result, the seller is forced to wait. If you operate an adult business or work in the gambling market, then using OKOIN is a much more convenient option, because the ‚Äúhold‚Äù does not exist.  10. Protection from consumer extremism Because OKOIN is encrypted and the transactions are anonymous, the consumer can not cancel them or appeal the payment at a bank. It means that you are effectively protected from unscrupulous consumers.  Read more about the OKOIN project and the OKO Pay system on the official website.",False

Road Map of the VR Technology Company (OKOIN Project) for March 2018 Let there be sex! Not some sex. Sophisticated. Technological. https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*naytqFCAlj4anHSCb5x0bw.png Just think, new technologies emerges every day opening up new horizons of sexual experience for men and women. Everything you could not have been experienced in reality before for some reasons (prejudices, ethical norms, embarrassment, guilt, and social stigma) is now available in the virtual environment. Whereas emotions and sensations are as close as possible to the real ones.  The VR OKO platform is one of such technologies. It includes a virtual reality helmet and an infrastructure for the distribution of digital content. Putting on the VR OKO helmet, the viewer is immersed in a spherical video with a viewing angle of 180 degrees. This is the game-changing principle of viewing erotic films, which will be appreciated by those who are bored with traditional videos.  Next generation video: VR + full interactivity But that‚Äôs not all. Imagine that actors and actresses from the screen appear right in your room. And even more: you get at your disposal a porno-constructor, with the help of which you create a storyline you want. You choose the actors, the stage, the content. All of these will be in the format of the virtual reality.  Creation of such a constructor is a key goal of the VR Technology team. And from March 2018 its story begins. As the project is large and serious, and the main source of financing are funds of the shareholders of the company and crowdfunding through the ICO, the company will report on the results of the work every 10 days. Plus, we will set clear tasks for the next 10‚Äì15 days.  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Vvasva8wIMiFTjTsVB4oLQ.png  This will allow VR Technology remain as open as possible with transparent business processes. Any feedback from the community is welcome. Especially if it is constructive criticism. Only that way you can make a truly valuable and highly demanded product.  OKO Pay‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpayment system for 100% anonymous settlements There have always been difficulties with settlements in the ‚Äú18+‚Äù industry. And at different levels: starting from government regulation ending with processing of payments. Moreover, there was no concept of anonymity as such that strongly limited the consumer empowerment.  That is why VR Technology has started developing a payment system. OKO Pay is a decentralized payment system based on smart contracts in the Ethereum infrastructure. It uses OKOIN tokens as a means of payment and settlement. OKO Pay is an integral part of the OKO platform and is designed to address issues of anonymity of payments and the speed of mutual settlements. Major work on the system is scheduled to the second quarter of 2018.  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jcJq-7a98IW-S1iXIwHxQg.png  Fast. Simple. Anonymous.  Users who previously could not openly purchase adult content because of the risk of being compromised now face no restrictions using the system OKO Pay. In addition, another advantage of a decentralized blockachain-based payment system is the absolute transparency of operations.  The next step in the evolution of the payment system OKO Pay is the consistent takeover of segments of the adult market and their linking to a single settlement instrument. Ultimately, this is convenient: for both consumers and suppliers of goods and services for adults.  Honest.  At the same time, OKO Pay is designed to solve another serious problem that face paid subscribers on adult sites. This is an automatic renewal of the subscription to access to content and a regular money withdrawal from a bank card without prior notice, and as often happens, the user‚Äôs consent. In the OKO Pay this is impossible. Each time the user makes a decision about certain payments, and the funds always remain exclusively under his or her control.  Complete independence from banks!  The main feature of the payment system based on the blockchain is the complete elimination of the hold of money in banks, and, as a consequence, transactions delays. This is particularly true, because more than a third of transactions in the ‚Äú18+‚Äù sphere are filtered out as ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù and frozen up to several days for verification. So, obviously, this cause inconvenience to both buyers and sellers.  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R25DXGpDExPj2AL38HK57g.png  Furthermore, unlike traditional banking systems of receiving and processing of payments, OKO Pay is much easier to connect and use. At the same time, the system stands in one row with Ethereum and Bitcoin in terms of the level of security. Tokens, thanks to two rounds of ICO, are liquid and are of an independent value, and the use of the blockchain technology guarantees 100% reliability and anonymity. The more content studios produce, the more active paying audience gets the system. The higher the audience coverage, the higher the price and stability of the token. The higher the stability of the token more studios show interest to it. We have come full circle.  Alpha testing of the platform Alpha testing (technical launch) of the platform allows to debug the basic functionality and protect it from errors and failures. So, during the testing, developers will debug the work in the following aspects: The efficiency of the OKO Pay system Stability of the library synchronization with the platform infrastructure Correctness of work with different types of devices Checking security systems and countering DDoS attacks Scaling the system in case of increased load ‚Ä¶ and many others.  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*el0wM85F6U5vsyIo5Y97RQ.png  The planned period of the alpha testing is the second decade of March 2018.  Closed Beta testing The difference from alpha testing is that real users and trusted service providers are involved in beta testing for more detailed testing of the platform performance. In other words, these are the final preparations, followed by a full-fledged launch of the platform for everyone.  https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*cLo-Rn3ZhyWZaR0OFgwRHQ.png  Beta testing starts in late March, and the final release of the platform will be held on April 25 as part of the closed party OKO Star. In March 2018 all preparations will be done. Already now, VR Technology is negotiating with leading erotic theaters and show in the world. By the way, invitations to the party will be raffled among the buyers of OKOIN.    ‚Äî Renat Bachmut, Technical Director VR Technology",False

But for now it‚Äôs a ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù from me on the investment front, until I see some more public appearances and interviews from the team.  The things I like about the project:  The buzz/interest here and in the Telegram group is definitely picking up. I think it was an extremely astute move from OKoin to extend the ICO end date until April, as the crypto industry is just now warming up to the idea of adult entertainment on the blockchain. 6 months ago was probably too early, but now the time seems ripe. Nearly all the posts here and in the Telegram are investment related questions about the company‚Äôs fundamentals (as opposed to raunchy porn talk). And OKoin brand in general seems to be more female friendly than other blockchain adult industry tokens.  The token use for the OKoin to pay for premium adult content online within their ecosystem is an actual legitimate use case for a token. People are ALWAYS going to want to anonymize their online porn habits. And paying with a credit card is the main impediment to that. Having existing tokens in your possession that can be used to pay for adult content online really will serve to increase sales that might have previously been halted due to the credit card issue.  The company‚Äôs ‚ÄúOKO Stars Private Party‚Äù launch party at a castle in Prague I think is an actual great marketing idea, in an ICO world full of partnership and social media subscriber count talk. Airfare, hotel, party in a castle with the OKO stars, Prague‚Ä¶ who wouldn‚Äôt want all that??? Cheers to actual good marketing.  The stats seem to indicate the company‚Äôs VR headset product is ripe for growth. Google searches related to Virtual Adult Entertainment have increased 9,900% in the last two years. Sales of VR headsets are projected to increase 10x by 2020, and monthly growth in the audience of VR adult movies is currently at 250-300%.  And not only does the company already have a working product in their VR headset, it‚Äôs sold 90,000 units thus far (according to the company). If those sales figures are correct, this seems like a good example of a company that has a product that‚Äôs sold well in initial test markets, and that needs the capital raised from an ICO to scale up production and introduce the products to new markets around the world.  The team members themselves are active in the forums and on Telegram, so that‚Äôs good. And they seem like nice guys.  But the only thing holding me back from investing is that I can‚Äôt really find much information online about the team or their company. Now a lot of that isn‚Äôt really their fault, as the adult industry is anonymous and private by nature, and plus the company is located in Prague ‚Äì not exactly a mecca of blockchain activity. And Linkedin isn‚Äôt exactly commonplace in the adult industry. But as of now, it‚Äôs just been sponsored articles on crypto news sites, and the telegram/bitcointalk activity. I‚Äôd like to see more appearances from the team at conferences (within either the crypto industry or adult industry), and maybe some interviews, again within either the crypto space or the adult space. That would add some legitimacy to things. Otherwise, this project has a ton of upside and is something I will be watching closely going forward.",False

The OKOIN is based on the blockchain technology that allows achieving a number of serious goals 1Ô∏è‚É£ full anonymity of payments for users, which is more than 30% of the world's population 2Ô∏è‚É£ independence from traditional financial partners, banks and payment providers. Stability and honesty of mutual settlements between the parties to the transaction.  üöÄ Virtual reality technology in the OKOIN project satisfies the basic human need ‚Äì a constant search for new and previously unknown sensations. The desire to get these feelings makes us tick, regardless of gender, age and nationality.  All these facts allow us to draw a conclusion about the serious stability and prospects of OKOIN in times of sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the main cryptocurrencies.  Relying on fundamental values ‚Äì constantly growing demand, satisfaction of market needs and stability, we understand that OKOIN can become an instrument of preservation and augmentation of capital for many crypto investors.  For our investors, the drawdown of the cryptocurrency exchange rate at the moment means only one thing ‚Äì it's a great opportunity to buy OKOIN on better terms at the beginning of its path to success!  The choice is yours! Convert crypto assets into fiat and absorb losses, keep observing the global market decline and do nothing or look for growth options.",False

Official VR Technology statement based on ICO results.  Dear friends, investors, colleagues, partners and customers,  The Board of Directors of VR Technology has decided to launch the second ICO round for the OKOIN project. This round will start on January 25, 2018 and end on April 25, 2018, with the tokens entering free auction on May 20, 2018.  The reasons why we made this decision are as follows: ‚Äî We have yet to reach our stated goal. This does not in any way jeopardize the fulfillment of all the obligations assumed by the project team, but does limit its capabilities. The prospects for reaching the goal are high. We know this by the growing interest of our partners and investors in our project and the increased number of interested parties by the end of the first round. We were in fact met with a lack of time and restrictions that we simply couldn‚Äôt foresee (first and foremost, the censorship of advertising platforms because of the adult subject matter of our project). Yet despite numerous challenges, we still conducted a full-fledged marketing campaign, told the whole world about our project, and received support from funds, private investors and top-class specialists from various IT fields willing to share in the development of our product. In the second round we intend to address these challenges, including through a bounty campaign (our audience‚Äôs help in distributing information about the project in circumvention of the censorship of some crypto media).  The benefits of attaining our goal within the foreseeable future are obvious for investors. The coin‚Äôs growing capitalization and its increased liquidity are sure to have a positive effect on the rapid rate increase when entering the exchange. Attaining this goal will enable us to order, purchase and involve much more VR adult content, which in no time will make the platform the leader in adult VR content, a highly promising area in terms of market development. Many have argued that our goal is too high and a project like this does not need such voluminous investment. But from the very beginning we have understood that to become the market leader, we must fill the platform with a huge amount of content in a really short time. Given that the average market cost of one high-quality VR video is EUR 8,000, and to fill the platform we need more than 100 or even 1,000 videos, our goal does not seem either high or unattainable. We didn‚Äôt expect quick success in the ICO, but we are confident in the timely success of our roadmap.  ‚Äî The risk of exchange speculations with respect to our token, and as a result a drop in its value and inadequate liquidity. Such actions and their consequences may jeopardize the entire project. We are not prepared to risk what we already have for the sake of short-term benefits; we see more significant benefits for all our investors in the medium term, not to mention the long run.  ‚Äî The team‚Äôs objective is to form more fundamental token values before April 25 by implementing the first stage of the roadmap (the team will report on the progress to investors online on the website), increase coin liquidity (by involving new investors and achieving the goal in the second round), thus avoiding high-risk speculations, including on the part of pumpers. The coin value will also increase due to new arrangements with partners who are prepared in the near future to start accepting okoins as payment for services and goods (during the first round campaign, our project drew attention from production studios, content distributors, etc. Today, we continue negotiations with many of them and expect they will conclude successfully. By the time okoin enters the exchange, it will be used extensively as a payment means on adult websites, sex shops, online chats and other related resources. This will create over-the-counter demand for the coin and save it from unfriendly speculations, which will later lead to a stable increase in its market value and add stability to the okoin token. We did not issue tokens for the sake of tokens: our goal is to create a stable crypto currency to be widely used in adult projects, and not to just become another speculative bubble threatening investors.  It should be noted that we are the first adult ICO project disclosing our team members and their names, and officially registered as a legal entity in the European Union. Indeed, we are maximally public (publish progress reports on the official websites and disclose our team, which is not typical for this market). Previously, many successful adult ICOs either turned out to be a scam and disappeared with the investors‚Äô money, or fell into a speculative bubble at the start because of incompetent management, could not keep up token stability, and lost funds for the project‚Äôs implementation. As a result, most investors lost their money.  We are also starting work on the VR adult chat ahead of the roadmap schedule.  Benefits for current investors (early investors): ‚Äî Every investor receives a 100% bonus regardless of the amount of their investment. Bonuses will be distributed in the span of month.  ‚Äî During the second round, positive token price growth dynamics are allowed up to $8 by April 25. Thus, we can forecast the token price to be a minimum of $8 upon market entry, which gives early investors the opportunity to make a profit of x8. Market entry: May 20.  ‚Äî High asset liquidity is confirmed by completed platform development works (see above).  We disclose both the team of developers and their director engaged in the platform‚Äôs development, and report online about progress and tasks completed (github, video blogs, Progress Report website section)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsome claimed that we do not disclose our developer team, only management.  Along with the statement, the drawing mechanics and winners are also published. The announcement of the event‚Äôs postponement to April 25 (see the reasons in Clause 1). Another 30 tickets will be allocated for the drawing in the second round.  Bounty campaign to be held for the second round (will be published within 2 days)  April 25: event, presentation of the platform‚Äôs beta version (fulfillment of obligations for the first stage of the roadmap).  Thank you for your understanding, and thank you all for being with us!  The VR Technology Team Join our Telegram group ‚Äî https://t.me/okoinico  P.S. We‚Äôre going to update www.okoin.io before January 25 to include information about the second ICO round, and an extensive team-related data unit. The latter will now feature info about the development team as well, not just about the organizers.",False

WHITE PAPER  |  ROADMAP  |  ABOUT  |  OKO STARS  |  HOW TO INVEST | BOUNTY   We raised more than $25 million in 1st round News about this on Bitcoin.com   The decentralized VR OKO platform is the driver of progress on the pornography market, with no equals as yet. The platform, which is protected against hacking, solves several problems at once, all of which seriously inhibit the development of the pornography market:   Switching to a new video playback format. In the last two years, the number of search requests related to VR porno has increased by 9,900% (according to official statistics from Google). The monthly growth in the audience of VR movies for adults is 250-300%. Deliveries of VR headsets will multiply by 10 by 2020, according to predictions by VR HMD (Head Mounted Display) market researchers at the Juniper Research company. By 2020, the VR pornography market will be worth $1 billion per year.   Pornographic content distribution without intermediaries.   Fighting against piracy. A distributed open-source database for controlling rights to intellectual property.   The anonymity of users and payments. In most countries, pornography is legal, but there are serious limitations on its distribution. Confidentiality is made possible thanks to the level of security, transparency and permanence of records that blockchain technology provides.   The ability to set up private video chats in virtual reality without intermediary websites and currently existing limitations. VR technologies are certain to breathe new life into the type of adult content in which a girl in a video chat does what is asked of her. The effect of presence in such videos will increase as it will be possible to almost ‚Äòtouch‚Äô the girls.   A virtual market of goods and services for adults. Millions of commercial applications from manufacturers without intermediaries.   The decentralized P2P principle allows for the elimination of intermediary services.   The platform offers its users the opportunity to become part of the blockchain-managed decentralized pornographic market; to take part in a new evolutionary stage of a powerful and extremely stable industry; to contribute personally to the creation of an independent and secure platform with a multitude of interactive services, a pornographic VR video library and the largest adult sales platform in the world. For all users, this blockchain-built platform offers the opportunity to publish their own content based on the principles of the P2P technology. It also gives them the ability to absolutely safely and anonymously invest in new projects on the pornographic market and get royalties from them in the future. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many OKOINs a user has: one or ten million. Each user gets the opportunity to make profitable investments in the most stable and high-turnover ‚Äòadult business‚Äô. The O–öO platform is a groundbreaking project for a huge industry that distributes the value it creates among those participating in the ecosystem.
