We wanted to give you an update on the happenings behind the scenes of Aitheon.  As you are well versed in crypto, you know that the process of getting on exchanges requires intensive back and forth relay of information and verification for the process to be completed and AIC to be listed on exchanges.  Likewise, we at Aitheon also want to make sure that we are on exchanges with high volume and a solid reputation for ease and safety of user. We also firmly believe that we need to be making the RIGHT moves, versus haphazardly making any available ‚Äúright now‚Äù move.  We will continue to move forward with the exchange process and expect this to be completed within the upcoming weeks. Total token allocation we expect to announce within 1-2 weeks and airdrop tokens will begin distribution soon after.  Keep in mind that in the near future major news about Aitheon will be announced. (The public announcement of the largest robotics deal that you, as our members, had private access to will take place within the next few months.)   Remember that we are all token holders and members of this community. As leaders of such, we know that our decisions impact each and every one of us and we want to make the best possible decisions.  Some exciting news-  Our first official bartending robot was purchased during the ICO by D26 Bar in Hong Kong!! The Core Team will be flying out in the upcoming weeks to install it; where it will be serving drinks at the 2018 LKF Beer and Music Festival July 21st & 22nd to an estimated crowd of 50,000 people. We couldn‚Äôt be more excited!!!!   Other types of robotics will be coming out shortly which will expand the Aitheon Platform offerings and also the visible markets to the public. We have been contracted to start automating several other small businesses including a crepery, frozen yogurt shop, a restaurant, and another bar.

Soma initially choose the ticker SCT for their symbol, but yobit already has SCT dedicated for scryptoken, so they got S-O-M-A instead of S-C-T for yobit while on other exchange like cryptopia, they still listed as SCT.

Aitheon is partnering up with CarSmartt, a unique ride-sharing and package delivery application, to develop, test, and launch a fleet of driverless vehicles. Aitheon will implement the same driverless technology that has been showcased in Miami, backed by the safety and reliability provided by remote ‚Äúpilots‚Äù operating on the Aitheon network.  With Aitheon working on developing and installing the driverless system, Carsmartt plans to purchase and operate a fleet of cars to deliver packages to customers, which will be controlled by the blockchain.  Aitheon plans on building and testing at least 5 of their driverless vehicles in 2018 at the CarSmartt production facility in Nevada. They are currently working on integrating the CarSmartt application into the Aitheon platform, a phase they plan to complete in the next 4 months. The vehicle testing phase is scheduled to commence later in summer this year.  Aitheon will bring in the hardware and software technology through partnerships with Quanergy, the leading provider of solid-state LIDAR sensors and smart sensing solutions and Nvidia Driveworks, a leader in advanced automotive technologies, to operate the driverless vehicles around the clock. The final testing of the vehicles will be done in Italy; Aitheon and CarSmartt expect to produce around 5 to 10 cars per month....",False
