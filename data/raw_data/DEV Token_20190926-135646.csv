Quote from: Barley Hertog on March 09, 2018, 12:03:15 PM Quote from: devcrypt.io on March 09, 2018, 05:55:16 AM  Quote from: Barley Hertog on March 08, 2018, 06:08:05 PM Am I right that the main source of your income is special options for contractors' advertising on the platform?  As well as advertising and options for freelancers.    Thanks for the answer! But what makes you so sure that the fee-less business model will work? Now it seems that it CAN work only when the project investments are growing together with the users amount, and the token price rises. Once the growth goes slower, you'll have to take fees. To my mind.  It will work regardless of the token price or project investments. As long as users are using the platform the model will be sufficient.

If that's just a way to attract people it won't work, because anyone attracted by that magic word will simply get pissed off and leave as soon as he realizes that you have been been lying already in the title.  If you looked more closely there is a link to our airdrop which is almost over now.  OOpps, sorry, you are right, I didn't see the link at first, my bad. It just happens so often that the word airdrop is abused. Again I apologize.  No worries, happens to everyone  to all others: as always, THANKS FOR THE SUPPORT!",False
