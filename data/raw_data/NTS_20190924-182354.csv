The NTS token is a ""utility token"" that will have several usages within our Financial Services ecosystem.  Discounted trading fees (50% off) is one benefit of holding and using NTS.  Free Global KYC and ID Verification services is another.  Additionally, our Merchant Payment Services and Ecommerce Platforms will also employ the NTS token as a utility/payment token.  In essence, the NTS token will underpin the entire ecosystem, so holding and deploying the token across the ecosystem is beneficial for users as it provides both access to and, at times, discounts on, our services.  The benefit you will experience will be as a USER of the platform. Hence, the utility nature of the token.  To recap:  Benefit #1: reduced trading fees with NTS. Benefit #2: ultra low listing fees for ecommerce merchants. Benefit #3: ultra low cost transactions for Merchant Payment Processing (another area that kills merchants with high fees). Plus no more chargebacks! (That in and of itself is HUGE for merchants.) Benefit #4: Global KYC Identification Verification Services FREE for holders of 10K+ NTS tokens.  If you see NO benefit to using the platform, i.e.:  - you're not a cryptocurrency trader who'd like discounted fees, - you never foresee sending money to anyone across the globe, - you never foresee selling anything as a merchant online or buying anything online as a purchaser, - or you never foresee needing Global KYC Identity Verification Services for free,  then maybe this isn't a good fit for you.  For a comparative analysis to similar-type tokens, I would refer you to pages 13-22 of our whitepaper, so that you are able to conduct your own due diligence and evaluate the utility of the NTS token against your own personal needs.  www.nauticus.io/whitepaper",False

A theoretical maximum of 2,500,000,000 Nauticus Coins are available.  Tokens sold to users will account for 80% of total supply; 8.5% of the token supply will be allocated to the core team and another 1.5% will go to advisors (the percentage allocations will be in proportion to the number of tokens sold to users). Ten percent of the total supply will be used in the referrals program.  At the end of the ICO any unsold or unallocated Nauticus Coins will not be generated. The token contract itself will be generated AFTER the ICO, therefore, unsold tokens will simply NOT be generated (the equivalent of burning them, if they had already been generated).

Users from around the world will be able to buy whatever crypto they wish using their own nation’s fiat money.  The Exchange will also enable users and merchants to send and receive payments internationally — like PayPal and Western Union combined, but with much lower fees and live market rates. More than 450,000 users have already signed up to the platform and Nauticus is registered with Australian Government regulator AUSTRAC.  The exchange will have a truly global focus and will support seven major foreign currencies at launch  —  🇺🇸USD, 🇪🇺EUR,  🇯🇵JPY,  🇭🇰HKD,  🇦🇺AUD,  🇿🇦ZAR &  🇨🇳RMB. This will later expand to 16 fiat.  Only BTC, ETH and NTS will be able to be directly exchanged for all of the other altcoins.  Using NTS to purchase your altcoins will give users 50% off all trading fees, which will drive the adoption, use, demand, and price of the coin.   Each phase of the project is a solution that builds on top of each other, allowing the whole to become more efficient and cost effective, hence increasing competitive advantages.

Luckily, I've realized that Nauticus alone will solve at least four of the reservations I've had about the shortcomings of innovation failing to keep up with distributed ledger technology. Such reservations are in the eCommerce, merchant payments, global KYC and ICO gateway sectors within the blockchain ecosystem.  I am relived but mostly excited to see Nauticus finally capitalize and solve these problems because one of the most attractive traits of blockchain technology is the ability to maximize convenience for anything that it touches as it should. For example, the worldwide eCommerce will unite buyers and sellers into one marketplace and freely be able to make peer to peer transactions through a safe and trustworthy marketplace using cryptocurrencies. Secondly, the introduction of merchant payments is something that has somehow eluded many others but hopefully it can finally be cracked and we see crypto merchant payments finally reach the masses.  Since all these will be carried out through the blockchain, it means that transactions will be faster, cheaper and more reliable for all parties involved.",False

Users from around the world will be able to buy whatever crypto they wish using their own nation’s fiat money.  The Exchange will also enable users and merchants to send and receive payments internationally — like PayPal and Western Union combined, but with much lower fees and live market rates. More than 450,000 users have already signed up to the platform and Nauticus is registered with Australian Government regulator AUSTRAC.  The exchange will have a truly global focus and will support seven major foreign currencies at launch  —  🇺🇸USD, 🇪🇺EUR,  🇯🇵JPY,  🇭🇰HKD,  🇦🇺AUD,  🇿🇦ZAR &  🇨🇳RMB. This will later expand to 16 fiat.  Only BTC, ETH and NTS will be able to be directly exchanged for all of the other altcoins.  Using NTS to purchase your altcoins will give users 50% off all trading fees, which will drive the adoption, use, demand, and price of the coin.

Luckily, I've realized that Nauticus alone will solve at least four of the reservations I've had about the shortcomings of innovation failing to keep up with distributed ledger technology. Such reservations are in the eCommerce, merchant payments, global KYC and ICO gateway sectors within the blockchain ecosystem.  I am relived but mostly excited to see Nauticus finally capitalize and solve these problems because one of the most attractive traits of blockchain technology is the ability to maximize convenience for anything that it touches as it should. For example, the worldwide eCommerce will unite buyers and sellers into one marketplace and freely be able to make peer to peer transactions through a safe and trustworthy marketplace using cryptocurrencies. Secondly, the introduction of merchant payments is something that has somehow eluded many others but hopefully it can finally be cracked and we see crypto merchant payments finally reach the masses.  Since all these will be carried out through the blockchain, it means that transactions will be faster, cheaper and more reliable for all parties involved.",False

An exchange that has multiple trading pairs tied to hundreds of cryptocurrencies will make this a one stop platform for both the serious investor and the inexperienced investor.  I was surprised to find out that one of the features of this exchange is the ability to support ICO's during the investment stage and listing them on the exchange once they go live. A problem I have when dealing with ICO's is the whole KYC procedure we're faced to endure for each and every new ICO that we partake in. Hopefully this 'Global KYC Verification' system will truly solve this problem even if it is just for the ICO projects that Nauticus will support.  Even before its launch the project is already strides ahead of its competitors with the recent delivery of its mobile wallet app which is going to make it easier for me to stay connected everywhere I am. Talk about a one stop crypto shop!  I look forward to making this Nauticus my new home.,False

Many exchanges have one or a few FIAT for trading. With 100 different currencies, it will make it a global exchange and any one from the world should be able to use it with their currency. The hassle of gauging cryptocurrency to FIAT will be history. This should help investors to easily tell if their efforts are rewarded or re-evaluate strategy.  Many investors are waiting for the launch of this exchange. The beta version is already looking very friendly and should be very easy to use. The visibility of all the functionality and easy of use with all the major cryptocurrencies visible will make it a breeze for people who are technologically challenged.  The greatest advantage of this exchange is the regulatory registration and following the law of the country of operation. Another added bonus of assurance to the already shaky crypto world.  In my opinion, I will be using this at ease with great hopes. I can't wait for the project to finally go launch to make the impossible happen.

One **very** important fact needs to be stated here:  As stated on page 37 of our whitepaper, purchased tokens can be traded immediately on our Nauticus exchange once it launches in August. However, free, gifted and referral tokens are restricted to our platform only (for example for use in trading fees) for a period of 2 years after the ICO. After this period, they can be freely exchanged for fiat or other cryptocurrencies. 🎁   🚫 This is to prevent large volume of free tokens immediately to be traded upon the launch of our exchange, and letting the REAL contributors suffer. This is a way of weeding out people who are only attracted to the referral program to make a quick profit and are not really interested in contributing to the project.  We Love and Care about our users, and will do everything to ensure true FAIRNESS, after all this is the whole idea of blockchain.

Tokens are allocated as 80% to public sale pool, 10% user referral program, 1.5% advisors, 8.5% team. And all token metrics are based on public pool as priority.  All unsold tokens are burned based on public ratio 80:20, ensuring fair value for all contributors.  So, in really simple terms, it's best to think of it like this: whatever number of tokens are sold during the ICO is the single largest determinant of what eventual TOTAL token supply will be, as the public sale constitutes 80% of TOTAL supply.  For example, if we only sell 500K tokens during the ICO, then that means that 500K is now eqal to 80% of total supply, only leaving 125K for the other 20% and meaning that all tokens above the 625K amount will be burned, greatly reducing supply.  This is a really easy way to think about it. So, at present, it's hard to say what the FINAL total token supply will be (until the ICO ends).  But what we can say for sure, is that whatever amount of tokens are sold during the ICO, this # will automatically become 80% of total supply, thus determining total supply amount.

Seems there is a misunderstanding...  There is no KYC required to participate in our ICO. You may participate without any KYC requirements whatsoever.  However, as per the requirements of our AUSTRAC-administered Digital Currency Exchange and Remittance registrations, KYC is required to use our exchange or send tokens from our digital exchange wallet to another wallet.  We will shortly release a KYC section into our ICO contributor dashboard for users who have registered during our ICO, so that they can complete their exchange KYC requirements PRIOR to the launch of our exchange.  This means ICO participants will be the first that are KYC-verified and able to use our exchange.  Hope this clarifies things for you  ",False

It's a great one!  The main purpose upon launching our ICO was to raise enough funds to launch the first pillar of our ecosystem (the crypto exchange) as you rightly pointed out. The soft cap that we set ($8M) was to allow for the accomplishment of that goal. Thankfully, as of today, we have raised almost $15.2M (effectively, almost doubling our soft cap) and equalling the amount Binance raised in its ICO last year.  This is excellent news as it allows us, not only to launch our high-speed exchange as planned by mid-August, however, it also gives us a head-start towards the launch of our green blockchain mining center next year as well.  In fact, the funds raised during the ICO and those raised during our leadership team's recent World Tour give us such a head-start, that our CEO, Bryan NG, was quoted in a recent article on our Medium blog, as saying, ""“We have raised more than $4 million during our whirlwind world tour but, more importantly, we have forged new partnerships that could advance the project by an entire year.”  (Read full article here: https://medium.com/nauticus-blockchain/nauticus-announces-bonus-sale-426827fc411f)  So, from our perspective we are doing exceedingly well meeting our targets.  Additionally, as outlined on page 18-19 of our whitepaper (found here: https://cdn.nauticus.io/NauticusWhitepaperOfficial.pdf, our *very conservative* gross revenue projection for year 1 is $48.03 million, with a net profit (after tax) of $19 million.  This will put us in a strong position to open the green blockchain mining center without requiring additional ICOs.  Should this change, we will obviously inform all users. But at present, due to our current fundraise, no plans for additional ICOs exist. Hope this helps clarify!",False

Our main sale ended on May 18th and our Bonus Sale runs from May 19th until July 18th.

Then after a period of intense security stress-testing, it will launch in mid-August.  After the incredible experience our leadership team had on their recent World Tour and the amount of excitement our project generated, plus the number of strategic partnerships we signed, our CEO and COO felt it was best to capitalize on the momentum they had generated and announce a *Bonus Sale* to accomplish two very important goals: 1) attract as many new users to the exchange as possible (as users bring VOLUME and volume is super important for an exchange's success) and 2) to reward our incredible community of early backers, by matching their original bonuses from the main ICO in the bonus round.  So far, this bonus sale as been a resounding success, as early backers are thrilled with the bonus-matching idea and we're signing on registered users for our high-speed exchange at an incredible pace!  The exchange will launch in mid-August (as planned), whether or not the Bonus Sale took place. Allowing for a bonus sale that takes us almost up to launch gives us an opportunity to keep the momentum going to ensure this project is a resounding success for our entire community.

Nauticus is so much more than just a crypto exchange. We aim to create a financial services ecosystem to provide user-friendly, efficient and secure crypto banking, payments and eCommerce solutions. I'd invite you to have a look at our whitepaper, which explains our plans in detail: https://storage.googleapis.com/assets-nauticus-platform/NauticusWhitepaperOfficial.pdf  Main exchange advantages will be:  - high-speed exchange with over 1m tx/sec - interfaces for both mom and pop-type users, as well as advanced traders - a focus on having LOTS of fiat on-ramps We launch our exchange in mid-2018 with 7 fiat currency options, including USD, EUR, JPY, HKD, AUD, CNY and ZAR, and will feature 16 fiat currency on-ramps within 1 year. - also, we will launch with 100+ cryptos and expand to 300+ within 1 year as well.  Regarding token listing:  Our tokens listings go through a selection criteria matrix to ensure that only quality tokens are placed into our platform, encouraging coins that need the support and space to trade.  A number of criteria are considered. Not only trade volume and demand, but also cap size, business management of the coin, brand presence and marketing status. Is the coin viable? Does it have use case? Does it have business case, etc.?  We are currently open for Token listing on our exchange with an early bird offer. If you have a token you'd like us to consider listing, please get in touch with us at listing@nauticus.io.",False

As listed in our whitepaper and on our website, our soft cap is $8m (and that has been reached, allowing us the green light to launch our high-speed crypto and fiat exchange in mid-2018). We set an ICO target of $68m and a hard cap of $88m to allow us flexibility and give us ""stretch-goals"" to kickstart our ambitious 5-year roadmap which includes, a green energy mining center, a global ecommerce platform, a global merchant payment platform, a global KYC verification platform, an ICO gateway, and as a by-product of offering up to 16 fiat currency on-ramps (several international banking licenses - which are not cheap!).  As you can see from our roadmap, we've got lots to do in the next 5 years and giving ourselves those higher 'stretch-goals' for fund-raising will help us shorten that timeline significantly, if we can raise those funds. If not, the exchange launches as planned (since we're already up to $12.6m raised) and we use funds generated from the operation of the exchange to fund our roadmap projects.  In regards to unsold tokens:  Tokens are allocated as 80% to ICO public sale pool, 10% user referral program, 1.5% advisors, 8.5% team. Token metrics are based on public pool as a priority.  All unsold tokens after the ICO are burned based on public ratio 80:20. Ensuring fair value for all contributors.  So, in really simple terms, it's best to think of it like this:  Whatever number of tokens are sold during the ICO is the single largest determinant of what eventual TOTAL token supply will be, as the public sale constitutes 80% of total supply.  Therefore, for example, if we only sell 500K tokens, then that means that 500K is now 80% of total supply, only leaving 125K for the other 20% and meaning that all tokens above the 625K amount will be burned, greatly reducing supply.  This is a really easy way to think about it. So, at present, it's hard to say what the FINAL total token supply will be (until the ICO ends). But what we can say for sure, is that whatever amount of tokens are sold during the ICO, this # will automatically become 80% of total supply, thus determining total supply amount. Hope this helps to clarify and simplify things for your calculations. 🙂",False

Additional funds raised will be applied towards our ambitious roadmap to help speed up our time to market with each of the subsequent 5 pillars of our global financial services ecosystem.

It has provided encouragement and inspiration to our hard-working team to push themselves around the clock to deliver the best quality final product.  Due to concerns driven by recent cases of sophisticated attacks on other exchanges, and a number of reports of scammers attempting to use our brand name, we have decided to conduct additional security testing and implement extra layers of protection to ensure the safest possible ecosystem for Nauticus users.  This will entail a short delay of between 12 to 48 hours before we open up the ICO. The dashboard will be RELEASED AT A RANDOM TIME as soon as the additional safety measures have been implemented and tested, allowing users to sign in and participate in the ICO.  We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this might cause. However, at Nauticus we firmly believe the safety and security of users should always be our No.1 priority. We will make an official announcement on all our social media channels the minute the system is ready.  Kind regards, Barry Cheng, CSO Nauticus  Be sure to join our channel over on Telegram for the latest updates: https://t.me/nauticusblockchain",False
