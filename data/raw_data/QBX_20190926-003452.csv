At qiibee, we will provide a loyalty platform and developer interface on which every loyalty application can be easily decentralized and tokenized. With the addition of our wallet, users will be able to store all loyalty tokens earned in the ecosystem, in one place. Besides that, they will be able to exchange these tokens with each other and thus maximize their freedom of choice. This, in turn will incentivize them to be more active on each account and redeem more rewards.   The opportunities resulting for loyalty program owners from building their applications with our tools include: cost savings, complete removal of the liability connected with unredeemed points, and increased data security, as our platform is based on the Ethereum blockchain. By using the blockchain, we provide an ideal framework for addressing the weak points of today’s loyalty market and making it virtually immune to modification and theft.   Our vision is to connect a highly fragmented market, increase its efficiencies as well as cut out the central data authority, whilst our mission is to become the go-to community for the discipline created by combining loyalty and crypto technology: crypto loyalty.   For more information about qiibee please visit our website: https://tokensale.qiibee.com/#/ and download our white paper: https://tokensale.qiibee.com/src/docs/qiibee-Business-White-Paper-v1.3.pdf   If you have any general questions, I’ll be pleased to answer them. For technical questions, our CTO, Pascal and our Lead Architect, Federico will respond. Whilst token sale related questions will be answered by our CEO, Gabriele.

To sum up, the status quo of the loyalty market faces three inherent problems: 1.  highly fragmented market (due to a huge amount of not compatible loyalty programs companies need huge budgets to attract new customers and keep the existing customer base active) 2.  operational inefficiencies (liability of unredeemed points increases rapidly and low customer activity) 3.  data centralization (customer data are under the risk of attacks and manipulations) Whilst users have a hard time keeping track of their different loyalty points or to catch up with each individual loyalty program offer.  Introducing a loyalty platform on top of a Blockchain can tackle these problems altogether. Decentralized data storage gets rid of the security concerns and possible exploits of the users transaction data. Tokens instead of points stop the increased uncertainty and costs of liabilities and rewards customers with a real value. Combine these advantages in one platform and thereby enabling the exchange of loyalty tokens between different loyalty programs and you get engaged customers on top of it.  And this is exactly what qiibee provides: a loyalty platform and a DevKit enabling an easy and cost-effective integration of new and already existing loyalty applications. Combined with the qiibee Wallet where every loyalty token can be stored, exchanged and even cashed out, an ecosystem with immense network effects arises.

It makes sense and it's straightforward. Qiibee is not a revolutionary innovation and there are lots of competitors on the market. But the idea is good enough for a solid business, with huge market potential. The business use cases in the White Paper are unique. The only issue is the market entry, and the scalability. The team is really good, experienced. I would bet they would be successful. ",False
