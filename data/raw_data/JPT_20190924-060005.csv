ICOs must pass a rigorous process in order to be considered and selected by JP. First, the ICO must have a strong team, with verifiable experience. Next, they must have a strong concept as well as a working prototype or product. The JP Team will also research the top ICO listing and rating sites such as Cryptobriefing.com and ICOBench.com among others. In addition, the JP team will analyze and review activity on their social networks and on discord or telegram groups. The Jointly team will request a KYC certification in order to verify its identity"".  Users will also be able to make proposals for adding the ICO projects, but it will be later.

Quote from: eaglesonms on June 11, 2018, 10:32:09 AM Hello, I tried to find this information on your website, but I could not. What price or bonuses are established at each sales stage?  Hello. Yes, we have progressive bonus system for purchasing tokens. If you buy JPT during 1 stage you will get 15% bonus. Further bonus will decrease: there are 10% for 2 stage, 5% for 3 stage. So it is more profitable to purchase tokens now when the attractive bonuses are available.",False

A new advisor has been added to the project, Do Yeop Kim, which with his knowledge will make a valuable contribution to the success of Jointly. Kim is an advisor for important ICOs like ICOmax, Blocknubie, Amicorum.LIVE and others  We have updated the site and the Whitepaper (available in a few days) with a new section ""financial sector"", where we illustrate the performance of the ICO market from 2014 to 2018. We have also added two graphs to show our forecasts on the volume trend of the Jointly platform over the years as well as Jointly's capitalization (with a consequent increase in the JPT token value).  One month is missing to the pre-ICO and in these weeks we have talked to many investors interested in supporting our marketing campaign  Finally we are proceeding with the development of the platform, precisely we are improving the functionality of the smart-contract at the base of the project. In agreement with the advisors we decided to decrease the bonus issued during the pre-ICO, precisely from 60% to 40%. Consequently the hard-cap will be higher, from 960,000€ to 1,440,000€. We have also decided to change the platform fee from 3.5% to 5% in order to have more funds to improve, in the future, the platform.

Generally a small-medium investor invests from 0.1 ETH to 3 ETH, and we want to take KickIco as a first example: investing 2 ETH the investor would have received 0.5% bonus (2 ETH = 6000 Kick = $ 474), which at the present value, including the bonus, would be 6030 Kick = $ 476.  By investing the usual amount (2 ETH) using Jointly, the investor would have obtained 10% bonus, with a threshold of the common wallet at 1000 ETH, which today would have a value of $ 521.
