Also, we'd like to thank all the professionals for complimenting and promoting the project. Thanks to all of you, we are 4000+ registered members and more than 400 ETH have been deposited in two weeks. And this is just the start!  ICO starts at 10 AM (UTC+1). First round will start at 0.80$. We're glad to announce that we believe our ICO is going to be a success. Make sure to deposit ETH in your wallet to have a chance to get ADE at the best price. Be aware: There is no break between each round, so it is possible that the ICO only lasts a few days.  We received 3 general questions from members we'd like to share to the community to make Adenium clearer for everyone.  What is the difference between lending and Adenium investment plans bot ? Most of current systems run their bot with ETH/BTC collected on their local exchange (blocked coins ""converted"" into lending. The inconvenient is that this system needs to run with ETH/BTC from new members in order to work. Without them, the system crawls down, damaging members and impacting the currency's notoriety quite badly.  With Adenium's investment plan, we do not need ETH from future members. In fact, ETH will already be available for the bot thanks to ICO funds. It will also create strong interest among future members to use a successful and working system.  How are we going to manage the calls? During team creation in December 2017, we recruited 3 people for back office in order to manage phone calls. We also created a partnership with the company Digicall based in our region (Geneva). They have been specializing in this area for more than 30 years. Thanks to this partnership, we are able to receive 25 phone calls at the same time for more communication and humanity with our community.  What is Adenium's ambition in Ecology? This is an area that means a lot to us because of our values. It is important for us to contribute to a better vision of the planet, which is why we've been doing it for multiple years. Ecology will give more importance and credit to Adenium as the world's economy grows in a significant way in this area. All those ingredients will have a positive impact on the long term for the token's price.  If needed, Our team is available to answer any questions about the process of deposits and purchases.  We thank again all of you for your trust and your interest in Adenium and we wish you good luck for ICO.  Regards, Your Adenium Team",False
