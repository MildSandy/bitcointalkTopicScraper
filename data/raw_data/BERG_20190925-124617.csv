BergmannOS is the operating system of the new generation, that gives you full control and automatisation of the cryptocurrency mining. The system is almost ready for usage - a stable beta-version of software complex for miners is already available.    Our video presentation     Bergmann Ecosystem   BergmannOS is a part of the whole ecosystem called Bergmann, that unites separate instruments for the efficient work in cryptosphere. In the nearest future users will have access to a range of different programmes for miners inclusive of the trade bot.  Bergmann team has been engaged in development and research in the field of information technology for over a year. The resulting Bergmann ecosystem will combine the disparate cryptoindustry tools, creating a platform to provide services within the following projects:  BergmannOS — hardware and software system for monitoring and controlling of mining farms.Zephyr (for BergmannOS) — global firmware update introducing the Smart Mining option. Toxer — a system of two major projects: the trading platform and cryptocurrency exchange. Schaman — trading advisor, which will include a telegram-bot for the exchange, customizable according to the system suggestions.   Within BergmannOS a global update under the code-name Zypher is going to bring great benefits to the users of the system.    Why BERG tokens are good to be bought?   BERG tokens allow to pay subsription for BergmanOS. One token for one unit for one month. Its only 2 USD for token on ICO Step 1.  According to product development roadmap few major updates will be done in Q2 2018. Zephyr update the one that make mining bring 15% - 150% more profit because of choose the best altcoing to mine every moment. Zephyr update will be premium account option only that will cost more then basic type subscription. But the same it will allow to earn more as well. BERG token will be accept as a payment even for premium account. So you can pay with 2 USD token aqquired on ICO Step 1 or you can pay 6 USD for premium features. Aqquiring tokens during ICO step 1 cost 3 times lower than it will be available at release.  All above not investment offer.     Technology   BergmannOSS team has developed software complex which consists of several integrated modules divided into two functional parts: Client-side operating system part with full set of tools and drivers for 100% stable of operating mining unit and private key to access server part. Web-based server interface with simple and great interface for remote communication control of the mining units.     Why you should try BergmannOS?   Users can already see the benefits of BergmannOS: 24/7 stable control of your farm Auto and manual tuning of the units Autotuning of video cards Warning messages in the event of failures Reports on system’s state and unites’ work Marketing quotation of crypto currencies User-friendly interface       After the update Zephyr users will get access to the Smart Mining option. The auto-mining of the most profitable currencies will be produced according to the results of the inner analyses of the data of each currency. On the basis of the current difficulty the system will choose the most profitable currencies.  We expect the rise of the price of BERG token on the basis of the limited amount of tokens and the growth of the demand on the services of BergmannOS (as well as the price increase of the package of services in the fiat currency). Moreover the payment in BERG tokens will stay fixed: The user who prefers the payment in fiat currency will pay for the whole package of the service, which includes all options of the ecosystem Bergmann, $10. The holder of tokens acquired during the ICO will continue to pay 1 BERG for the month service.    ICO BergmannOS   Anyone who joins the ICO will get access to a free beta-version of BergmannOS till the end of the ICO. Enquiring tokens holders gain an access to the system and evaluate the functionality of the whole complex. The Bergmann team presents almost ready for the use product that will be upgraded in the participant's sight.    The price of 1 BERG is $3 which covers one month of the service.     Depending on the stage of the ICO the discount up to 33% is guaranteed to all participants: The price of 1 BERG at the first stage of ICO (the first month)  — $2. The price of 1 BERG at the second stage of ICO (the second month)  — $2,5. The price of 1 BERG at the third stage of ICO (the third month)  — $3.    The amount of tokens - 1 764 708 BERG. The sale will take place on the Ethereum platform on the basis of the smart-contract.    BERG tokens will be distributed according to this scheme: 10% BERG tokens (176 471 BERG) go to BergmannOS project 3% BERG tokens (52 942 BERG) go to the team 2% BERG tokens (35 295 BERG) will be distributed among the participants of the bounty-program 85% BERG tokens (1 500 000 BERG) will be distributed among the participants of the ICO         The remained tokens after the campaign will be destroyed.
