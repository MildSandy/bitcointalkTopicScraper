Do you believe it will be the predominate form of charity donation eventually? How long until this becomes a reality?  Really need to know about this before I'll be able to invest.  It is clearly our aim and our vision to make AidCoin the preferred method to donate transparently through blockchain technology. We are developing a solution that really helps solving problems currently present in the non-profit sector, so we believe it will be adopted both from charities and donors.  Obviously blockchain technology and crypto in general are just at the beginning of their development and mass adoption will require time. However, we strongly believe that this will be the future, so being the first mover on this sector gives us a strong advantage.  That's a great argument for your own case. No estimates on the time frame for adoption though? It's really hard to tell in this field, so I can understand your hesitancy. This last year, in the crypto world, has felt like a decade in just about any other market.  For sure time really seems to pass faster in cryptoland than on any other market.. We believe it will be a monthly timeframe (6/12 months) to spread AidCoin adoptions to a core base of donors and Charities. However, to answer your first question (becoming the preferred method for donations), timeframe realistically will be years, since it will take time for the technology and cryptos in general to go mainstream.",False

Token for Charities,"    Thanks all for bringing up great questions and discussions here about Aidcoin. Here are Q&As to questions.   Q&A  Q: Why do you need your own token?  We need our own token for a series of reasons, below the most important ones: A) Nonprofit is a particular sector with specific dynamics, so the idea is to create a token that is easily identifiable with the industry B) We want to be independent from other currencies in terms of image, monetary policy, price dynamics and future technological choices C) We aim to align investors and donors motivations, and leverage positive and charitable behaviours from the different actors involved in the cryptospace D) The token is used to pay our commission on CharityStars, AIDChain and AIDPay E) Tokens holders will be able to vote on future decisions regarding how to use AIDPool’s tokens that will be used to increase platform adoption among the nonprofit sector.   Q: Why do you need your own ledger? We are creating a platform (AidChain) where every charity and fundraiser organization can easily register a verified account, linked to a specific public address. In this way we are able to track donations transparently.  Will you get partners/charitable organisations to connect up to your platform in the future or will you mainly run your own campaigns and pay them out to different charities? Charitystars will continue to operate its business independently, but we will be the first to integrate and accept AidCoin. AidChain platform however will be open to every charity or fundraiser organization, and our aim is exactly to boost the platform adoption.",False
