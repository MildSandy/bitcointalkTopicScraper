This is a really interesting project. Exact target, good plan, clear path to make a real, needed and valuable system.  But i have a different question here.  Could this system tech be used also for other purposes? Now in general it will be used for precise targeting new dangerous cyber threats.  My question is if this system could be used also for auditing other projects, programs, websites.  There are many projects which could really benefit by sharing their code and paying to make it bulletproof against such threats, safe from general security holes and being well tested by variety of freelancers and hackers.  Actually i see this system as a whole new level of internet development and opportunity for many skilled professionals to use their abilities for good cause and in exchange for a proper salary (also anonymously f.e. in bitcoin, project token and for gaining a real fame in cyberreality).

This is a really interesting project. Exact target, good plan, clear path to make a real, needed and valuable system.  But i have a different question here.  Could this system tech be used also for other purposes? Now in general it will be used for precise targeting new dangerous cyber threats.  My question is if this system could be used also for auditing other projects, programs, websites.  There are many projects which could really benefit by sharing their code and paying to make it bulletproof against such threats, safe from general security holes and being well tested by variety of freelancers and hackers.  Actually i see this system as a whole new level of internet development and opportunity for many skilled professionals to use their abilities for good cause and in exchange for a proper salary (also anonymously f.e. in bitcoin, project token and for gaining a real fame in cyberreality).   Can't wait to see it in action!  P.S. We live in really awesome times guys. We trully shape the future here",False

You have to remember Polyswarm isn't just a random currency crypto, its a platform for security experts to have incentive to find and share security vulnerabilities that are found to help integrate the IT security field.

BlockTower Capital launched in August, raising $140 million from backers including Union Square Ventures LLC and Andreessen Horowitz to bring professional trading and portfolio management to emerging digital assets like PolySwarm. PolySwarm is the first marketplace where security experts are incentivized to detect threats and build anti-malware engines to protect consumers and enterprises.  “BlockTower Capital’s support is a huge vote of confidence for PolySwarm’s mission to decentralize IT security through cryptocurrency-based incentives,” said Steve Bassi, CEO of PolySwarm. “We look forward to building on this momentum as we prepare for our public token sale launching February 20.”  Today’s antivirus and IT security market is dominated by single-vendor offerings that often miss emerging threats. PolySwarm incentivizes a global community of security experts to disrupt the $8.5 billion cyber threat intelligence industry, providing enterprises and consumers with unprecedented speed and accuracy in threat detection. By introducing a platform that encourages innovation and competition, the market will reward experts who are best able to protect users.  PolySwarm’s founders built the company out of Narf Industries, LLC, an information security firm that recently completed a blockchain-based identity management project for the Department of Homeland Security as well as cutting-edge information security projects for DARPA. PolySwarm’s advisory board includes former McAfee CIO Mark Tonnesen, alongside renowned information security and blockchain experts Dan Guido, Chris Eagle, Dr. Sergey Bratus, and Carl Hoffman.  The PolySwarm market runs on Nectar (“NCT”), an ERC20-compatible utility token that makes it easy to submit and classify potential threats on the PolySwarm market. Nectar replaces traditional, outdated antivirus and threat-scanning subscription payments. The Nectar token sale begins February 20, 2018.",False

Threat protection should too.    Website | Whitepaper | How PolySwarm Works | Team & Advisers | Token  Twitter | Medium (Blog) | Reddit | GitHub  What is Polyswarm?  Polyswarm is a decentralized threat intelligence market made possible by Ethereum smart contracts and blockchain technology. Polyswarm incentivizes rapid innovation in the Antivirus and automated cyber threat intelligence space with precise economic incentives that reward timely and accurate threat intelligence. The first of its kind, Polyswarm provides a seamless, real-time threat detection ecosystem involving enterprises, consumers, vendors and geographically diverse security experts. The Polyswarm lowers the barrier to entry and creates the market for tailored threat detection solutions.  Polyswarm fosters a global community of anti-malware experts that work quickly to investigate files, URLs & network traffic and form consensus regarding malicious intent. Whereas today’s market forces users into one-size-fits-all products incapable of providing comprehensive coverage, Polyswarm’s distributed community of experts rewards specialized knowledge that together protects users from All Angles.   How does Polyswarm stand out?  Polyswarm creates value by re-imagining the threat intelligence market. Polyswarm unlocks potential in dormant information security expertise by creating rewards for crowdsourced and collaborative malware detection. Polyswarm incentivizes specialized knowledge and mandates interoperability, allowing enterprises and end users alike to obtain more complete threat coverage.  Headlines frequently call attention to shortcomings in today’s Antivirus and intrusion prevention / detection products. We believe these shortcomings are caused by today’s market incentives. Polyswarm is a carefully designed replacement for this market that will continue to push threat detection forward.
