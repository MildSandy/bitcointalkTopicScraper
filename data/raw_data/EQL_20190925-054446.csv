Indeed, I think we are very different than bitjob and traditional freelance platforms.  Librium introduces the concept of a hybrid between a SaaS marketplace (App Store) and a freelance platform. What that means is that third party developers can build tools to enhance workers' skills. We call these apps the Service Providers of the ecosystem.  As an example, SparkSales.io will be the first Service Provider of the Librium Ecosystem. It provides tools (chat and AI technology) to salesmen, in order to improve the sales of e-commerce businesses. SparkSales is an existing product and business, and will drive initial value for the Librium Ecosystem.  I invite you to read more about all this in our whitepaper.

Yes, we have existing partnerships with digital businesses that currently use SparkSales, as well as workers. We are also establishing partnerships with third party developers and companies that would like to become new Service Providers on the Librium Ecosystem.  Moreover, we will most probably attend these two conferences in November: - World Funding Summit - consensus:invest  Quote from: klarki on November 11, 2017, 09:16:04 PM What is the distinguishing feature of this platform from other products on the market?  Traditional freelance platforms merely put workers in contact with employers. The Librium Ecosystem allows app developers to build tools that identify job opportunities. Workers are then empowered to engage those job opportunities in a manner that helps them to work more efficiently than they would have otherwise.  For example, SparkSales.io provides salesmen with chat-box technology and AI tools, allowing them to provide value that they would not be able to provide otherwise.  This is on top of the decentralized nature of the Librium Ecosystem, that allows for more efficient and lower fees transactions, a reputation system, the Librium Award System and the Librium Loan System.",False
