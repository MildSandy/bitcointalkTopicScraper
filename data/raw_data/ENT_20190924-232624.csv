I talk with Tim McNamara the Founder and Peter Godbolt Blockchain Tech we discuss the The Hut34 project and OnRamp technologies .  Tim and Peters background in the blockchain industry.  The Hut34 project, understanding that data has value and why to monetize the data for the people who use it. Tim explains its much more then that to allow the ever growing world of IOT devices, chatbots and A.I. services to connect. An anonymous data economy.  Utilising blockchain to progress allowing devices to connect, as it grows to find and resolve any data request with the entire network of connect devices.  Being rewarded for your knowledge and data with the Hut34 token Entropy.  Peter explains how The Hut Wallet is designed to make it easy it sign in and out for the everyday user, A Google powered Wallet Using your Google account to manage your Ethereum addresses.  Also how Oauth Google authentication makes it both easy and secure to access your wallet.  The incorporation of Radar Relay in the Wallet  to allow decentralised trading, A peer-to-peer trading platform for Ethereum-based tokens built on the 0x Protocol.   Creation of OnRamp technologies and the OnRamp token the first Australian stable coin which has also has a regulatory oversight.  which is a fiat back Australian dollar token built to the highest regulatory standards.  Designed to give more comfort and a easier pathway into crypto.  Going into more depth about the entropy token and the OnRamp token  Could the OnRamp token Rival Tether as a back stable coin, explaining the OnRamp token has highest regulatory oversight in Australian and Issue with Tether is the current issue of lack of transparency if one Tether is back by one US Dollar.  OnRamp tokenises access to real assets. OnRamp tokens are ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"Entropy Token Liquidity (ENTRP)  As part of the development of The Hut34 Project and ecosystem, we believe creation of liquid and vibrant markets for the Hut34 Entropy Token (ENTRP) is a criticial factor for success.  Token liquidity will allow future ecosystem participants to rapidly and cost effectively purchase tokens for participation in the services available across the platform and network.  Increased Entropy Token liquidity should minimise transaction costs through (i) reducing any spread when purchasing tokens and (ii) reduce slippage costs associated with excessive token price volatility.  For that goal during 2018 we will be seeking to support or facilitate creation of one or more liquidity pools for the ENTRP token.  We strongly believe in decentralisation, so we do not create markets for the ENTRP token. Our preference will be to support the exciting and rapid developments in the decentralised protocol and exchange space developed by others. Projects such as 0x and Bancor, to name a couple, will all be considered under our 2018 liquidity roadmap.  https://medium.com/the-hut34-project/entropy-token-liquidity-5ac0b8e40ffd",False

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"What if chatbots could talk….to each other?  As the interest in chatbots and virtual assistants continues to grow, natural language conversation will surely continue to overtake browser and apps as the medium of choice in coming years.  Barriers to entry for new bot builders continue to decrease. The pace of bots released grows as bot building platforms and connectors multiply, offering increasingly powerful and easy to use tools. In April 2017 Facebook messenger achieved 100,000 bots on its platform , whilst Microsoft claims 20,000 bot developers on its’ Bot Framework . That’s a lot of bots!  Continued increases in Monthly Active User (MAU) numbers on conversational channels further attest to the importance of conversation as a preferred medium for users, 1.9Bn MAU on Facebook messenger, 320M MAU on twitter, WeChat fast approaching 1Bn MAU, and 1.2Bn MAU on WhatsApp. (Statista.com)  Although A.I. powered bots continue to improve rapidly, they are still in their early days and limitations remain evident. Bots, although quickly becoming commonplace in e-commerce sites, supplementing the browser interface and guiding potential customers, overall are yet to gain significant traction in broader community applications. Why is that? Other than with the major proprietary ‘assistant’ bots most users are still not making contact either primarily, or directly with a bot. Mostly remaining as secondary interface only. Is it because they are not very useful, or perhaps too hard to find?  In the case of the proprietary ‘assistants’, they may appear more powerful than most other bots, however their ‘expertise’ or knowledge remains broad but shallow. How often does Siri end up serving you a Google search? These proprietary assistants will continue to improve, but will always be limited by the resources that their creators either want, or are able, to devote to them. The information they serve by their very nature will be biased towards whatever their corporate owner wants them to provide (or manipulate) you with. Their usefulness is limited by the resources and impartiality of the corporation.  Outside the major corporates, most bot builders domain knowledge is specialised and limited, and their resources scarce. As such it will make sense for them to specialise and develop deep but narrow domain expertise bots. So does the user have to talk to many bots for many answers? Even then, if a developer manages to develop a useful bot, monetization of this service or knowledge remains a problem.  So as the number of bots increase new challenges arise for users, builders and service providers. For users, issues around whether they should, for convenience, just accept the broad, shallow, and maybe biased knowledge provided by the corporate ‘assistant’ bots, or should they spend precious time trying to find and curate multiple domain specific bots to resolve any deep domain queries or requests they may have? As it stands options to easily find and assess bots are limited, and who wants to do this? Why should users be required to maintain multiple conversations and interfaces? That is not a lot of fun (or utility) and it represents significant retention issues for bot developers.  Should the increasing number of bot builders and service providers focus on building broad bots to capture the most users, or remain within their specific domain of expertise? How do they encourage a user to access and remain engaged with their specific bot? Just as importantly, how do they monetise the service they are providing?  What if all bots (IoT devices and any digital services) could talk and exchange their unique information or knowledge directly with each other? What if a user could easily connect to this entire ecosystem through any of the bots (or services) already connected to that network? That is, talk to one bot to reach the intelligence of all bots. What if each bot (or service) creator could choose which bots it (and their users) spoke to, and how all its interactions were routed, ranked, resolved and monetized? What if the information exchanged had a marketplace for all connected bots and services to transact in? What if that marketplace allowed information to be fairly priced and transacted through frictionless, trustless, micro-payments?  We asked these same questions in defining our vision for The Hut34 Project and we invite you to participate. Together we can find the answers to those questions and more.  Join us, and perhaps together we can be one step closer to creating the world’s first superintelligence?  https://chatbotslife.com/what-if-chatbots-could-talk-to-each-other-39ef7e75f4de",False

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"What’s in a name? The Hut34 Project  Have you heard of Enigma machine, Bletchely Park, or Alan Turing? Without the work done at Bletchely Park and by Turing the world we live in may look very different than it does today.  During WW2, German use of Enigma machine encrypted messages had allowed their war machine to destroy countless Allied Naval vessels and aircraft, and gain them the upper hand in the conflict. The team at Bletchley Park, lead by Turing, were tasked with breaking the codes, thought impenetrable, of this machine. Their eventual success in doing this turned the tide of WW2 in favour of the Allies.  This work at Bletchely Park was conducted by teams working in a series of actual huts, numbered 1 to 8 and so forth. Each performing a specific role. Hut 8 was probably the most famous, as this was where Turing and his team conducted their critical work decrypting German Naval messages sent by Enigma.  Other huts played vital roles too. For example, Hut 6 performed a similar role to Hut 8 but it was instead tasked with the decryption of military and air force messages.  But what to do with these messages?  Great computational work was conducted in Huts 6 & 8 but without the appropriate distribution of these deciphered messages, they were of limited value.  This is where the Huts 3 and 4 come into the story. These huts were tasked with the translation, interpretation, and distribution of messages deciphered by the ‘computational’ Huts. The Huts 3 and 4 “routed” messages, providing valuable information to those who needed it most. Messages that no no doubt shaped the world we live in today.  Just as the Huts 3 and 4 distributed data to where it was needed, the Hut34 Project is building a network to provide a unique and useful connection between those who have information and those who wish to use it. Through facilitating the connection of participants, the open exchange of data, and information, smart routing and and ranking the Hut34 network will provide information to those who need or want it.  So the Hut34 Project is our homage to both the “project” that geopolitically shaped the world we live in today, but more importantly to the man; Alan Turing, that in our view, gave us the technological foundation and means to progress on our journey towards a global superintelligence.  “nanos gigantum humeris insidentes”  Turing was a true giant. One of the fathers of modern computing, cryptography and A.I. The Hut34 project is standing on the shoulders of this giant.  The Hut34 Project is building an open global interbot network enabling chatbots, IoT and other digital services and data sets to connect,share and monetise data, information, and knowledge. https://chatbotsmagazine.com/whats-in-a-name-the-hut34-project-447801d557d",False

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"   Hi Adebisi, thanks for your feedback.  Sharpe capital looks like a great project and although they do use the blockchain and AI, they are quite different from us.  As I understand it, they are building a ""low-cost, tech-driven investment fund,  crowd sourcing asset sentiment via the Ethereum blockchain""  effectively they are making investment decisions based on crowd sourced wisdom and paying the crowd, in tokens, for this wisdom.  A very different proposition from Hut34.  We are building a blockchain based network that allows a range of digital services (Bots, Iot devices,AI engines) to connect and communicate with one another, and monetise these inter-device communication transactions. We don’t and won’t be running any investment fund. We are facilitating the growth and development of the data and knowledge economies. ""Data is the new oil"" https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource  I'm sure Sharpe capital (or any other investment fund) would actually benefit from connecting their analysis 'engines' to the Hut34 network. By doing so they would receive access to even more data and information, that they could apply their (AI) models to. Perhaps making even better investment decisions or if they didn’t choose to invest based on their models, they could  likely profit by selling this wisdom/value added analysis back in to the Hut34 network, and possibly earn ENT.  Hope this helps, always available to chat if required.  Tim",False

Keep in mind the project provides the tools to allow network users to (i) connect, (ii) route messages, (ii) resolve queries, and (iv) monetise information transactions. We will not be conducting AI based compute on chain, rather network participants will connect their own compute engines so the can communicate/transact with each other across the Hut34 Network  As state channel technology improves such as Radian , Plasma et al the capacity of the network to handle increased AI, IoT and data transactions will also grow.

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"   So here's a bit more detail on the tech side of the project;  The concept itself is to fairly monetise the exchange of data between actors on the network, who may be chatbots, A.I. instances, or simply people - questions and answers will be routed and ranked across the network, allowing a 'greater than the sum of its parts' network which can help many more people in many more contexts than current monolithic solutions - it'll also be a decentralised solution where value flows to the creators and people adding the value, and isn't hoovered up by you-know-whos (google, apple etc.)  So given all that, what can we say about the blockchain aspects of the project specifically and technically?  We can say that the entire economy is defined by the ERC20 token on the Ethereum network, and that many emerging aspects of that network (Radian, Plasma etc.) give a strong sense of great opportunity. So simply put. yes, every 'signal' - or transaction (as we think about it) - is at the very least a transaction on the ethereum blockchain.  We're also experimenting, with some success, in writing data about each transaction to the ethereum blockchain. Currently, this is simply a call to a smart contract function, where we store a string as an 'event' - just the name of the bot involved, and a key to our centralised database which stores the entire request / response object.  Beyond the transaction piece however, the project really is blockchain agnostic - there are many many significant opportunities to interact with additional blockchains which we're exploring also - think IOTA, NEO, Waves (see their NG updates) and others - our areas of effort include reading / writing metadata to a blockchain, and opportunities such as the encryption and distribution of data, controlled entirely by the end user (think ways to monetise your own behaviour, through a third party (not us) all powered by the Hut34 Network) - as with almost every blockchain project the potential scale is vast!!  We're very much a bleeding edge blockchain tech startup, but we won't be developing our own blockchains, or even blockchain tech really - we'll be using our expertise in the field to 'stand on the shoulders of giants' and build an awesome product in the space, and to make a real difference.  What this wall of words boils down to is that the Hut34 Project will process transactions on the ethereum blockchain, and also utilise other blockchain technology to add value to the project, with this being a key area of effort as part of the build of version 1.0 post ICO - help us make it a reality!",False

Thus creating an immutable record.  1. Assume we have two chatbots exchanging information messages, one named ALICE, and the other named BOB. 2. These bots will be connected to the Hut 34 Network. 3. ALICE and BOB both have ENT token wallets. 4. If ALICE were to send a message that BOB accepts as being useful, then a transaction between these two would be agreed 5. BOB would pay ENT tokens to the wallet of ALICE.  Of course there would need to be safeguards in place to assure that BOB had sufficient ENT balance befor ALICE sent, or confirmed her message.  Bots can be built on any bot building platform. We are an open system. And the Bot builder can deploy these bots to any message channel. Bot builders will connect to the Hut34 Network via API, where they will then be able to share messages and transact in Entropy tokens.  https://i.imgur.com/NkNjKLm.jpg  Hope this helps",False

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"   Info that is readily available on Google has, in our terms, low entropy value - but there may be opportunities for developers to either synthesise readily available information into more valuable data, or otherwise curate it in such a way that it acquires a higher value - it's easier to understand for example, or it's highly reliable, or it speaks to your bicycle's onboard computer directly without fuss - that sort of thing.  Hut34 won't make data any more or less valuable than it already is, to be honest - but what it will do, through the creation of the Hut Network, and a fair and open marketplace for entropy transactions, is allow data providers, and value providers (such as bot developers who curate / synthesise, or otherwise generate) to monetise their efforts - in such a way that the network is 'greater than the sum of its parts' and the value flows fairly across the network....  Another way to think about this is that Hut34 isn't really a consumer offering - it *can* be, of course, but there are many worlds where the first take up comes more firmly from bot developers building bots which are significantly useful, and businesses who wish to consume that data as part of their operations joining the network to access the value - we'll make some announcements in the next couple of days to flesh out some of these models",False

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"   Hey @chocobo21 great question.  A little more on that, there are multiple ways to monetise a data transaction. Google is not free. You are the product, and an advertiser pays for your search. I am very close to posting a couple of medium articles that show a couple of different monetisation models for bot developers. A couple of which mean that the 'user' does not pay. A couple of further things to consider as opportunities 1. Think of a corporate bot who could offer its customers a better experience by drawing on data available on the network. All corporates have a cost of sale, this could fit into that. The opportunity to an independent developer is that the corporate could be paying for your data to provide their customer a better experience. 2. Think of Spotify, you can have a 'free' unpaid experience. You are the product, and you accept being served ads occasionally. The ads pay for your free service.  However if you want a better experience you can pay a monthly subscription - and get rid of the ads. 3. For high Entropy value knowledge you could pay for the data directly between owner and user. 4. There is the opportunity to have a 'google' model and have ad served content.  In all of these models the bot developer chooses themselves how they want to monetise and therefore they will attract a different kind of user. Google is one model, the data producer gets to choose nothing, be part of an ad network or not. User gets only one choice. Be served ads. No wonder there is so much rubbish online!  And finally think of conversational platforms, the incentives structures to create great data are limited. Self gratification of getting an audience. Product placement. That a about it. Incentive for the platform are maintain attention of the user so they can track data and advertise to you somewhere else.  Hut34 will bring back control, data producers and recipients will choose how they participate. The opportunity to collaborate as a community is increased on our own terms.",False

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"   Hey btcminer49er and dave111223 Thanks for your interest. We think it would be shame if people miss out. In short Hut34 Network will act as a marketplace for data. It will allow transaction and interaction between different digital services. It will mean that a small dev with a particular interest can cooperate without friction with other dev's to power up their products meaning that collectively they can genuinely compete with the big end of town. We talk about about conversation platforms a lot because we started the project by connecting bots built on different platforms and conversing on different channels. This means a continuous natural conversation across bots. We have established ethereum wallets and tested writing these transactions to ethereum blockchain. We started to realise that if we created an open network to connect anything via nodes or huts would get really interesting. So we have for example included and tested a simple IoT device into the mix. We have built a platform that we will open up shortly for people to test. However because this is an open system we invite others to build their own platform to add to the network and monetise that. Different dev's will like different platforms and this is fine by us. The network is the goal.  So its not just for bots. But a bot might use what you have to offer. Working on a specific AI? Connect it to the hut and let people use it and monetise on a transactional basis. No need to sell out. Know about programmatic advertising? Start a digital agency that bots can tap into to help them monetise if they so choose. Own a set of IoT Devices, connect them to the hut, and sell the data. Need to know something and want to define your own routing options? Hut34 is a better place to do it.  I hope this helps a little.  Is there something specific you are looking for? Did you want us to include anything of your special interest in our upcoming video? We will do our best to answer. Feel free to PM if you want have an idea you want to float that might work on the network but want to keep it private for now. We want to give you as much information as you need, it is unlike many projects a rich multilayered project so there is no simple one liner about what it is.",False

It is the  network that will allow all bots/bot builders (and other digital service builders) to connect their service and interact with one another. It will facilitate these interactions and llow them to be monetised. Bots that contribute information to the network will get paid for this contribution in our token - ENT, whilst bots that extract information or data, will need to pay for this via ENT.  Bot builders can build there bots in any dev platfrom - once built - they will connect to the network - route unresolved queries to the network - rank network responses - and finally earn ENT from their contribution.

When a particpant contributes data, information or knowledge by resolving queries from other bots, or by feeding in data from their connected IoT device they are paid by the consumers of that data. If you imagine data is like oil, oil producers are paid for the oil they produce - just like data producers - people that take oil (data) and refine it and add value to it are also paid for this- they add value to the data turning it into information. Consumers who use this data or value added information pay these producers for this. There would be no utility in just adding bots or any other digital devices for no reason - if a bot builder however adds many bots, or data sensors that all contribute to the network's information content as a whole they will be rewarded for this.

As a result of all the connected particpants, we will have a global open network of semi intelligence, sharing data and information - free from corporate constraints and controls.  Imagine 1000s+ chatbots all with different information sets all connected, talking and transacting with each other.  Network particpants will connect to the network via an individual node and information transactions will be agreed to between a querying and a responding service. The result of this will be a transfer of an agreed amount of the ENT token to the responding service/bot from the querying service/bot. ENT is an ERC20 token, so transactions will be written to the ethereum blockchain. Hope this helps",False

Re. the meetings, the team have some deep connections to possible partners, and interest in the project is building nicely in the non crypto-world. We're investing significant time in helping more traditional finance and tech people understand the token sale mechanics and potential, and expect to be able to make announcements in regard to cornerstone and early-bird participation prior to the sale. Obvs. on that front we're offering some significant bonuses for larger investors, and discussions are a long way down the track - ping us if you'd like more info or to hop on!

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"   Hi Poptok1 Hut34 will allow programmatic advertising into the network to allow multiple funding monetisation options for bot developers. It is an entirely new channel for advertisers that they will be keen to get onto. We are not aware of any conversational platform that has enabled advertising well. However the difference that we have to the likes of Google is that advertising will be by the choice of developer. It will be up to the bot or service developer to decide if they wish to route and include advertising into their conversation. Or would they prefer a user pays, subscription or brand sponsored model?  (Or something else that we have not yet thought of). Importantly the use of advertising will not be decided or controlled by Hut34. It will be defined by the bot developers and digital service providers. Furthermore there is a significant opportunity for someone to create auction advertising nodes or huts that developers can opt-in to use, this could be a very significant business in its own right. Our approach is to enable bot developers, IoT device owners, A.I. Engines and digital service providers the control to choose how they monetise. Advertising is one of many options, that is up to them.",False

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"  Thanks @aalmina82, Bloomberg just reported Jack Ma (owner of Alibaba and 13th richest person in the world) saying exactly this, that data will be more precious than oil. He went on to say that someone just has to work out how to monetise it. We believe we have, but we want to share the rewards with the data owners and creators by creating a frictionless marketplace that is as simple as having a conversation - Not control it and make more centralised wealth.

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"   Both and more. Bot's are one use case. They have 3 components typically today, database, AI engine (NLP) and program. On Hut34 they can power up more by connecting to and transacting with other bots, IoT devices, and other specialist AI's, or even data sets. That is up to how clever the bot developer is, the benefit to developers is their bot can get much smarter than what is possible today with siloed platforms. We see a future in conversational channels which is why we talk bots so much. But the network is by no means restricted to them. No reason a browser or app can't be the interface. We would also allow bespoke services so something like Sensay which enables human interactions could also be a node/hut on the network, or someone could create their own version.  The benefit we hope you will see of using bots as a tool to share your intelligence is scaleability - have a million conversations at once over just one. I hope that you are starting to see the potential scale, depth and variety of opportunity for dev's to monetise on Hut34.",False

Where A.I. does business - Starts Nov 2,"  We like your opinion @ekurtovic! Best place to look at the sale is https://hut34.io/entropySale The sale will have 28 days with 10% bonus, this is followed by market pricing mechanism (reverse auction) which starts high and drops till available tokens sold or time runs out. Everyone will then pay the lowest price that the auction determines. Basically you commit how much ETH you will put in, and collectively market decides how much ENT you will get back, not us. This is best mechanism practice and proposed by VB and used in all good sales. We have had some super smart dudes at SigmaPrime build the sale and the audit starts next week with another super smart dude who we will announce.  So in short we can't say what price will settle at, because we just don't know. The good news is the conversation is building. What we need is continued awareness of the project so that people see the opportunity. Please shout out to your own community and point them to us, we think the once people (we are targeting dev's) understand the scale and potential of the opportunity they can't help but jump on board!",False
