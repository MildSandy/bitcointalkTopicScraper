As a private jet charter customer today, you will have to pay a large recurring subscription fee, as well as retainer membership fees in order to have access to the Uber of Jets. Flying on a private jet may seem like a luxury, but if you’re already paying a large sum for the cost of the service, why are you then having to pay so much more on top of that for the service?  The way that the general aviation industry is currently structured exploits the customer wanting to use the service in exchange for convenience and service, rather than reward.  This isn’t only seen in the private jet charter industry, but also across the luxury lifestyle sector. Other than individual companies offering loyalty to their services, you as a customer really don’t get the benefit of your service.  On top of this, as any loyalty program works currently, you are very limited as to how you can redeem these points and their value is completely dependent on how the program or company in question decides. This means you are partially rewarded for your loyalty, but how you can then actually use that, is decided by someone else.  VolAir is bringing private jet charters & luxury lifestyle to the people. VolAir is gearing up to provide easy access, through our upcoming app, to offer everyone the best possible private jet rates & accompanying lifestyle. Along with accessibility, you will be able to get loyalty bonuses with your VOL wallet and exclusive benefits from our partners. We are striving to bring the private jet luxury lifestyle, previously only dreamt of, to you. While others are obsessing on moon lambos, we want to bring you closer to the moon, in luxury.  Quick FAQs  How many versions of the application are there? The VolAir roadmap has 2 distinct versions of the application. The first allows partners to get their jets into the application, search and find them. This will also give them the ability to store their VOL tokens on the application in their wallet. When a user wants to book a flight, it sends them to our third-party partner and on confirmation of booking, using an internal process, the customer and vendor are issued VOL tokens.  The second version incorporates all the aforementioned features; including the wallet and searching for flights, additionally, users will be able to benefit from the tiers available, while the partners will be able to utilize the partner gateway and payment system. Where are the key locations? We are currently on-boarding partners and establishing key locations around the globe, where VolAir will have a dominant presence. Currently this consists of; Switzerland, Singapore, North America and Dubai.  How will the VOL tokens be used? The token will be the sole means of payment on the network. Customers will use the token for services within the application; staking for higher tiered rewards. Eventually they will use them to purchase across other private jets & luxury partners as well as rewards given for customer loyalty.   Market Problems/VolAir Solution  Market Problems Membership fees raising while luxuries diminishing. Unexpected fees or changes in terms; when private suddenly becomes public. Matching empty legs with with consumer demand.   VolAir Solutions  We will never require and up-front fee, rather we will reward people for flying more. We do not want this to be a service you buy into but rather one which rewards your loyalty. We will reward people for their purchases not change the circumstances. We want to bring private jet charter & luxury lifestyle to a larger pool of people. We want to meet the demand of the people, and in-turn reduce the amount spent on maintenance, jet fuel, and crew; with full flights.  Three-Part Approach  VolAir is entering the market with a token, technology, platform, wallet and vision to bring private jet charter and a luxury lifestyle access to more people with complete transparency, efficiency and decentralization. We seek to educate, connect, communicate and cater to a large audience excited about the VOL token/wallet, technology and VolAir.   1. Technology Two version of the application. The first version allows our aviation partners the ability to list, search and find their jets. Additionally, this version will allow people the opportunity to store their VOL tokens on the application in their personal wallet. Essentially, a user who wishes to charter a jet will book the flight, it will send them to our third-party partner and on the confirmation of the booking using a smart contract, the customer and vender are issued their VOL tokens. Click HERE to View Second version incorporates the aforementioned features, along with the tiered model which will provide customers with more benefits the higher they climb through the tiers. The ascension between the tiered cannot be purchased but is granted the more services someone uses. Click HERE to View  2. . Luxury partners We are currently on-boarding global partners, as well as establishing key locations around where VolAir’s presence is needed. As of now the list consists of: Switzerland Singapore North America Dubai  3. Rewards As a customer climbs through the tiers they are issued VOL tokens, which can be exchanged for fiat, flights or staked in their integrated VOL wallet to achieve higher tier and receive further benefits.

They had time pulling in ARR subs, which dried up and they hadn't catered for different geographical markets. For example, the middle east is a huge market for private jets, but JetSmarter's model failed there and they closed operations! It's a huge potential market for us and we have people ready to grow it. If you look at JetSmarter, they are also a middle / app layer - They work with brokers just like we do to confirm/ fulfil their flights and have other companies that do the ""VIP"" service part. This is no different from everything we have in place now.  JetSmarter has 2 brokers, and we have the same number of planes as they have access to.  On top of that, JetSmarter have just been trialing ""no fee month"" where you can use jetsmarter without the upfront fees. So they know the model is broken... yet with VolAir we have completely flipped that model and give back to the user rewarding their loyalty! Why shouldn't they get something back too?  So we've done a lot of the ground work to make this work as a business. We have people ready to commit in nearly all our chosen locations to help us grow as a business in those places.  We've been working solidly on the technology side to ensure that we can offer the best services to our customers and our partners, maximising technology to leverage the empty legs of private jet flights and bringing them to our users, too.  Like I said, what you can't see in all of this is the work and research gone into understanding our competition in the market, where the real life gaps are and how we can use technology to give back to our users.  Any questions on it though, I'd be happy to answer!",False

We have secured partners with over 12,500 planes with all of our contracts in place. We have people in our key locations already committed to helping us grow the business in those places. We are actively securing more partnerships with various luxury products and services.  On the technology side, with regards to the iOS App Prototype, the development team has signed off on the v1 iOS private jet booking app and have the initial prototype ready! Regarding our Smart Contracts, they are online and have been deployed to our testnet, we’ll be finalizing the last of the contracts while completing the auditing of all contracts before the scheduled mainnet launch before the end of the month.  Thank you for your positive feedback and support! We will be announcing the bounty soon and would love for you to be apart of it.",False

Not only does VolAir help tap into that market, but also aims to make it more accessible. We can do this by using technology to minimise wasted flights that are empty, and utilising the seats available. You can already fly from London to Geneva, occupying just one seat for 500 GBP, which isn't far off a business class commercial flight cost. With the fact you can redeem VOL directly against the flight costs means possibility to drastically reduce costs. Our main aim is to make this more accessible. After that comes things you'd expect, such as hotels, car rentals etc. through our partners, too. Yes, aimed more high end, but equally to make this available to the businessmen/women, who currently can't utilise this market due to price points.",False

They offer a few services; the part ownership model, where you can either buy hours in chunks or part ""own"" a jet, which means they have a fleet of the same jets so people get the same type each time. They also have a service to manage other people's jets, with the option of helping them get a return on them by leasing them out to others for trips as well.  So, a very different model whereby they own their own fleet and management of other people's jets is a big thing. This means they have fewer of their own fleet, due to the model being so different.  We work with a couple of brokers, who themselves don't own any jets, but they're the link to all the smaller owners of jets directly. I'll be publishing who they all are soon, it's not a secret, but need to get it on our site etc. they're essentially the link for us to many many owners around the world.  One thing they do very well is having these relationships with all of these people, but market growth and penetration for them is still quite old fashioned. That's why it works well for us, as we can bring them more exposure and business, that they benefit from, as do we. So it's a win win.",False
