More importantly Kwhcoin team is developing a model to compensate the value of distributed energy resources at the edges of the grid transitioning to an advanced energy network that can be accessed by all with no barriers to inclusion.  The energy sector is in its most significant transition since the inception of the electricity grid. The United States is served by an extraordinarily complex and effective electric system with fossil fuel generation of electricity at strategically positioned centralized plants serving as the core reactor. The three major parts of the system — generation, transmission, and distribution — work together to bring reliable and affordable electricity to virtually everyone in America, thus providing a service that is essential to the nation’s security, economic development and social connectivity. However this is very expensive and carbon intensive at all generation and distribution points and virtually removes all of us from access to the value chain. There are many estimates but McKinsey’s values the current (depreciated) value of the U.S. electric grid, comprising power plants, wires, transformers and poles, is roughly US $1.5 to $2 trillion and the replacement costs would EXCEED $5 TRILLION dollars. The environmental impacts of such a large investment in fossil fuel energy sources are beginning to reflect in natural environment and geopolitical turmoil.  https://coinidol.com/kwhcoin-cryptocurrency-as-liberation-technology/",False
