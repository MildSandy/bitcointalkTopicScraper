AI is becoming a force to be reckoned with in the drone industry.  Once a mission is set up in a flight app to capture all relevant areas, the operator can merely press a button and the drone will fly the mission. Many companies are making progress toward having AI pick out common features such as control points. As more data becomes available, technology will rapidly improve, providing significant benefits for many industries.  Improved Efficiency, New Insights and New Revenue Sources are some of the key areas which can be seen with adoption and learning of AI. UAVs and AI will not be replacing human employees; rather, they’ll simply allow humans to take on more challenging tasks that can’t be performed by machine.  https://medium.com/deepaerodrones/what-ai-is-bringing-to-the-commercial-drone-industry-18cbf59fb43  More About DeepAero in Telegram Announcements: https://t.me/deepaerodrones More About DeepAero in Telegram ICO Channel: https://t.me/DEEPAEROICO",False

Earlier the rules included, drones weighing more than 250 gms, would operate 9 km away from airports, no more than 90-meter altitude, no more than 500 meters from the operator and should remain within the sight.  Now, new Transport Canada rules are being proposed that includes dividing drones into weight classes and permits and liability insurance for heavier drones. The drones would be marked with owner names and contact information. The distance from the airport would be reduced to 5.5km and it’s not to be operated in city parks. With the changes in the regulations, more drone courses could also be seen.  https://medium.com/deepaerodrones/new-drone-rules-coming-for-canada-1bea1ec0026c",False

But expect a bit of heart breaks here and there as Drones does not generally run on batteries alone.  As of the present there are 6 ways of flying a drone and the fastest among the 6 (and the most dangerous too) is the one powered by a combustion engine.  Combustion engine powered drones are able to stay in flight for about an hour with a maximum speed of 100 km/h sporting a 2-stroke 10 cc.   gasoline engine.  Not the most environmental friendly means of keeping a drone airborne, but it does increase speed and distance covered.

Drones are not commonplace today but are set to change the way we travel, deliver items and grow food.  DEEP AERO is preparing for the near future where drones will need their own air management systems to avoid collisions, where the purchases of drones will be made regularly and where drone services will be needed for consumer transport.  When the number of drones increases, the main problem that arises is how to provide safety and ensure they don’t crash into each other. Drones need a special traffic management system, a similar to the one currently used for planes, which will connect them on a global scale. However, there is no system to control unmanned air traffic today. Existing systems don’t have enough capabilities to handle drones-related operations and manage their growing traffic density.  DRONE-UTM is a new decentralized traffic management platform that will be able to monitor flights of manned and unmanned aircrafts in the shared airspace. Based on the blockchain technology, the system will gather information about drones’ locations, thus avoiding their clashes.  “The use of unmanned aerial vehicles is increasing exponentially,” says Mr. Gurmeet Singh, the CEO of DEEP AERO. “We are researching prototype technologies such as airspace design, dynamic geofencing, congestion management, terrain avoidance, route planning, re-routing, separation management, sequencing and spacing, and contingency management for a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system that will develop airspace integration requirements for enabling safe, efficient low-altitude operations of drones.  He continued: “DEEP UTM includes things like universal drone registration standards, open identification systems, tamper-proof flight data recorders, accurate and trustworthy 3D mapping data, dynamic weather information, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication.”  The platform will enable safe, low altitude operations of drones and will have universal standards for registration and identification. This will allow for large numbers of drones to work together while adhering to rules and regulations. The platform includes eight aspects such as the flight planner system, the registration system for drones and a geo-fencing system to stop drones from accessing prohibited places.  At the moment, there do not appear to be many competitors to DEEP AREO. One of them is Distributed Sky, an Ethereum-based air traffic control system that has already been running for two years. It will be interesting to see if the competitors work on separate systems and use atomic swaps to share data or if one of them becomes the accepted technology.  DEEP AREO is led by Gurmeet Singh Anand, who has been the President of Anand International, a company with over 1,000 employees on LinkedIn, for 22 years. The project’s CFO, Mayank Jain, also has extensive experience in running his own business and has created an auditing firm, called MITR Netcom. Besides, the project includes a team of strong advisors, such as an AI and machine learning expert Kiran K. Garimella and Sydney Ifergan, the owner of The Currency Analytics and a general ICO expert.  Quote What is the DEEP AERO’s DRONE-MP Marketplace? The DEEP AERO’s DRONE-MP marketplace provides a way for users to purchase drones and services for drones using the platform’s native DRONE tokens. The marketplace will operate in a similar way to current e-commerce sites, while the use of the cryptocurrency allows people across the world to pay each other without exchanging their currencies from one to another.  The other main aspect of the platform is the operation of drone services. The marketplace will allow users to book drone flights instead of using conventional transport, what is likely to reshape the way we travel today.  Quote What are the Main Real-World Applications? One of the biggest applications is cargo drones. They deliver goods straight to people’s homes, bypassing conventional transport and corresponding limitations. Amazon is one of the main proponents of cargo drones and has already trialed them in the US and UK. When their use become more common, it is likely that the savings in transport costs will lead to a wider adoption. Other applications include using drones for applying pesticides or pollinating plants in agricultural situations.  Quote The DEEP AERO’s ICO Details After finishing the pre-sale on April 15, the project has launched the first phase of its ICO (May 1 – 15). Investors can already participate in the campaign, leveraging the bonuses of up to 35%. In total, there will be 2.5 billion tokens issued, which is a half of the total supply. All tokens not sold during the ICO will be burned, reducing the total supply.  According to the startup, 25% of their funds will be allocated to marketing and promotion. The project has already attracted a strong interest, with its telegram group now accounting for more than 16,000 members.  Quote The DEEP AERO Drone Contest In a move to attract more attention, DEEP AERO is offering over 300 rewards to ICO contributors who put in more than one Ether (ETH). The prize is a passenger drone worth $450,000, as well as hundreds of DJI PHANTOM 4 PRO drones worth $1,500 each. The competition will continue if the ICO is fully funded.",False

They also save data on how to improve one are who will be considered as ""bottleneck"" of the traffic.   2. No sense in using drones over CCTV cameras?

But Ehang Corp, a major Chinese drone maker, has been busy testing its Ehang 184 flying taxis, a drone designed to transport people. It's now completed more 1,000 test flights with and without passengers, as CNN reports.  Ehang burst onto the international scene at CES in Las Vegas in 2016, promising a dream of personal robotic transportation by drone. Now it looks like it's made good on its promise, with more tests to follow in Dubai and Las Vegas. Importantly, the 1,000-plus flights have involved a broad range of conditions, including traveling in inclement conditions.  With eight electrically-powered rotors, the Ehang 184 can fly for 10 miles at speeds of up to 80 mph or more—a handy way to hypothetically beat the traffic to airports in places like New York, Las Vegas, and Shanghai. One hang-up: it's meant for just one passenger, though it's been stress-tested with a payload of 500 pounds. Another hang-up: it can only carry people and cargo for 23 minutes.  The key to the Ehang 184's operations is its automated flight system; its flight computer pulls data from onboard sensors and uses satellite navigation to chart the safest path. If damaged, it's designed to make a controlled descent to safe ground.  The Ehang 184 is one of several serious passenger drone companies looking to take to the skies—Airbus is another contender. While automated passenger drones would make urban commuting easier (at least initially for anyone who can afford to ride—travel like this tends to be pricey), the flight performance and AI behind them could revolutionize retail logistics. Chinese retailer JD, for instance, is experimenting with payload delivery drones that can lift up to one ton. And drones like this also have military potential for uses in situations like carrying supplies, evacuating personnel, and transporting special forces.  Ehang's CEO, Hu Huazhi, says these passenger drones will first focus on carrying wealthy customers to establish a customer base (making it much like Elon Musk's strategy for Tesla). Then, ideally, economies of scale would democratize passenger drones, so everyone else can take to the sky. That, at least, is the futuristic vision.

Below is an article that claims that they have created a Hack-Proof Drone by HACMS.  Quote The Hack-Proof Drone More than a year ago, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) announced that their researchers were working on a project codenamed HACMS (High Assurance Cyber Military Systems) for the design of a software that is able to thwart cyber attacks once deployed in any context, like a defense system or an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.  The secret project has been underway for several years, according to Kathleen Fischer, HACMS program manager for DARPA. The project originated at the University of California, San Diego and the University of Washington, and has made possible the definition of a new generation of drones equipped with secure software developed with principles of the HACMS program. The drones used a software that prevents cyber attacks, in particular any interference with the control and navigation systems of the vehicle from hackers.  “The software is designed to make sure a hacker cannot take over control of a UAS. The software is mathematically proven to be invulnerable to large classes of attack,” explained Kathleen Fisher.

Where will be there first store located? Country? If you go to their website you can see an address below Ajman Free Zone, UAE. I presume this is their main office of operation and where we can expect the first store to be.  2. What is the price range they will sell the drones? Depending on the type of drones they will sell. For example they have a raffle for those who will contribute or invest at least 1ETH with Deep Aero, the prize is a passenger Drone worth $450,000 USD and a Phantom 4 Pro worht $1,500 USD. I believe that price of drones they are selling will be similar to this converted to crypto currency.  3. Do we need to have licence to use Deep Aero Drones? We expect Deep Aero to be AI driven, but in case of manual piloting of drones this will vary on the country on which you are in and regulations or laws that your country has. In my country, drones like phantom 4 pro or those that are used in wedding videos need not have a license to fly this type of drones. For Passenger Drones, I do believe this will require a license to fly.  4. Deep Aero market will be open globally.

Quote When the trained rats find a landmine, they stop and scratch at the TNT-scented spot, which the human de-miners mark and come back later to excavate. If they find a mine, they detonate it on site.  According to the article, they are just landmine-sniffing rats. They don't detonate landmines.

I will answer your questions respectively.  1. using rats to find mines are being done for a long time. but putting this on a drone? how can they detect it?  Drones can detect the landmines by using GPR (Global Penetrating Radar). GPR uses high-frequency (usually polarized) radio waves to detect the landmine.  2. drones are flying in sky, should they have metal detector? they will just detect itself.  Metal Detector can also be used to detect landmines. Drones are made up of mostly plastic material and the metal detector have what we call as Electromagnetic Field Detection Pattern which detects only those covered by that detection pattern so it will not just detect itself.   3. how a drone can detonate it?  A drone can have a built-in robotic arm that can put a small detonator to the detected landmine then the drone will move to safety before detonating the landmine.  I have found videos that will surely show how it works.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkbfEoMOZdo  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw_YCFDurZA",False

I will not say that drone will 100% detonate a bomb or a landmine but the fact that no human is at stake while detonating a landmine, that is a great assurance that no one will be hurt.",False

DEEP AERO’s public Pre-Sale is scheduled between 30 March 2018 and 15 April 2018. By integrating the Bancor Protocol, DRONE token holders will gain access to continuous liquidity regardless of trade volume or exchange listings, through the Bancor Network, where any integrated token can be automatically converted to any other directly from the Bancor Wallet or any Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask. Currently integrated tokens include ETH, BNT (the Bancor Network Token), GNO (Gnosis), BNB (Binance) and many more projects that will be activated soon.  “We have a huge community and anticipate massive demand for the DRONE tokens, so it absolutely makes sense for us to provide our users with an easy way to convert DRONE tokens as soon as the ICO is finished,” said Gurmeet Singh, CEO of DEEP AERO. “Integrating with Bancor will provide liquidity to everyone who wants to be a part of the drone economy as we build our platform and revolutionize the drone industry.”  DEEP AERO will activate a Relay Token with 2% of its circulating token supply within a week following the successful completion of the Token Sale. Users will be able to purchase and sell DRONE tokens directly from the Bancor Wallet or any Web3 wallet at a formulaically calculated price.  About DEEP AERO  As the world economy heads towards large-scale adoption of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)/drones for commercial purposes, the drone industry is grappling with huge challenges. One of the biggest challenge that the drone industry is facing at present is that there is no autonomous system to manage high volume unmanned drone traffic.  DEEP AERO, a global leader in drone technology innovation, is building an AI-driven, autonomous, self-governing, intelligent drone/unmanned aircraft system (UAS) traffic management (UTM) platform on the Blockchain. It is designed to enable safe low-altitude civilian flights of manned and unmanned aircraft in the shared airspace.  “The use of unmanned aerial vehicles is increasing exponentially,” says Mr. Gurmeet Singh, CEO of DEEP AERO. “We’re heading towards a future in which millions of drones will fly billions of flights. At some point in the not-too-distant future, fleets of commercial drones are expected to swarm across the skies.Current airspace management and air traffic flow management systems don’t have the capabilities to handle the type of operations relevant to drones. In addition, the anticipated traffic density of drones is far beyond the capabilities of current air traffic management systems. At DEEP AERO, we are currently researching prototype technologies such as airspace design, dynamic geo-fencing, congestion management, terrain avoidance, route planning, re-routing, separation management, sequencing and spacing, and contingency management.”  DEEP AERO’s DRONE-UTM includes universal drone registration standards, secure identification systems, tamper-proof flight data recorders, accurate and trustworthy 3D mapping data, dynamic weather information, and secure vehicle-to-vehicle communication.  DEEP AERO’s DRONE-MP, a decentralized marketplace will be one stop shop for all products and services for drones. This platform will be the foundation of the drone economy and will be powered by the DEEP AERO (DRONE) token.  DEEP AERO (DRONE) Token ICO has started on 1 May 2018.  For more information, please visit https://www.deepaero.com/ico  About Bancor  The Bancor Protocol is a standard for the creation of Smart Tokens™, cryptocurrencies with built-in convertibility directly through their smart contracts. Bancor utilizes an innovative token “connector” method to enable formulaic price calculation and continuous liquidity for all integrated tokens, without needing to match two parties in an exchange.

Robotics is already being implemented in strawberry harvesting, fresh-fruit picking, data mapping and seeding. The autonomous tractors might also capture a commonplace. Recently, an interactive presentation at Colorado State University, shared the overview of future of farming by the presenters Raj Khosla and Tom McKinnon.  Khosla discussed the 5 R’s of precision agriculture: “at the right time, in the right amount, at the right place, use of the right input, in the right manner.” These are the keys to the technique.  On the other hand, McKinnon explained the uses of drones in the application of water, pesticides, fungicides, herbicides and fertilizers. Drones deployed in agriculture offers farming the similar technological advantages to those that most people hold in their hands and use throughout the day.  https://medium.com/@deepaerodrones/use-of-drones-robotics-in-agriculture-1d4be0b7467e",False

DEEP AERO is all about building a harmonized framework for Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Drone/UAS Traffic Management (UTM). If we have that low-altitude shared airspace, our drones may be considered as unapproved and unverified drone if we don't register them and fly anywhere we want. This may cause accidents and collisions because we are not covered with their rules and regulations.  Quote Quote from: DEEPAERO on May 01, 2018, 09:05:54 AM  Any kind of technology can be used for destructive purposes. One of the best features of DRONE-UTM is that regulators will be able to screen unapproved/unverified drones and filter them out and take appropriate action against them.  They also have DRONE Marketplace where we can buy from official and registered sellers. If our drones are not as sophisticated as their drone model.

By integrating the Bancor Protocol, DRONE token holders will gain access to continuous liquidity regardless of trade volume or exchange listings, through the Bancor Network, where any integrated token can be automatically converted to any other directly from the Bancor Wallet or any Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask. Currently integrated tokens include ETH, BNT (the Bancor Network Token), GNO (Gnosis), BNB (Binance) and many more projects that will be activated soon. “We have a huge community and anticipate massive demand for the DRONE tokens, so it absolutely makes sense for us to provide our users with an easy way to convert DRONE tokens as soon as the ICO is finished,” said Gurmeet Singh, CEO of DEEP AERO. “Integrating with Bancor will provide liquidity to everyone who wants to be a part of the drone economy as we build our platform and revolutionize the drone industry.” DEEP AERO will activate a Relay Token with 2% of its circulating token supply within a week following the successful completion of the Token Sale. Users will be able to purchase and sell DRONE tokens directly from the Bancor Wallet or any Web3 wallet at a formulaically calculated price.  About DEEP AERO As the world economy heads towards large-scale adoption of Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS)/drones for commercial purposes, the drone industry is grappling with huge challenges. One of the biggest challenge that the drone industry is facing at present is that there is no autonomous system to manage high volume unmanned drone traffic. DEEP AERO, a global leader in drone technology innovation, is building an AI-driven, autonomous, self-governing, intelligent drone/unmanned aircraft system (UAS) traffic management (UTM) platform on the Blockchain. It is designed to enable safe low-altitude civilian flights of manned and unmanned aircraft in the shared airspace.  About Bancor The Bancor Protocol is a standard for the creation of Smart Tokens™, cryptocurrencies with built-in convertibility directly through their smart contracts. Bancor utilizes an innovative token “connector” method to enable formulaic price calculation and continuous liquidity for all integrated tokens, without needing to match two parties in an exchange. Smart Tokens interconnect to form token liquidity networks, allowing user-generated cryptocurrencies to thrive. To convert tokens instantly, visit the Bancor Web App or join the Bancor Telegram group for more information.  https://medium.com/@deepaerodrones/deep-aero-will-integrate-bancor-protocol-to-provide-token-liquidity-for-its-drone-tokens-6230fc412224",False

It is my point exactly. Cargo drones with max weight of 3 Kg will definitely have shorter flight time than those of existing commercial drones right now (with DJI Inspire 2 Pro taking the lead at max 27 minutes flight time and 7 km distance covered, that is with normal weather condition as flight time and distance decreases with stronger wind gusts).  And pardon my intrusion on set priorities, but flight time is of an essence as much as privacy, safety, autonomous functions and so on. I know that technology has been evolving at a very rapid pace yet it would be nice to know Deep Aero focusing on this matter as the flight time will give you a very good edge against competitors.  Moreover, guaranteed longer flight time is essential to flying your commercial drones much more safely, i think you will agree.",False

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) demands drones to stay within operator’s vision. Naturally, this makes it difficult to establish an autonomous aerial delivery system. Luckily for Japanese companies, this regulation seems to come on a swift end.  According to The Japan Times, Japan’s transport and industry ministers announced new rules that would be implemented by the end of 2018. BVLOS drone missions would be permitted and as far as the safety is concerned, it can be guaranteed remotely via cameras and sensors.  Additionally, this new set of rules would open up easier transportation of goods and materials to remote, rural and mountainous areas.  https://medium.com/@deepaerodrones/japan-to-scrap-vlos-regulations-by-end-of-2018-c07a546b00b4",False
