Most people familiar with the project are extremely excited about its potential. Its Telegram community recently crossed 27,000 members. Investors looking for a powerful business concept in ICO form have a lot to be enthusiastic about when it comes to Elementh. This isnât just some company cashing in on the crypto craze; it has spent years developing its database and product and is now ready to flex its muscles. Risks     The Elementh team is rock solid, but we have to take away one point for the lack of blockchain expertise at the top or in the advisory group. We are only removing one point because the team is transferring its business model (where it is a domain expert) to the blockchain. In other words, Elementh is not just a crypto startup company beginning from scratch. -1     Elementh isnât the only blockchain project focused on e-commerce. There are several competing projects that offer e-commerce platforms on a global scale or to targeted niche markets. The company has identified several of these potential competitors, including VeChain, INS and Connectius. Other e-commerce ICOs include Omnitude, Teky and BitBoost. The project faces competitive risks from outside the blockchain industry as well. For example, e-commerce giant Amazon is already investing in blockchain through its partner ecosystem. Suffice it to say, Amazon has a huge competitive advantage in this space. -3     Although the whitepaper has identified a roadmap, the content lacks financials and provides only a high level overview of the companyâs income-generating activities. At present, we are looking at a fairly lengthy technology development life cycle through March 2019, when the master nodes will be implemented. -2 Growth Potential     The e-commerce market has been thriving for more than two decades. While traditionally focused on business-to-consumer transactions, the business-to-business segment has grown significantly. Combined, B2B and B2C business is a $10 trillion market. Given that the vast majority of buyers perform some form of online research before purchase, Elementh can fill an important function by providing greater transparency and more efficiency in searching and comparing products. As the company states in the whitepaper, the entire e-commerce industry is potentially its target market. This means huge opportunities for growth. +4     Unlike other ICOs, this project has moved far beyond the concept phase and is now in product development and testing. Case in point: Elementh has already released its MVP, which includes a database with over 1 million goods. +5     Elementh is a great example of a project using blockchain to solve real-world problems. The backstory behind Miiix and how it led to the current project strengthens the value proposition even more. We should also point out that each co-founder had a hand in building Miiix, so there are strong synergies at the top, as well as a shared understanding of the challenges facing e-commerce. +2     The technology behind Elementh allows for a unified e-commerce platform that provides financial applications as well as consumer/buyer protections such as identifying counterfeit goods. The platform is literally being built to provide end-to-end e-commerce services; everything from decentralized market places to geo-location services and up to bank storing. +2 Disposition When it comes to e-commerce projects, Elementh is near the top of the list in terms of product development, use cases and team dynamics. That being said, it is entering into a highly competitive environment filled with established e-commerce businesses and burgeoning startups. Against this backdrop, weâve assigned a final score of 7 out of 10.  Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-elementh/",False

But not so many people get involved in the technology backing these concepts. In the meantime, the blockchain technology opens fantastic possibilities for fundamental changes in entire markets, industries, organizational and legal structures, etc. Now very many projects coming up to an ICO are trying by any means to fasten the blockchain technology to their products as it increases contributions. The problem is that many of them try to think according to old paradigms. But all repeat over and over again: we must work on projects which can not be implemented without blockchain. It always seems strange to me, as bitcoin itself can be actually done without blockchain. It is a different story that blockchain significantly increases trust of all the system participants and sometimes this trust is crucial for the project existence.  Thatâs how it goes in the e-commerce market. Imagine that you have a set of market players: brands, manufacturers, suppliers, retailers and end customers. Also there are service providers, for example, logisticians or developers. They all interact quite intensely. The main thing is that they shall exchange information on goods, amount, prices and sales themselves with each other. At that, there are such players as Amazon. It would seem that they have all necessary information and, in their own database, information on sales via their trading venue. But what shall happen so that, for example, Alibaba had decided to sell goods via Amazon without usage of their own venue? Itâs hard to imagine since they are global competitors and a part of information they have is exclusive. Exactly such information exclusiveness and restricting hinder development of the whole e-commerce market.  In 2012 we created project Miiix, and our goal was to facilitate operation of the e-commerce market, create a product classification standard, preserve the full stock inventory of all the market participants and all price lists for goods in one place. We have been collecting information for 6 years, and all the time we felt the harshest resistance of the market. And only in the end of 2017 we understood why. All the market players resist and donât want to give their data to an unaffiliated company which further makes money off of that. The bigger such company becomes, the less it will be loved. And then the blockchain technology comes to the rescue. Imagine that instead of an unaffiliated company, the technology becomes the basis of the market. The technology that belongs to the entire market: to every of its participant. Imagine that the market players, by starting supporting the technology, instantly gain competitive advantages over those who donât work with the system. How is that possible?  Imagine that the product classification standard is unified, i.e. every market participant can easily use it and obtain data on any product in the world, in any language with all data on the product. In this case, for example, if a supplier has purchased goods and wants to sell them at the regional level, it can immediately spread the information on availability of the goods in its warehouse among all required retailers. The supplier in its own discretion chooses who will be provided with data on full depth of the stock, who will see just availability/absence, and for whom access to the information will be actually denied. And all this information is stored being decentralized and encrypted, by all participants of the market. Those who are most concerned in possession and availability of the information, are engaged with support of the infrastructure. Thereby, there is no conflict of interests. All participants of the market are willing to increase amount of information in the system. At that, they are all owners of the information at a time. In addition to that, availability of the data can be differentiated.  Actually, it is the essence of project Elementh. If you are a participant of the e-commerce market or keen follower of the idea, so as we, join us!",False

Forum, roadshow, a quick tour of the city's sights a few after-parties on the roofs of local skyscrapers.... Everything merges into one quick short-term adventure, as if I flew here only yesterday.     Going to this trip, I did not know what to expect, because it was my first experience visiting the International Blockchain Conference. The first evening on arrival in the city, I was on the roof of the Fullerton Bay Hotel in the beautiful Lantern bar. There my first networking began. A funny guy named Hugo, who perfectly understands Russian, having lived in Russia for 4 years, told his vision of the ICO market and how he as an advisor signs any government in any countries.  Evening beer and this networking were very useful, I felt asleep easily, despite the different time zone, and in the morning at the conference through Hugo I managed to communicate with new people. Interesting, that the Blockchain Economic Forum conference, organized by the Russian LAToken project, attracted many Russians to Singapore and almost half of the conference was Russian-speaking, and it was not only ICO projects The first day was full of business cards . Afterparty for VIP tickets on the 71st floor of the skyscraper was the best event of the day. Main networking was there.     As a result of the day, we went to dinner to local food court. Strange, cheap and very tasty food.  The second day at the conference was hard, the reports were still boring, networking was much tighter, even the afterparty on the roof of Singapore's tallest skyscraper was not so good at all. That was a very lazy networking. I decided to leave early.  As a result, it turned into a dinner with an interesting person who can do advertising in FB, even when FB is against ICO advertising. And as an old resident of the city, he also showed excellent places for dinner in Singapore.  The third day of the conference started perfectly, it was a day dedicated to ICO, as a result - many useful contacts and potential partnerships. In the evening, having escaped from the conference, we drove off to a meeting with Ian Balina. He is a very powerful opinion leader in the ICO market. I succeeded in pitching Elementh, handing a business card, making photos with him and now waiting for news from him. It is necessary to say, it's a long path, so I have to find the next meet-up with him and remind about our project several times Evening afterparty was right at the conference, which was definitely not very cool, as everyone had already got to know each other by this time.     The last day in Singapore was in a roadshow format, which had about 30 local investors. During the pitch I was a little bit worried, apparently affected by the long absence of experience of pitches before investors. It turned out a lot of networking, useful acquaintances and potential partnerships in the Asian region and investments in the project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWGfoRgatfk    At the end of the road show in half a day I had time to visit the local botanical garden, climb the Marina Sand Bay and finish my trip with the same bar on the roof of Fullerton Bay, where my Singapore adventure began.  Conclusions:  1. International conferences Must Have for the project. Those acquaintances and partnerships that are acquired there, can not be obtained otherwise.  2. There is no need for pitch or project presentation, it is enough to have a VIP ticket and participate in all after-parties, where the main networking takes place.  3. To participate in the roadshow, request a full list of confirmed investors to advance all the inquiries in advance, this will significantly improve the quality of networking at the event.  Well, finally, the question is: why in such an advanced city as Singapore, you can't pay anywhere with PayPass? Everywhere you need a credit card. Well, damn, it's a 2018, not 2000!",False

We've collected 910 ETH. We really appreciate your support! Our main goal is to make ICO as soon as possible. Right now we're discussing potential investments with 2 cryptofunds from Israel and Luxembourg. We need anchor investors. We also plan roadshow at China and Korea in March. We need to get big contributions in the first 2 days of ICO, that's why we've decided to move dates of our ICO round. Ico will start at 01 April 00:00 UTC and will continue till 1 May 00:00 UTC. In this case we have an opportunity to get enough commitments till March to get HardCap in the first day of ICO. We are also going to open pre-fund smart contract in a few days, that will work this way: - all contributions to this smart contract will be refundable till the start of ICO - all collected funds at this smart contract will go to ICO smart contract at 01 April 00:00 UTC Imagine, that in 2 weeks we don't have the opportunity to get all hard cap. In this case we'll start ICO at 01 of March and it would continue slowly till 31th of March to reach some big amount. Psychologically people will see, that ICO is not so quick as others and can choose another ICOs to invest. It's the old scheme. Now we are going to change some rules. We collect funds from that moment (will start in a few days) to smart contract, like any other investors pools do. We collect funds to this smart contract and send them all in the first day to our ICO smart contract. People don't see this opportunity to contribute to the pool in public. They will see it only in their accounts after the registration. In any case it's like we create pool to invest it to our own ICO. What can we get here. Some scenarios: 1. We collect <10 000 ETH, that means, that in our old scheme we'll didn't reach soft cap and we should make a refund. And now in new scheme we have 1 more month to reach it. 2. We collect something like 10 000+ eth. We'll send them to our ICO in the first day and people will see, there are lots of funds going to ICO quickly. And that softcap is reached already. That can help them to decide to invest here. 3. We collect 30 000 ETH during March may be even in the first dates of March. In this case we can stop collecting them, announce, that our hard cap closed and we don't need ICO anymore. In all these cases we get the same timeframe as in the old scheme except the first one, which is the worst one and we're sure it will not happen. P.S. All people investing in pre-fund smart contract will pay for the tokens ICO price: 1 EEE = 0,0002 ETH and will get bonus as if they invested in the first day of ICO (30% early birds bonus)",False

What is Elementh Airdrop?  An airdrop is the free distribution of tokens, which are the units of currency native to a blockchain project. In order to participate in Elementh Airdrop you need to register at https://elementh.io/ and go to ""Airdrop"" tab. You'll find all requirements there.  To be the part of Airdrop campaign you need to provide us the following information (at https://elementh.io/): - First and second name - Email address - ETH wallet address (if you don't have one, you need to create it, for example, you can do it at myetherwallet.com) Telegram account (e.g. @bob, if you don't have one, you need to create it, you can learn and download it here https://telegram.org/) - Country of residence  What you need to know about how the airdrop works: We are distributing 2% of total supply tokens in the Elementh Airdrop. 2% of total supply tokens will be distributed between everyone who signs up for the Elementh Airdrop. For example, if 10,000 people sign up, each of them would receive 2% of total supply tokens divided by 10,000. But if only one person signed up, then that individual would receive all of 2% of total supply tokens tokens.  Is there limit to the number of people who can take part in the Elementh Airdrop? Thereâs no limit to the number of people who can participate in the Elementh Airdrop â the purpose is to get as many people involved in the Elementh Community as possible.  What you can do to increase the number of tokens you'll earn: The airdrop will include a referral program. Once you complete the form, on the next page there will be a link, specific to each participant, that can be shared with your friends to invite them to participate in the airdrop. For each person that you refer (up to 20 referrals per person), you will receive a 100% bonus on the standard token allocation. For example, if Bob refers 20 people, and the standard allocation is 1000 tokens, then Bob receives 20000 tokens, as 1000 * 20 = 20000. Fake users and fraud attempts will be strictly checked after the airdrop. You may end up losing your entire airdrop allocation if you are found to have engaged in any fraudulent behaviour.  When you will receive your tokens: After the Elementh Airdrop ends, you will receive an email asking you to confirm your details. Within a week of the end of the token sale, all tokens will be distributed to participants of the Elementh Airdrop.",False

Applications  In general, there are two types of applications built on top of Elementh. The first category is financial applications that provide users with great opportunities to manage and participate in contracts using cash, including buying and selling products and content online and offline, as well as tokens built on the Elementh software. The second category is non-financial applications, such as identifying fake / counterfeit goods in the supply chain, etc.  Decentralized marketplaces based on Elementh. Based on Elementh's blockchain any marketplace will be able to allow sellers to use existing merchandise cards without creating new ones. Data on the ownership of the product will allow you to get rid of counterfeit products sold through the marketplace. Unified merchandise cards will allow you to easily find the lowest price for any products. At the same time, it becomes possible to pay using any crypto currency. Tracking the movement of goods. The complete producer - distributor - seller - buyer chain, stored in the Elementh blockchain, will allow to find suppliers for any volume of products, up to direct order of goods from the manufacturer. We see it as the future of e-commerce. Search for goods by geolocation. Seller information available in the Elementh blockchain allows you to find the most convenient places of purchase for any item. Decentralized sending of messages. The ability to send messages allows you to contact directly with any participant in the transaction. This will allow setting up exchange systems, bidding, obtaining individual purchase conditions and so on. Store designer. Having all the necessary data to set up a store, the system allows you to create individual decentralized showcases for any vendor in the system. Fakes search. Data on all participants of the chain will allow to track the appearance of counterfeit products at any stage of the transfer of ownership of goods. Banking scoring. Access to data on all transactions of any participant of the system will allow instantaneous scoring of the seller, which makes it possible to build credit and overdraft systems by the banking institutions. Different verticals. Elementh blockchain can be used by any service provider, for example, hotels or airlines with ticket, coupon or voucher entity to store information and track ownership.   Most of projects who goes to track counterfeit don't understand how ecommerce works. They are going to track UPC/EAN codes but it will not help if you don't have the full chain from manufactory to the customer. And usually at wholesale suppliers all EAN/UPC codes are lost. And you can't track what stage counterfeit appears. That's why you need some benefits for wholesale suppliers to use system first and only after that you can think about counterfeit.",False
