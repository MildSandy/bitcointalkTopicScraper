Let's take a look at re:factor key differences.  Should a buyer of goods (debtor) fail to make a payment in a specified period of time, most of the platforms require supplier of goods (receivables seller) to repay the debt instead. Such transactions are said to be executed with recourse to receivables sellers.  Unlike on other platforms, sellers on re:factor platform can benefit from using non-recourse model. In such case a seller will get protection against debtors’ bankruptcy or late payment in addition to receivables financing. When sellers choose any of this two models (recourse or non-recourse), re:factor informs investors about the seller’s request, recommends maximum risk exposure limits and provides professional advice on associated risks. Based on that information investors will be able to make a deliberate decisions about proposed investment. A seller will be able to switch from non-recourse to a recourse transaction to facilitate the trade, should investors be unwilling to accept the risks.  Re:factor may also offer investors a bad debt protection service, so investor could obtain a right to claim a delayed payment not only to seller, but sequentially to re:factor as well. Needless to say, such option sufficiently lowers investment risks.",False

The labor costs have been rising rapidly and it makes outsourcing of production for foreign companies not as beneficial as it used to be. The country’s average salaries jumped by 18% in 2014, followed by 17.1% increase in 2015. In 2016 they were lower than the US average figures only by 30%. Although China will no soon give up its leadership position as a global manufacturer, various economic analysts predict the country’s cheap-labor-driven growth to end up before long. After that, as the former Chief Economist of the World Bank Justin Yifu Lin estimates, about 100 million jobs positions connected with heavy intensive labor will be transferred to lower-income countries. This transition will increase 4x the number of manufacturing jobs in those countries.  What countries will fill China’s shoes as growing international manufacturers? George Friedman, the head of the consulting company Stratfor Global Intelligence, calls these countries Post China 16, or PC16. The PC16 list includes 16 countries with total population of about 1 billion: Mexico, Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Peru, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Philippines and Indonesia.  All these countries are characterized by impressive dynamic of economic growth. The annual growth rate almost of all them never dropped below 5% during 2006–2016 period; some of the countries reached double-digit annual growth rates. PC16 countries are transitional economies, so there is still a lot of work to be done to make the countries ready for the mass deployment of large-scale manufacturing. The key step to success in this regard is providing private business with an access to funding. There are multiple ways to do it and factoring, a complex of services designed to provide a supplier with financing in exchange for the right to require a payment from a buyer, is probably the most certain one.",False

This is not entirely true. Factoring does not just solve the problems that arise because of receivables, but is used to increase the volume of sales of goods and services. Any instrument should be used for its intended purpose and without a thought-out strategy to expand the market — it will not perform its basic functions.  Factoring solves several major issues and risks faced by suppliers. Its main purpose is to solve the lack of financing while expanding the scale of production or supply. If the supplier has enough organizational, production and human resources for this expansion, then factoring almost completely covers all the necessary costs, even if the volumes are increased by several times.  The second problem that often arises in such situation is the inability to manage risks, for example, the risk that the buyer will not pay for the goods or services he is getting. Or the risk of payment delay, which can affect negatively the entire production. Due to factoring, the supplier is always protected from these problems, because the risk management is assumed by the factoring company.  The third problem is lack of human and organizational resources. With the fast growth of accounts receivable, there is an additional burden in resolving problems with accounting, communication with debtors about payments, etc. In this case a factoring company is irreplaceable, because this part of work is completely taken care of by its professional human resources.  But, as many other tools, factoring is often misused. It may become excessive for a company that does not have the opportunity or simply does not want to expand on the market, increases the volume of goods and services supply. This can affect the brand in a positive way, as well as lead to a deterioration in the financial standing of the supplier. Factoring is not a pill for every company, but only for those who really need it.",False

It is an asset that is available to almost all companies around the world: trade, manufacturing, research, telecommunications. However, in most cases it is a dead weight that doesn’t allow to extract from it the benefit that potentially exists in this amazing asset.  But what makes it so special is the ability to maintain its value even during crisis and recession. Any other asset can lose in value, but not receivables: the debt of a hundred rubles, one hundred yuan, a hundred dollars or a hundred euros will remain so.  Meanwhile, few people are trying to sell their receivables, exchange them for other assets, or mortgage them. And what really stops them? Mainly, the lack of a wide spread of necessary technologies. For example, the technologies required while working with receivables as collateral should include the ability to properly assess the portfolio of receivables as collateral, to monitor its security and quality, and to collect it if necessary. And such technologies already exist, and very soon they will become widespread.",False

Its reserves have always been there but only recently have we acquired the necessary technology that brought it to the global market and radically changed the industry. The same will soon happen to the receivables as well, and the meaning of these groundbreaking changes will be no less significant.  And some statistics. Asian factoring volume, which declined by 8.46% in 2015, suffered another decline of 8.47% in 2016 to EUR 508 billion. This was caused mainly by China, which saw a further decline of 14.5%. However, Chinese economy is expected to grow at a new normal with a growth rate of about 6.5% for 2017. Although China continues to be the world’s second largest factoring country after The United Kingdom, its factoring growth rate is not expected to experience the high growth as seen in the past.  Japan and Taiwan, two other major Asian countries also suffered decline in volume, albeit at a lower rate 8.7% and 10.45% respectively. Nonetheless, the growth in two other major Asian factoring countries, Hong Kong (27.7%) and Singapore (4.1%) as well as interesting growth in the emerging Asian markets of Malaysia (362.7%), Thailand (20%) and Vietnam (96.4 %) helped to cushion the decline somewhat. Yet Asia continues to be the second largest factoring region accounting for 22% of the world factoring volume. Consequently, some South East Asian countries, (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam) and India are expected to fuel the growth of factoring in Asia as there are signs of increase in factoring activity.",False

Item 104 of the code of laws says “If a merchant gives to an agent grain, wool, oil or goods of any kind with which to trade, the agent shall write down the value and return (the money) to the merchant. The agent shall take a sealed receipt for the money which he gives to the merchant”. In other words, when a seller delivers goods to a buyer, the former doesn’t get paid right the moment; instead, he obtains a right to get the payment after the subsequent sell of the goods.In modern trade finance terms such a right is called “trade receivable”.  Some economic historians argue that factoring appeared in ancient Rome when local wealthy merchants attracted middlemen (factors) to assist with sale and delivery of goods. We know for sure that American colonists in the 17th century resorted to factors’ services when exporting from America to England. Second half XX century textile manufacturing boom in the United States and growing trade in the United Kingdom have shaped factoring. The world factoring market had reached 2.4 trillion EUR in 2016.",False

I see that such a service will be very in demand in many countries. It is very likely that such a concept will compete with traditional banking.,False
