Mas há um segundo custo temporário, além dos 25 QSP. Para executar uma auditoria, você também deve investir 200.000 tokens QSP. Nesse caso, comprar significa 200.000 moedas e, desde que você mantenha a sua carteira, terá acesso ao sistema Quantstamp. Você recebe como fichas apostadas de volta. Eles não são gastos. Então, seu custo real é muito baixo. Esse mecanismo de piquetagem é uma aplicação contínua pelo token.

Esperamos que seja suficiente, se um verificador para considerado desonesto, o impacto econômico prejudicado. Quais os dados apostados por usuários e resultados de séries de programas irão elevar o preço do QSP. Isso permite que você faça uma redução substancial de todos os tokens.

We will also demonstrate what a good Proof-of-Caring submission looks like by highlighting a submission from one of our community members. Although the content we are looking for is changing, we will apply the same general scoring criteria that we applied to the highlighted submission to all future submissions.  Here is the new type of content we are looking for For our next PoC submission period, we are looking for content that focuses more on sharing technical blockchain knowledge as well as sharing general blockchain security practices.  Being creative with your PoC submissions Before diving into our highlighted PoC submission, I will list a wide variety of PoC submission categories that we have received so far. I am listing these categories in order to encourage you to be creative with your PoC submissions.  An Example of a High Scoring Proof-of-Caring Submission Here is an example of a PoC submission that received a high score. In order to keep this article short and concise, we removed some of the original submission.  Why this community member received a good score High scores are generally given to submissions that demonstrate some combination of the following criteria: significant creativity, effort and impact. The submission above demonstrates lots of effort and impact and cites links to many of their claims.  Remember to include the Proof in your Proof-of-Caring Quantstamp would also like to remind you to submit proof alongside your Proof-of-Caring submission on our PoC portal. For instance, if you claim that you made a video about Quantstamp, please submit a link to the video as evidence as well as screenshot of you making the video.  Parting remarks Before we leave you, we would like to point out a couple things. First, even though the type of content we are looking for is changing, the general criteria remains the same. What was your level of effort, creativity and impact? Also, a good way to measure impact is to think about how much your content involves the community.

The sensation in my stomach reminded me of what it was like to go to class on the first day of high school. Having started companies of our own, it was the first time Steven and I had felt that in a long time.  Right after our bus took off, our fellow YC founders started bombarding Steven, Quantstamp’s co-founder and CTO, and I with questions about crypto. We spoke to them for a bit but after a few minutes, Steven and I couldn’t resist the urge to pull out our laptops and start working. As the custodians of a blockchain network under development, there is always so much work to be done and we had to take advantage of every moment.  When we arrived at YC, we started group office hours. In office hours, founders share the challenges they are facing and provide each other with great feedback. Office hours are moderated by former CEOs of high-growth companies, so we receive feedback from some of the most successful business leaders in the world. I wish I could share more details, but we promised to follow Vegas Rules. What is said in office hours stays in office hours.  After office hours, Sam Altman, the President of Y Combinator, gave a presentation. He discussed several military quotes and applied these quotes to running a successful business. One particular part of his presentation stood out to me:  Make a long term commitment to yourself and to each other.  He connected this idea to the tendency of businesses to focus on short term goals in order to please institutional investors and acquire funding. Sam recommended that we align our every action to fit our long term goals and to make smart decisions that trade short term discomfort for long term gain. This made me recognize that I believe Quantstamp is particularly well positioned to focus on our long term goals.  Some CEOs from traditional companies make it their full time job to appeal to traditional investors in order to receive funding. Quantstamp is relatively fortunate, given the success of our recent offering, in that we can dedicate more of our time to developing a protocol that has the potential to enhance the security and future of blockchain technology.  During the dinner, Steven sat next to a group of founders. The topic of the conversation switched to the earthquake, which happened the previous night. After a while, the person he talked to got up in from of the room, and started giving a speech. It turned out he was sitting next to Drew Houston, the CEO of Dropbox. Drew gave an inspirational speech about his experiences at Dropbox, growing the company to more than 1000 employees. A key takeaway from his speech at the dinner was that companies face a different set of challenges during each phase of its growth and that it’s smart to plan ahead for the next stage.

If nodes behave maliciously by attempting to forge an audit or failing to report a bug, their deposits are ""slashed"" or deleted. In return for staking tokens and successfully auditing contracts, validators receive audit fees. This is a solution for the nothing-at-stake problem.  Hypothetically, a validator who finds a bug could choose not to take the bounty and to exploit it for future gains, but, even in the absence of staking and slashing conditions, auditors are still economically incentivized to report the bug. If a potentially malicious actor refused to report a bug in hopes of exploiting the contract once published, functioning nodes will still find the bug, report it, and claim the bounty. The potential bad actor is therefore faced with either reporting the bug or failing to receive payment.  So the premise is, that the smart contract is audited before it is published, and other nodes would find the bug anyways. Also malicious behavior of nodes is penalized.",False

Our team has been a fan of Quantstamp for some time and are impressed not only with their technology but also with their approach to building and supporting their community. Their Proof-of-Caring initiative directly rewarded the most active and passionate community members and is a model for how communities should be built.  The Ink Protocol Smart Contract works to enable decentralized reputation. The contract handles every Ink Protocol transaction, including the payment, escrow, optional dispute resolution, and of course feedback and reputation. All feedback is tied to a verified purchase on the Ethereum blockchain, so security is not just important, it is the foundation of every transaction.  Quantstamp is a scalable security-audit protocol designed to find vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts. We will be using their technology and community to perform a full security audit on Ink Protocol. Their proof-of-audit protocol will ensure that Ink is bug-free and secure. After the audit is complete, the audit report will be publicly available for the entire community to see.  Like Quantstamp, Ink Protocol is all about fostering a genuinely supportive community of users that will keep the network growing and strong. To this end, we are even more excited to announce that we will be showing our appreciation to the most supportive and passionate members of the Quantstamp community by airdropping 2% of the total Ink Protocol Token (XNK) supply to them over the course of several months. Ink protocol is committed to compliance, Quantstamp community members from the US, Canada and China are currently ineligible for these airdrops — for the time being — we will make sure to update you when there is an update.  https://medium.com/@PayWithInk/ink-protocol-and-quantstamp-partner-up-to-deliver-secure-decentralized-reputation-payments-for-56da9d8cfe43",False

Where in the real world do you see instant returns on investment? This is the problem with crypto traders. They want everything immediately. It takes time to develop and launch a good product. Sure, you can release some BS, half baked product, get a market rally and flop. But that's not a long term strategy, is it?  Investing in an ICO is like being an angel investor. Real investors understand that a product may not see the light of day until a year or two out from their initial investment. Quantstamp isn't a quick flip, it's a platform in the making. If you want quick returns, stick to day trading, but be prepared for even more risk.  And yes, already invested in POWR. Made my investment back x5 and still holding 30% of what I bought   Keep in mind, Quanstamp will see a steep curve Q2 of next year, and if you HODL, you should receive some nice airdrops from serious ICO launches.

It's a great read for those doubting QSP. Get in and HODL!   ""What is Quantstamp?  • Decentralized network that uses validator nodes to achieve consensus and verify transactions; • Security library for Solidity; • Application Programming Interface (“API”) for Ethereum; and • Adaptable, modular, platform-agnostic design. In the future, Quantstamp aims to expand their security library to support programming languages other than Solidity, and Quantstamp’s API may be implemented for other platforms.  Some key points:  - QSP is the first scalable security-audit protocol designed to find vulnerabilities in ethereum smart contracts.  -Qsp is a first of its kind coin and has no competition in the crypto world, potentially this could mean that quantstamp could emerge as the market leader for securing smart contracts.  -Users will be airdropped QSP in a proof of care system, depending on how long you've held QSP for and how much you hold you will be awarded free tokens, (Basicaslly HODL and get paid free dividends)  Key technical Members:  - Richard Ma, Founder and CEO of Quantstamp. As CEO of Quantstamp, Richard Ma has been actively participating in the cryptocurrency space. From giving out talks at blockchain conferences to attending interviews with members in the community, he is able to establish an affable public persona. Under his leadership, Quantstamp has shown to be innovative in the way they carry out their operations, with the introduction of the “Proof-of-Caring” concept, as well as an interesting “Proof-of-Hodl” concept in the pipeline. He gives the impression of caring and looking out for the “little investor”, and is thus far the most charismatic leader we have seen in the cryptocurrency space.  - Steven Stewart, Co- Founder and Chief Technical Officer Key Past Appointments: • Computer Systems Analyst at Department of National Defence (DoD) (Canada) • Co-founder and software engineer of Many Trees, Inc.  Community:  - Quantstamp has garnered the support of over 18,000 members in its telegram channel till date, making it one of the biggest and fastest growing communities in the cryptocurrency space. Additionally, the selection of pre-sale participants through their unique Proof-of-Caring screening process has enabled many prominent community leaders to become stakeholders. This project has also established a strong presence in the Internet, which primarily stems from the powerful word of mouth of the vested investors.  Conclusion:  I could go on about this coin all day but there is not enough hours in the day! I am super bullish about this coin and can easily see this coin being one of the top 10 crypto currencies. I think that the current market valuation of $100M USD is extremely undervalued and has a lot of room for growth and could easily see it at 2-3 USD By June 2018.

I went through the white paper and I am now quite enthousiastic about the approach and the possibilities here.  However I got a bit confused on some aspects and I have a few questions, could you please clarify :  - What is the exact status of the QN : is it a protocol running on ethereum (as QSP is an ERC20 token) or is it an independant blockchain, maintained by ""verifier nodes"", which can intereact with the smart contracts created on the ethereum blockchain (or any other blockchain where QSP would be deployed)  - In the case QN is effectively a blockchain, could you describe in a more detailled way how blocks are created ? This is what's written in the white paper.   Does it mean that the blocks of the blockchain would be issued through PoW that would contain the work required to do the automated checks of smart contracts (when there are pending checks) ? - In the Case QN isn't an independant blockchain, can you explain how the network of verifier nodes is created and how the tasks are affected to the nodes?  - The white paper mentions that other smart contract languages might be added, however i see no such plans in the roadmap ? I assume these further developments to be contextual (ie if another platform starts to enjoy success, the Quantstamp API  will be likely deployed on it)?  - Tezos team argued that one of the weaknesses of Ethereum was that Solidity is a ""bad"" language for smart contracts because it can't be verified efficiently in an automated way, which is why they went for more ""obscure"" dev languages (Ocaml if i am not mistaken) what do you think about this claim? Any opinion on their approach?  Thanks for the answers and all the best for the crowdsale !",False

Their telegram channel has over 4100 people in it right now, and it's adding over a hundred every day. Don't miss this one.  It's a startup that audits Ethereum smart contracts, instead of some random schmuck who you may or may not be able to trust. This is a niche that really does need to be filled.  They have a strong team as well one of the advisors is the director of engineering at Facebook.  unlike many other ICOs who only have an idea and a white paper, these guys have a working prototype and have already audited Request Network's smart contract.  That market cap is also low at $30million.  Don't miss this one!",False

Most can be understandable but the executed technical smart contract codes / language.  Bounty has been a good option so far to get it manually checked by members with high credibility but to me as an investor, still there is an unavoidable grey area. The error might be intentional / unintentional but if incase, I will be talking about real money that’s lost / made. Now with Quantstamp, I will be at peace of mind.  Most of the projects are either a concept or with MVP. Here, I can find that it not only has a working product but a tested and proven one with upcoming ICO – request network.  With the all star team, advisors, immediate requirement and use case, I personally see Quantstamp at the horizon of success already.  Considering the token matrix and project as a whole, ICO market cap and $ per token seems to be very low creating immense profit possibilities to investors who will be qualified for pre-sale and crowdsale. I would like to congratulate and thank for such an awesome project and will contribute my part wherever possible. I am definitely in and in the future deserving projects verified by Quantstamp.  Looking forward to meet the Quantstamp team @ World Blockchain Summit Dubai.  Disclaimer: These are my personal openion and not financial advice.",False
