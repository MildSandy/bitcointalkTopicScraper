All the relevant information about this project is on the page 2!  Moderator - AdmSintec  WEBSITE / WHITE PAPER / TWITTER /FACEBOOK / TELEGRAM / MEDIUM  Our official bounty thread  Sintec - is a unique Blockchain option granting the opportunity to invest in the production of high-tech industrial material - polymer bituminous binders (PBB).  What are polymer bituminous binders?  Polymer bituminous binders are polymeric composites made from high molecular petroleum solvents, polymers and fillers, contained in the polymers of protonated complexes of various modifiers. The main difference in the applied technologies for the modification of bituminous rubber crumbs lays in the nano molecular transformation of raw material.  Where is it used?  Road building Accumulator mastic manufacturing Waterproofing Cable production Paints and varnishes Roof building material  Mechanism for gaining earnings on STEC tokens 1.Investors acquire STEC tokens during the ICO, which are backed by a real product - PBB and are considered to be a Blockchain-option, sold at a 50%. 2.Starting from March 2019. Sintec will open a company for the repurchase of $1.6 million dollars worth of tokens on a monthly basis. 3.Tokens which are not claimed for redemption during March 2019, will earn 8.5% dividends per annum, credited each month.  Sintec - this is the only project that compensates lost profits in the case that the rate of invested cryptocurrencies rises!  Guarantees  By buying STEC tokens during the ICO, investors receive a guarantee that their initial investment will grow by over 100%. In order for this to happen, investors simply need to declare their intent to sell tokens at any time, starting March 2019. STEC tokens are backed by raw materials - polymer bituminous binders. Starting March 2019, any investors will be able to exchange his tokens for raw materials at the first demand. During the time of the ICO, the cost of 1 ton of raw materials will be fixed to 21 000 rub. If a request for a repurchase is submitted, and the cost of the raw material grows, then the cost of the token will grow proportionately. If the cost of the cryptocurrency that the investor used as an investment grows when STEC tokens are presented for a buyback, tokens will be able to be returned at the going rate. Thus, investing in STEC also means that you are investing in Bitcoins, Ethereum, and Waves. If an investor decides to sell tokens immediately after March 2019. Then that investor will will earn 8.5% dividends per annum, credited each month.
