A supply chain is the process involved from the inception of producing organic foods and dairy products to delivering it to the end customer.  PAPLE plans to integrate Blockchain technology into the supply chain process to track information about your food.  The value of Blockchain here is its ability to make the supply chain entirely transparent from farm to table.   Blockchain technology can be used to improve traceability by providing trusted information on the origin and state of products. In the case of the global food supply chain, growers, suppliers, processors, distributors, retailers, regulators and consumers can gain access to information regarding the origin and state of food for their transactions.  This can enable food providers and other members of the ecosystem to use a Blockchain network to trace a product to its source.  PAPLE will use this technology to enable farmers, manufacturers and retailers to justify premiums for certain products.  It will also give consumers confidence about where their food comes from and how it was produced.   For the customer, being able to see where the produce comes from and how the raw components were sourced is an opportunity to enhance the quality of consumed and used products, which, in the long run, can potentially lead to a significant positive effect on healthcare needs.
