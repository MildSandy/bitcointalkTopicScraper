You are totally correct. The only way to consolidate volatility is to significantly increase the overall marketcap. However thats not gonna happen without mass adoption. So what we're trying to do is at least take away the volitlity issue from our merchants. We have to be able to address and take the price risk of our own currency in case of a price drop. Otherwise we cannot really convince any merchants to accept any crypto. Hopefully this approach will add to mass adoption soon.",False

MAJOR PROJECT UPDATE !!!!  Dear Community,  As Crypto mania pointed out in hes previous comment, our presence on bitcointalk was not too active in the last couple of days, so please accept our apologies and let us inform you about the current state of the project.  Crowdsale:  Starts on the 20th next Monday with 50% off on the first week. We are about to launch the crowdsale under extremely volatile ETH market conditions where both Alts and ETH are in danger of a further selloff as we believe money will keep bleeding to Bitcoin at least for a while. Anyway crowdsale is NOT our main source of income so we can go ahead with it as planned. Looking at market conditions it is likely that we wont be able to reach our initial goal of 400 ETH. However we would like to assure all of our investors that no matter how the crowdsale goes, we will keep working as our company runs independently from crypto. It is to say that a successful crowdfunding would help us a lot with our upcoming travel and even expenses abroad, but fortunately we dont depend on it business operation wise. So again crowdsale starts on the 20Th of August as planned.  Private sale:  This is the main reason why we were not quite active on forums like this. The Private sale start the same day as the Crowdsale and we had a lot of negotions with our Private investors. These are basically the following: Restaurant and bar owners, Hotel and Gostel operators, Local municipality branches for tourism. We spent pretty much the whole last month on negotiations with these partners. Their support is extremely crucial to the project as they are the ones (acceptance points) givig utility to the Token itself. Without the support of relevant tourism organization parties we woukd not have a real life usecase and would fell under securities as a consiquence. Fortunately we have an overall awesome acclaim from these parties. We basically already sold (actual sale start on the 20th) 15% of the 3 Billion Private sale tokens. Around 60% in Hungary and 40% in Spain (at the moment these are the two countries where we have HQs to negotiate phisically). Our PS live events can be found on our Facebook but you may turn on subtitles as those are not in english.  Tech Update:  We are in close partnership with IBM in general. They are not involved in our ethereum blockchain work at all, however they have a great interest in our tourism projects in general. As we had dozens of negotiations with industry leaders, it is clear that around 40% of companies doesnt think that the blockchain is secure. They seem to be afraid of public chains and would prefer private solutions instead. However they would still need to be able to interact with their clients directly so we had to think about this issue a lot. A week ago we made the decision that we will partner up with IBM to settle a second Meerkat blockchain that will have the same properties as this one, but it will run on IBMs Hyperledger platform. This way we can create a permission based Meerkat smart contract for companies looking for more secure blockchain solution. IBMs prestige is of course a useful sales tool for us as well. Hyperledger is capable of running the Meerkat Exchange Contract in its current form. Hyperledger is fully compatible with Solidity therefore Meerkat will soon become an interoperable Token with multichain features. We expect to carry out this development accordingly to our roadmap.   Etherscan Update:  If you look up our contracts you will find that 100.000.000 MCT Tokens are transferred from the Private Sale Address (original balance of 3 Billion Tokens). We have transferred these Tokens to a newly created Private Sale dedicated address. We had to do this because of some Private Investors who never used crypto before and they couldnt or dont want to buy Tokens with ETH but rather with FIAT. It is not common and we always support our partners with their first wallet creation but some Investors are not even interested in ETH. They are mid/long term investors so they are not really interested in how they can swap MCT back to ETH or FIAT. So it is a good thing. These Investors are long term hodlers  This is it for now. Next week we will be busy with the launch of the IBM cooperation so once again you may feel that we are not active on social channels, but you can always find active community members in our Telegram chat. Many members are 100% up to date with what we do in the phisical world so feel free to ask them. The official IBM cooperation  will be announced later this month on every channel so expect us  Thank you for all the support and we keep up the hard work.  Best regards,  Meerkat Team",False

Actually the ecosystems in the tourism sector are pretty good and efficient. The real problem there is the high fees solution providers are asking for.

Our main goal is to offer the same services but for 2% commission instead of the market standard 20-30%.  But this is just the accomodation sector.

I don't understand why a merchant would complicate his life dealing with the market, considering he still uses $ for his daily purchases.  If this would be adopted by, let's say, a super-market brand, I see how it would work, because the token becomes useful for buying daily necessities, but again, why would a business do that outside of a possibility for the value of the token to increase in price. If the $ is stable, using a token seems like an extra headache.  To sum it up, I don't know how many people with business share our view regarding the long term instability of $, they just care about having a working business, from which he can withdraw profits in whatever currency that is used somewhere else.

Thanks for your constructive comment and in fact you are totally right. Your point is that why any merchant would accept crypto if not for future prcie gains. This is a really good question and in fact it could have been a weak point of our project. Or any crypto project really.  Here is our answer: An diverse audio guide application that leads crypto customers directly to the premises of the acceptance point. So the short answer is we guarantee new customers to show up with crypto. You are totally right wihtout this aspect not many merchants would be interested. In fact the management gets this objection all the time. Merchants refuse to accept crypto becuse they say noone has ever wanted to pay with crypto in their shop. So why would they accept it ? From who ?  That is why we came up with this business model. Your question leads to the main pourpose of our application! Very important question thank you.   ,False

The short answer is no. The merchant exchange conract does not operate with a fixed Token/Fiat rate. We do not fix a USD rate. Instead the merchant issues an invoice to us for the sum Fiat+VAT value of goods being sold for Tokens.  This is totally different. And it is only likely to apply when Token price lowers significantly. Even then merchants are still insentivized to hold their balance. Anyway this is our merchant investor protection model. It is necessary as we have to address price volatility concerns of potential acceptance points.   ,False

You ask a very important question. Actually the core of your question was one of the key aspect of our project. So the question is how customers can find these small local merchants and vica-versa.  The answer:  A key element of our project is the downloadable Meerpackr application. It is a navigation app (basedon google maps) with a built in audio guide and collection of merchants. This application will lead crypto customers directly to the premises of the merchants. It is very important as this is why we can negotiate successfully with merchants. In many cases their first obejction is the fact that they have never seen a customer willing to pay with crypto before. Their obvious concern is that they dont know how to attract these customers so they dont veen think about accepting crypto. But when you telll them there is a navigation database that leads users directly to their shop thats a different story. We guarantee them totally new crypto customers every day. Sure they are only incentivized to accept any crypto if there are customers showing up with such request.  Please read our whitepaper carefully for more details on this matter. It is basically the most important aspect of the project. The navigation app is an absolute key to our success. Without the app it wouldnt work.    ",False

According to the ex-manager this is just a temporary kick, however we have cancelled our contract with this person. According to our aggreement from now on he is not part of our team anymore and he doesnt have rights to represent our firm, even if he get back his access to this Thread. We will try to discuss this with Admins to see if we can somehow get admin permission for the Thread. If its not possible, than it is likely that we will open another Thread. In this case you will find an official statement on our website and also you will be noticed via corporate email from us. Sorry if this may lead to some inconvenience. It is very hard to find a reliable community manager as they are keep jumping from one project to another with several accounts. We will solve this situation as soon as possible. Until then we will reply and post updates from this account. From now on please only send messages to the official mkt email address which is:  csanad@havefunbudapest.com    You can also double check this matter if you wish by asking for official confirmation on that address.

The reason why our management is not really involved in here (and other social media) is because they are extremely busy with merchant negotiations for the Private-Sale period (which will run simultaneously with Public-Sale).  On the other hand I have to say that the top management are not blockchain experts. They are experts of tourism, advertising and finance. Their job is to push mass adoption forward by keep doing what they do which is getting there phisically and negotiate in person. The crypto aspect of the business is handled by devs only. For example this is why we resist all schill/bounty initiatives. We told the management that we shall stand of out the ICO crowd by not doing any sintethic pumps. Bottom line is we are responsible for crypto and crowd-sale. The management is responsible for actual business and private-sale. However you can talk to them via our telegram group.

I have to say there is kinda big difference between our project and the one you mentioned. To me it seems that they are totally focusing on travel accomodation. It is like 10% of our business. We have a few hotels in our merchant portfolio but it is not in our focus at all. We are targeting local merchants (restaurants, bars, cafeterias and popular sightseeing destinations. Going for accomodation can be pretty hard I think. I mean you have to compete with giants like Booking. Now I know how we all like to say that everything is better on a blockchain. However accomodation reservation is a difficult story. There you cannot make mistakes because if I travel hundreds or thousands of kilometers and then end with a false or invalid reservation I will be in big trougle right? I think thats why Booking is so popular. They have a superior customer service. They have built in guarantees, free cancellation and stuff. These are all very important customer protection features. You can try to compete with it but who said it would work better on a blockchain. It probably wont.  Bottom line is not every industry is easy to adopt with crypto. Not every database works better on a blockchain. I thnik it is very important for crypto startups to focus on areas where they can ""easily"" succeed. Beating a great service provider like Booking is not an easy task. That why we dont aim for these hights.",False

This is really important for an ICO to be transparent as much as possible.  Of course, your explanation @meerkatoken about bounty campaign caught my attention because I am in crypto almost from the beginning and never heard that a token is seen as an security because of bounty campaign, accordingly to the SEC rules. Like I said this is something new for me and if possible I would like to know the source of this information.  Keep reading about Meerkat and I see this working but don't forget about a desktop app or to add a possibility to login and operate from laptop or desktop not limit your product to the app only, I personally think this is a big mistake.

I would like to shortly reflect to the issues you raised.  Desktop app:  To be honest we havent think about to launch such at all. The main reason being the fact that our management is negotiating with merchants for more than a year now. All of them are interested in our project beacuse there is a mobile payment system they can use without any modification in their current systems. In fact our project is pretty useless without the audio guide app as this is the only tool to lead crypto customers directly to our merchants. Otherwise they wont find each other so... you get the point.  SEC security issue wiht bounty programs:  It is not a surprise that you havent heard of this as it is THE BIGGEST current issue with 99% of ICOs. You can find articles on this as some expert covered this already in major articles yet it is something noone want to talk about (even if you think you invested in a utility token, it ends up being a security investment if there was a bounty).  The short explanation is:  So their idea is based on the Howey Test. The SEC’s Howey Test labels a transaction an investment contract (and, most likely, a security) if “profit comes from the efforts of a promoter or third party,” which almost always occurs when a project is promoted as part of a bounty program, and free token means there’s an implied expectation of profit. These guidelines indicate all bounty-promoted tokens are securities  I know it seems very bad news but this is the reality noone wants to consider. We do.",False

Thanks for dedicating your very first comment to us. Assuming youre not working for a competitive project there is no secret I can tell you. Because there is no secret in our token economics. Our company the Have Fun Corporation is basically a tourist guide and advertisement services agency.  To keep it short with concrete numbers a usual merchant pays roughly 3000 USD per month for our advertising spaces both in our quarterly magazine and downloadable app. So as you can imagine we make a reasonable income on merchant contracts. Therefore we are not worried to buy back our tokens if necessary. As it is emphasized in the whitepaper our business model is based on the idea that price volaitlity can not be a problem for a merchant. Otherwise they just refuse to accept crypto and thats it. Volatility is a real barrier for crypto and it has to be address honestly for businesses. Hopefully our project can contribute to that. ,False

Allow me to pass your details to our Marketing department. As far as I know the romanian translation is still suitable.  Regarding your concern I would like to reflect shortly. The economical cycle is this: 16% of Tokens will be owned by Merchants (merchant private sale starts along with the public sale). Thats a big chunk of the total supply already. Merchants are directly incentivized to hold their Tokens. Which they obviously will as demand goeas up. Thats the easy scenario. We work for this of course.  However we have to be preapared for price corrections and this topic has to be addressed correctly. For example these days people do buy the rumors and sell the news. So you have to be prepared that if you come out with a new exchange listing news that can drive the price down instead of increasing it. Happens in crypto. All right. But merchants have to know about this they have to be informed how our community works and reacts to certain things. This is why crypto could be scarry to general businesses. They dont even understand the hectic price actions. Someone has to explain them honestly.  In short we know our business and we know our financial limits. We accept high-class merchants only meaning that they have to be in their field for at least 5 years and we have a longer list of metrics where we evaluate our partnerts anyway. Obviously the higher the income of a merchant the less likely that it will sell Tokens for less then what they bought it for. Also most of our merchants have some investment strategy on their own. Most of them are actually pretty familiar with the stock market. These merchants wont panic in case of a dip. But on the other hand we have to show confidence in our project buy making a contractual promise that if nooone else is willing to buy their Tokens, at least the issuer will.  Again price volatility is something that we are used to in crypto. Most of the general businesses wont accept it. They will gladly accept an increasing value but not the decrease. I mean they wont tolerate a -10% dip in one day thats for sure. So we can decide whether to face this and say I am confident and you can count on me. Or we wont make it through to mass adoption.",False

You might find it interesting.  FACT:  Any bounty supported ICO is automatically considered as SECURITY by the US SEC. I assume you know what that means for an ICO in the long run. Trouble.  Meerkat is a pure utility Token and we simply cannot risk to loose this aspect.  On the other hand bounty and airdrop tokens are subject to immediate sale after the first exchange listing. Thats why most ICO loose value after reaching the markets. By the time they get listed they already issued thousands of Tokens to random bounty participants. Those Tokens will be sold the soonest I can assure you that. You can see this if you check hystorical exchange release data of most ICOs. Sure the lack of bounty can decrease our marketing exposure but still we are ok with that. Investor interest is first bro.",False
