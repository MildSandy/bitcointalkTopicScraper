WE HAVE AN IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT!  CONFIDEAL, A SMART CONTRACT PLATFORM, STARTS A SMARTER ICO.  Our ICO campaign failed and raised 303 ETH out of 70,000 planned, in spite of the functional product, wide media coverage, and good ratings.   The main reason, which is clear and which would prevent ourselves from investing in any ICO, is loss of trust. The market that used to be overheated three months ago is now shrinking. The risk of investing in a fraudulent project can now be compared to driving on a one-lane mountain road in the dark with the lights turned off: it’s not that you are doomed, but are likely to get into trouble. Investors’ skepticism toward projects has contributed to the market decline even more than ICO ban in certain countries. Although we are trying to be as transparent as it gets, it will take the community long to find an antidote against “toxic” projects like Tezos or Confido and to start regulating ICO’s in a safer and a more efficient way.   At the same time, the “exhaustive funding” strategy that we chose for our roadmap was perceived unfavorably for two reasons: first of all, overfunding would have hampered the growth of our token’s value on the market, and second, such request for abundant funds could have aroused suspicions in our acting bona fide.  5 days ago our investors received an e-mail with the instruction how can they retrieve their funds. Meanwhile the team is working on their mistakes in order to launch a smarter campaign.  Although our first ICO has failed, we received so many words of support and our belief in our project is so strong that we keep on fighting for the future of Confideal.

From there, the company plans on creating an ecosystem through which anyone, regardless of programming knowledge, has the ability to construct smart contracts; providing access to the commercial industry.  Confideal is a new platform built out of necessity.

Smart contract technology represents an ideal tool for low-risk deal-making: outlined and executed by program code, the contract between the counterparties can be fulfilled or broken only in accordance with the originally established terms. The terms of a smart contract are established before the deal is made. Then their fulfillment is ensured by software code without human interference. Due to the technical specifics of the blockchain - the distributed database where the smart contract is stored - any interference aimed at changing the terms of the deal after it has been signed is nearly impossible. The Ethereum smart contract works as an “escrow agent”, a sort of bank cell, where the terms of the deal and the money (cryptocurrency) are stored until the contract is fulfilled. Moreover, the terms of the contract are available only to the counterparties themselves, and, in case of disputes, to the arbitrator.",True

So maybe for the future it is an option to have a variety of arbiters being required for a smart contract to work as impartially as possible. Much like a multi-sig it could be a solution to have several independent arbiters which have to make a judgment. Or in the future maybe it is also possible to include fully autonomously working oracles as arbiters? But then one question arises if you include real arbiters into your system as you do it now: how are you going to achieve cost savings over standard arbitration processes as we have them now? Why would they offer their services at a cheaper price on a blockchain than in real life?,True

The organization of international deals is an a priori more complex process than that of domestic contracts. For that reason, the partners tend to simplify the contracting process by conducting the entire workflow via the Internet. This approach creates additional risks - it becomes possible to modify contract data without the partner’s knowledge, forge signatures in   Photoshop etc. -  Foreign exchange regulations. There is a possibility of severe time delays in the countries with strict forex regulations. Delays of five or more days are quite probable, and sometimes banks can deny payment processing outright, offering no explanation. - Arbitration. In case of disputes, there can be one more type of costs: the average cost of an arbitration procedure today is 2.5 million USD, and it takes no less than 6 months to be completed. Such losses are inadmissibly expensive for SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises). Confideal is the platform which uses the smart contract technology powered by the Ethereum blockchain to solve the principal problems bound up with modern contractual processes.",True

Delays of five or more days are quite probable, and sometimes banks can deny payment   processing outright, not explain. 3)Arbitration.
