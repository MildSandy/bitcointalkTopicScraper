The platform will combine the financial market with a fast-growing cryptocurrency industry to make the latter more accessible to ordinary people. We received many letters from users asking us to add the function of buying / selling cryptocurrency and tokens, without having to leave the application. Moreover, we came to the conclusion that it is easier for users to buy and store cryptocurrency immediately in the application rather than have to make a purchase on centralized crypto exchanges. Especially considering that in recent years, hacking exchanges has become common practice, and verification process takes more than one week.  Such a function will make the purchase / sale of cryptocurrency and tokens simple and secure. We have taken other steps to achieve this goal. For example, the storage of private keys in the application is carried out only on the user’s side, and also, for greater security, you can use multi-sig and add more than one transaction.  How will the exchange be carried out, you may ask. It becomes quite simple to buy cryptocurrency / tokens, just in 4 simple steps:  1. Select the required cryptocurrency / token;  2. Specify the address to receive “coins” to;  3. Make a deposit in one click, using a plastic debit/credit card. Funds are credited instantly;  4. After receiving the payment, the equivalent ammount to the deposit in the selected cryptocurrency is transferred to the wallet specified in the application.  The quick purchase function of cryptocurrency also facilitates the acquisition of tokens through the Scopuly ICO-list. By using it, users can participate in ICOs, without having to leave the application.  Scopuly platform will be a basic tool for beginners and experienced investors / traders working in the cryptocurrency market. It will allow you to convert and transfer funds from any currency to crypto assets.  Thanks to the platform, the transfer of assets to the digital forex market will become more smooth and troublefree.

With the Stellar protocol, the universal Blockchain World Wire system allows any financial institution to instantly make cross-border payments.  Advantages of the Scopuly platform include transparency of operations, low cost, high productivity, simplified form of transaction fees and a high degree of security.  The ability to instantly transfer funds to anywhere in the world is the main advantage of decentralized multicurrency cross-border transactions. In addition, the cost of operations will be much lower than if using conventional banking payment system. The whole process of making a transaction can be controlled in real time, but at the same time the security of the transaction will remain at the highest level.  This paragraph will discuss how exactly it will work. For example, a user from Moscow wants to send funds to New York. He will send, for example, XLM crypto currency, and the recipient in turn will exchange the received XLM to USD on Scopuly Exchange and withdraw this amount to their bankcard. This process will only take a few minutes.  This greatly simplifies international transfers and payments, and also makes them faster and more economical compared to traditional bank transfers.  As a result, crypto-currencies such as Stellar XLM or Scopuly SKY will become more accessible to ordinary users by integrating them as a payment method and a bridge between national currencies.  This allows users to make cross-border payments with a commission of only 0.5% and a guaranteed transfer period of 15 minutes on average. This is the time it takes on Scopuly fiat exchange for funds to be transferred to recipient’s bankcard. At the moment the average bank transfer commission is about 4% and it takes from three to five working days for funds to be received.  Multicurrency payments. For example, your client charges you with MOBI tokens (for example 100 MOBI) and sends you the QR-code of the account for payment. You scan the QR-code that was billed to you and want to make a payment, but you do not have MOBI tokens that your customer wants to receive. For Scopuly, this is not a problem. You simply select any asset that is on your balance sheet (for example SKY tokens) and then the system calculates how much you need to send SKY so that your customer receives 100 MOBI.  This greatly saves sender’s time, since, to make a payment on the billed account, it is not necessary to change the assets on the stock exchange to the asset that your client wants to receive. You just make a payment, and the exchange itself looks for relevant offers in the Stellar order book, making the exchange in between assets for you automatically, at the most favorable rate.",False

Its main task is to search for matches on requests for the purchase and sale of user assets. At the same time, the platform does not store personal data and user funds and operates on the basis of a distributed registry (a database that is updated independently by each participant — Stellar blockchain).  Differences between centralized and decentralized exchanges  Centralized exchanges exist under the management of a particular company or a person. Managers that fully control all actions taking place on the platform, are not only responsible for the information placed on the exchange, but also make all decisions on which the further development of the platform depends. They are also responsible for protecting user data.  Decentralized exchanges are managed automatically or semi-automatically, and each platform participant has the opportunity to make important decisions in regards to the development of the project. The interaction between the participants occurs directly, without any intermediaries. Such exchanges use blockchain technology for the storage and processing of the data.  In addition to supporting the release and movement of assets, Scopuly also acts as a decentralized, secure and fast peer-to-peer exchange for crypto assets of any type.  Scopuly provides almost instant trading and zero commissions for crypto asset trading.  We are glad to provide you with an exchange, where it will be possible to trade crypto assets and always have full control over your tokens. Scopuly unites safety, which is achieved through decentralization, with the speed and convenience of centralized platforms. This is the next step in crypto currency trading.  A number of centralized exchanges make most of the deals with cryptocurrency, but their business model puts users funds at risk. The market has a serious potential for growth, but until the problems with security will be resolved, the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology itself is under the question. This is why we are putting all our energy into creating an exchange, which will be as fast and easy to use as the centralized platforms, but without the risks that they have.  Scopuly — is the most secure exchange in the world, the main difference of which is that users hold their funds themselves, without having to go through any intermediaries. Scopuly — it is freedom, speed of sending every type of an asset that is only possible to imagine.  Crypto, fiat, bonds, goods and more. All Assets are traded on a peer-to-peer model. Scopuly works on the universal stellar order book. Bidding takes place directly between traders.  No intermediaries and no miners. You trade from your own wallet and constantly control your keys. Scopuly is a new place for experienced traders. In recent years, millions of new tokens have been released. Everyone will have to find some kind of an exchange in order to trade these assets. Users will need to register accounts on random exchanges to be able to buy or sell certain tokens, and inevitably many of these tokens will not be listed or other errors will occur.  Scopuly users have the opportunity to trade more than 1,800 Stellar tokens without registration, without commissions and KYC procedures.  Scopuly is created to support efficient, real-time, decentralized crypto trading. Any token created on Stellar Blockchain can be bought and sold on a decentralized Scopuly exchange using the distributed exchange offer mechanism. ICO projects will not have to rely on third-party exchanges, such as Bittrex or Poloniex, Binance, to list their tokens or create a trading market for them. All this means that the sale / distribution of tokens in Scopuly can be started immediately after emission.  Scopuly’s decentralized crypto-exchange is a token trading mechanism, completely free from restrictions on trading pairs. Usually, centralized exchanges themselves determine which trading pairs will be on the exchange. New tokens on such exchanges arrive very slowly, and sometimes, unexpectedly for users, are removed altogether. We also see that centralized exchanges are beginning to demand a fee for the placement of a new token, and this contribution amount reaches $ 3,000,000 per listing. Looks like madness.  In Scopuly, everything works exactly the opposite. Listing new tokens will always be free and will never have any moderation — this is a completely decentralized and automatic process. Users will not only be able to add their own new tokens and choose which token they want to own and trade, but also they will be able to create their own trading pair from the tokens that they currently own in their wallets.  In Scopuly, the addition of new tokens occurs automatically, the user finds the necessary asset and makes an exchange to it. This means the complete democratization of the trade and addition of new tokens. Using Scopuly, you have your own Stellar wallet (which Scopuly does not control) and ability to trade thousands of tokens, with a 5-second average confirmation time and transaction costs in tiny penny fragments ($ 0.00003 — charged from Stellar).  We believe in the future of decentralized exchanges (DEX) and the potential for revolutionizing the issue, investment and trading of financial products. Our mission is to discover this potential for the whole world. Previously, only investors with deep pockets could invest in the best products at the best prices. Our mission is to make a revolution in trade so that users trade on a uniform playing field, regardless of the bankroll. Getting rid of trade commissions will help us achieve our goals of financial integration and maximum democratization. In Scopuly, all trade peer-to-peer exchange operations have completely zero commissions.  * Decentralization and democratization is at the heart of Scopuly",False
