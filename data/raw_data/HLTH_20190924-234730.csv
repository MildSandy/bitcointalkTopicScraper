To put it plainly — NO, we are NOT storing healthcare data on the blockchain.  What we are doing is much, much cooler.  Instead of storing healthcare data on the blockchain, we are using the blockchain to govern access to that data through our key pair system, which is the heart of Health Nexus. In this way we can allow healthcare providers to share stored data with each other, even if they are using different storage systems. We modeled this system off the research group MedRec from MIT, which implemented a similar tool for Beth Israel Hospital.  This system works by allowing users to create permissioned “keys” on the blockchain. These keys store a URL pointing to specific data, with access governed by rules such as an expiration date or allowable actions. Our key pair system allows for the creation of children keys that can be granted to other users, such as healthcare providers, allowing easy and secure access to that data.  For example, a hospital can create a key pointing to the data for a recent patient who just underwent knee surgery. In that key they include a hash of the data for verification, an expiration date, and read access. They then create a child key and give that key to the rehab center their patient is attending, giving that rehab center read access to the patient’s data until the expiration date. This information can all be audited, allowing the original hospital to prove it granted the rehab center access to patient data.  Our key pair system utilizes audited smart contracts to accomplish this, and our smart contracts can be viewed via Github repo. We have specifically created a meta data field to allow users to set their own permissions and rules going forward to ensure our contracts are developer friendly to encourage the creation of new healthcare solutions on Health Nexus.  Going forward we are looking to build this into the protocol level. We are doing this because the large utility value of this ensures its use, and by including it at the protocol level we can help ensure a better built, defined and efficient system. We will start by specifically including data fields in the accounts to keep track and maintain the keys to insure greater efficiency.  Long story short, this key system will allow for simplified and secure data sharing of sensitive data without requiring all providers to share storage systems. It has already been tested at Beth Israel Hospital and version 1.0 is ready to go!  https://medium.com/simplyvital/the-key-to-simplyvital-health-84d3d4dff684",True

Hope it can help you ( but i advise you to read the white paper for more technical purposes ) :  Simply health Vital wan't to reducing medical costs, giving individuals more control over their health data, opening up possibilities for innovation in medical research.  In order to do this , they have an open source PROTOCOL ->  Health nexus  who run in the blockchain to  helps the providers view authenticated ad non-repudiable records at the same time regardless of clinical affiliation. Because Sharing data between care teams is extremely difficult, but necessary to ensure that the correct care pathway is being followed in the right order by the right providers. their platform allows providers to easily share files with their care teams to coordinate care.     Payors can also utilize their platform for real time access to care pathways for audit reasons. They can dig into visit history data to identify why episode costs deviate significantly from average costs.   In conclusion , HLTH will be partner with their competitor.

Most other healthcare decentralization efforts are applications that can be built on Health Nexus. That's how we envision it working - service providers that understand decentralization and are crypto-savy will build applications on Health Nexus and use familiar SaaS models to engage healthcare providers (that don't really have crypto-economic experience and don't want to).

In addition, the data sharing piece is just the beginning, and, if you look at where healthcare is going globally, the trend is toward what is called ""value based care"" (our niche focus) where payment is based on outcomes and patient recovery, not number of procedures/stuff the docs do. Specifically in the US, just as IPKiss said, the providers are financially penalized for not sharing data or coordinating care. I read the 1200+ page MACRA ruling, and if you look at where that legislation is going in 3,5 to 7 years, it completely hinges on providers coordinating care and sharing data. Private insurance (Aetna, United Health, etc.) always follow in the Federal Government's footsteps -- this market, in the US alone, is $300B worth of payments tied to value based care. And it's a massive paradigm shift in healthcare. Tons of research showing that existing tech systems are inadequate to support docs in this new payment reform.  Data sharing is just the beginning, though. We are already developing smart contracts for insurance payment distribution with one of the nation's leading health insurance companies. A tokenized system provides limitless opportunities for other developers, too, that leverage the open source Health Nexus protocol, and for us as a company to continue to build applications.  Also, it is important to note - re rural hospitals - that, just like any other product, ours will not be rolled out to 100% of the providers globally immediately. Adoption of technology is over time - and those providers that are ready and in need adopt faster.  Case in point, we had a customer meeting yesterday (very large hospital system in the north eastern part of the US) and we are moving ahead with them re our platform. Their need is immediate, they see the value, they're ready.  In the US, there is, as IPKiss said, again - Federal legislation that requires the adoption of electronic systems for patient tracking.  Globally, there are places that are more advanced than others. However, the opportunity is vast. For example, our advisor, Dr. John Halamka of Harvard and one of the top hospitals in the US, is leading a project with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to bring blockchain-based healthcare solutions to Africa. One could argue that Africa uses very basic systems, if at all. However, with technology that is designed correctly and cost effectively, adoption is not a problem. We're proud to have Dr. Halamka as an Advisor to share his learnings on this project, and to guide us as we continue to grow and develop.",True

There are many healthcare projects that are profitable in the short term - it depends on whether or not the company did the right Customer Validation -- most digital health companies don't spend the time on customer validation. Before we incorporated - and before we had a burn rate, we spent 1.5 years on customer validation, testing simple-basic wire frames in excel to understand what providers and healthcare administrators needed and would pay for.  This research, plus my background as a Strategic Planner for the 6th largest hospital in the US, proved invaluable as we attained revenue within 7 months (We were incorporated in Feb 2017). This is quite unheard of in healthcare, but speaks to the fact that we created a product that fits a true need.  While you are correct that blockchain technology is new, the platform and services that we are bringing to healthcare fit a very specific need, and a need that directly affects them financially. We started with Bundled Payments which financially penalizes providers for poor care of their patients, BUT provides financial savings for good care of their patients (that's quite simplified, but I don't want to nerd out too much about Bundles Payments.. )  In addition, we don't actually mention that we're using blockchain technology when we are speaking with potential customers. Bringing it up simply creates confusion and many, many questions; and it doesn't matter. Our customers just want a product that works, is compliant with their needs. It would be like telling them we're using AWS or postgres....they simply don't care. When the conversation shifts, usually with the IT team, into the details of the technology, we then discuss blockchain tech. Because of the audience at this time, our tech is even more exciting to the team.  Lastly, the government is not a target we have our eyes set on yet.

As described in the response below, there is a global shift toward what is called ""Value based care"" where providers are paid based on the outcomes of the patient (with some systems farther along than others). Value based care drives the need to be able to see the patient data in aggregate, regardless of which system the hospital uses. The fact that reimbursement is tied to providers working together is key -- interoperability is a business issue not a technology issue in healthcare. Countless articles on it, but in short, if there is no financial incentive or shared financial gain for sharing data, providers and health insurance companies don't share data. As a former Strategic Planner for the 6th largest hospital system in the US, I was baffled by this -- it's in the best interest of the care of the patient to share data. BUT sharing data affects market share (I know... healthcare is a business too...it sounds weird). And, affecting market share, especially in locations where there is a lot of competition, and margins are tight already, means they won't share data unless they have to. As stated below, just like any product or program, 100% adoption will not happen on day 1. Our platform and tech is for those that are in these risk based contracts right now, and are looking for solutions - now. This is a $300B+ market exploding over the next 5 - 10 - 15 years.  Also, the way we've designed our first applications do not require all hospitals to use our system, as you imply. This was very strategic and intentional after I studied for months reading and interviewing others on why Health Information Exchanges failed in the US. (See above comment about data interoperability and data sharing being a business issue not a technology issue.)  [Pasting other response here] On Point, IPKiss!! Thank you. In addition, the data sharing piece is just the beginning, and, if you look at where healthcare is going globally, the trend is toward what is called ""value based care"" (our niche focus) where payment is based on outcomes and patient recovery, not number of procedures/stuff the docs do. Specifically in the US, just as IPKiss said, the providers are financially penalized for not sharing data or coordinating care. I read the 1200+ page MACRA ruling, and if you look at where that legislation is going in 3,5 to 7 years, it completely hinges on providers coordinating care and sharing data. Private insurance (Aetna, United Health, etc.) always follow in the Federal Government's footsteps -- this market, in the US alone, is $300B worth of payments tied to value based care. And it's a massive paradigm shift in healthcare. Tons of research showing that existing tech systems are inadequate to support docs in this new payment reform.  Data sharing is just the beginning, though. We are already developing smart contracts for insurance payment distribution with one of the nation's leading health insurance companies. A tokenized system provides limitless opportunities for other developers, too, that leverage the open source Health Nexus protocol, and for us as a company to continue to build applications.  Also, it is important to note - re rural hospitals - that, just like any other product, ours will not be rolled out to 100% of the providers globally immediately. Adoption of technology is over time - and those providers that are ready and in need adopt faster.  Case in point, we had a customer meeting yesterday (very large hospital system in the north eastern part of the US) and we are moving ahead with them re our platform. Their need is immediate, they see the value, they're ready.  In the US, there is, as IPKiss said, again - Federal legislation that requires the adoption of electronic systems for patient tracking.  Globally, there are places that are more advanced than others. However, the opportunity is vast. For example, our advisor, Dr. John Halamka of Harvard and one of the top hospitals in the US, is leading a project with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to bring blockchain-based healthcare solutions to Africa. One could argue that Africa uses very basic systems, if at all. However, with technology that is designed correctly and cost effectively, adoption is not a problem. We're proud to have Dr. Halamka as an Advisor to share his learnings on this project, and to guide us as we continue to grow and develop.",True

The first major reason is that we have started with a practical and simple implementation of blockchain technology so that we could directly introduce blockchain to healthcare, and since in the US so far there have only been theoretical or very small applications this has allowed us to become the 'go to' for blockchain in healthcare while allowing us to gain more experience.  In addition, it has allowed us to adopt a phased approach that allows us to slowly onboard Healthcare more and more onto blockchain.  This has allowed us to also to build a product that is targeted towards Healthcare's needs.  From a Technical standpoint, there are a few major differences.  Our governing system is unique.  It provides a decentralized system for upgrading and validation that takes advantage of the trustless nature of blockchain and helps to ensure its security and longevity.  Along with that our verification system also provides a unique way to ensure compliant nodes.  Next would be our data storage.  Long term we are planning on integrating data storage to our system that is currently not being offered by other projects.  While there are other differences, those would be the largest three.",True
