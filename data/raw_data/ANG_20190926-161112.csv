I've worked for them and they never paid me, they also fired me without good cause.  They are very dishonest people and they claim they can do things better than the competition, which is laughable.  They keep promising things, but they can't even honor a contract without cheating.  This contract you see here was never honored by them (i.e. they never paid me for my work).  They claim they are a open/democratic project and they have removed all of my posts on Facebook and blocked me, how hypocritical from them.  My advice is: stay away from these scammers and invest your money on better projects.",False

He was on a 4 month trial working on our project before he would've been fully committed. He has been tagging us in every social media and also now on bitcointalk claiming that we are dishonest and hypocritical and he is claiming that we never paid him. We will upload details of what actually happened and you can be the judge.  The payment schedule for his 4 month trial was supposed to be as follows: 1st month= $500 paid in BTC 2nd month= $600 paid in BTC 3rd month= $700 paid in BTC 4th month= $800 paid in BTC On the 4th of September we sent him $250 worth in BTC (he was supposed to get paid biweekly) So for 10 days we ended up paying him for 2 weeks actually.    Based on the conversation we had with him, his computer wasn't performing very well so we decided and agreed to purchase him a new computer for $587.89. The deal was for us to pay for the full amount of the computer but $200 out of the $587.89 was supposed to be as an incentive for his future cooperation. And the remaining was supposed to be deducted monthly at the price of $50/$60 every month until it was paid off.  Here is the attached copy of the payment that was made on September 3rd for the computer.    Based on unproductive cooperation we decided to end the terms with him. So, Mr. Dviola was supposed to receive the other biweekly payment of $250 in BTC but we ended the terms. So technically, he owes us the difference($337.89) we paid for the computer.  We will not waste any further time to answer Mr. Dviolas comments on social media but if he continues the harassment we will put in place our legal rights.",False

Here is the attached copy of the payment that was made on September 3rd for the computer.  https://i.imgur.com/WwdPkqf.png  This is true.  However, you didn't remove my personal information from the screenshot very carefully, I can still see my information. You understand this is illegal, right?  I never mentioned anything personal about you, not even your last name.   Based on unproductive cooperation we decided to end the terms with him.  Unproductive cooperation is when others make mistakes and you still overlook their bad behavior.  https://i.imgur.com/OcBSCAq.png https://i.imgur.com/fl05gll.png   So, Mr. Dviola was supposed to receive the other biweekly payment of $250 in BTC but we ended the terms.

We will not waste any further time to answer Mr. Dviolas comments on social media but if he continues the harassment we will put in place our legal rights.  The same way you have your rights, I also have mine.  Also, you should be aware that Brazilian CLT laws prevail all other labor laws and contracts.  So, pay me what you owe me and the story ends here.  Also, for our safety, all of our conversations are being recorded and archived.",False
