Among other improvements, the release offers accessible UI for publishers to list their ad inventory on the platform and advertisers to bid for the listed ad slots and submit their ads.  The platform’s core is an Ethereum-based advertising marketplace that has already been tested out in real sector. Earlier the project has reached partnership with the global travel media provider Ink and conducted world’s first blockchain-driven ad auction, selling 1 million advertising spaces on boarding tickets.  Fortunately enough, the project has chosen simplicity and accessibility over the bells and whistles offered by a number of projects attempting to get in the niche of blockchain-driven advertising. The team has also developed its second generation of smart contracts, allowing bids to persist as off-chain signed messages until accepted. Such an improvement alone will provide greater scalability potential, which is additionally reinforced by specific smart contract architecture compatible with second-layer scaling solutions.

We are glad to report that our partner Stremio, a video entertainment hub, has announced that it will be using AdEx exclusively for its advertising monetization needs.  Stremio has been our partner since the very beginning. The two projects were established by the same founders and are closely related; this is why it’s only natural that ads on the video streaming app will be delivered by AdEx exclusively.  Stremio has previously used the services of different advertising networks, however none of them have performed to the satisfaction of the Stremio team. This means no more ads will be shown on Stremio’s desktop and mobile apps until the AdEx prototype is released and functioning.  The Stremio team is confident that this change will be positive for the video hub’s users who would be able to enjoy video content with unobtrusive ads, while advertisers reach a targeted audience with their offers.  We’re incredibly excited that we will launch our platform with a service that currently has close to 5 million users across the globe. This will give both advertisers and publishers confidence in the real-life application of blockchain technology for advertising, as well as in AdEx as a solution bridging these two industries.  https://medium.com/@AdEx_by_Stremio/adex-becomes-exclusive-ad-provider-for-video-entertainment-platform-stremio-eb476bc86eff",False

If we know btc is volatile, we should have more eth, neo , bnb pairs just to even things out. Just imagine a scenario where bitcoin falls to say a few hundred dollar. Everyone will go back to bitcoin buying frenzy and no one will like to spend that bitcoin on an altcoin with the hope that bitcoin price will rise back few thousand dollars which can make them real money. With this, demand will go down of altcoins.  Its always one of the two arguments. Bitcoin is rising up so everyone is planning to ride the wave and hence altcoin is decreasing or bitcoin is decreasing so there will be more buying opportunities for bitcoin and that is why no one will spend a higher bitcoin amount to get  altcoin.  If we get more pairs we remove dependency of a coin's performance just on bitcoin. A coin should and only should be measured by their product and their marketing strategy and not by factors which they can't control and is bleeding them daily and its investors.",False

I have to say I have seen this type of pattern many times. And usually it's accumulation. But that's a long drop. It's not BTC price (or China) doing this so much as a natural correction. I think we could be looking at a large rise in the future when Adex delivers or within a couple weeks of delivery (lead up towards news rise). Adex is on Bittrex and it's not going anywhere so the market is protected from China bullshit.  So the positives are :  - This pattern is very common in coins that are being accumulated for a MUCH higher rise in the future (think weeks or months). You can see it has happened for other coins by looking in the charts of other coins doing well at Bittrex. Seems to be an ICO thing.  - It looks like there is very much a controlled slide. I think someone is letting it down slow to create a stable slide and gain more coins for later.  - Adex has the prototype coming out in October which should lead to a rise in leading up to this release.  - Adex never went up more than 10x from ICO price and generally major ICOs that see large action reach 20x.. 30x even 100x. For example other coins that had big market ""attention"" such as those at Polo earlier this year saw at least 20x generally or much more.  So I'll just hold out for weeks or months at this point. It's really so low now there is no point in selling since there will at least likely be a rise back over $1.00-$2.00 anyways with news or release.",False

We have been waiting for weeks now and you said it will just take a week. I think the time that you had is more than enough.  We've sent some social bounties after the ICO, but there was a bug with the bounty portal we used and the Twitter API. That's why people haven't received a full reward for their actions during the bounty campaign. Hence, we had to wait while they send us the fixed spreadsheet. They've done it a few days ago.  So, in the 3rd of August, we distributed all missing reward. Nevertheless, I should warn you about the next: 1) the social bounties were always in the absolute amount of ADX, never in stakes. So, you will get as much as the portal shows to you. 2) On the question of the allocation of funds - we didn't distribute all bounties as we keep them for another bounty campaign, particularly for bug bounties. 3) We also should tell, that we've excluded everyone who registered after 7th of July (it's the date when the bounty campaign officially ended).   Thereby, we've coped with all problems and paid all bounties as promised.",False
