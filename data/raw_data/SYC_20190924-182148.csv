SoyCoin (SYC) is the combination of cryptocurrency, green technology, and the real industry. Uniting these technologies we will create one of the stablest coins thanks to the created real assets. And merging with the “Bancor” company will give stable economic development future crypto - economy. The association of these technologies will bring invaluable benefits to all communities. The cryptocurrency industry provides the chance of deeper application of cryptocurrencies in day-to-day life. SoyCoin is the first to offer green technology solution using soybean to fuel a network of mining farms independent of the centralized power supply system. This will undoubtedly lead to strengthening and development of the cryptocurrency industry and its infrastructure.    The goods produced by SoyCoin will be purchased using various cryptocurrencies. This enables small medium enterprises to buy and sell using cryptocurrency for raw materials from SoyCoin production plants as goods for retail stores. This will expand the application of cryptocurrency in everyday life.      The “ASSAR Group” company, the founder of the project is preparing a Crowdsale. The raised funds are planned to be used for the construction of a network of production plants which will be operating with the combination of green and blockchain technologies. The Mining Farms will not require the electric grid, for the electricity will be fully provided by green energy resources. Clients will be able to buy products from the company using SoyCoin (SYC) token.  Release Of Tokens     The total 325 000 000 (three hundred twenty five million) tokens will be released on a blockchain platform of Ethereum, with a basic cost of 1 (one) USD, from which 2 000 000 (two million) at the discounted price of 0,5 USD per token will be implemented in the process of Pre-Sale. For international marketing campaigns as a “bounty” (reward community and advisers) during the Pre-sale and Crowdsale reserved 3 (three) % of the total amount of tokens. Also 17 (seventeen) % token, the project team reserves. Thus on Crowdsale participants will be given an opportunity to get on a blockchain platform of Ethereum 258,000,000 (two hundred fifty-eight million) of tokens at the price from 0,55 USD up to 1 USD in the order described in the section ""SoyCoin – Crowdsale.”  Pre-Sale: 2 000 000 tokens - 0,6% Crowdsale: 258 000 000 tokens - 79,4% Team: 55 250 000 tokens - 17% Bounty: 4 875 000 tokens - 1,5% Advisers: 4 875 000 tokens - 1,5% Total: 325 000 000 tokens - 100%  The Description Of Production     Interest in soy products and other soy by-products continues to a steady growth worldwide. Over the past 50 years, production of soy has grown almost 9 times, and there are over 20 thousand by-products from soy. Soy products include food and non-food industry, medicine and dietary food, as a forage for pets, cattle, pigs, hens, and fish. Moreover, soy is one of the cheapest sources of protein, also important for vitality to keep you healthy. Soy is one of the major crops containing up to 45% of protein, high-quality on amino acid structure, up to 20% of oil and up to 35% of carbohydrates.  Income From Mining Farms     The Mining Farm installation is expected to start approximately in 3 months after the termination of Crowdsale. During the start of the main production plant, it will switch to the biogas network. Before commissioning, approximately 50% of income from Mining Farms will be distributed among participants of Crowdsale (50% will be distributed according to the redeemed tokens (% a ratio) from the total amount of sales), 25% will go to the exchange for repurchase of tokens for the purpose of increase in demand and to granting tokens to owners to get speculative profit, 25% remain at team of the project. Approximate calculation of income from a mining of farms in Table 1:   Development Plan  Our development plan is based on a possibility of one of five scenarios, depending on the volume of the raised funds: •   $25 million – construction 1 plant with a Capacity of 200 tons a day. With Mining on 3000 farms. •   $50 million – construction 2 plants with a Capacity of 200 tons a day. With Mining on 3000 farms. •   $88 million – construction 1 plant with a Capacity of 600 tons a day. With Mining on 5000 - 6000 farms. •   $176 million – construction 2 plants with a Capacity of 600 tons a day. With Mining on 5000 - 6000 farms. •   $264 million – construction 3 plants with a Capacity of 600 tons a day. With Mining on 5000 - 6000 farms. Capacity of the plant 200-600 tons per day is the daily processing of soybean. Depending on the volume of the raised funds sites of the plants will be defined.
