Imagine if the devs created an exchange for Minereum-created coins where we pay 10 MNE to create a coin and 500 to list a coin, and pay our trading and transaction fees in Arte (sort of like how GAS is used to pay for transactions on the ETH network), I could see both coins becoming very popular.

I am new here. Just registered because of the discussion about a bot doing transactions and stuff. I really haven't read ALL of this thread here. BUT....there might be a good possibility that THIEVES invested heavily into MNE and/or ARTE. Background: About a week and a bit ago my MEW got robbed because I ended up on a mimic phising site of MEW. My deposit arrived in wallet and two hours later it got stolen from this address: 0x46F8Cf8424FC6F8f208eF37793650353a9C35f63  There is just the one deposit I made and the withdraw from the thieves. When I followed the money I remember to have stumbled over transactions of the same amounts than posted here in the forum.  If someone has the time and motivation feel free to have a look at the address and follow the money. It might be possible that it are the very same transactions discussed here.  They are stealing up to a million USD worth of coins per day....they spread it literally EVERYWHERE. Tokens and coins I never heard of before.    They also lost money by investing in a scam....which makes me a little bit happy. haha,False

News travels fast and something like this sticks heavily and won't go away that easily. But you can probably dump ART for a couple of cents when it hits some small exchanges.  BTW MNE didn't collapse yet since Dev (aka the big Gen holder) needs to built up his mined pool first before he can start dumping it. Almost all mined coins went into ART so it takes a while to accumulate a substantial amount of new coins to start dumping it. But when it happens it can go down to a couple of cents real fast and there is really nothing you can do about it.  So for the believers, don't waste your time on this thread since a dump is immanent. The procedure for execution has been initialised, it's only a matter when to pull the trigger.",False

See here is the thing with this project, and what makes it brilliant and scary.  It is not really a ""scam"" in the most common form of the word.  A scam would be an operation that takes everyone MNE who contributed to ARTE and never delivers anything promised in return (meaning ARTE tokens), and yes that could still happen.  We literally may never hear from Developer again.  However, that is a low level scam in terms of dollars.  Say we never hear from Dev ever again, hes got 500K MNE right now, and zero market to get value on.  I dont give a shit what Coinmarketcap says the price is for MNE, someone has to be willing to BUY it.  People are not buying up 500K MNE at $1.50.  So if the coins are NOT burned, and again I am not saying they will or wont be, then what is the best way for the developer to make the biggest return on this?  Simply, its by coming through with everything he has said he would do on the tech side.  While people in here are calling scam, there will be A LOT of people who will read these threads and then see the developer back up his claims for the tech side and invest in this project based on updates for future developments.  You have to remember, this is the wild mother fucking west.  Its like panning for gold back in the old days.  If people smell a pump for ARTE/MNE and think they can get a solid 2X, 3X, 5X, 10X, you can damn well sure believe its gonna go up.  Unless developer literally delivers nothing, its in his best interests to make this project work.  He has stacked the playing fields FOR SURE, but there is room for everyone who is invested in ARTE/MNE to get a little taste if he simply delivers on his promises regarding tech.",False

In a nutshell, this is pathetic FUDing hardcore if I've ever seen it at a more-than-opportune time to FUD and stand to gain from the lower prices of pumping and dumping on yet another ICO project leaving many bag-holders in it's wake and people are actually falling for it.

I think the community for MNE and ARTE deserves an extended road-map and the relationship between the two tokens to be elaborated on.  I have always defended the fact that this project is good, yet underdeveloped, but we need to see some focus in 2018 with clear targets and less ambiguity about the direction of the two projects.  Simply stating there's a genesis address exchange and ICO factory is not enough, there should be more specific targets and definitely more marketing prowess, I see nothing about this dev wanting to pursue partnerships with other projects when in fact this will be vital in the coming developments.

I'm afraid however that 1.000 ART won't make you much money. I think ART could go to 10$, but with 1.000ART you'd still only mine about 0.04 of them, which gives you about 40 cents a day (1.000ART = 10MNE = 12$). You'd ofcourse be making profits after 1 month, adding up to about 12$ a month.  Now, in the first quarter of 2018 you'll be able to sell the entire address on a special Artemine platform. If we compare it to selling a business, you should be able to sell it for the gross revenue of 1 year, which is about 12$*12 months, so 144$ or about 0.5ETH.  I recommend you buy some more Art so that you can get a better income. Personally I've bought 10.000 so that, if my prediction comes true and ART gets valued at 10$, I make about 4$ a day, which comes down to about 1440$ a year in passive income.  It's still a question on what the purpose of ART will be for an investor. If it's not gonna do anything it's not gonna be worth 10$, not even 1$.

There is way too less demand for this.  - Somebody swapped a lot of MNE to ARTE --- Yeah so? MNE Genesis addresses were free, nobody really kept track of it as far as I know. Nobody knows if these addresses are the Devs or just some random person. All we know the Devs of ARTE shows every single transaction, without us going to etherscan and checking everything.  - No marketing --- I've seen a banner of the ARTE crowdsale and we've already had some news article, what do you guys want? I don't think marketing is completely free in this day and age. And we all should assume the Devs burn the MNE, this means right now ""the great scam"" was worth about 95ETH. This project heavily relies on YOU - the community. It can be big on itself, but it can be even bigger with your help, like every other token.

Only 500 MNE has been converted since day 1 ended and the last one 6 hours ago. Besides, the MNE converted to ART are already taken off the market no matter if they are burned yet. Under normal circumstances those will not hit the market anymore. I see some huge buy orders on MNE sub 0.0003 so the speculators are waiting for the price to go down < $1 to accumulate a lot of MNE for future gains.  I keep following this ICO with great interest since this provides a good learning opportunity on the dynamics when Alts are subject to donations for ICO's. There is so much speculation going on and so much uncertainty that the market sometimes reacts completely adverse to expectation. It also appears that most investors have no clue in what they are investing, they only see an opportunity for quick gains or the deep desire to hold a genesis account once in their lives. There is also so much kept in the dark like someone holding > 300 inactive genesis accounts on MNE that were all of a sudden released into ART genesis accounts minutes before the day 1 deadline closed. It's 100% sure those addresses belong to one and the same person that now holds the same amount of genesis accounts on both coins. He can start mining both MNE and ART while the MNE investors face the risk that the accumulation of the supply will go much faster now that all those accounts are revealed as active. I have some serious doubts whether the original MNE airdrop was played fair and square when someone managed to acquire so many genesis accounts and kept those inactive for such a long time (May-September). It feels that the investor is always 2 plays behind in the game when there is so much manipulation going on.  Good thing is that MNE is cheap now so who likes to gamble can stack 10k supply and wait for it to triple in value to sell it off, rinse repeat.

By making ICOs in smart contract form, there can not be any more ICO scams.  So the tokens go hand-in-hand. With one you make an ETH token and with the other you make the ICO for it. There is no limited supply as coins are burned so the developer made the ""genesis self mining"" adresses for both coins.

The reason I invested so much money into MNE and ARTE is because the whitepaper was such dogshit that I had to post a series of questions with the dev on the MNE forum about a month ago.  Very very basic questions like why is self mining useful and other issues that should be clearly stated on the WP.  In response I received a very thorough explanation from the developer and the community and the WP was then updated the next day to reflect these questions.  This is very promising to me, this tells me the dev really does give a shit, he just desperately needs to hire some PR/marketing people.  I totally get why people want more details and answers as this is money we're putting up for something we don't quite get.  Sorry if I come across defensive I just don't want to see an avalanche of unjust criticism when it seems like the dev is just really overworked.  If I REALLY REALLY had to guess, I would say the dev understands the clock is ticking and this concept with be cloned with other projects and he wants to get out there FIRST.",False

I've got one question though which is related to the public mining feature coming with Artemine.  Let us assume there are 200k MNE burned in the ICO. Regarding the ARTE supply that is supposed to be around ~315000 ARTE per year as there would be ~864 ARTE mined per day (if I'm not mistaken), I found the following :  When talking about technical aspects on the ARTE public mining, what about the ""call number"" which is supposed to be the same for every user?  Considering the call number that is set to be the same for everyone, the ARTE supply cannot be infinite so everything runs well.  What if the call number appears to be set to the opposite mode?",False

People can say all they want how 'this project is incredible' and 'the devs always deliver', but guess what that's not enough. Every single day a new coin or ICO is born and the ones that make it are the ones that advertise and scream out to the world why we should buy them; they run bounty campaigns, they have paid facebook ads, they write articles, they're active on social media, they communicate, they have pre-ico sales, they provide intrinsic value to their tokens. Minereum/artemine simply don't do any of that. If a coin isn't used or demanded a lot, it's not scarce. If it's not scarce, there's literally no reason for it to gain in value. Again, people say 'oh the value will go to the moon once the mne coins get burned' guess what, the coins aren't in circulation anymore if you buy and hold. We need a ton of people using them, and I don't see how that's gonna happen if barely anyone knows the ICO is even happening tomorrow, and if they don't innovate and provide us with a decent roadmap. I could write their whitepaper in less than an hour, because it's shit. I believe in the products, I just don't believe in the devs anymore to pull it off.

You need ETH miners for the self mining smart contract to work. So it's really not energy/resources efficient, in fact, it's less so than any-other coin that distributes all of their coins at the start. Artemine is really the least eco friendly ETH based token since you constantly need ETH miners for the self mining of the coin. A self mining coin does have it's benefits though, such as incentivising people to hold the coin vs sale it since you can always mine more coins. Not sure if that's a must buy feature though.",False

If everyone dumps MNE for arte and tons of MNE get burned then MNE goes to the moon with news if they keep up with that project.  I assume the dev is making a play here of some sort.

Right now, I'm thinking about joining the ICO.  There are 1 Million+ a few MNE tokens available.  There should be some 15 to 20 % of the MNE tokens not accessible by users who used exchange addresses and forgot to store the privkey and other concerns. Rounding up, there should be a maximum of 800K MNE is available. If all those 800K MNE Is invested into Artemine on September 14, then there are 80K x 1000 ARTE = 80 M ARTE can be the maximum number of tokens to be produced in 63 years. This is the maximum. Many MNE holders don't invest all of their holdings right into the ICO. So, the total could be less at the end of the first day ICO prediction. The final result will be in next year which will end up in huge profit. Patience is the key to mint profit from MNE and ARTE besides the 'cons and concerns' raised by other users. I see more positive outlook than the negligible concerns.  I wish to see your point of view.",False

If developers are only trying to grab your money, why wouldn't they just use ETH? It's hassle-free and pretty straightforward. It'd give them way more money than by selling pumped MNE. Maybe they just feel that they shouldn't leave previous supporters of Minereum with nothing and they try doing something for them? Not out of pure generosity of course but for keeping your allies happy. Another idea is that the new token should be connected somehow to the previous one. The whole world of crypto is a pure speculation. Always. So don't try shaping these accusations just to buy cheap. This FUD is truly annoying.

Day 20:  less than  $21.42.  Day 26: less than $22.50 per MNE  Should not the price rise to buy in with mne be less aggressive than the price rise to buy in with eth over the 5 time periods in order to provide incentive to use MNE?

I think that would be good for the mne community and support price rise which is fair since many mne will be burned, reducing its supply.  I'm curious what people think about this.  Also I'm wondering what type of plans will be to market the ICO.

It takes a while to get a decent company started in order for the ICO to go smoothly. Other than that, we need ART to get properly advertised in order to get as much investors as possible involved. If they would hold the ICO in the middle of september, I doubt a lot of money would flow in, because people simply wouldn't know about it. Possible investors who don't know MNE or ART will only be interested if they can join on the first day of the ICO, otherwise they'll deem it too expensive compared to earlier investors.
