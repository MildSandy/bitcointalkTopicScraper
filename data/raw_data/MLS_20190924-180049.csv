This flexibility, we believe, is going to allow CPROP to scale globally and become the leader for blockchain powered real estate.",False

We employ a membership token model whereby real estate agents and other service providers (e.g. home inspectors, lawyers, etc.) buy our tokens to use our transaction management system. As these tokens are ""spent"", CPROP will burn them, decreasing the overall token supply. In the long-term, as more members join the platform, token supply will decrease and the token price will increase.  Hope this helps. Have a great day.",False

CPROP’s solution helps these parties transact in a more transparent and efficient manner. This gives them more time to do what they do best - find new listing and sell, sell, sell!  For buyers, they’ll love CPROP for it’s ability to provide real-time insights into where they are at in the negotiation or closing process. This reduces a lot of stress and friction normally associated with a property purchase. And they love the security that the blockchain brings to their transactions.  Developers and commercial real estate players have also received our solution with enthusiasm. CPROP plans to address a common industry pain point that often arises when large commercial properties are put up for sale in a competitive tender. In these instances, the bidding process is usually time-constrained with bidders afforded a limited opportunity to perform due diligence. By having blockchain-authenticated documents with information sought by bidders readily available, sellers can eliminate much of the risk in the process and pave the way for higher bids.",False

Smart contract escrows are one important part of CPROP’s solution, but they are just one of the reasons buyers and sellers are going to love us. CPROP’s system provides unprecedented transparency into each step of the transaction so at any time, a buyer, seller, and agents can see what’s been done, what’s left, and who’s holding up the deal.  One of the challenges facing property portals - highly dependent on advertising - is how to diversify their revenue streams. The answer: getting “closer to the transaction”. The problem, however, is that property portals aren’t in the transaction business. As we all know, changing the business you’re in isn’t fast or easy. Well, fortunately for property portals, CPROP does exactly what portals need and we do it well.  CPROP’s transaction management system seamlessly integrates into portals, so after a buyer finds her dream house on a portal, she doesn’t go away. Conversely, she stays in the portal’s system (powered by CPROP’s technology) and as the buyer moves through the transaction, multiple revenue opportunities (previously unavailable to portals) will occur. For example, smart contract escrow fees, membership fees to agents to use the system to process transactions, blockchain authentication, data archival and retrieval, etc.  Hope this helps answer your question. Cheers.",False

For each of our user segments, there are many advantages to using CPROP. I give a brief summary below:  Our value proposition to portals and brokerages (our technology seamlessly integrates into their existing system) is that we provide a convenient way for them to stay with the transaction through the closing thus positioning for multiple, additional revenue opportunities.    For buyers and sellers our transaction management system delivers transparency and efficiency buy giving unprecedented visibility. We leverage the power of blockchain to deliver an unprecedented level of trust and security. Especially for buyers located at a distance or in another country, CPROP is an ideal solution because the product can help buyers access reputation-based service providers located in the jurisdiction in which the property is located while giving visibility into the steps and documentation required to close a transaction even before the process starts.  Real estate brokers and agents can benefit and utilize CPROP’s platform to more efficiently manage the tasks associated with closing deals, and have full visibility across all their transactions, giving them more time for the activities that really drive their revenue – acquiring more clients and listings.  CPROP’s platform is designed to provide all participating service providers with an additional sales channel to become visible to remote/international buyers without having to buy advertising. More effective service providers can leverage their favorable user reviews to further amplify their visibility to potential customers.  Hope this helps answer your question.",False

In commercial buildings you have data everywhere, but its hard to find, and bring together.  It gets lost over time, and therefore when it comes time to buy or sell a commercial building records get lost.  We are working on an idea we call ""Carfax"" for buildings, that uses blockchain to take all this silo'd data, bring it together and make due diligence on commercial buildings easier.

We want to allow real estate agents to have a work flow management system, that keeps the buyer 100 percent informed on the current status of his purchase.  We then will use blockchain tech to provide the smart contracts, recording of deeds, and tracking of documents.",False

These portals exist around the world, and carry properties from their own country/region.  All this data is already available, just not generally accessible to foreign buyers.  So instead of us trying to recreate the MLS or compete with real estate portals.  We believe it is easier to make a plug in for brokers and portals, that allows buyers greater visibility.  This acts as a plus for the buyers, but also allows real estate brokers and portals to have additional traffic to their sites, which will result in additional revenue streams.  For the buyer, having the brokers and portals use our work flow management system, will give them complete visibility on where they stand in the sales process.  Whether they are waiting on a home inspection, or a closing date, all this data can be managed by the real estate agent and sent to them via mobile device.  Finally, including smart contract escrow services, and putting deeds on the blockchain, give the buyer maximum transparency and security.",False

In several ways:  1. We are focused on integrating with currently existing real estate platforms.  Our business model is not to try and ""recreate"" a real estate portfolio but use existing brokers and portals. Trying to recreate the real estate market will take years...if ever.  2.  We are not focused on government adoption.  Government adoption is great. I'm 100 percent for it.  But many governments will take years, some never.  Its too slow to cash. Most governments have no extra money.  So yes I'll put a deed on the blockchain, but not sure how that gets me to revenue.  3. We are focused on what gets us to revenue and profitability. We have done this before.  One of our Cofounders was also a Cofounder in Dotloop, a real estate startup that Zillow (USA largest portal purchased in 2015 for $100m plus).  That software now handles 48% of all residential real estate transactions in the US.  4. Our team has extensive experience in both commercial and residential real estate startups.  Our other two Cofounders (including me) having designed a software solution that is being used by JLL (worlds second largest property manager) for its Asset Managers to help them to more accurately manage their portfolio.  So I believe over the last several years we have been able to identify the pain points in the real estate industry and address them through our offering.  While our offering has a strong [Suspicious link removed]ponent, it also has a strong workflow management system that real estate agents love.  We presented it at the last Inman in New York and we have brokerage houses prepared to beta it for us later this year.   So we are not focused on doing everything.  We are focused on what solutions we can provide that people will adopt and buy.",False

The real estate agents will pay in order to have access to additional business from our platform.  This is normal in real estate today.  I talked to some real estate agents that pay their local portal up to $1600 per MONTH for leads.  So if we can give these real estate agents access to additional buyers, of course they will pay.  Especially a small amount of say $100 per year.  In addition, many other service providers will pay to join the platform like attorneys, home inspectors, etc.  as it gives them access to new business.  The portals will join us, because they already have listings, they make their money on traffic to their site, so the more traffic the more they charge for advertising.  Buyers WE WILL PAY for their feedback in CPROP tokens.  This will incentivize them to leave positive and or negative feedback on service providers.  Escrow fees people will DEFINATELY pay.  As they pay this already, but most of the time don't have the security of the smart contract.  So think of this, would you rather send money to an attorney in a foreign country you don't know, and pay him a fee to act as agent, or pay LESS of a fee and get a smart contract escrow?  We have done extensive research and talked to numerous portals and agents, the model will work.  Hope this helps address your concern.",False

When people join the platform they will need the CPROP token, as well as using the CPROP token for the ESCROW service and payment to buyers for leaving feedback.  All these tokens will have to be purchased directly from the token holders.  The idea is that we form a community that grows over time and thus token becomes more valuable.  Just to use the idea of the company called dotloop that Adam Co-Founded in 2008.  That software platform now handles 48 percent of all transactions in the USA. If we had even 10 percent uptake on our new workflow management software, the tokens will be bought back completely in under 3 years. (of course using issuing price).  The difference I see with this company, is not only are we addressing the USA market, but also the global market.  So I think that there is a huge upside to token holders if you believe we can get adoption by brokerages or portals.  My belief is we can get major adoption of our workflow management system in the USA and abroad using a SAS model.  That would be a huge win, and thats our goal.",False

We attend the Global Portal Show in Thailand a couple weeks ago and had an awesome response from the Portals.  Their main focus this year is ""how to get closer to the transaction"", they are worried that technology will eventually make them obsolete if they don't keep up to date.  So our attendance was timely.  We spoke to over a dozen portals and had an overwhelmingly positive response.  We are targeting a couple of portals in the largest markets.  We had our latest meeting last week with one of them, it was the CEO with 12 team members!  So we are highly excited about moving forward in the process!  We have submitted paperwork to them  that outlines how we would cooperate in integrating CPROP into their offering, and hope for a positive response soonest.
