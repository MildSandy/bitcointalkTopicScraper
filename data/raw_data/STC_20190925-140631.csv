CoinStarter is off to a great start, and we’re busy with the new design, layout and software upgrades of our new platform.  We’re also adding some new social features which will further connect our community. With many of these new changes, we’re moving our launch date to May 21, 2018.   We believe more than ever that the opportunities in the coming year for our ecosystem to grow and flourish are truly unlimited.  We’ve begun searching for new additional talent to help us implement our ongoing business model and our new software initiatives. Yes, we’re hiring!  Shortly after the conclusion of our ICO, we kept our word and launched the STAC on all the exchanges that we initially promised.  It has been only a month since our ICO ended and we will continue to be proactive in listing with more exchanges as opportunities present themselves.  Our goal is to grow STAC as a real utility to serve all our future products and services.  We don't think in the short term but the long game.  So, to update you on our Businefy software, we have over 2000 registered users and growing daily.  Businefy is already a fantastic product, but our goal is to continue developing the software for the business enterprise sector.  We see massive adoption in this area for blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) in the coming years.  We’re super excited about what we can innovate with Businefy.  This space is going to be big!  On another note, over the last few weeks, there’s been a lot of noise and differing opinions in the crypto space.  Because of these news reports, there seems to be a lack of clarity relating to ICOs by regulatory bodies around the world, so we have a full top-down legal analysis underway to make sure all our software products relating to ICOs are compliant.  We’ll make changes to our software if necessary to seek the approval of our legal team.  We’re confident this process won’t hinder our business model but make us stronger.  Now concerning our Roadmap, the dates are always tentative and not absolute.  As a fact, goal dates on a roadmap are a general target and should not be considered definitive.  As a software company, we aim to beat or come close to the date projections we’ve given.  We’re as motivated as anyone to launch our software updates rapidly, as long as it achieves our objectives. We, therefore, are aiming to launch our new platform May 21, 2018.  Please note, that our product development division has already begun and you’ll see some new products when we launch our new platform, and this will continue in the coming year.  After all, we love innovation!  Again, our entire team is committed to executing our vision in 2018 and beyond!   Cheers, Cornell Holloway",False

Quote from: john1010 on January 24, 2018, 01:42:31 AM I've already joined their program since launch, but it's seems very slow in movement.  When we initially “launched” in the summer of 2017 it was a beta to test the market for an interest. When we grew to over 100k members in a month we knew that there was a solid interest. After the initial growth, we worked through the legalities of forming the company. Nothing is built overnight and anything good takes time. Thank you for being with us from the start!
