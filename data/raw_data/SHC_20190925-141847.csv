I have couple of questions about your project.  1. I recently read an article about similar topic - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10916-016-0574-6 and after reading your white paper it is not clear for me how will you store the medical data in your system. In the provided article the authors propose the method to store data in the blockchain cloud as it is makes data immutable and secured. So first question is why don't you consider the blockchain as a storage for data as it sounds quite logical. 2. How re you planning integration with hospitals? As I know there is no common standard and healthcare providers are quite conservative and do nothing without money. What do you think about it?,False

First I should say that storing medical data in a blockchain itself is pointless as amount of data is not limited and continues to grow every day. Also data itself is not the same as for transaction of bitcoins or ethereum. Medical data includes also digital images in DICOM standard such as radiology or computer tomography that can be up to some gigabytes. Storing all this in a blockchain theoretically guarantees that data is immutable but technically there is no such a blockchain nowadays. For storing data there are decentralized database such as IPFS and BigchainDB. In our project we are focusing first on data dynamic integration and not storing that makes our system more flexible. After enabling integration we will start to provide personal storage options to individuals but it will not be blockchain may be some decenrtalized database.  First we plan to engage individuals. We are working on providing as much automated services as possible to them in the first stage of the project. These are definitely clinical decision support systems providing individuals with recommendations. Also basic automation with the usage of smart contracts has high priority. Currently we consider the integration with medical vending machines as a first step. You are absolutely right about doctors' attitude to all innovations in IT but we believe that when they understand that individuals can still bring some profit to them by using preventive healthcare services and doctors can focus on the treatment of people who really need it, then it will optimize monetary flow in hospitals and reduces their load at the same time.",False

Currently people usually visit doctors when they already have problems with their health. Hospitals also face different problems such as lack of resources and information about patients.  Our solution.  We provide dynamic integration process for healthcare data collected directly from person (Peronal Health Records) and differnet hospitals (Electronic Health Records). Data collection is followed by data processing in the context of cross-organizational porcessses with the help of Ethereum smart contracts. Person has a better overview about his current health status and can easily send collected data for anonimous analysis performed by AI that results in different notifications. Also we connect doctors to create personalized guidelines for individuals. Stakeholders interested in anonimous medical data for researches are also part of the eco system and can buy data directly from the individuals. SHT tokens are based on the Ethereum blockchain and are used as internal currency in the eco-system.

Data entered manually by individual 2. Data gathered by iHealth Cloud - https://ihealthlabs.com/ 3. Data analysis with EbMeDS - http://www.ebmeds.org/web/guest/home?  Also we have technical ability to integrate data from central Estonian e-Health Foundation but it is not a part of a current prototype.  We plan to use that prototype as a first step for future development of the final product that includes smart contracts.  A concrete plan depends on the results of ICO that will be launched in February.,False

We plan to launch our solution first in Estonia, but for us the country is not important as we are working with decentralized system where the individual plays main role, not the country, location or specific hospital. From the technical point of view and according to our e-health integration experience the easiest way is Estonia as we can cover the whole amount of digital records that are sent by hospitals to central e-Health Foundation repository. Also as we know, in Russia there are some digitally operating hospitals already and we are ready to communicate with them too. For us, person is important, not the specific data standard or location.  The usage of smart contracts helps to establish trust between different stakeholders involved in the cross-organizational process, so we can integrate different hospitals from different countries, private or not, and different private clouds,  that collect data from different smart devices such as mobile phones or smart scales.  We are open to all integration options as we do not define our own standards. Otherwise, we provide dynamic integration process as described in the conference paper, published in Springer - http://www.springer.com/la/book/9783319697833 and presented n St Petersburg conference, where the paper got ""Best research paper award"" - http://dtgs.ifmo.ru/galery.html?galAlbum=6.  We are not going to put all the medical data (that amount is too big) to the blockchain but we are planing to use it as a transparent method of sharing information in the context of business processes.",False

If health insurance companies get a hold of somebody’s medical data and a problem is identified, they are going to use that to jack up insurance premiums or deny cover completely.  This is a scary, Orwellian idea.  I do not wish you luck.  You need to be destroyed, and nobody should participate in this.  Insurers are already giving people fitbits and Apple Warches, and using the data to adjust insurance premiums.  Idiots think “ooo cool, free Apple Watch”.  Then they spend a year watching TV and playing video game, and the following year their health insurance premium goes up 40%.  Not cool.",False

First, I should repeat again, that we focus on the person, not on the potential users of the data. That means that user can decide what to share and to whom. That's one point.  The other point is that usage of smart contract regulates the behaviour and rules of a contract. In your case, person knows that sharing data can lead to increase of his insurance bills. From one point it is not good for ""idiots"", from the other point it is a good motiviation for people, who would like to start healthy life. I would like to see insurance companies reducing their bills in case people were active and kept their lifestyle healthy. In this case, client receives smaller bill, insurance company reduces risks that it will need to pay some costs to the client related to the health issues. It is better to get more money with small parts that having big bills and risks of obligations.  What do you think about it?",False

Blockchain is p2p technology, so we consider relation between individual and healhcare specialist, instead of patient - doctor. At the first stage individual gets informative overview of his data and ability to rocess it with clinical decision support systems. Second step includes integrating hospital data sources. Individual can share his or her data with seleced otganisation such as hospital that can use this anonimous data in the research.",False
