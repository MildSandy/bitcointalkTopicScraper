ICO WILL BE COMING SOON    Our Bounty thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2136534 Our Casino thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1741336.0  Take a tour around our Casino   Betstreak is committed to take online cryptocurrency gaming to a whole new level by announcing its intention to build a Multi-Coin Platform API (MCPA) that will allow players to use different cryptocurrencies to play across slots, table games, poker and sportsbook.  Launched in August 2016, Betstreak has since grown to become recognized as one of the top 10 casinos listed on AskGamblers. It is the first licensed casino to participate in an Initial Coin Offering crowdsale with ambitions to become the leader in crypto-gaming.  During its first year of operations, Betstreak has 3,500,000 Euro and 1500 BTC wagered on its platform and has gained a profit of over 2150 BTC. Armed with a full suite of games ranging from blackjack, baccarat, slots and live dealer games, Betstreak intends to expand its business beyond fiat and bitcoin gambling to a wide range of cryptocurrencies including its own Betstreak token. Online gambling is poised to grow to 58 Billion USD by 2018. Presently, less than 5% of the market support cryptocurrency as a form of payment. This presents a potentially huge opportunity for all entrants into the crypto-gaming market because of the ability of cryptocurrencies to allow micro-payments and reduce transaction fees.  Having already established itself as a recognized licensed casino with a full fledge working product, Betstreak stands out as one of the few ICOs where investors can invest with a clear understanding of the team ability to deliver their next project and knowledge to run the business properly. Once the MCPA is built, Betstreak players will have a buffet spread of currencies they can choose to use and enjoy a complete gaming experience when Betstreak adds crypto-poker and crypto-sportsbook into their gaming arsenal. This will be the first of its kind in the gaming and crypto space. The Betstreak team believes that its biggest differentiator among the other gambling ICOs is best experienced.  On 1st October 2017, Betstreak will launch its ICO to distribute its Betstreak tokens. The funds raised will go mainly to the bankroll of the casino and platform development. The tokens can be used to play on the Betstreak Multi-Coin Platform API, sold back to the casino as part of a profit-sharing program or traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.   What is the Betstreak ICO about? An Initial Coin Offering is a means of crowdfunding via cryptocurrency. Investors can purchase Betstreak Tokens using 3 prominent cryptocurrencies in the form of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC). During the past 1 year that Betstreak has been operating, Betstreak made a profit of over 2000BTC through the loyal support from Betstreak gamers.  Why should you invest? Betstreak is one of the most well known Bitcoin gambling sites and has been the most profitable betting site with over 2150 Bitcoin and profit in the past 1 year alone. This popularity and profit has been from only four game providers with very little marketing. We are looking to raise investment so we can develop more products including our own crypto currency payment platform and incorporate more game providers, as well as include Bitcoin Sportsbook and Poker platforms. With your help we can market each of these products to grow www.betstreak.co into the leading crypto gambling destination.  How to Buy? To buy BST during the presale period you need to sign up or login to https://ico.betstreak.io and deposit the BTC/ETH/LTC you wish to contribute. Pre-sale will be on the 3rd week of Sept 2017 and will be announced by email. For those who missed out on the presale, you can take parton the actual ICO day itself.  Exchange rate 1 ETH = 1000 BST Hard Cap: 90,000 ETH  ICO Details (Cont) Early backers bonus: Early backers will get a larger percentage of the shares from the crowd-sale meaning they will receive more coins the earlier they contribute.
