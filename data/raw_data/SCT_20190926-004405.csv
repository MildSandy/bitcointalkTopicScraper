And that's because the city managers do not know from where to start and which tools to use. Tools are different and often not mutually compatible.  The Solution We offer a solution to start using the right tools in the right way. Our solution is a platform for Smart Cities, where any city in the world can simply launch its cloud platform with dedicated name, design, options and smart modules to start its own smart environment. The platform will be totaly based on the SCT - Smart City Token.  Why invest in this project? Already in production We have an available product in a huge market (before the ICO start)  Token Usage Our SCT token is a limited utility token for platform operations (more cities = bigger token value)  No similar projects available There are no smart city platforms currenty using the blockchain technology.  Background & Skills Our rich background in the field of smart citiy solutions and huge technology know-how in cloud computing and web applications.",False

But they are not successful in implementation. They are Russian projects. So I don't know what strong points you have that will strive the world of crypto.

I will try to answer your main question.  We have a strong partnership with the city of Rovinj and Pula in Croatia.  Also our strong points are to create a crypto ecosystem in the cities that implement the platform so also the SCT token.  Usage fee of the platform in SCT Citizen rewards for participating in submitting problems and ideas in town All possible payments (garbage collecting / parking / local government fees and charges) in SCT so there will be a circulation of tokens from citizens to government and vice versa Voting via blockchain Signing of local government documents  Ando so on... We have plenty of ideas and a good partnership with the local mayor which wants to implement these ideas and it's in our team. We will post an agenda of smart city events we want to partecipate in 2018 showing our work and ideas.",False
