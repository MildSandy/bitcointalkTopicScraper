Here are the details on the price, bonuses and process for you to get ready for it:  1. PRICE ========  One EMINENT token is USD0.25 each, or its equivalent in ETH. If you choose to pay in ETH, note  that ETH prices go up and down quite a bit, so our system will calculate the ETH price that is equivalent to USD0.25 per EMINENT at the time you’re buying it.  2. Minimum Purchase ============  The minimum amount you can purchase is USD100 or the ETH  equivalent of this amount (the ETH  amount will vary depending on ETH’s  value in USD at the time of your  purchase, it’s about a bit more than  0.2 ETH at the time of writing).   USD100 gets you 400 EMN tokens,  USD500 gets you 2,000 EMN tokens, USD1,000 gets you 4,000 tokens,  and so on. You’ll get bonuses  depending on when you’re buying, as follows (see No.3 below).  3. BONUSES ========  The bonuses are:  1st tier: 10% extra bonus tokens. Ends on 3rd July or 21,875,000 EMNs sold, whichever is earlier  2nd tier: 7% extra bonus tokens. Ends on 9th July or 21,875,000 EMNs  sold, whichever is earlier  3rd tier: 5% extra bonus tokens. Ends on 15th July or 21,875,000 EMNs sold, whichever is earlier  4th tier: 0% extra bonus tokens. Ends on 25th July or 21,875,000 EMNs  sold, whichever is earlier.  Because we’ve increased the bonuses so that you will get more EMNs for the same purchase amount, our hard cap is now USD28,572,155.55.  4. KYC ======  You'll be undergoing a KYC process. This simply means that when you click  on the “Participate” button on ICO day  on our website, you’ll see a form that  you need to fill in with your real  details.  On one of the screens you’ll be asked  to upload a copy of your ID. Our system will automatically process your details.  If you pass, you’ll see a page for you to indicate the amount of EMNs you would like to purchase, and your preferred  payment mode (USD or ETH).  5. Payment =========  Whichever payment mode you prefer, you’ll see instructions on how to pay. Simply follow the instructions strictly,  as soon as possible.  You’ll see our bank account details  (bank into Amazing Appventures Pte. Ltd.’s UOB Bank account in Singapore)  or our ETH Wallet details, depending on your preferred mode of payment.  6. Distribution of purchased EMINENT tokens will be done 2-3 weeks after the end of the ICO ==========================  Once you’ve taken the correct steps, simply wait for the end of the ICO for the EMINENT tokens to be distributed to your ETH wallet.",False
