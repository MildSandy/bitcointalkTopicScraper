In the current digital technology age, most crowd fundraising donations are made to campaigns with an outreach relative to the city/province/country where the campaign is started, almost all personal fundraising campaigns doesn't attract a global influence, we want to change this. Through GivaCoin, we are creating a system where campaign starters has the potential to reach a global audience of donors and where the donors have an incentive beyond helping the need of another.  We believe that we can democratize charity, but we need YOU to kickstart the movement. Thanks to you, we will be able to create a global network of leaders who will use GivaCoin in giving back to their communities and to help people that are desperately in need. Together, we will create a movement that will in the future recognize GivaCoin as a household name and a global leader in online fundraising.
