Any news... well Hereby we’d like to inform you that on December 30th the xChainge crowdsale ended. Unfortunately we did not succeed in reaching the Soft cap of 10,000 ETH as we had intended due to numerous reasons. Obviously our marketing efforts were insufficient to achieve a better result in promoting and explaining our ideas to the blockchain community and attracting enough investments during the auction. Besides we have not got any institutional investor in the project yet. We are really sorry if our ICO’s results fell short of your expectations. You know, they disappointed us too. We assure you that investment you made in the xChainge tokens (sure if you did any) will return to your wallet within several days after December 30th. If you meet any problem in refunding, feel free to get in touch with us in any way convenient to you – directly through that mailbox or any our account in social media. Despite disappointing crowdsale results we would not stop working on the project. In January, 2018, we are scheduling some appointments with blockchain investment fund and moneybags who are able to invest or lend further development of our products. Whether we succeed it would be possible to return to idea of arranging another round of token placement for the community later. As we deeply believe in ideas of free digital financial world and really decentralized crypto exchange we are confident that we’ll get market’s support sooner or later. Thank you for your attention and support to xChainge project.  Sincerely yours, the xChainge team.",False

Thank you for your information!  An exchange platform is composed of three elements: token storage, the exchange operation itself and transaction clearing. In order to be truly decentralized, all of the elements have to be implemented in such way, which is what no one has done before. All the projects at this moment ignore the last part - transaction clearing. It's still done on one or multiple servers under control of one single entity, which means the operations can be compromised, blocked, rolled back, tampered with, fed to a dog, call it whatever - it's still not acceptable and not inherently secure. We are working on making the last piece of the decentralization puzzle in form of Arianda Network, which is specifically designed to do decentralized transaction clearing.  We are also doing our best to develop the most user-friendly interface because we are convinced that a tool with a familiar interface will bring the blockchain world closer to people who are long used to the simplicity and convenience of the classic online banking software.",False

Hi! The xChainge on-chain P2P platform will allow users of the xChainge Wallet to conduct on-chain exchanges of any ERC-20 tokens directly from the wallet. Also, using the xChainge cross-chain P2P platform, xChainge Wallet users will be able to exchange ETH and ERC-20 tokens for any other cryptocurrency. In future the list of cryptocurrencies will be enlarged.        What advantages before other wallets?  1. All of the named solutions are still based on centralized clearing servers, which means they can be taken down by will. This also means that actions and personal data of their users can be affected by the service administrators. Finally, the UI/UX is greatly falling behind modern standards.  2. We are well aware of 0x and Raiden and we're not competing with them, instead our solution is based upon the existing work made by cool people behind these projects.  3. xChainge team is the first team who set out to get rid of the ""servers"" in a traditional way, where they are under control of one single organization.  We are also embedding all the needed cryptocurrency services into a single application. No longer will a user's workflow remind shuffling a deck of cards: wallet - switch - exchange - switch - contract builder - switch - wallet - switch, etc. xChainge puts everything close together within one window.

Our goal is to make the xChainge Wallet a payment center that people will use to make daily transactions with XCH tokens or any cryptoassets that will be supported in the future.  The xChainge Wallet will not charge users for any transfers neither involving ETH, nor any of the ERC-20 tokens. The only expenses the user will face will be Ethereum network transaction fees. Installing the wallet to store cryptoassets is,naturally, free of charge. And how the expenses for infrastructure will be compensated? There can not be anything free in this world ) Someone has to pay.   Sure, there is no free lunch, but xChainge is decentralized, meaning we, as developers, don't own servers, that need to be maintained.  The only expense the system entails is the electricity bill paid by the node owners. But that's totally fine, because these people get paid for keeping their nodes alive.

In standard auction schemes the participants are always under pressure, because of the constantly growing price. However, Dutch auction offers an opposite, more fair approach - the final price of a token at the end of the campaign is the same for everyone. Either the minimum of 0.005 ETH or whatever the price is on December 30th. Even though the price decreases over time, it doesn't mean that early investors will get less tokens for more money - tokens will be distributed according to the final price. Eventually it's up to the investor to decide how much he values the token, so feel free to invest at any time and wait to see what does the market think of the project - you probably will get more tokens than you expected.

Aktivo was a success, attracting about $20M to three lots in less than two years of operation. Thinking of improvements to Aktivo, we started gravitating towards blockchain and eventually came up with an idea of a tokenized fund with non-volatile security tokens to support the investments. This fund was expected to be a hedge investment tool for crypto-investors who are tired of high volatility of crypto currency market.  https://medium.com/@xchainge.io/the-story-of-a-totally-decentralized-crypto-exchange-part-one-6dd4c34750c1",False

Which is good, and you may call such solutions decentralized. But a complete exchange platform actually has three elements: storage, the exchange operation and transaction clearing. In order to be truly decentralized, all of the elements have implemented in such way, which is what no one has done before. All the projects at this moment ignore the last part - transaction clearing. It's still done on one or multiple servers under control of one single entity, which means the operations can be compromised, blocked, rolled back, tampered with, fed to a dog, call it whatever - it's still not acceptable and not inherently secure. We are working on making the last piece of the decentralization puzzle in form of Arianda Network, which is specifically designed to do decentralized transaction clearing.  A long-time blockchain enthusiast may cope with the interface of EtherDelta, but try explaining how to use it to your former not-so-wise classmate Joey. If we, as a community, want more people in the cryptocurrency world, we desperately need a solution which is accessible and familiar to anyone. Joey doesn't need to know how an engine works to drive a fancy car, and neither he has to know how cryptocurrencies work to use them.  The time has come.",False

Decentralization improves robustness against random errors, as well as against attacks and collusion attempts by individual participants Removal of intermediary parties helps to significantly simplify and speed up interactions between users.",False

However, Dutch auction offers an opposite, more fair approach - the final price of a token at the end of the campaign is the same for everyone. Either the minimum of 0.005 ETH or whatever the price is on December 30th. Even though the price decreases over time, it doesn't mean that early investors will get less tokens for more money - tokens will be distributed according to the final price. Eventually it's up to the investor to decide how much he values the token, so feel free to invest at any time and wait to see what does the market think of the project - you probably will get more tokens than you expected.",False

All of the named solutions are still based on centralized clearing servers, which means they can be taken down by will.

We are well aware of 0x and Raiden and we're not competing with them, instead our solution is based upon the existing work made by cool people behind these projects.  3. xChainge team is the first team who set out to get rid of the ""servers"" in a traditional way, where they are under control of one single organization.  We are also embedding all the needed cryptocurrency services into a single application. No longer will a user's workflow remind shuffling a deck of cards: wallet - switch - exchange - switch - contract builder - switch - wallet - switch, etc. xChainge puts everything close together within one window.
