And will be listed this month in several other exchanges. However, it is not traded yet (token locked), as the crypto market went down drastically.  We believe that tokens that are used by the people can increase in value. Tokens that are created for speculation will die very fast.  That is why Welltrado team is releasing the first version of the dashboard to manage investments across multiple crypto and P2P investment platforms and then will unlock the tokens.

However the quality of borrowers has been very good for many years. The platforms know that defauts are the single largest threat to their business, so they avoid risky loans.   The problem in the P2P lending industry is not the quality of borrowers.

Because only 19% of the loans emerging on the platforms are even succesfully funded.

Welltrado is a marketplace with over 100 merchants that brings with them over 10 million loans, for you to choose from. Some of those loans will be backed with collateral. Some not. You have the power to decide what you want to invest in.  The Welltrado token represent our platform as a whole. If you lock it you will get part of our revenue. Which will tick into your account instantly. This revenue can be used to buy new loans or pay fees associated with bein part of the P2P lending fund (if that is what you have chosen).

I think your concept might work out even without tokenization.  Why have u decided to use it?  The concept will work without tokenization. It sure as hell is supposed to. We make no secret of the point that this idea is supposed to work with crypto and without. This is real world product, and thus we are not reducing it to be a crypto-only solution.  The reason we are doing an ICO and not another type of fundraising is based on a pretty simple observation actually. We could do another type of fundraising - heck. Our competitors are doing just that - with succes. But this is basically a question leverage. The p2p lending industry desperately needs new investors. Investors who wants something stable, but high yield, are not extremely conservative... and most importantly not afraid of new technology.  With an ICO Welltrado will bring in a huge amount as investors aswell as just money. This gives us a huge negotiation advantage, which is quite simply needed for the market to adjust. Which is also why we will succeed where the others will fail. We will already have an investor base, and thus be much much more interesting for the P2P lending platforms. Because make no mistake. When you disrupt an industry, it requires change from all sides.  Secondary. And this is on me, and not the Welltrado team. I really believe that crypto needs more stable asset classes. Stocks aren't stable. It's cool that crypto is so volatile, gains and all. But a portfolio needs better and more stable asset classes aswell... honestly I don't think that crypto has been very good on viable alternatives. That's why I believe Welltrado is going to fill that hole.   Quote from: martbruce on March 10, 2018, 12:08:42 PM Hello.

The largest is US based, and is only targeted towards institutional/whales in the US market The only EU based competitor that we know of, is UK only.  Being UK only offers some advantages, such as being able to navigate UK FCA tax wrapper advantages etc. But we believe this is a non-issue.

Quote from: foreverman on March 11, 2018, 09:13:47 AM Hey. Initially, your platform was focused on European market. Why did you decide to change the vector?   Well. For starters it was never focused on the ""european market"" as anything as a starting point. However from a regulatory standpoint it makes sense for us start here. Asia and Africa are very interesting to us, because the banks aren't very strongly represented in these areas. There are p2p platforms in this geographic, with good gains and success ratio - but aren't getting funded because banks don't give a shit.

No. No ... and No. This industry is about trust. We will not in any way give access to a platform which has shitty practices - just because we can. That is exactly the opposite of what is needed.

But most of it will come from very traditionally based platforms. Looking at it now, that certainly is the case. When we say blockchain it isn't for ""fun"" It is basically because we believe that a trustless method of rating all these ""platforms"" are essential to the growth of the industry. Because while blockchain can be used to many many things, it is especially needed in sectors like the P2P lending industry, where trust is the thing blocking popular demand.  The P2P lending platforms/industry are not idiots. They know this. So the people actually leveraging the blockchain in this manner will get the spoils. However no one is to say that we won't get a horde of copycats. That's for sure. But as long as we stay loyal to our investors, have the best service - we are confident in our product. ",True

However we are fully comitted to be a part of that process. We already have a few cryptocurrency brokers lined up. We imagine we will grow together on that, because obviously some of the safeguards already in place in the FIAT world is non-existent in the cryptoworld. For better and for worse. We also have major goal, to introduce crypto to the many FIAT investors who will be on the platform aswell.  Quote from: Cenil on March 09, 2018, 04:24:54 PM how long does the Loan take effect? is there any other convenience offered in this loan to make it easier?  We are not a loan broker. The many many P2P lending platforms that we are gathering into our platform are. That being said the whole point of P2P lending platforms, and the financial technology that they built upon, is to cut out middlemen and be quite fast. This is ofcourse very dependent on the kind of loan you want to make.   Quote from: Veecker on March 09, 2018, 05:49:01 PM If the platform decides to leave yr platform for some reason, will the user who invested n it get the dividends anyway?  YES. Technically they will have an account at the platform already in one form or another.  So depending on what we agree on, you would just have to login on the leaving platform directly from their website.   Quote from: gazman on March 09, 2018, 07:26:10 PM Good afternoon.

We are connecting many many P2P lending platforms, that have their own return rates based on the type of investments+risk.  The P2P lending market is a huge space, offering many different products ranging from fast consumer loans to mortgage loans. Now this 35% returns example is based on a portfolio of mortgage loans. You would actually be able to find loans with even higher return rates. Sometimes as high as 50% in annual returns. However we will always recommend a healthy mix of high-risk and more conservative options for our investors.  So it actually the portfolio mix YOU as investor makes - that defines the return rate. Our toolset will oufcourse feature loan automation on specific criteria etc.  ---  Now if you are not overly interested in building your own portfolio and balancing it out. We also have the oppertunity to be part of our P2P lending fund. On this you choose the risk profile, and we manage the investments for you.

If you deposit into our P2P crypto fund. Yes. You decide your risk profile and we do the rest. However if you want to unleash the real power of our toolset - you remove the middle-man and become your own bank. What I mean by this is that you make your loan criterias as investor, and decide what loans to invest in. This can be very automated by you setting certain criteria, you can follow experts, and copy their loans.  etc.   Quote from: g8stTDas on March 07, 2018, 06:06:03 PM Can a creditor whom I’ve entrusted my funds use them without my contest? Let’s say, I’ve prohibited providing loans to North Korea, but he’s trying to do it.  Well since the P2P lending platforms offer up their loans, and let you select which you want to invest in yourself - you have the control. Now sitting there and handpicking loans, is not really very effective. So we build a range of tools to let you select which types of loans YOU want to invest in. What countries they can come from, what interest rates, and so on.   Quote from: waitsummer on March 07, 2018, 07:52:04 PM Hey. Will it be possible to use your platform for giving loans in fiat? You know, cryptocurrencies are just getting popular.  It is not possible to give loans. We are not a loan platform. All the p2p lending platforms operate in FIAT. For more information - please do read the whitepaper: https://www.welltrado.io/static/docs/Welltrado-Whitepaper.pdf     Quote from: bars_kz on March 07, 2018, 09:27:05 PM Is your platform focused on consumer credits or will enterprises be able to get them, too?  We strive to have many different loan types on our platform. This includes: P2P Consumer Lending, P2P Business Lending , Invoice Trading, Equity-based Crowdfunding, Real Estate Crowdfunding and many other types of loans. Our plan is start with letting in regular (retail) investors in, but later in a year or so - give access to larger institutional investors.   Quote from: rdizza on March 07, 2018, 10:57:07 PM Good afternoon. I’d like to invest in lending with the help of credit cards ‘cause I believe that this option is the most reliable one.  The P2P lending asset class is similar to insecured credit card debt. A robust asset class where net default rates, has never surpassed the actual growth interest rates(US) in the last 20 years.

We are a marketplace, that is gathering all the P2P lending platforms and their 10 mln. loans - into a single platform.  It is the P2P lending platforms who are responsible for checking the borrower data. They do the underwriting on the loans, check the loan tapes etc. If they feel the loan adhere to their standard, they will make it available on both their own and our platform. Depending on the deal we strike, Welltrado will always work on getting priority access to the loans - so that they appear first at our platform.  The problem in the P2P lending industry is not the quality of borrowers. Looking at industry numbers, about 75% of potential borrowers, are being discarded because the to not live up to the set standards. Why? Because only 19% of the loans emerging on the platforms are even succesfully funded. There IS not enough investors, even though the loans are perfectly fine - and it is stopping growth, and giving us in crypto a great chance to get good return rates on a very stable and safe asset class.  Now, a huge other problem we are solving - and related to the question you ask: Who are checking the P2P platforms themselves? Nobody is. Who is to say that their claim of ""0%"" default rates XX platform claim - are in fact true claims? It is not validated by a third party. This perhaps is the single biggest obstacle to growth and maturity in the industry.  That is why Welltrado is pulling all the loans to our platform. Then we as a third party, has a chance to rate and evaluate how good the P2P platforms are actually performing. This will increase trust tenfold, draw big and small investors alike. Because reliable data is paramount to taking informed investment decisions.",True

This made a gap in the credit market, allowing new contenders for the first time in hundreds of years. Among the disrupters we find the p2p lending platforms. Peer-to-peer lending is a  method of financing that allows people to borrow and lend money without a financial institution. Harnessing technology and big data, P2P platforms connect borrowers to investors faster and cheaper than any bank.  -- Verification time: Verification time for you as an investor is about two days. We naturally are required to do regular KYC, like any other actor in the market. The key here is that you don't need to do it more than once. Most of the investors in p2p lending market, are diversifying their money across different platforms. They do that to minimize risk, but also because the p2p lending platforms often specialize in a certain type of asset. Some only have personal loans, others only mortgage etc.  Problem here is that the management of perhaps 7+ platforms, get increasingly time consuming, and you risk losing the overview of what is going on with your investments. Also just signing up for 7+ platforms, who has their own independent KYC, own interface and own systems - is just a real hassle. Many normal/retail investors end up just investing in a single platform, to avoid all this. But that is a risky proposition(All eggs in one basket). But you also often will not get the best ""bang for your buck"", in terms of interest rates.",True

So just to be clear. The p2p lending business is huge and is in no way limited to ""consumer lending"" at all. Mortgage loans, Invoice financing, business loans etc. is also a really big part of the space.  Now this ""shady broker"" scenario, is actually a very legitimate question. It is exactly one of the reasons why we built Welltrado. Because as it works now,  the P2P lending platforms takes the loans themselves, does the rating themselves and puts out their own statistics. Welltrado will keep track of all the loan-data generated through our platform, and thus be able to remove bad seeds.  However we are not cooperating with shady P2P lending platforms. We have no reason to do so. There is loads of legitimate platforms outthere, with proven track records who wants to be a part of the project. Why - Well the situation in the P2P lending industry is that the demand for investors is huge. As an example - let's take ""consumer lending/personal loans"". Right now, on average the platforms weed out 3/4 of the loan originators, due to bad credit scores and various other criteria... of the 1/4 that actually make it on the platform - only 19% succeeds in funding. There is simply not enough investors, even to perfectly sound, stable loans with interests hovering around 15-20% in the consumer lending sector. (higher rates can be found in ex. mortgage loans)  Why is this happening? Well that is for another post. If you guys are interested, I'll write it. Else check out: www.welltrado.io Much is explained there.  Hope that you guys, are signing up - and see ya on the telegram.  Kim - Co-founder. (absolute forum beginner)",True
