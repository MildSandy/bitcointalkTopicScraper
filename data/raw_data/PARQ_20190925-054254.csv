Please direct any doubt or questions to our Telegram channel  According to a 2017 UK study titled “Tackling Pollution and Congestion” by Professor David Begg and Claire Haigh, congestion has been steadily rising in all major UK cities. When congestion occurs, tailpipe emissions are four times higher than when the traffic flows smoothly. Congestion leads to slower driving speeds, which in turn has been tied to an increase of toxic emissions and serious health issues  Who is Parksen?  Parksen is building a Green, Smart and Connected City Platform - powered by the Ethereum blockchain, immutable smart contracts and a real-time parking app - that will bring innovation to modern and urban hotspots around the world.  The Parksen Parking app has been functional in the Netherlands, and was chosen to be the most affordable option by the Dutch Consumer Association in 2017.  Our mission is enriching and connecting these metropolises with truly green soltions, smart and IoT device integrations, which will cause huge cost reductions and general infrastructural optimization for citizens and municipalities alike. By using blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, municipalities, parking garages and companies will be able to purchase and integran new system and hardware upgrades from our partners.    Parksen is Green  Large cities across the globe are dealing with ever-increasing levels of congestion and harmful emissions. Traffic is coming to a halt, and citizens are paying for it economically, physically and emotionally. For instance: on average, frustrated drivers in the UK spend over 44 hours a year per driver trying to find proper parking, with yearly costs running up to $33 billion in total. UK citizens are also 64 times more likely to die of air pollution than drivers in Sweden – and twice as often as their American counterparts.  Parksen is Smart  Despite a recent surge in technological advancements, cities and companies still struggle with outdated hard- and software systems. The number of available parking spots displayed is often inaccurate, while maintenance personnel identifying problems in a timely fashion and on-street parking availability is predominantly unknown. These elements all contribute to congestion. Drivers don’t know where to go and end up spending way too much time searching for a spot, while those that offer parking see many spaces go unused, wasting everyone’s time and money.  Parksen is Connected  Governments are notoriously skeptical of technological innovation. Bureaucracy stands in the way of progress, that’s a tale as old as time, but this doesn’t mean we should strive to always go around it. We all share the planet, we all live in the same cities. Cooperation between governments, companies, and consumers is not only good, it is absolutely necessary.  The Parksen team  Our team is full of tech-savy veterans, transportation industry professionals, urban and sustainable city planners, IT-professionals with a background in Dutch Ministries of Defense and Justice, and season and tech-oriented Marketing Personnel and forward-thinking developers.  Eddie Postma. CEO and Founder. As a veteran project manager and fearless internet entrepeneur, Eddie has been building and maintaining enterprises for nearly three decades. With experiences varying from online magazines and video production companies to the Parksen Parking app and PARQ, Eddie tackles each of his projects with unlimited energy and dedication.  Paul Heath. Chief Security Officer. Our very own Certified Ethical Hacker, Paul Heath, worked for the Dutch Ministry of Justice as a Migration Specialist before becoming a Senior Developer at the Ministry of Defense. From there he moved on to the Parking industry and Amsterdam municipality as a Senior Technical Consultant, before finally landing at KPN, one of the largest telecom companies in the Netherlands, as a Solutions Architect.  Arjan Douwes. Senior developer. Arjan is our All-Star developers, which isn't that surprising considering his lengthy resume which includes several gigs at Parking Providers, Airports and a whopping six years tenure where he worked on a Parking Platform for the city of Amsterdam. He is a highly skilled developer who loves to keep up with the latest technological innovations.  Massimo Bensi. Senior developer. An exceptionally experienced Azure Solution Architect and Developer from Italy, Massimo joined Parksen to assist in the creation of our Smart, Green and Connected City Platform. His experience as Senior Software Developer at a rivaling parking app makes him a perfect fit, and so does his experience working on blockchain and smart contract development.  Roy van Pamelen. Urban Development Specialist. As our very own City Planning Expert, Roy is quite literally the man with the plan, if you will. For over a good decade, he has been involved with numerous sustainable and urban renewal projects in the Netherlands. Driven by the desire to bring green solutions to large cities, he is a crucial part of our team.  Check our website to meet the rest of our team!
