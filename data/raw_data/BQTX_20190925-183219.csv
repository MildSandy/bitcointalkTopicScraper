Just like selling covered option calls/puts on stock market – BQT allows traders to acquire more crypto for short term (up to 30 days) without selling their own crypto.  BQT works as combination of Option-Margin-Auction in each trade.  Trader Peers can dictate/negotiate the conditions of each trade and post it for an “auction” against other peer traders to compete against the multiple offers.  This makes an honest market dealings for traders and fixes significant fees for the company revenue model.  So if I have 1BTC I can place 20% premium hedge offer on exchange (1.2 BTC) to ask community to give me 1BTC worth of ETH for 30 days.  I will be receiving competing offers lowering my premium “say to 10%” and upon accepting it would place 1.1BTC into escrow (which is stored by BQT in cold wallet during the escrow period) and immediately receive 1BTC worth of ETH from peer trader.  For providing the premium I now have an option (any time during the hedge period) to either return ETH (with premium) or give up the escrow – so I can play with 2 crypto assets and if say ETH goes up 40% (as we saw recently) I would simply give up the escrow with premium and keep my gains on ETH.  This is a very unique concept!!  https://vimeo.com/280874044  - shows it in more details.  Let me highlights important benefits:   1. All trader wallets are decentralized and controlled by peer traders 2. Escrow is guaranteed by the company and is securely stored. 3. BQTX tokens are utilized for escrow fees (with 50% discount) 4. Company is to allocate 30% of escrow fees revenues to buy back BQTX from or traders (and other exchanges) every quarter and burn them (therefore reducing BQTX inventory which impacts the value of a token).  This is much better alternative vs security dividend paying tokens. 5. Company also would share 20% of escrow fees / revenues quarterly with 10% most active traders following our proprietary algorithm.  This would benefit utilization of the platform.  In addition, we are to announce affiliate program to invite traders and benefit affiliate on revenue share from future trades generated by new users.      This process creates a very transparent system for traders to leverage their crypto holdings and increase their portfolio without risks of system manipulation and in secure manner.""",False

I think differences will be subtle and perhaps not so hugely different from others. It is a massive growing market and I think new entrants need to have some decent capital funding to enter the market with some success. Existing exchanges have the advantage of having been able to build on their existing code as they earned. There will be room for new companies. For comparison - How uniquely different are forex companies ? I think their success usually is based on confidence, trust, accessibility, marketing and reliability of giving the same day to day services.  Binance started out with an ICO and grew very quickly into a market leader. I don't think anyone expected quite such a rapid growth.  But as the crypto world evolves - Exchanges need to: Be secure Have good code Easy to use platform Ability to operate BOTs & auto trades Fast trade engine Have good hot wallet and cold wallet practices. Have good governance Have a good legal structure Be located in a good jurisdiction suitable for crypto. Be located in a country with a good legal system that can handle legal disputes Be located in a country where authorities provide some oversight to protect investors (without killing the innovation).

I as you can imagine travel quite a bit and see how much wider crypto is utilized around the world... just recently in Barcelona I walked into Audi dealership and could buy a 100k$ car with bitcoin.  That's besides ""we accept bitcoins"" signs over 50% of small shops I randomly visited.  But it is what it is... and laws are very strict and require multi state licenses.  As P2P exchange we could just as Localbitcoin take a position of entering US market right away and point all regulatory risks to our users. We decided to launch in EMEA and APAC market first while continuing to lobby for legislatures (with other players) and acquire proper state licenses in US.  I can promise you however that we are not putting it into long basket.  Our goal is to beat expectations of our road map projections as US market is most important initiative for the company.  But we will enter it after all beta related ""bugs"" and unexpected issues are mostly out of the way.  I very much on board and always fighting to advocate the importance of Blockchain and crypto  in effort to tremendously advance progress of technology innovations.  I speak about it on conferences and very vocal on thr subject regulators.  US is behind but lots of $$ been put into crypto projects by prominent VCs and PE firms... it is inevitable that rapid utilization of crypto technologies on Blockchain networks would be hitting US soon. Especially as ALL major banks and financial institutions spending billions of dollars to integrate Blockchain and crypto into their operations.

Almost dead only with few spammy answers.  I think this should be adjusted and links added all over social media and ICO page. Good visibility is the key. BTT forum is so crowded that an Announcement thread is visible on the first page of the subforum only for few minutes or even seconds. Real people and discussion are needed to attract investors. I am an investor and when I evaluate an ICO I always look for ann thread full of people and valuable discussion. In such a thread I search for information and answers to my questions.  Not everybody is using Telegram.,False
