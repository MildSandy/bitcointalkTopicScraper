E-commerce is driven by a wide range of payment methods that best suit the diverse preferences of consumers, the options that define each transaction, and the general attributes of the product or service. However, the commonality of these methods is the existence of a trusted third party gateway, which handles the facilitation of payment within the transaction. Until recently, there a widely-available equivalent to cash in E-commerce did not exist, even though the need for a sort of electronic money was obvious - especially in the areas of micropayments. This inefficiency was highlighted in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym for an individual or group of programmers) in a white paper entitled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”. The paper suggested a mechanism based on peer-to-peer networking, through which a payment system could eliminate financial intermediaries and allow users to make direct and relatively anonymous transactions via the Internet (Polasik et al., 2015).",False

However, after spending about 2 hours to read your project, I have some questions for you: 1. Your WP keeps repeating that ""Since 2015, Blockonomics has helped thousands of E-commerce sites increase sales by including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other major altcoins as a payment option for their customers."" but you did NOT give your readers any examples, such as: which sites, how much money has been increased, what exactly did you help, etc. Moreover, your road map does NOT point out your help since 2015 because it starts from Sept 2018. So, tell me as detailed as possible 2. In June 2019, you are planning to support Lightning Network integration for users with aims to reduce payment fee. Well, as you can see, one of the biggest concern of users is that the security because they have to use off-chain transactions. What's your solution in this case and how different it is from current method and your competitors? 3. According to Alexa.com, your site is hosted in Boardman, Oregon, 97818, United States and your traffic is mostly from USA and India. Also, your WP states that ""The Company registered office and address for service can be found on our website."" but I can't find the information in you site. In short, where are your office location and why do you have 700 daily visitors but you seem to be brand new to investors?  Regards",False

Our merchants page has detail on this. The customer websites/testimonials can be found on the below links https://blog.blockonomics.co/accepting-bitcoin-payments-how-it-has-helped-merchants-a7cf1e6e3ee2 https://blog.blockonomics.co/whmcs-sites-accepting-bitcoin-payments-great-idea-d80191ed8a6 We have already been operational since 2015. You can see our progress on this thread.  2. Lightning network is still in beta. Our dedicated node will have channels open to all major lightning nodes. Our merchants can accept lightning payments using this. Problem with lightning network is not security. The off chain transactions themselves are secure. A lightning node can watch the network for fraud and has locktime mechanisms to stop double spends  3. We are not brand new ... as I said we have been around since 2015. Lots of people in bitcoin community know about us. This ICO is a recent development. Here is our company address,False
