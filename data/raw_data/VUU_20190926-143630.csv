ICO Summary | Whitepaper  Current BONUS:10% until May 28th!!  CLICK TO PURCHASE VUU TOKENS!  Private sale investors: We are still open for Private Placements and Strategic Investments. Please PM us.  LIMITED TIME BOUNTY: $1,000USD of VUU Tokens for HONEST Reviews (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3930624.0)  What Is Vuulr?  Vuulr is a Blockchain for the Film & TV Industry. We are building the World's Largest Marketplace for Film & TV Content!  Vuulr (pronounced View-ler) is building an infrastructure for the US$240b film & TV content industry; the largest global content rights marketplace supported by a digital supply chain built on blockchain. We are here to transform the way the industry operates by bringing buyers and sellers from discovery to delivery from the current 4 - 5 months to under 24 hours.  Vuulr is the FIRST EVER ICO on Quoine’s JFSA-licensed Qryptos ICO Mission Control platform!  What Problem Are We Trying To Solve? The global Film & TV content industry still does business the old fashioned way. We are here to bring it into the digital age.  •   This industry is valued at US$240b but trading of rights still takes 4 - 5 months. There’s a lack of transparency for both buyers & sellers as the channels are monopolised by key middlemen who take 30 - 40% commission of the transaction! •   A few of the reasons why it takes so long, is because many of these processes are still manual, managed by excel spreadsheets and the same information is being reworked over and over again across the globe; duplicated with errors. A coherent supply chain ceases to exist due to the lack of standard specifications. •   There's no central metadata refinery that buyers can quickly access and tap on. One of the key reasons is also because the industry experiences stiff competition and feels huge conflicts of interest.  This inefficiency presents an exciting opportunity for VUULR to develop a Blockchain-based solution to reinvent how the industry operates.  Endorsements This is a real problem and we have a real solution. No wonder we have received endorsements from current and former execs from the likes of BBC, IMG Media and Disney!  The VUU Token We have spent months obsessing over and planning our token economy. We hope to address token velocity problems plagueing crypto, while also giving all our investors a reason to HODL VUU!  VUU tokens will be used to: •   Denominate & settle transactions •   Pay fees & subscriptions for using Vuulr services •   Power the Vuulr rewards program: we will purchase tokens from the market using profits and redistribute those as rewards to those parking our tokens  Exchanges Vuulr will list on Quoine’s Qryptos platform shortly after ICO completion ensuring liquidity.
