By hooking clients’ data to the gene-chain, they will expose that meta-data (when they wish to) and compress their data in clouds or silos using our proprietary compression solutions.

Sequencing.com  https://enterprise.microsoft.com/en-us/industries/health/genomics/partners/  My take: These guys are already Microsoft partners and take data from the likes of 23andMe, Ancestry.com and the like and allow you to analyze it with apps provided by Sequencing themselves. It appears from the press release that Ancestry will be integrating the Encrypgen token directly onto their ecosystem. This could position Encrypgen as the DNA industry standard exchange token.  ""That is the central goal of the partnership between Microsoft and Sequencing.com, a platform that allows users to store, analyze and share their genetic information. Simply put, the platform enables individuals to upload their genetic information — generated via Helix, 23andMe, Veritas, Ancestry.com, National Geographic, HLI or any other source — to Sequencing.com and use their personal information in health and wellness powered by Microsoft's cloud.""  2. Genomics Personalized Health  https://genomicspersonalizedhealth.com/  My take: These guys are into the more higher end full genome sequencing whereas 23andMe are more into looking at specific parts of your DNA. Personally for me this is what I was waiting for as it opens up the gateway to paying a little more $$$ to have my full DNA analyzed and assessed. Again my assumption is that the partnership will allow for this data to be directly uploaded via the Encrypgen Token from GPH.",False

Healthcare productivity has not increased with the rest of the economy. As we live longer, with more chronic disease, this is wreaking havoc on family, and even national, budgets worldwide. DNA-based medicine allows for more targeted spending on health according to each individual’s risk assessment or treatment, while improving benefits, which is much more efficient. Unfortunately, the open sharing of our personal data is unsafe, for example, leading to discrimination for insurance or employment. Even for very ill patients willing to forego privacy concerns, data is close to impossible to use because it is fragmented and out of our hands with doctors, researchers, and personal DNA companies. Until now...  Two software companies that are currently defining the new field of Cryptogenomics, Encrypgen and DNAVID, share a vision of an efficient health economy centered around each one of us, safely and fairly.  DNAVID is developing a social network that the user owns and benefits from. The network issues its own money — DNACoin — to reward those that help improve it. For example, users are paid DNACoin to enter their DNA and medical information for anonymous use. Then, they decide how their data can be used and how to spend their DNACoin. For example, anyone can sponsor research with their DNACoin, or they can earn DNACoin by allowing the use of their info by drug companies. A set amount will be sold to drug companies wishing to use the network for their research with consenting individuals. Eventually, DNACoin can be sold in exchange for money.  “Because we all are genetically connected, we all benefit from the information in each other’s genome. So it is in the interest of every one of us to have a universal pooled DNA resource, the bigger the (much) better. With user-friendly software that is trusted and safe, we will start to see the parabolic network effects as more people start joining and sharing. This then will translate into higher value of the network which will cause the appreciation of DNACoin. This in turn generates a virtuous economic cycle contrary to the current downward spiral in healthcare.” said David Weiss, Founder of DNA\/ID, the EU-based startup that develops the open source DNA social network https://dnavid.com and mints the DNACoin cryptocurrency that is the basis of its economy. A former PhD bioinformatician, bioengineer by training, big data scientist and programmer, Weiss founded InSilico Genomics SA, creator of one of the largest repositories of genetic information for biologists InSilico DB https://www.insilicodb.com, and the personal DNA service GenePlaza https://geneplaza.com.  “This partnership affords the opportunity to accelerate the path-to-market for our complementary offerings if we can guarantee the security and the traceability of transactions, and the easy query of our user’s data with Encrypgen’s unique blockchain solutions. We have a shot at helping to solve this big problem rather quickly.” he added.  Encrypgen provides the other half of the solution, which is to keep DNA data safe and private using an un-hackable registry of transactions (a ""blockchain""). The technology enforces user’s wishes, by allowing access only according to specific permissions, or to record every access, etc.  The software's specialization in DNA results in efficient query and transmission of DNA or chunks of DNA in a compliant manner. Encrypgen has its own economic token Gene-Chain Coin which is the currency for transactions of data over their Gene-Chain. Gene-Chain Coin is currently conducting a successful token sale to help fund expansion of their Gene-Chain network .  “We share a vision of improving the role of genomic data in improving personal health, and in empowering each of us in the curation of our own data. It will be an interesting experiment to see how the DNACoin and Gene-Chain Coin economies interact and we expect that the synergies between these currencies will benefit both individuals and the market for scientific data, as well as help us achieve the promises of personalized medicine.” concludes David Koepsell, Encrypgen’s CEO and Founder. Together, these technologies promise to provide a safe and productive fresh start for human health.",False

After reading the whitepaper, they have made strong assertions which are categorically false. For example, they have suggested that intelligence and personality are directly attributable to genetics with no effect by or consideration of environmental contributions (see the many twin studies on this very topic). Any second year undergrad biology student knows that this is completely false. However, when I brought this up in their slack, I was provided a link with a paper authored by the founders which did not corroborate this assertion.  When I brought this up again in their slack, a fellow named michael messaged me saying that he had ample evidence that intelligence is determined by genetics, removed the messages I had posted and then banned me.  If the authors can't take criticism and cannot provide evidence which clearly corroborates their findings, then it suggests that this is a fly by night operation not worth of investment. Given that there are literally thousands of ICOs available to chose from, there is no reason to pick one in which the authors are clearly uneducated about this topic and who chose to ban skeptics rather than engage them. If the authors cannot get second year undergrad biology straight, what else have they screwed up? Honestly I would have just closed slack and moved on but after being banned, it suggests that censorship of dissenting opinions is occurring and this is something that should be made clear.  Relevant bits from the ""whitepaper"" ""... DNA contains information on a person’s ethnicity and heritage"" and ""...personal traits such as intelligence and personality"". It's absolutely true that genetics play a role in many diseases processes and disorders, but to suggest so boldly that so many characteristics about an individual can be derived from genetic material given our current technology is pushing the boundaries of reality.  Despite all of this ridiculousness. I made it clear that the multichain tech this firm was planning to use was very interesting and did not see any red flags with respect to their tech stack as outlined in the whitepaper or the development team .

Apparently discussion of the whitepaper and the contents of it are not considered related to the platform. Seconds before being banned, michael stated to me ""My personal opinion as someone that has been reading science for the last 20 years, is that there's virtually no argument, whatsoever, that Intelligence is genetic. There's a deluge of evidence."" and then linked papers which do not support his position. In the first paper linked to me by michael: ""We show that the identified genes are predominantly expressed in brain tissue, and pathway analysis indicates the involvement of genes regulating cell development (MAGMA competitive P = 3.5 × 10−6)."" It's a pretty big leap to suggest that SNPs or loci that correspond to expression of genes involved regulating cell development implies that intelligence is genetic. Further, the study referenced analyzed over 78,000 individuals all of whom were of European descent, which reduces this study's explanatory power.  Lastly, the authors of the paper have said 'The current genetic results explain up to 5% of the total variance in intelligence."" I completely agree, that as usual, more studies are needed, but to suggest right off the bat that intelligence (and ethnicity and personality) are determined in the manner described in the whitepaper is disingenuous.  The next paper he provided me with does not even address the issue we were discussing. It seems like random papers were strewn about in the hopes of dissuading any further investigation. The paper stated ""The combined (and all three individual samples) showed a small positive phenotypic correlation between intelligence and lifespan."" Okay? How is this even relevant to the discussion of genetics influencing intelligence. This paper discusses the correlation among intelligence and lifespan NOT intelligence and genetics. Source: https://academic.oup.com/ije/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/ije/dyv112  I could keep going on like this for the remaining 3 papers cited to backup these claims, but it's mostly the same thing repeated. The point is, if such unfounded statements are being made in the whitepaper, then it suggests to me that other areas may also be lacking. In addition, the banning individuals who want to support these types of endeavours by ensuring accuracy is just silly and frankly pisses me off. If you are going to run a platform dedicated to storing genetic information, you have to expect that individuals who have training in the field will look on with interest. Have you really not had Vanessa, Barry, Nick or another advisor proofread the paper?",False

We empower science, business and individuals to securely and efficiently achieve their goals.    Our Genesis  ''With the debate about gene patenting settled by courts banning most patents on naturally-occurring genes, questions about gene ownership needed to be resolved. This time, instead of waiting for public policy to catch up, we decided to make something that creates, tracks, and resolves questions of custody and payment and that makes science and commerce less risky: The Gene-Chain was born.''   -Dr. David Koepsell    What does the Encrypgen project aim to do?  Encrypgen will create a global marketplace of Institutional requesters of sequenced DNA, and providers of sequenced DNA. Any person can be a provider of sequenced DNA, and be rewarded for their contribution. Researchers around the globe will use DNA coins to pay for access to study that genomic data.   What does Encrypgen have to do with genetics?  Encrypgen’s gene-chain is a private blockchain to facilitate exposure and safe transmission of user’s genomic data. Users can choose to give aggregated access consent to their data, and be rewarded by research conducted worldwide by universities, hospitals, scientists, etc…   What problem does Encrypgen solve?  Encrypgen solves multiple problems at once. Before Amazon shopping existed, people would drive to each store separately, buy their products, and continue driving to other stores. Amazon created an online marketplace where customers can conveniently buy most things in one place from the comfort of their home, and have them delivered. Encrypgen has a similar aim, which is to create a secure, convenient ‘marketplace’ for institutions to easily obtain large quantities of sequenced DNA, while being given ‘consent’ by the providers automatically included in the transaction. Rather than institutions and researchers having to obtain multiple different consents across multiple different countries and struggle with legal boundaries for multiple different studies, they can obtain all of that genomic data in one place with the click of a button. This will revolutionize the market for genomic data and create a direct link between researchers around the globe, and citizens providing their genomic data.

The Gene-Chain is our private blockchain for science and medicine, allowing the searching and storing of genomic information with blockchain-enhanced security and privacy. While numerous databases already exist to capture genomic data, and to use it both in science and commerce, current schemes to accumulate and proliferate that data for use are insufficiently secure or open. The challenge is to create a secure database for use in both personal genomics and large-scale science, impenetrable to malicious hacking or other unauthorized uses, controllable and trackable for individual donors. “Blockchain” technology is the best technical means to achieve both aims and we outline below a model of a “gene-chain” database as a solution to both ethical and practical problems related to genomic databases.  The sole currency for transactions on the Gene-Chain (among those who wish to share information) will be Gene-Chain Coin (GENIE). The Token Sale for GENIEs is underway. There are only 100 Million in the universe from now until the universe ends. 80 Million are up for sale before the Gene-Chain grows.
