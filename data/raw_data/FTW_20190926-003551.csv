We recommend using MyEtherWallet, Parity, Metamask or similar wallets. Remember, never give your Private Key to anyone, under any circumstances. FutureWorks will never contact you to ask you for either private or public key via email.  https://youtu.be/IuSKAaliKME      Dream Comet Studios, LLC is soon to release the FIRST ever crowdfunding token for motion pictures known as FutureWorks which is geared to make funding easier for indie filmmakers through the help of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency. Anthony Daniel who is the CEO of Dream Comet Studios, LLC invented a new film donation blockchain that supports its donors. The film production company has two feature films that are out currently worldwide. The token will be out during pre-collections, which any donor that participate during that time will have to hold onto their tokens until March 31st, 2018. Anthony Daniel has built a double eco-system within the token's blockchain to help create a self-sufficient refueling cycle for the token. Yes, any project made under the FutureWorks token will have to donate a fixed percentage of their profits into the token supply quarterly, which this is set to start at the end of Phase 3.      Details about how the token works can be found on our site at www.ftwtokens.io. We have a full detailed Roadmap within our official Whitepaper. Down below is a sample of the Roadmap to give you an idea of when the phases will start. The production company has big plans for the development of FutureWorks for 2018 with hopes of adding partners in 2019.  http://i64.tinypic.com/2mn21yt.png      You can review all of the finer details on our website when you read our Whitepaper. We had to change the game and when researching we've found out that a lot of production companies that use crowdfunding platforms fail since they run into fees, expenses, and just unable to reach the full potential of finding supporters. Dream Comet Studios will be crafting the overall blockchain its first year, but we already believe that we have a giant step among others since we're the first ones to do something like this. Anthony Daniel projects that in 6-8 months from now everyone will be wanting to get into blockchain technology. We've got a lot of great feedback from the film community but more importantly from the crypto community. You now have a way to support motion pictures and get a reward as a donor, which is really amazing. We felt that there was a lot of hoops to jump through using another crowdfunding platforms/sites and wanted to ensure that you as a supporter would be taken care of in such a creative way. Would you rather have a t-shirt or a token that may increase in value over a period of time for supporting our cause of making great original content? I believe most of you would want the token. It is designed to be held onto which it can either increase value or decrease value over time. This is not a security token since we're not selling tokens nor asking for investors.  When we do well, you do better. It's that simple. Now, let's create some art together!",False
