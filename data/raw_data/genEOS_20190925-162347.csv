Each generation of blockchain has its own distinguishing features that determine its usability and integrability into business processes.  At genEOS, we aim to create a blockchain 4.0 that overcomes obstacles faced by previous generations, yet maintaining their major improvements and advantages, and delivers blockchain as a business-usable environment for creating and running applications, bringing the technology fully mainstream. We believe that a blockchain 4.0 environment should have the following features:  very low latency of transactions and the potential for parallel performance across multiple CPUs, for rapid function and unlimited scaling  delegated Proof of Stake structure for producing new blocks, to create a blockchain structure that maximizes real-world decentralization  exponentially accelerated processing and transaction speeds that enable to create a platform that lets Dapps rival standard web apps for speed and versatility, while maintaining the unique security and other advantages of blockchain technology  an operating system-like construct upon which applications can be built. It provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across multiple CPU cores and/or clusters   Seele may have its own vision of blockchain 4.0 as it is determined by the project’s creators.
