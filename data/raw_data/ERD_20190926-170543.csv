Q1: Our internal target is that the testnet should be launched sometime around Christmas but there's still lots of work to be done. Q2: In our prototype, we have run tests with 200 nodes, so in the testnet we intend to scale this considerably. However, we'll have to see how this works in the first release, or if we'll do this only with the second release. Q3: The precise number has not been decided yet, but we will probably post some of the simulations around the testnet launch to receive some feedback on them. Q4: Do you mean technical documentation? Q5: We are discussing some really interesting ideas and should also post some notes on this around the testnet launch. The idea is to create a wider distribution, departing a bit from the simple ICO distribution, to create a way for real supporters to join during the bootstrapping phase even without investing direct money. This will most likely be a combination of several distribution methods.",False

Here is the most important part of the announcement highlighted: ""Elrond and NETOPIA aim to jointly explore the potential of integrating Elrond’s token, ERD, into the NETOPIA payment platform allowing their merchants to offer on their turn to their users and clients the possibility to acquire products and services through ERD tokens as well.  This will also mean that 6,000+ merchants who are using the NETOPIA solutions will be able to accept ERD cryptocurrency overnight, with no development or operational costs on their part.""  For reference about Netopia: ""NETOPIA is the biggest electronic payment processor in Romania, expecting to process in 2018 more than 13 million digital transactions with a total value of around $400 Million.""  So to answer your questions: 1. This partnership will bring over 6000 online stores where Elrond will be accepted. Lots of other stores and means of using Elrond will come to add on this and will be announced as we advance. 2. There will not be any fee on the development or integration side for the merchants accepting Elrond. I suspect the standard fee will apply for Elrond at first. 3. Definitely. We are already working on this, and will make announcements as conclude discussions with some of the exchanges. The important part is for us to launch the tech, listings will come with that. 4. Payment utility should go live as soon as we launch the token. We expect this to happen sometime in Q1 2019. We're working hard to reach these targets.",False

The most important advantage we have is that our technology is very compelling once released. In a market full of empty promises, shipping what we proposed will be an extraordinary feat. We are very close to doing that already.  The funds we will gather will be used to speed up and expand our global presence, but momentum is growing steadily.  If dapps would have a platofrm offering a 1000x improvement in fundamental architecture efficiency today, most of them would migrate instantly.  Still we recognize distribution is also critical for elrond to truly take off. That's why we're working hard on relevant partnerships that will add real utility to our ecosystem.
