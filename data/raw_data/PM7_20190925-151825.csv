Let me explain how PM7 works. You use your referral link to share information about PM7. For each friend registered by your link, you earn Installation Bonuses. They are in hold firstly. Every time your connected friends make a purchase of PM7 you will earn Commission Bonuses (up to 7%). You can withdraw them immediately. As soon as you collected $200 Commission Bonuses your $20 Installation Bonuses will be unheld. Then you can use your bonuses for purchasing PM7 and withdrawal. If nobody from your friends buy PM7 you won't be able to unhold Installation Bonuses and use them. But you can invite more friends and then they make a purchase you will earn Commission Bonuses and unhold Installation Bonuses And please, pay attention. We don't allow to buy PM7 by Installation Bonuses. This is explained simply. we build a running business and want it to generate revenue and we could share it with the owners of the tokens. Therefore, we can not just sell tokens for the given Installation Bonuses. We strive to develop the system through the purchases made by your friends. The more purchases and invitations on the network, the more we earn. We focus on longm-term income, not on one-time bonuses",False

You use your referral link to share information about PM7. For each friend registered by your link, you earn Installation Bonuses. They are in hold firstly. Every time your connected friends make a purchase of PM7 you will earn Commission Bonuses (up to 7%). You can withdraw them immediately. As soon as you collected $200 Commission Bonuses your $20 Installation Bonuses will be unheld. Then you can use your bonuses for purchasing PM7 and withdrawal. If nobody from your friends buy PM7 you won't be able to unhold Installation Bonuses and use them. But you can invite more friends and then they make a purchase you will earn Commission Bonuses and unhold Installation Bonuses And please, pay attention. We don't allow to buy PM7 by Installation Bonuses. This is explained simply. we build a running business and want it to generate revenue and we could share it with the owners of the tokens. Therefore, we can not just sell tokens for the given Installation Bonuses. We strive to develop the system through the purchases made by your friends. The more purchases and invitations on the network, the more we earn. We focus on longm-term income, not on one-time bonuses.",False

If nobody from your friends buy PM7 you won't be able to unhold Installation Bonuses and use them. But you can invite more friends and then they make a purchase you will earn Commission Bonuses and unhold Installation Bonuses  And please, pay attention. We don't allow to buy PM7 by Installation Bonuses. This is explained simply. we build a running business and want it to generate revenue and we could share it with the owners of the tokens. Therefore, we can not just sell tokens for the given Installation Bonuses. We strive to develop the system through the purchases made by your friends. The more purchases and invitations on the network, the more we earn. We focus on long-term income, not on one-time bonuses",False

The PM7 tokens perform infrastructure functions and they are the identifier, the unit of measurement   of   PM7   events,   and   quantity   of   PM7   events   per   month   that   the   backer receives by purchasing events during the ICO.  3,500,000,000 – is the approximate number of Internet users. 1,000,000,000 – is the number of PM7 in the system. 3.5B: 1B = 3.5 users. There are 3.5 users for each PM7 in our system. For example, if you buy $100 of our PM7 events during the first phase (and receive PM7 tokens), then taking into account bonuses: 100$: 0.05 = (2000 PM7 + 800 PM7 (+40%)) x 3.5 users = 9800 users can be involved for $100, which generate revenue in the form of bonuses. According to our calculator, 9800 friends can approximately generate revenue of  +/- $19,000. At the same time, the system and   its owners will receive $7200. In other words, for every $1 spent, you may theoretically receive income up to $72. This is considering the fact that on the first level will be 7 friends, but you can involve much larger (see calculator). So $72 is repeatedly multiplied. And this is only one product and level, and we have an innovative multilayer and multi-level blockchain technology of MLM distribution. And there will be thousands of products!!!",False

The system of rounds and bonuses for amount of tokens bought is implemented to make the service more popular at the very beginning of the launch. The early adopters of our system are able to gain a huge amount of bonus tokens (up to 100% gained!) by buying the tokens as soon as possible. The sooner the ICO gains traction the easier it will be for us to achieve our goals in a short amount of time.

After all, what’s the difference, how good an idea, if no one knows about it? Let’s say that Elon Musk would fulfill his promise and send the first people to Mars in 2024. A breakthrough in space exploration? Undoubtedly, but what use of it, if everybody would know nothing about it? That’s why Mask regularly participates in various PR events, which eats up a large part of the budget of SpaceX. But this money could be more useful for other things. Almost every business in the world works in a similar way. And it does not matter, whether it’s a huge corporation, like SpaceX, or a small shop delivering organic food. If no one knows about them — business is doomed. Therefore, business reserves an enormous part of its budget, to advertise its product.  Solution  This situation is as old as capitalism itself and is aggravated every day. But the current development of technology can change everything. Specifically, the blockchain — a decentralized system that removes expensive intermediaries in various spheres of life. As for the advertising industry, the PM7 platform can revolutionize it. This is innovative marketing affiliate platform, which removes the “layer” of advertisers of all colors and allows businesses to contact directly with consumers. PM7 operates on the principle of multi-level marketing. Now the platform allows sharing an information about ICO projects. The algorithm of a platform is very simple. For example, the company wants to enter the ICO. Accordingly, she wants many people to know about it. This company contracts with PM7, which indicates how much it is willing to pay for spreading of information about its product. Users of PM7 distribute this information and thus generate a revenue system. This income is divided among all participants of PM7. So, most bonuses are getting distributors — 62% of the total. Another 31% is spent on paying bonuses to premium account holders. Between them, revenue is calculated depending on the number of tokens, which is held by premium account. The remaining 7% goes to develop the system and maintenance of its functionality.  Advance technology  The work of the PM7 platform, in fact, provides two concepts — an event and a token. PM7 event — the number of metrics, events, information sources and the possible amount of revenue in the system. The platform offers premium accounts with a different number of PM7 events per month. If the customer buys events during the ICO PM7, he receives tokens as a reward. The calculation is one-to-one. A token is a unit of measure for events. It also performs infrastructure functions. It is based on the modern standard ERC-20. Initially, this standard was developed to implement smart contracts of the Ethereum. But later due to its simplicity and reliability, it became one of the most popular token protocol for crowdfunding companies or ICO. ERC-20 — a breakthrough in the world of the blockchain. Prior to it, each ICO-token reinvented the wheel, coming up with its own versions of the basic functionality. They implemented their own functionality to exchange tokens, using a unique name and different arguments. Let`s imagine that the owner of such an “outdated” token A wanted to exchange it for the same token B. To do this, he had to study the system token B and, so, to implement compatibility for the exchange. ERC-20 is a unified protocol that avoids these complexities and allows without the difficulties. Such tokens on the ERC-20 protocol qualitatively win before tokens of the same bitcoin. After all, tokens of the most famous cryptocurrency in the world were released in limited quantities and they are becoming less available every day. At the same time, their price is unreasonably high.  More abilities  But the functions of PM7 tokens do not end with collecting money and determining the number of events. It also serves as a virtual currency. This currency will be used by projects and partners of the PM7 platform. In the future, using tokens platform users will be able to pay for services and receive bonuses. In total, the platform is going to release a billion PM7 tokens. At the same time, at a lower starting price, platform developers will sell half — 500 million tokens. One token will cost only $0.05. The remaining 500 million tokens will be shared between companies, investors, team, and advisers. Customers who receive tokens and, therefore, events, will receive commission bonuses from the system at the stage of ICO PM7 in the future. And, as the cost of the tokens themselves will increase, customers will be able to receive more revenues. Moreover, platform users will be able to freely buy and sell tokens on crypto exchanges, thereby earning money on rate fluctuations. The ICO of PM7 is scheduled for 2018. After that, the platform integrates its tokens with one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world: Exmo, Hitbtc, Tidex, Liqui. At the beginning of 2019, PM7 will receive licenses to manage funds, as well as licenses for brokerage activities from the US financial regulator SEC. This will allow PM7 to sell tokens in the world’s largest financial system. At the same time, only at the stage of preparation of ICO PM7, already more than 50 companies wanted to cooperate with the platform.",False
