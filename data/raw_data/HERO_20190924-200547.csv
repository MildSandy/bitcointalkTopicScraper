We are targeting the final release of the remaining tokens in the next several weeks. Please help spread the word to the remaining token sale participants that they must register at membership.herotoken.io/register and complete the KYC process in order to receive their Hero tokens.  Thank you for your continued support in building the Hero community. Your enthusiastic support has been vital to the success of the Hero Origen Token sale. Now we must transition from the sale to the building of the Hero Capital Market Platform. We have some important updates which we are happy to share with you in this regard.  David, the founder of the Hero Project, has resigned from his operating role at PawnHero so he can focus 100% of his time and efforts on building the Hero Capital Market Platform. He has relocated from the Philippines to Europe where we will open an office in Barcelona, Spain and build the executive team for the Hero Project. We are in the process of hiring experienced blockchain developers and additional support staff to build and market the Hero Capital Market Platform in the Philippines and other markets in SEA. Europe offers the most experienced blockchain developers, infrastructure, and technical staff available to build the Hero Capital Market Platform. Building the right team takes time, but David’s an experienced entrepreneur and he has done this before.  As we’ve disclosed previously, we’ve already arranged for the trading of the Hero Origen token on the Qryptos exchange in Singapore. We are also actively working to arrange the listing of the Hero Origen token on additional exchanges. We’re moving as fast as we can on this, but we can only move as fast as the exchanges and the applicable legal authorities. We will provide an update once we have cleared the legal and regulatory compliance requirements for us to secure additional listings.  Please remember that the Hero Project is both a social venture to provide financial inclusion, transparency, and efficiency for the underserved populations of South East Asia, and a non-profit business that must like any business build its product and market it to its customers. As such, although we will share as much as possible with the community, we also have to keep certain parts of our business strategy, product roadmap, and marketing plans confidential, so we can maximize our business opportunity. This is for the benefit of all Hero stakeholders.  Although we used to provide a weekly update to the community, in this next phase our public updates will be less regular. However, we will endeavor to provide updates to the community on developments in the Hero Project as warranted. But we will never disclose private and confidential information and risk our competitive advantage. If you bought Hero Origen tokens and have any questions or concerns, you can always email us at tokensale@herotoken.io.

The 6th batch of tokens were issued today and 37,514 HERO Tokens were distributed to members who solved their issues and got verified by May 5.

HitBTC is currently ranked the #8 exchange in terms of 24 Hour Volume Rankings by CoinMarketCap. Experts have called the exchange intuitive, responsive and easy-to-use, friendly with trading newbies but complex enough for advanced traders. We are working with the HitBTC team to finalise the procedure.   This is great news for the HERO community especially for the Japanese token holders who are not able to trade on QRYPTOS. HitBTC does not restrict any nationality from trading on their platform.  Thus, we encourage the community to create an account ahead of time as we wait for the listing date. Here is a short tutorial on how to create a HitBTC account: https://support.hitbtc.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005089525-How-to-create-an-account-  Listing on a top exchange has been an often frustrating and very stressful process but we are happy to finally announce the listing on a Top10 exchange. Contrary to what people might think, listing on a top exchange is not just about paying. It is a very arduous process that took us months to accomplish filled with legal requirements and influenced by factors we don’t control. We truly appreciate the community members who were unwavering in their trust and support. And we ask the community to continue to do so in the next steps ahead. We have your best interest in mind, but allow us the time to execute our vision of making credit more readily available and affordable for the unbanked or underbanked, starting in Southeast Asia.  The team would also like to remind the community of their role in spreading hype and good feedback on HERO instead of spreading negativity which will not benefit anyone. It would be in everybody’s best interest to help HERO promote Financial Inclusion, Transparency, and Efficiency in Southeast Asia.  Our team continues to be available for your questions and concerns through our Telegram group https://t.me/Herotokensale or via email tokensale@herotoken.io.

Meanwhile Translation, Bug Hunt & Creative Development, and Exclusive Support bounties will be distributed by the end of the week.  If you have issues with your bounty then please do the following: 1. Send a PM to @andykov on Telegram 2. Write your detail in issue: How much you were to receive, on which address, which campaign, what is your username and any other necessary details. 3. Be patient and give a few hours to a day or two for his response as he is busy dealing with a lot of bounty issues. Rest assured your problem will be dealt with so long as you message him and include the complete info.  For any other issues or questions regarding the bounty, message @andykov or @silviudis on Telegram and you can also visit the official HERO Bounty group https://t.me/herotokenbounty.  Next batch of token distribution is set for April 20th. Again, we want to remind the remaining pending and unverified accounts to verify before the 17th of April to be included in this batch of token distribution. We are proactively contacting those with unsolved problems, please check your emails as our support team has repeatedly sent out instructions to help you.  Regarding the exchange listing we are still talking to several big exchanges but nothing has been finalized. We know this can be a little frustrating for the community but know that is very frustrating for us as well. Some issues we have been experiencing with certain exchanges are their very inconsistent listing prices which seem to increase as the talks get more advanced. Others have very unreasonable demands, while some are very slow with their responses. These are just a few of the difficulties we are facing, but we are doing everything we can to speed up our talks and finalize a listing. We continue to do our best to give you the best options possible so we ask for your continued patience.  Finally, we want to ask everyone to join our new HERO Token Channel.

The 5th batch of tokens were issued yesterday and around 30,923 HERO Tokens were distributed to members who solved their issues and got verified by April 18. As of the moment 217,063 HERO Tokens still remain in reserve post the release. We are still proactive in sending emails to the unverified accounts and continue to remind them to complete the KYC to get their tokens, but it is out of our hands if some people cannot follow simple instructions. In any case, if you still have issues with your tokens or problems with your accounts you can send an email to tokensale@herotoken.io with the complete details of your transaction and your problem.  For the remaining undistributed Bounty campaigns, the Translation bounty spreadsheet will be updated later today. It will be open to comments and disputes before it is distributed. Visit the official HERO Bounty group https://t.me/herotokenbounty for inquiries or message @andykov or @silviudis.  Regarding the exchange listing, we are still currently in talks with several top exchanges. But we want to consult the community regarding this matter. We are nearing an agreement with HUOBI and Bit-Z. However the listing process for both HUOBI and Bit-Z require an active participation from the community. Both would require a voting phase that will ask the community to buy voting tokens and vote for HERO in order for us to get into the exchanges.  Here are the Voting mechanics for HUOBI:  The voting phase shall be 11 days. Each round selects two projects to go live. The project that scores the first will obtain the priority in entering Huobi Pro listing audit. The winning projects need to get at least 600,000 points. Projects that enter the final list are required to have more than 1,000 voters. 1 vote costs 0.1 HT. Each user can cast 100,000 votes maximum.  https://huobiglobal.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000760471-Voting-Rules  Here are the Voting mechanics for Bit-Z:  In accordance with the listing rules, coins need to be voted to hit 2 million VTC (Votecoin) before getting listed. Each of your supporters or community members who registers on Bit-Z can vote 50–1000 VTC. VTC tokens can be purchased at DKKT market. The voting period is 7 days, which means the voting goal of 2 million VTC should be reached in 7 days. In case you fail the voting, VTC tokens will be refunded to the voters after the voting. If you succeed in the voting, VTC will not be refundable.  https://support.bit-z.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360002590973  Now because we know that voting is something that would need the undivided attention of the community, we want to focus on only one of them. So we will ask your feedback regarding this matter. Both of these voting schemes do not ensure that HERO would be listed on the exchanges, and we need to actually reach the voting goal of either 2 million VTC in 7 days for Bit-Z or 600,000 Points in 11 days for HUOBI to get listed. We want to ask the community if you are willing to take such a risk. And if you are, would you prefer the voting process of Bit-Z or HOUBI? If you choose among the two, the exchange listing would significantly speed up. But if you think that it be would be safer to go for an exchange without a voting phase, it would probably take a little longer to get listed. We will set up a Poll in the Official HERO Telegram group to gauge the community’s choice. We appreciate your help and the patience you have shown. We look forward to your decision.  In the meantime, we also want to address certain issues coming up in the Telegram group saying the team is not using the community’s contributions properly. We want to assure you that the funds from the ICO have very much been untouched. It is public for the community to see, thanks to the blockchain: https://etherscan.io/address/0x1706024467ef8c9c4648da6fc35f2c995ac79cf6  We want to assure you that we are very careful in our transactions and business decisions only because we have your best interest in mind. We ask that you allow us the necessary time to make the right and carefully considered business decisions we need to make. Rushing will not help anyone. It is still only a few weeks removed from the ICO closing, we have a lot in store for you to be revealed at the proper time.  Another concern we want to address is with the Token Price, extreme movements in both directions can be observed because the trading volume on QRYPTOS is insubstantial. It is still very early for HERO. Listing on a bigger exchange where all the token holders can access, together with platform development progress, will have a big impact on the value of the token.  In line with this, we have good news for those asking about the platform. We have significant information about the development of the HERO Capital Market in next week’s community update. Please stay tuned for that.  Finally, we want to ask everyone to join our new HERO Token Channel. Because updates and messages easily get buried in the main group, we decided to open a channel dedicated to the latest HERO news and updates.

Bounty stakes have been updated, and bounty tokens will be distributed by midnight on Sunday. Just processing a few things and dealing with all the problem reports so we ask bounty participants to please wait a little longer. If you have any issues or questions regarding the bounty you can message @andykov on Telegram. For all other bounty related concerns, please visit https://t.me/herotokenbounty.  The 4th batch of tokens were also issued this week and around 82,973 HERO Tokens were distributed to members who solved their issues and got verified by March 30. As of the moment 247,983 HERO Tokens or 2.10% of the supply still remain in reserve post the release. We are proactive in sending emails to the unverified accounts and continue to remind them to complete the KYC to get their tokens, but it is out of our hands if some people cannot follow simple instructions. In any case, if you still have issues with your tokens or problems with your accounts you can send an email to tokensale@herotoken.io with the complete details of your transaction and your problem.  We know everyone is waiting patiently for the new exchange announcement and we promised that we’ll have something for you by today. But as these things go, there’s been a few delays in the talks so we want to be transparent with you on the progress of our listing with the exchanges. Currently we are in advanced talks with: Bit-Z (waiting to hear back from their risk control department) and CoinBene (advanced discussion). Plus the other big exchanges we’re trying to get listed on and our current status with them: GateCoin (Focusing on scaling architecture of exchange before listing new tokens), Huobi (followed up multiple times, promises response within two weeks, this was March 14), KuCoin (no response since March 14), Binance (no response — applied twice), and OKEx (no response since application), Japanese exchanges not listing any tokens right now (Coinbase incident).  Hopefully we’ll have something more concrete for you next week, ideally the Bit-Z or CoinBene listing will be finalized but again we don’t want to make false promises so we ask you to temper your expectations a bit. Remember that the timeline for the listing is not entirely up to us and we are trying to speed up things as much as we can but we’re also working with the exchange team who work at a pace we cannot control. But with our advanced talks, know that it won’t take too long now to get listed on a bigger exchange.  Finally, we want to ask everyone to join our new HERO Token Channel. Because updates and messages easily get buried in the main group, we decided to open a channel dedicated to the latest HERO news and updates. You can join the HERO Token Channel here: https://t.me/herotoken_channel  THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED TRUST AND SUPPORT!  Our team continues to be available for your questions and concerns through our Telegram group https://t.me/Herotokensale or via email tokensale@herotoken.io.  Until next Friday and Happy Weekend.

Majority (95%) of our tokens have already been distributed since March 9. The second round of tokens was successfully issued yesterday, March 15. 178.324 tokens were distributed to 1,153 wallets. We did not mint any additional tokens. Instead, those tokens were already minted and held in a reserve wallet. Thus, the token supply stays the same at 14,765,425.24871560000.  Members who received their tokens yesterday only completed their identity verification after the deadline for the first round of tokens, which was March 1. The next round of tokens will be issued on March 20 to all those that verify their account or clear their ongoing dispute before midnight on March 18. As this will be the third round of tokens issued, we will be leaving a bigger window to resolve any ongoing dispute and have the remaining members verify their account. Please be reminded to get your accounts verified and to settle your issues before March 18. If you fail to do so, you will further delay the token distribution. The fourth round of tokens will hopefully be the last and this is expected to take place in the middle of April.  We proactively reminded everybody to complete the KYC before the ICO ended and yet many still did not. This week alone, we verified and solved more than 1,000 accounts and disputes. That gives you an idea of what happens behind the scenes of an ICO. Transaction support is taking a lot of our time.  The most common problem we encounter these days is people who registered an account but sent their contribution from a different wallet. They would then contact us afterwards to ask why they did not get their tokens. Tokens are issued to the wallet from which we received the contribution from and only when there is a registered and verified account. You cannot use a different account that is registered under a different wallet address. If you have not received your tokens yet, this could be because you do not have any account (register now) or there is a dispute. Those disputes are usually related to members who bought HERO tokens with non-Ethereum, i.e. Bitcoin, Ripple, LTC etc., but did not provide the transaction signature to provide sufficient proof that they were the ones who made the transaction, or there are multiple people claiming to have made this transaction. Those members need to fill up the problem reporting form, complete all required fields, and upload supporting documents and screenshots from their wallet/exchange.  Again, we have repeatedly sent warnings to the community, yet members continue to make the same mistakes. Thus, it is beyond our control if people cannot follow our simple instructions. If you still have token concerns, please email tokensale@herotoken.io and make sure to include the complete details of your issue. Our average response time is less than 12 hours, while more complex issues take more time.  For Referral Program participants, we released the remaining tokens to those who had verified accounts. Again, you will need a verified account in order to receive tokens. We already emailed everyone who participated in the token sale and referral program whose account status are still not verified. Please make sure you follow the instructions in the said email.  We ask bounty participants to be patient as bounty tokens will be issued by the end of March at the earliest. Stakes will take a while to be calculated and have not been a priority. Bounty participants will receive their tokens only after all members who participated in the token sale have completed their KYC and received their tokens, so that the total number of tokens sold can be determined, which then provides the foundation to calculate the amount of tokens to be issued to bounty participants. Remember, the bounty pool is equal to 2% of all tokens sold. We were hoping that everybody would follow the instructions and complete the identity verification in time, but since this was not the case, all advisors, bounty participants and team members have to wait.  We also want to remind everyone that for issues with QRYPTOS, it is best to seek help from their support on Telegram: https://t.me/QUOINE_Support. To those of you complaining that QRYPTOS KYC takes a while to process, this is standard protocol for almost all exchanges. It is very difficult from them as well to cope with the high number of new registrations. The verification process of other exchanges take even longer, so we ask you to be patient (this is out of our control). We also want to remind Japanese people to send tokens on QRYPTOS because chances are that your account will not be verified and you will not be able to withdraw your tokens. That said, QRYPTOS only needs KYC if you want to withdraw funds, but not to buy/sell HERO and other tokens. So you can still buy/sell HERO Tokens even with a newly created account or simply check the token price.  Taking a step back, HERO ICO started on February 1 and ended on February 28. Most ICOs announce the listing on exchanges only weeks after the ICO ended. For example, LALA World ended its token sale on January 12 and only listed its first exchange two months later on March 12. We at HERO, on the other hand, were able to list on QRYPTOS before the ICO even started. Which we believe speaks for the team and project itself. But what we did not know and also could not (since the ICO had not started) was that 82% of all tokens would be sold to Japanese citizens.  Unfortunately QRYPTOS is not open to Japanese citizens. When over 80% of all token holders are unable to trade, then this explains the current trading volume, which has been low to almost nonexistent (only 10 ETH worth of HERO were traded in the last 24 hours). Aside from that, all major currencies and tokens are down significantly compared to the last few weeks. You can also see that the funds we raised have remained almost untouched apart from some marketing related expenses, though the value depreciated a lot as well.  The biggest concern of the community at the moment is getting listed on other exchanges after previously listing on QYRPTOS. We have and will always be transparent with the community. We are in talks with several reputable exchanges and have filed for listing, but like you we have to wait. Listing on an exchange takes time. Exchanges get tons of applications. As a result, certain exchanges are upgrading their policies and restrictions, thus, resulting to listing being more complicated than ever. This is why we are cautious before revealing any news to the community. Our philosophy has always been that we announce news when they are final so that we do not set wrong expectations or false hope. As such, we are not name dropping or confirming any discussions with any specific exchange until the exchange itself announces the listing. We believe this is the right thing to do and announcing any negotiation would be a breach of the non-disclosure-agreements we signed with some of them and thus jeopardises the listing (some exchanges specifically forbid disclosing any listing negotiations, i.e. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/binance-listing-tips-changpeng-zhao/) . Right now, we engaged two leading law firms in Singapore and Japan to procure the necessary legal opinions requested by some of the exchanges we are in talk. We want you to know that we are doing what we can to give you the best options at the closest possible time when it comes to this matter. It is a misconception when people think that you simply pay a lot of money or fill up a form.  Re CoinMarketCap: We have received questions regarding this quite often this week. The moment we are listed on multiple exchanges with daily trading volumes, we will approach CMC and ask for the listing. It is simply too early right now. Give it a month or so.

Good news for bounty participants! Bounty tokens are issued on April 6, and the stakes will be updated by March 30. As a bounty participant, you do not need to complete the identity verification process. For those who want to remove their signature, kindly message bounty manager @andykov on Telegram. For all other bounty related concerns, please visit https://t.me/herotokenbounty.  The fourth batch of token distribution is also set on April 6. There are still 200 accounts that need to get verified before March 30 so if your account status is pending, please check your emails as our support team has repeatedly sent out instructions to help you.  Our support team is doing a great job. Everyone should have gotten a response to their emails sent to either tokensale@herotoken.io or accounts@herotoken.io. We will continue to do our best and keep up with the level of emails we receive on a daily basis.  We know everybody is awaiting news for the listing on additional exchanges, but nothing has been finalized yet. We are talking to several Top 30 exchanges at the moment. We are getting closer as the days go by and we feel comfortable to announce the listing on one or multiple top exchanges in the next fourteen days.  Another positive thing to notice is that trading has picked up on QRYPTOS with the daily volume and prices rising. At the point of writing HERO/ETH is traded at 0.00347899.  Finally, we want to ask everyone to join our new HERO Token Channel. Because updates and messages easily get buried in the main group, we decided to open a channel dedicated to the latest HERO news and updates.

We are pleased to announce that the first batch of HERO Tokens will be issued tomorrow March 8. While there is no specified time yet, we want to assure you that the tokens will be distributed before the day ends. As mentioned before, the first batch of HERO Tokens will only be issued to people whose accounts were verified before March 1 and didn’t have any dispute with their transaction. Tomorrow 93% of all those who bought HERO tokens will receive their tokens.  To be transparent with the community we want to share that the final token sale contribution count is at 41,996 ETH (other cryptos converted and included) which will be equivalent to approximately 15 million HERO Tokens.  We will send instructions by tomorrow on how to add HERO tokens to your wallets. So we remind you to be patient and wait for us to release the necessary token information via newsletter, Medium, and Telegram.  Moreover, we are happy to confirm that the HERO Token listing on QRYPTOS exchange will start on Friday, March 9, at 8pm (JST). We encourage you to create an account on QRYPTOS now, if you haven’t already. Also we’d like to share that QRYPTOS only needs KYC if you want to withdraw funds, but not to buy/sell HERO tokens and other tokens. So you can still buy/sell HERO Tokens even with a newly created account. QRYPTOS Support team is available on Telegram https://t.me/QUOINE_Support  Again there are still 7% whose account status is still pending or unconfirmed. You need to complete your verification process before March 8th if you want to get your tokens by March 15th. Please see this to help get your account verified: http://bit.ly/2EW0i59  If you made a mistake with your transaction you need to report it here https://goo.gl/forms/Rclb26xt5jTfeXFg1 only if your problem is not listed then email tokensale@herotoken.io  Also here is a rough timeline for the rest of the token distribution: referral programs will be issued before March 15, and finally bounty participants will receive after all those who bought received theirs, hopefully by March 30th. If you have any questions about the bounty, join our dedicated support on Telegram https://t.me/herotokenbounty .  We are now well on our way in this journey that we hope ends with financial inclusion in Southeast Asia, a future where the unbanked can readily access affordable loans and where transparency and efficiency is a service afforded to all.

HERO was listed on a small but (very) fast growing exchange, QRYPTOS. We wanted to leave you with some food for thoughts about the token price. At the time of writing this blog post, there are buy orders for HERO tokens at a price of 0.0018 ETH. It is important to note that this solely shows the willingness of people to buy tokens and at what price and rather than being the value of your HERO token. That the trading price is below the ICO price can be explained by a combination of the following: a) ICO just ended and until the last day, February 28th, people were able to purchase tokens (hard cap was not reached) b) tokens have just been issued, everybody on Telegram and in the community have their tokens, therefore why buy more unless the price is attractive. Whereas the willingness to sell at a high price, and therefore the slight prominence on the “sell” side makes sense for everybody who holds HERO tokens right now. A lot of token holders would probably sell at 2x, 3x or 5x. Placing those orders therefore is totally legitimate. Now, when people argue that the trading price is below the ICO price, we have to start with what was the ICO price. Ethereum closed at $354.7 on November 20th, somebody who participated in the presale, remember minimum was 10 Ether with a bonus of 30% (first 3 hours) (10 * 354.7 = 3547.0 USD received 200 * 10 = 2,000 + 30% bonus = 2,600 HERO tokens) so effectively this person paid $1.36 per token. Whereas on the other hand somebody who bought on February 1 at a price per Ether of $1101.49 and 10% (no more minimum) paid $5.01 per token. Finally those who bought at the end of the ICO at a price of 870.44 USD per ETH and no more bonus paid effectively $4.35. Remember price per HERO was always 1 ETH = 200 HERO (plus applicable bonuses). It was a difficult call to decide at what price to list. Eventually together with the QRYPTOS team we decided to price at $4.7. Higher than what the average paid, providing a slight premium to those who participated during the ICO. So what happened today was that only (!) slightly more than 20,000 HERO tokens where both sold against each ETH and BTC. That is equal to 100 ETH each. This is nothing as compared to the 42,000 worth of Ether contributed during the ICO (less than half a percent). It would however make sense for referral participants, who potentially have their own expenses for marketing to sell HERO tokens at any price to cover their bills. Likewise it makes sense for somebody who came in in November during the presale to sell since Ethereum already appreciated 2x (during the ICO sometimes already 3x) against the price. This does not even take into account the current dip across the entire crypto market recently. It is not surprising to us that there are only relatively few buy orders and few people selling at a higher price. This shows that the big majority of HERO token owners are HODLing, which is the right thing to do in the absence of any major additional announcement since the ICO ended. We hope this explanation helps to understand today’s events. We are excited about the weeks and months ahead. It will be a long way to disrupt what banks couldn’t for hundreds of years but we accepted the challenge and out of it the HERO idea was born.  Thank you for your continuous support and trust. Have a good night.  Your HERO Token Team  https://medium.com/@HeroToken/hero-token-community-update-march-10th-c2b1eee1a4bb",False

We are now gearing towards the next exciting steps that will make waves in the financial industry of Southeast Asia. We invite you to be a part of the financial paradigm shift we envision through HERO.  One of the first steps in achieving this is through our partnership with QUOINE, who run some of Asia’s biggest exchanges. We recently conducted a special AMA session with QUOINE’s Vice President for Marketing, Katherine Ng, to talk about the upcoming exchange listing on March 9th and what it means for future HERO Token holders. Here’s the AMA transcript for your benefit: http://bit.ly/2sQBEAt  This is just one of the many steps we have planned for the HERO Community. We have more exciting news on the way and we hope you come along for this exciting journey we have that aims to spread financial inclusion to everyone through the power of blockchain and visionaries like you who show no fear in taking risks when faced with a great opportunity.  If you are a visionary who aims to spread financial inclusion then HERO will enable you do so. If you have already contributed, we applaud you.

First off all, we would like to thank over 10,000 Heroes that participated in the HERO token sale. For those who didn’t buy tokens yet, there are still a few hours left before the ICO ends tonight at 8 PM Singapore time (GMT+8).  Now, to answer the most important question: When will HERO tokens be issued?  The first round of HERO tokens will be issued by March 8 to contributors…  whose account status was VERIFIED before 00:00 AM Singapore time on February 29 who provided a valid signature and necessary information in case their contribution was not made with Ether who did not report a problem with their transaction The second round of HERO tokens will be issued by March 15 to contributors…  whose account status is still PENDING at 00:01 AM on February 29 whose account status is still UNCONFIRMED at 00:01 AM on February 29 who reported a problem with their transaction who did not provide a signature and all necessary information for a contribution made other than Ether Our team will do our best to check all remaining PENDING and UNCONFIRMED accounts and make sure they are VERIFIED by March 8. We will also review transactions and reported problems, and contact only those who we need additional documents from or have questions for by March 8. If you do not hear from us, this means that your transaction was successful and that you will receive your tokens by March 15.  Are there any exceptions?  No. You have until midnight to get your account VERIFIED. It is your responsibility to meet our KYC requirements. In the past week, we have constantly emailed every participant with a PENDING and UNCONFIRMED account status. It is important that you follow the detailed instructions provided in those emails, and that you email accounts@herotoken.io once you correct any mistakes in your account so our team can review it once more.  Read more here on the most common issues with accounts: https://medium.com/@HeroToken/account-verification-referral-update-65e088545b36  When will Bounty Tokens be issued?  Bounty participants will receive their tokens only after all members who participated in the token sale have completed their KYC and received their tokens, so that the total number of tokens sold can be determined which then provides the foundation to calculate the amount of tokens to be issued to bounty participants. Remember, the bounty pool is equal to 2% of all tokens sold. We were hoping that everybody would follow the instructions and complete the identity verification in time, but since this was not the case, all advisors, bounty participants and team members have to wait.  In conclusion, we are working hard to issue tokens as soon as possible. Our team reserves the right to delay the second round of token issuance to those who did not complete the identity verification process in time, to those who did not provide a signature for a contribution made other than Ether, to those who sent their contribution directly from an Exchange, and others who did not follow our instructions. Please be patient as we have to manually review remaining PENDING and UNCONFIRMED accounts and their transactions.  Also, please refrain from sending unnecessary follow up emails or Telegram messages. If you made a mistake with your transaction you need to report it here https://goo.gl/forms/Rclb26xt5jTfeXFg1 only if your problem is not listed email tokensale@herotoken.io  We will provide additional instructions how to add your HERO tokens to your wallet such as MyEtherWallet and how to check the balance of your HERO tokens. Meanwhile you can calculate your balance yourself, 1 ETH or equivalent gets you 200 HERO tokens plus applicable bonuses.  ⁉FAQ⁉  ❓How do I know my transaction was successful❓Please read this article https://bit.ly/2s42y7L  ❓When Exchange❓HERO Token will start trading on March 9th on QRYPTOS.

This week we would like to update you with the following.  For those of you who contributed to the HERO token sale, our team wants to thank you. In the past seven days, the HERO token ICO has received:  Ether 35,883.8529 Bitoin 36.4737 Ether Classic 1,420.5775 Ripple 218,680.1917 Litecoin 4.3562 Bitcoin Cash 41.0570  When looking at the USD value, it is currently at $ 30,231,254 — visibly lower than what it was days ago but this is bound to jump up to over $40 million once Ethereum climbs back up to $1100. Meanwhile, the current prices provide a great opportunity for those who either want to buy more HERO tokens or who have not bought HERO tokens yet. You have until February 28. Create an account to buy HERO tokens. Keep in mind that tokens are issued only at the end of the sale period.  In preparation for an uninterrupted token issuance process, we identified common problems with the contributions. Recently, we came across members who made contributions but will not be able to receive tokens due to one or more of the reasons below. If your account status is still Unconfirmed or Pending, you have until February 28 to reach a Verified account status in order to receive tokens.  If your account is Unconfirmed, please complete the identity verification process by filling out all information required. If your account is Pending, please check https://medium.com/@HeroToken/account-verification-referral-update-65e088545b36 to see if you made any of the following errors, then follow our specific solutions to get Verified. If you contributed without creating an account, please create one now at https://membership.herotoken.io/ with the same ETH wallet address. If you sent contributions directly from an Exchange i.e. Binance, OKEx, Bitfinex etc., you may not be able to receive HERO tokens at all or not without contacting the respective Exchange. Please complete the following form at https://goo.gl/forms/Rclb26xt5jTfeXFg1 If you contributed from a different wallet address than the one you registered your HERO Dashboard account, you will need to create a new account with that wallet address instead. Due to the high transaction volume on the Ethereum Blockchain, some transactions ran out of gas and were not successful. Please make sure your transaction was successful. Please follow the following instructions at http://bit.ly/2C7ReqH Some members sent ETH to ETC. Luckily, our team managed to recover their contributions and will issue HERO tokens to those affected. Once you have made changes to your account, email accounts@herotoken.io so our team can check your account once again.  On a positive note, we will be announcing the listing of additional exchanges soon.

As we come closer to the token sale date, here are some helpful tips to ensure you are ready and good to go:  Account Verification  If your account is either PENDING or UNCONFIRMED, the reason could be due to one or more of the following:  Using a government-issued ID with details that are purely in foreign characters (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, Korean)  Solution: Upload a passport has your English name  Your name on your ID doesn’t match your registration details (i.e. registration was with English name but ID is in Chinese, Japanese, Korean)  Solution: Upload an ID where your name is the same or create a new account (Note every email and wallet address can only be used once and those information can’t be changed)  Wrong birthday (.i.e. born on 2018)  Solution: Login to your Hero Dashboard at membership.herotoken.io and change your birthday  Below 18 years old  Solution: Unless you are 18 years old you are not able to participate in the token sale  Cropped or blurry photo ID  Solution: Upload a new ID by logging in to your Hero Dashboard  Incomplete information on the account  Solution: Complete missing information  Details on the account do not match those on the passport or government-issued ID  Solution: Either change your details or upload a new ID  Uploading a selfie or other types of inappropriate photos  Solution: Upload a valid government ID  Expired passport or government-issued ID  Solution: Upload a valid government ID  US citizenship  Solution: U.S. Citizen, U.S. Person, resident in the Territory of the British Virgin Islands or a citizen or person from a jurisdiction, in which it is impermissible or restricted to offer, distribute, purchase, sell or retain cryptographic tokens, are not eligible to participate in this token sale. The good news is that there is still enough time to fix this problem in order to participate in the token sale and receive tokens. No matter what your account status is you will be able to participate in the tokens sale but by the end of February you will need to reach VERIFIED in order to receive Hero Tokens.   We highly encourage you to complete all missing information required to pass our KYC, and to upload a clear photo of your valid passport or government-issued ID, as long as this is in English characters.  If you are unable to change your photo ID on the HERO Dashboard, please send a photo of your passport to accounts@herotoken.io directly, from the email address that you used to register your account in order for us to verify your account.  Referral Update  We now have a ‘My Referrals’ section on the Hero Dashboard! Now you can keep track of all your referrals and check how many people used your referral link.  If you did not know, we pay you a 5% commission on the amount your friends contribute during the token sale. Use your personal referral link (you can find inside your Hero Dashboard) and start inviting your friends: bit.ly/2mUjMzb  We hope these help in making your Hero Token experience as smooth as possible.

We’ve been getting the same question over and over again: When will Hero list on an exchange and when? Today we have the answer! Hero Token will be listed on QRYPTOS starting March 9, 2018. HERO will be the only token going live that day.  QRYPTOS is a crypto-crypto exchange which supports trading of multiple cryptocurrencies including ZEC, BTC, XRP, ETH, ETC, LTC, XMR. From January, QRYPTOS is averaging 3 new tokens a week, many of which like HERO will be listed on QRYPTOS first. The platform specializes in listing new coins with negative trading fees to generate initial liquidity. For all traders that provide liquidity to the platform, QRYPTOS will reward them with negative fees of up to 7.5 basis points.       QUOINE is one of the 1st crypto currency exchanges in the world to be licensed at the national level. They received a crypto currency license from the Japanese Financial Services Authority in September 2017. They were taken on as a client by Deloitte & Touche, one of the 1st crypto exchanges to be audited by a big 4 auditing firm. In November of 2017 QUOINE conducted one of the largest ICOs ever raising over 100mm USD. The team comes mostly from a finance background with over 200 years experience in the financial services industry including Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America. QUOINE utilizes a cold-wallet storage plan and place the protection of client assets at the center of all that they do.  Seth Melamad, Global Head of Operations at QUOINE “QRYPTOS will not have any USDT, nor will we ever”. “I’m proud of it.”  QRYPTOS will also be localized to Korean by the end of January, with a Korean Telegram group already set up.  You can sign up on QRYPTOS here: https://accounts.qryptos.com/sign-up  If you need any help regarding your QRYPTOS account please visit their site helpdesk. Please do not message Hero Token about your QRYPTOS inquires.  Learn more about what our team has been up to.

If your account is not Verified yet, please email Mikki at accounts@herotoken.io   Incorrect contributions. During the presale, there have been a number of incorrect contributions i.e contributors sent their Ether to our Ethereum Classic address and some sent their contribution directly from an exchange.

Please know that we are listening intently to everyone’s concerns and work towards a solution that will be beneficial for all parties. To help those who find continuing bounty work challenging , we are offering the following options:  1. OPTION 1: Pause Bounty Work For participants who have supported the bounty campaigns from August 16 until December 1, you now have to option to PAUSE. This means that if you did not violate any of the rules and have continuously supported the project, you can opt to pause (work another project) and will not be disqualified. This applies to all campaigns but primarily for participants of the Bitcointalk forum signature campaign.  2. OPTION 2: Continue Bounty Work For those participants who wish to increase their stakes in Hero, you are free to do so. Just continue contributing to the bounty campaigns you have enlisted yourself in and your stakes will continue to add up. After the token sale, you will receive your full share of Hero Tokens.  3. FOR NEW PARTICIPANTS Anyone who joins the Bounty Campaign after December 1 and does not violate any of the rules until the end of the token sale will receive their share of Hero Tokens. Naturally, this will be proportionate to the amount of work you contributed.  We hope these solutions will clarify things and also help those who already want to stop and engage in something different, whilst still securing their stakes in the Hero bounty campaigns. Please understand that as much as we would want to compensate you right now, the rules of the bounty campaign states that you have to fulfill your end until project is completed. Also, since there are no Hero Tokens minted yet, receiving your tokens in advance is not really an option.  We thank you for your support since the beginning of the Hero project and wish you will continue the bounty campaigns. Please feel free to reach out to us on Telegram if you have questions or further concerns. All bounty participants will eventually need to agree to the Hero Origen Token terms and conditions and potentially need to complete the same KYC requirements as those who purchase tokens during the sale.  — Your Hero Origen Token Team",False

We introduced Hero Token through various forums like Bitcointalk and allotted 2% of the Token distribution to several Bounty Campaigns — which was recognized by people in the community as one of the biggest bounty pools to be ever awarded on Bitcointalk!  In the last 8 days, #HeroToken has reached over 352,300 unique Twitter users and garnered over 1,142,938 impressions. On Facebook, a total of 481,506 friends and followers have been informed about Hero Token, thanks to the continued support of our bounty participants.  The pouring support and inquiries can also be seen in the Hero Token Slack channel. More than 8,000 worth of messages that inspire not just us, but everyone else who wish to be involved, to help the unbanked and underbanked get access to affordable credit.  From 130 users 8 days ago, now our Slack channel has now crossed the one thousand mark — and we are preparing for the next thousands.  Basing from the popular inquiries we have gotten in the first week, what we would love for you and the other thousands of early believers to know is that the pre-sale will happen soon.  That said we are glad to reveal the bonus / price during the pre-sale; *We are lifting the first secret: Pre-sale participants get 30% extra token.*  *Day 1 is the actual pre-sale. Wherein you will have the chance to get 30% more tokens in the first three hours! If you miss it, the remaining hours of Day 1 offers 20% more bonus tokens.

Full Announcement:  Hi Everyone,  We've written a smart contract through which you can purchase HERO tokens and want to take the opportunity to share it with you before the pre-sale is starting soon.  *--->>>  https://github.com/HeroToken/herotoken-ico <<<----*  HERO tokens are fully ERC20 compliant, and we expect to have them included on both the etherscan.io token listing and major exchanges. Unlike other ERC20 tokens, HERO tokens are modified for us to be able to distribute rewards to token owners pro rata. To purchase HERO tokens using ETH, you can simply send the ETH to the smart contract. The wallet from which the money is sent will immediately* receive the HERO tokens, but they will not be tradable until after the sale. For people who will be paying through other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, we will be manually issuing your tokens once we have confirmed the transaction details. We expect to be able to do this within three days of the end of the sale. After we have finished issuing all the tokens, we will enable the trading of HERO tokens and make an announcement.  Regarding rewards, we will be putting up a webpage where you can claim your share of distributed rewards. This page can also be used to check how much rewards you have with us. Please note that the rewards will be tied to the wallets which own the tokens at the time the rewards are distributed. In other words, transferring tokens will keep the current rewards with the original token owner but future rewards will be given to the new owner. For technical reasons, you will need to install a browser plugin like MetaMask in order for the page to be able to interact with the Ethereum network.  After this sale is over, no further HERO tokens can be minted due to how the contract is written.  * While this is different from what is written in our white paper it is positive development. From a practical point of view, this achieves the same thing as not giving the tokens until after the sale. But from a technical standpoint, we avoid the problem of the token handout at the end of the sale from running into the gas limit.  *This coming Monday we are announcing an Ask-Me-Anything (AMA) and hope to go into more details. *  _We welcome feedback from the community! You can learn more about our BUG-HUNT Bounty Program on Bitcointalk https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2088859.0 _  Happy Weekend!  _PS.

(1) Assuming the top part of the whitepaper on page 17 is in USD, average monthly loan release is 7,745K. Int at 2.99% yields 231K of which up to 20% will be for the investors = 46K per month. Or ~555K for 2019. At max 50M HERO tokens, that translates to about 1 cent of income per token. At the current rate, each token ~$1.50... Is this correct?  (2) The whitepaper says ""up to 20% of distributable interest income""... so it could be 0%? How is the actual percentage determined? Is it discretionary?  (3) Is the definition of ""distributable interest income"" as shown in the example on page 13 and not some accounting term that could essentially wipe this to be 0?  (4) Is there any protection in case of a buyout? For example, if PawnHero gets acquired by another company, does the new company have to follow the terms of HERO token contract? Or can they just say future distributable interest income will always be 0% since ""up to"" 20% will be distributed.  Any clarification will be appreciated. Thank you.",False

Great to see how deep some people dive before the ask questions.  (1) It is the number of loans not a dollar term. So the  calculations  were made under the wrong assumption and are therefore wrong  (2) 20% but lawyers advised us to use that language...  (3) Will not wiped to 0%. 20% of the interest income  (4) Will need to get back to you on that one.  Pretty sure the 20% would stay as part of whatever deal that might happen in the future.

Regarding Blockchain, because if micro-loans are recorded to the blockchain and everyone can access them, then they can hold those more accountable for bad behavior. Blockchain as a technology, has the potential to address all these innate intricacies of the lending process.  With the inherent concept of open ledger, decentralized platform, smart contracts and integrated central database, blockchain achieves transparency, cost effectiveness, regulatory compliance and risk analysis in the lending process. By reducing manual reviews, data re-entry and systems reconciliation, the system provides the company with immediate cost savings. Loan data processing can be done exclusively on the distributed ledger reducing risk and increasing transparency and responsiveness, the technology itself functions like a regulation.  Regarding what the ICO proceeds will be used for, please refer to page 16 and onward from the Whitepaper since the full explanation is too lengthy to be put here.  The Token Distribution   80% of available token are for sale open to the public  • 3% of available token are for early believers and advisors  • 2% of available token are for bounties  • 15% of available token are allocated to the founders for long-term alignment of interests  While 15% might seem high, it ensures that the team has an incentive to continue to improve Hero Token, keep in mind ETH had 50% premine and look where it is at now. As for the Bounties, the total Pool is close to 2.000.000$, it is one of the largest Bounties ever to be offered on Bitcointalk, if not the largest, I do not understand how you can call that very very low... Even as a percentage, 2% of Total Sold Tokens is very generous, especially considering the high cap.  If you wish to find out more about Hero Token, try and give the Whitepaper a read, it explains a lot of things very clearly, including the reason behind the ICO and much more than that. The PawnHero Team is comprised of 28 full-time employees, besides being backed by companies such as Alibaba or Softbank and people like Nix Nolledo and Paul Rivera, and they are here to do something useful. There are more people with a facebook account than a bank account, that is why this business needs the blockchain and why the blockchain needs this business.",False

The response and support we have received in such a short amount of time has exceeded our expectations.  In the past few days, we have encountered several questions regarding the start of the pre-sale.  The date of the pre-sale has not been set at the moment. But all I can share with you for now is that the pre-sale will last for a very limited amount of time, and there will be a cap. And while it is impossible for everyone to participate, if you already know how much you wish to contribute, then you may send me a direct message. We would be happy to see what we can do for you. On a positive note, to all those we already spoke with — your slot is confirmed._  Another question we often receive is, “what is the connection with Alibaba"", Alibaba is a LP (Limited Partner) in a fund that together with Softbank that invested in PawnHero last year. For more details you may visit Teddy Himlers' (VP at Softbank back then) LinkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/teddy-himler-84674719/ it states on his profile.  That said, at this point, we are constantly working hard to spread the word and build hype among a wider audience. At present, the project has been translated into 22 languages — making it convenient for anyone to read the ANN / Bounty and WP in their very own mother tongue. We also created a Chinese (#中文_chinese) and Korean (#한국어_korean) channel here on Slack. Our website, www.herotoken.io is updated regularly, and you can find the links to other languages at the bottom. Additionally, we created an explainer video, which is published on the website. We would appreciate your help to reach even more people. Please spread the word, we have one of the biggest bounty programs on Bitcointalk https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2088859 it will be worth your time.  If you have any questions, do feel free to message me directly. Otherwise, you may contact @kevinq, our Head of Marketing, @grant for everything around social media and bounties, @myrtandrade if you need help with graphics, psd etc. or @colorlessk as bounty manager, who has been working with us for the past few weeks.  Be very careful. As we reach more people, we have to protect ourselves against scammers who try to fool you. We have not disclosed any wallet address yet. The only way we will make it known is through or official website www.herotoken.io (never through direct message on Slack or Telegram). Please also note that we had some problems with the Telegram group, as such, I am unable to respond to any messages there. We've contacted the Telegram team but are still waiting to hear from them. Meanwhile @colorless is responding to your concerns on our behalf. If you need anything, do not hesitate to message me on Slack. If you come across any scammer, please report them directly to us.  Thanks you and all the best,   David, Co-Founder & Chairman""",False
