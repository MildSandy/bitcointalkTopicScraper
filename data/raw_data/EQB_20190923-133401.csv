But also keep in mind that the ICO was in January 2017 and that the value of BTC went x7 until now and was x18 at the ATH while the token is still on no exchange. With other words: Something went really wrong here and the bonus is not that much to compensate the missed opportunity of still holding on to the invested BTC. I still hope this project might turn out as a good one but it was a mistake to invest that early.",False

Equibit   Equibit Crowdsale Closed  APRIL 3, 2017  Friday, March 31st, marked the close of our initial coin offering, an event that brought together visionaries who see the potential for innovation within the capital markets, members of the crypto-community attracted by an existing, mainstream use case for blockchain application, as well as established participants from the securities community. We want to offer our sincere thanks and appreciation to everyone who participated in the ICO.  ""We're thrilled to see the value of the Equibit system validated by the community in this way,” says CEO Chris Horlacher. “Big things are on the horizon and it's all thanks to these early supporters!""  With 229,301 equibits (“EQB”) sold, we’re very pleased that the ICO has crowdfunded a significant amount for us to hit our initial development milestones. In total, roughly USD $570,000 (CAD $760,000) worth of equibits were sold.  All purchased equibits will automatically be deposited into user accounts at EDC’s web-wallet service. EQB tokens may be traded between users and, upon authorization by an issuer, represent an equity or debt interest in the designated company. The remaining equibits from the sale will be held, as per our sale terms and conditions.  Next Steps  With the close of the ICO we move into the next phase on our roadmap; releasing Github repos to the public for both the EDC Web Portfolio, or wallet, and Equibit Core for full Equibit mining. EDC has retained the services of Bitovi, a prominent Chicago-based design and development firm, to develop the Web Portfolio trading platform and progress has already been shown.  “The designers at Bitovi are really, really examining the whole user experience of creating your wallet, administering the security, how information is displayed to you and how you encounter it in your day-to-day use of the application,” explains Horlacher.  Experts in creating high-functioning applications for groups like Cision, T-Mobile, and Walmart, Bitovi is adept at creating products for a wide range of use cases and high volume of users.  New to the crypto space for enterprise clients will be EDC’s Supernode with certified FIPS 140-2 encryption. The Supernode will also allow companies to easily build industry-leading Bitcoin and Equibit infrastructure with hardware-based encryption ensuring powerful, and stable, performance.  Project discovery and preliminary design work for a minimum viable product (MVP) is underway, led by EDC’s Chief Technology Officer, Marc Godard. In alignment with the roadmap, Bitovi plans to have the first version of the Web Portfolio ready to meet the June milestone.  “We’re really excited to be involved at base level with a high-profile project like Equibit,” said Bitovi CTO Brian Moschel. “Chris and Marc have a strong vision for what a successful blockchain application looks like, and I think EDC is on the right path to lead the industry.”  Additionally, we’ve also further scaled our team, bringing on two new seasoned developers to accelerate product development. Please watch for an announcement on our website regarding these new additions to the EDC team.  The next phase is an exciting one for EDC as we switch gears and focus our full attention on development. Blockchain has enormous potential to decentralize aspects of the financial industry, disrupting the status quo with innovative new ways to handle transactions, securities clearance, and trading. We’re proud that EDC is at the forefront of this innovation.  EDC is looking to significantly improve the issuer and investor experience, all based on the Equibit blockchain allowing for easy securities registration, direct peer-to-peer communication, increased OTC market transparency, and industry compliance.  This is the first in a series of monthly company updates sharing our progress as we work towards our milestones and all related Equibit news.

We’ve already seen notable groups make moves towards exploring blockchain for their industries, including Nasdaq Linq and consortiums of Canada’s and the US’s biggest banks, but an enterprise offering further confirms and validates the use cases for existing businesses across all industries.  A Linux project, Hyperledger is an open, enterprise-grade distributed ledger framework and code base that has the ability to “transform the way business transactions are conducted daily.”  “It has become a way of organizing open source blockchain projects,” explains IBM Blockchain.  Fabric is IBM’s contribution. As a whole, Hyperledger Fabric “is an open source, modular, multi-channel transaction network built and maintained by the Hyperledger community.” Noted use cases include supply chain, capital markets, manufacturing, and healthcare.  An inherent value of blockchain? Compliance is at the very heart of the technology; instead of needing a regulator to monitor transactions for breaches, a blockchain’s code can set the rules with its network thereby maintaining compliance for each transaction.  Simply put, due to the nature of blockchain itself, the technology provides existing businesses with a much more efficient and cost-effective way of executing financial transactions, storing supply chain data for simpler reconciliation and ensuring trust and accountability across a wide and multi-layer network.  There have been multiple notable reports recently extolling these very virtues of blockchain technology, including a New York Times article discussing IBM’s partnerships with Walmart and shipping company Maersk to innovate supply chain management and an article from Harvard Business Review looking at how blockchain will transform the financial system. As such, where EDC sees the greatest benefit for mainstream adoption of blockchain is the increasing need for transparency - where appropriate, not all information across a distribution network needs to be shared with every party involved - secure transfer of assets and data, and easy dissemination of widespread communication.  EDC is early to develop blockchain technology dedicated to the capital markets, having built a public blockchain called Equibit; a decentralized platform that allows for the secure issuance and transaction of securities. Operating as an over-the-counter market, Equibit has a built-in client base; issuers and investors looking for enhanced security, efficiency, investor communications, and transparency within the typically shrouded markets.  Home to a majority of global trading volume, the Equibit blockchain provides issuers and investors with a much more streamlined OTC markets experience; no longer will there be a need for costly third party depositories or transfer agents, and trades and peer-to-peer communication will take place within the same platform.  Amongst groups looking to innovate existing business models with blockchain technology, a synopsis can be made: in order to successfully scale operations, businesses require improved methods of confidential and secure transactions between parties within a business network, a more streamlined system of communication in which information is transferred only between the necessary parties, and a network that ensures trust, transparency and accountability amongst users.  With security being one of the highest priorities for our increasingly digital world, blockchain technology is certain to move further into the mainstream. We look forward to being part of that momentum.   Article first appeared on Equibit's News page: https://equibit.org/post/blockchain-the-internet-of-transactions/",False

The fact that you are ignoring this issue and just talk about equality of the miners just confirms my (and some others in this thread) suspicion  that you dont care at all about the ICO investors.   See above reply.   We are happy how the sale is going and the quality of people who support us, we wouldn’t want to sell all our coins to people that don’t understand the value of EQB or our products and will just purchase to pump and dump our tokens and make a quick buck. We value supporters that are looking at the medium long term.  We appreciate there are people wanting to buy more, and certainly more are available. But at the moment the market has decided that an EQB is worth $3.13 and it would be irresponsible and unfair to our ICO buyers for the company to sell for anything less.  We are happy with our initial progress made with the $150k angel investment we received in 2015. We will be able to happily continue with what has been currently raised in the ICO, until we have more to show such as our software and tools.  Most tokens drop in value as soon as they are listed on an exchange after the ICO independently of if there is mining or not, everyone knows that. And it's due to people getting out of their positions. People that are short term speculators. We do not cater for these individuals but rather people who believes in us, understands exactly what we are trying to accomplish and see the value of our network, tools, applications.  We are here for the long run and we expect our supporters to be following suite, if you think otherwise there are plenty other tokens to buy for other projects which will do great for short term speculators.",False

EQB will cater for all sorts of companies that would like to release such assets using a decentralized platform. Each EQB is divisible by 8 decimals like Bitcoin. They can always be returned to blank state giving an incentive for underperforming assets to get out of the market and give way to new offerings.  Equibit will be open to anyone to use, of course big companies who are already on stock exchanges will have to perform a corporate action to switch over to the Equibit system. If the motion carries all the existing holders (i.e. the stock exchanges and institutional investors) they could then do a share-for-share swap. However there are thousands if not millions of secondary and otc markets and startups alone all over the world, Equibit cuts down the overhead costs of creating, managing and distributing shares. But iis also much more than that. You can read our whitepaper to find out more.  Our lawyers will actually be preparing a comprehensive legal resource for companies in all major jurisdictions to do this. There would be template shareholder/director resolutions, bylaw amendments etc. We also want to identify all the jurisdictions that allow securities to be issued in bearer (anonymous) form. I think that will be a huge plus and Equibit could help remediate the negative reputation that bearer assets currently have.  The incentive is that companies using our platform would no longer need to use a transfer agent, which represents a major portion of their investor relations overhead.

Feb. 14, 2017  TORONTO, Ontario — Equibit Development Corporation, creator of the Equibit blockchain and blockchain applications for the global securities industry, has unveiled a two-year roadmap for extended value creation in the wake of its ongoing initial coin offering.  EDC’s map includes the release of Equibit’s source code to software developers, the launch of a pro version of the EDC wallet application for the asset management community, specialized Equibit mining hardware, and the securitization of financial assets on the Equibit system, said Chris Horlacher, EDC’s chief executive officer.  “Securitization will populate Equibit with a number of popular investment choices that will excite our investors and get other issuers interested in using Equibit,” Horlacher said. “This is a perfect way to kickstart the system.”  Securitization on the Equibit platform will allow holders of equibits, a new digital asset, to diversity their portfolio by investing in equities in traditional industries such as pharmaceuticals, utilities or materials.  “Though there are more and more coin offerings by the day, there’s actually very little opportunity for diversification available to crypto investors,” Horlacher said.  Equibit is a peer-to-peer securities registration, market-making, and compliance platform anchored in blockchain technology. The system allows investors to hold directly-registered securities and communicate privately with one another. Equibit also features a public order book, direct-and-group communications, polls, proxies and a compliance system.  EDC has sold more than 140,000 equibits since launching its initial coin offering sale on Feb. 1, which are required for issuers and investors to make use of the platform. The company has offered to sell one million equibits out of a total of 22 million equibits potentially available. The sale, which will run for 59 days to March 31, is being held on a special sale page at EDC’s website.  Purchased equibits will be delivered to user accounts at EDC’s web-wallet service. EDC will retain any unsold equibits, as according to the sale’s terms and conditions.  The offering started with an initial batch of 100,000 equibits priced at $2 per coin. The crowdsale will adhere to a predetermined schedule, with the price for equibits to increase with each subsequent batch.  All equibits sold in the coin offering will be created in the EDC platform’s genesis block, constituting the inception of the system’s operation.  Proceeds from the crowdsale will be used to expand EDC’s team of developers, accelerate product development, support and expand the network of Equibit supporters, install enterprise infrastructure such as supernodes and market Equibit blockchain applications.

Equibit will be open to anyone to use, of course big companies who are already on stock exchanges will have to perform a corporate action to switch over to the Equibit system. If the motion carries all the existing holders (i.e. the stock exchanges and institutional investors) they could then do a share-for-share swap. However there are thousands if not millions of secondary and otc markets and startups alone all over the world, Equibit cuts down the overhead costs of creating, managing and distributing shares. But iis also much more than that. You can read our whitepaper to find out more.  2. Companies in any countries should be able to use Equibit. Our lawyers will actually be preparing a comprehensive legal resource for companies in all major jurisdictions to do this. There would be template shareholder/director resolutions, bylaw amendments etc. We also want to identify all the jurisdictions that allow securities to be issued in bearer (anonymous) form. I think that will be a huge plus and Equibit could help remediate the negative reputation that bearer assets currently have.  3. The incentive is that those companies would no longer need to use a transfer agent, which represents a major portion of their investor relations overhead. Equibit is much more than simply a securities register, it can be used to communicate with all our your investors, poll them, handle proxies, and KYC issues in the secondary market. Apple has millions of investors worldwide and doing that using existing services is terribly expensive, slow, and insecure.  4. It's a fair question, but there's no objective answer (value is subjective). Every ICO buyer is making their own educated guesses as to what the token will do.",False

If you are in Washington DC on January 31st you are welcome to join the Equibit Launch Party!  More info: https://www.meetup.com/BitcoinDC/events/236831327/  Join EDC in celebration of the launch of the Equibit (Equibit.org) Initial Coin Offering. Held at a to-be-disclosed location in Washington D.C., attendees will enjoy hors-d’oeuvres, drinks and get to meet the executives and senior management. CEO Chris Horlacher will also be giving a talk about the promise of Equibit and its potential impact on the capital markets industry.  EDC is building Equibit, the world's first peer-to-peer equity marketplace and a complete platform for issuers to manage their investor relations without the need for depositories and transfer agents. Equibit allows issuers to use cryptocurrency tokens, called 'equibits', to authorize and disseminate their shares. It also includes a secure, P2P communications system allowing for private messages and polls to be instantly sent to individuals and groups on the network. A public component of the communications system allows for the announcement of bid/ask type messages, in the same vein as an open outcry trading pit but on a global scale. Investors can designate and revoke proxy rights with a simple click of their mouse. Equibit also includes trading passports, an ingenious way of handling the KYC issues currently faced by blockchain technology. Private issuers and investors can quickly join vetted communities on the network, gaining easy access to pools of capital and investment opportunities in an environment that maintains compliance with securities laws over exempt distributions.  EDC is also the creator of the world's first Supernode. A cryptocurrency node capable of transacting on both Bitcoin and Equibit and performing all cryptographic operations in hardware rather than software. It is certified FIPS 140-2 Level II compliant by NIST and the CSE, offering unrivaled security over private keys, and incredible speed for enterprise. Functionality is delivered through an API, making integration with existing financial applications easy.  Equibit White Paper at Cornell University: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06953",False

I am strongly considering investing during the ICO and I have some questions of my own:  * How many people are working full-time on the project? It seems that at least two of the team members listed on the website (Brent Kievit-Kylar, working at Google, and Nathan Wosnak, President of Ubitquity LLC) also have other commitments. * How many people have non-trivial contributions to the codebase of the project (i.e. are active developers)? * Do you have an office? * How many companies do you have in the pipeline, which have agreed to issue shares on the Equibit platform? * When do you plan to release a development roadmap? * Why isn't the project open source and do you have any demonstrable evidence of the work that has been ongoing for the year since the seed round? * How do you arrive at the weighted average price of $6.66/coin for the ICO?  Last, but not least: earlier in the thread someone mentioned the fact that a company, which wants to issue shares on the Equibit platform, doesn't need to buy a lot of Equibits -- they only need to buy one and can then split it into 10M pieces. IMHO, this is a huge issue, as I don't see any reason why every company wouldn't do exactly this. In light of this, how did you decide on a starting supply of 1M coins from the ICO? This would effectively mean that 1M companies can use the platform. I don't think this is a realistic expectation even in the very, very long-term and will most certainly drive the prize of Equibits down even without considering the fact that there are an additional 21 million to be mined.

Quite a few companies have inquired on how Equibit could suit their needs. One of them has a shareholder register with over 30,000 investors, however at this time we cannot disclose names. Stay tuned for announcements in the near future as things progress.   * When do you plan to release a development roadmap?

A genuine question related to this: how many companies are trading OTC in the world at the moment? I tried looking this up, but couldn't find any guesstimates.  Yes EQB's are divisible to 8 decimal places just like bitcoin. That being said, there are literally millions of companies worldwide that can make use of this system and many of them are going to need much more than 1 EQB. Apple has 5.3 billion shares in circulation and so just to re-create that they would need a minimum of 53 EQB... And even then a single satoshi's-worth of those shares would be $122.

The way it'll work is:  1 - Users enter the # of EQB they want to buy and hit 'Buy'  2 - Our ICO site calculates the final price for orders when users confirm their order.  3 - If there's enough EQB left then the system will hold that amount of EQB for 2 minutes while a user pays.  4 - If they don't pay in the allotted time, they lose their position.  What happens if competing orders come in at roughly the same time that takes from the top tranche?  It's first come first served, whoever gets their order in first has the opportunity to buy, unless they time out. When the server gives the final price, the order is reserved. Also if users time out too many times the system will ban them from placing any more orders.  So lets say that only part of an order can be filled at the cheaper tranche will they get only that amount or have to re order the whole order?  The server will price across tranches. For example:  Let's say a user orders 1,000 EQB, but only 200 are left in the current tranche, they will pay the lower price for 200, and the higher price for the remaining 800. And the site calculates the final price when the user confirms their order so he/she is aware. If the user isn’t happy, don’t pay for the order until it expires.",False

We appreciate your feedback. Escrow has been used for decades by companies raising funds because the logistics of doing it all themselves was nightmarish. Escrow agents specialize in getting through all of the investor paperwork, collecting investor funds, and making a lump-sum distribution to the company when the offer closes. It’s always been about getting companies capitalized in the most efficient way. Escrow agents have no responsibility or duty to do your due diligence, and they won’t. Nor will they do anything to drive a project forward and deliver, that’s what CEO’s do. EDC has built the infrastructure needed to collect purchaser information and payment and so the primary purpose of using an escrow agent has already been dealt with.

More info: https://www.meetup.com/BitcoinDC/events/236831327/  Join EDC in celebration of the launch of the Equibit (Equibit.org) Initial Coin Offering. Held at a to-be-disclosed location in Washington D.C., attendees will enjoy hors-d’oeuvres, drinks and get to meet the executives and senior management. CEO Chris Horlacher will also be giving a talk about the promise of Equibit and its potential impact on the capital markets industry.  EDC is building Equibit, the world's first peer-to-peer equity marketplace and a complete platform for issuers to manage their investor relations without the need for depositories and transfer agents. Equibit allows issuers to use cryptocurrency tokens, called 'equibits', to authorize and disseminate their shares. It also includes a secure, P2P communications system allowing for private messages and polls to be instantly sent to individuals and groups on the network. A public component of the communications system allows for the announcement of bid/ask type messages, in the same vein as an open outcry trading pit but on a global scale. Investors can designate and revoke proxy rights with a simple click of their mouse. Equibit also includes trading passports, an ingenious way of handling the KYC issues currently faced by blockchain technology. Private issuers and investors can quickly join vetted communities on the network, gaining easy access to pools of capital and investment opportunities in an environment that maintains compliance with securities laws over exempt distributions.  EDC is also the creator of the world's first Supernode. A cryptocurrency node capable of transacting on both Bitcoin and Equibit and performing all cryptographic operations in hardware rather than software. It is certified FIPS 140-2 Level II compliant by NIST and the CSE, offering unrivaled security over private keys, and incredible speed for enterprise. Functionality is delivered through an API, making integration with existing financial applications easy.  Equibit White Paper at Cornell University: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06953",False

Is it correct that 1M are being pre-mined for the ICO? That appears correct with 10 tranches of 100,000. This means the remaining 21M will be created similar to the 2009 bitcoin reward schedule.  Please clarify.   The Equibit team will not have any EQB individually, as per the terms and conditions of the sale they are not allowed to hold any. There will be 1M premined and the remaining unsold portion of EQB will go to the company EDC, and EQB will also be mined on the blockchain.",False

Quote from: sanchicharro on January 19, 2017, 07:57:00 PM  Interesting, tell us a little bit more about this web wallet, will it support 2FA? Not a fan of having my coins/tokens online, as it is a bitcoin fork, is there any chance to be supported by (for example) ledger nano s?  Also, are there any conversation with cripto exchanges (poloniex et al.)?  How are you going to market the product? I saw a little bit of press coverage here and there but I'd like to know what are your ideas regarding marketing.  One last question, have you guys ever heard of ICONOMI? (wink, wink)  Best,  Great question, yes the web wallet will support 2FA We are talking to a few crypto exchanges at the moment. We are currently talking to companies that are looking to issue as well as investors. Regarding marketing, we are working with a number of marketing groups. Our focus so far has been on the crypto community, investor community, and chinese community. We are always open to new ideas. We are aware of Iconomi but unlike their model of portfolio management, we are actually allowing companies to issue their own equity on a blockchain.

Essentially the EQB/BTC price is fixed using a trailing USD/BTC 24h average blended from several major exchanges so once you hit the ""Buy"" button, the price is locked in and you must make their payment in about 5 minutes or lose the reservation.",False

Equibit   Equibit - A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Equity System The Equibit whitepaper is now available to read on the Cornell University Library arXiv system (Updated December 19, 2016)   Abstract:  The registration, transfer, clearing and settlement of equities represents a significant part of economic activity currently underserved by modern technological innovation. In addition, recent events have revealed problems of transparency, inviting public criticism and scrutiny from regulatory authorities. A peer to peer platform facilitating the creation and exchange of directly registered shares represents a shift in equity markets towards more efficient, transparent operations as well as greater accessibility to the investing public and issuing companies. Blockchain technology solves the problem of transaction processing and clearing but the fungibility of their units pose a challenge in identifying the issuers and holders of specific equities. Furthermore, as the issuers are in a constant state of flux the benefits of a decentralized network are lost if a central manager is required to cancel equities from companies that no longer exist. We propose a solution to these problems using digital signatures, based on blockchain technology.   In a nutshell, what is Equibit?  Equibit Group has designed and built its own blockchain we call Equibit; a peer-to-peer network for creating and transferring equity. This allows issuers and investors anywhere to instantly transfer title to equity units called ‘equibits’ without any reliance on a transfer agent... and at practically no cost. With the use of equibits issuers can even restrict their units to prevent transfers of their equity to unauthorized parties.   What makes Equibit so great?   Equibit was created to address the inefficiencies of the current equity model and bring fairness to all involved. Here are just some of the features that makes Equibit the best solution:  Security: The Equibit blockchain is built on world-class security, using encryption that matches or exceeds most financial institutions. It allows for the creation of unforgeable equity units and an incorruptible chain of custody. This, in turn, is supported by the world’s largest and most powerful computer network; therefore you can be confident that your assets are secure against attackers.   Decentralized Settlement: Equibit is a peer-to-peer network for creating and transferring equity and debt securities. This allows issuers and investors anywhere to instantly transfer title to cryptocurrency tokens called ‘equibits’ without any reliance on a transfer agent or central depository... and at practically no cost. With the use of equibits issuers can even restrict their units to prevent transfers of their securities to unauthorized parties..   Investor Messaging: Our application includes a P2P communications protocol for easy and secure distribution of bid/ask orders, proxy assignments, meeting notices, MD&A’s and much more. Issuers can even privately poll their shareholders and create a vote tally that all participants can audit.   Earnings Distributions: Paying out dividends has never been easier. With just a few clicks, issuers can now create a Bitcoin-denominated distribution and send payments to all their shareholders of record.   Trading Passports: Equibit makes it easier than ever to comply with regulations over exempt distributions. Trusted actors on the network can certify the status of accredited investors and issuing companies can connect to these communities allowing the free-flow of their shares within trusted groups.   Market Information: Getting information about companies is easier than ever on the Equibit platform! Due to the transparent nature of blockchain technology, data on completed trades and earnings distributions is stored publicly and can be examined at any time by anyone connected to the network.   Who is the target market for Equibit?  The Equibit platform is being built to be used by investors of any caliber. From the hobby investor all the way up to the institutional investors, the experience will be the same.   Equity Market Facts       Underlying stock exchanges like the NYSE, NASDAQ, and TSX are share depositories and transfer agents. The volume of securities cleared by these intermediaries dwarfs the trading occurring on public exchanges due to the fact that most companies aren't actually listed on them.  For equity markets to work, issuers, investors and exchanges rely heavily upon these intermediaries. While transfer agents makes registration, clearing and settlement easier, it also introduces unnecessary costs and risks that Equibit eliminates.   Our Product Line  EQUIBIT SOFTWARE: At Equibit Group we’re not only changing the way capital markets work; we’re changing the way blockchain applications are built. By integrating multiple blockchains and seamlessly coordinating activities across them we're able to build applications with a robust and complete set of features required by an issuer/investor relationship.  EQUIBIT CORE: The Equibit reference standard. This application contains all the software necessary to run a full node on the Equibit Network. Equibit Core also interfaces with Bitcoin in order to complete the user experience. All functionality is delivered through a command line interface so developers can add whatever GUI they desire or integrate into their existing financial software.  EQUIBIT PORTFOLIO: For individual investors and issuers looking to participate on the Equibit platform. Our portfolio app allows you to transfer, buy, sell, authorize and cancel equibits. It also includes Bitcoin functionality allowing you to easily and seamlessly complete trades and communicate securely with other market participants.  EQUIBIT SUPERNODE: Now it's easy for enterprise and app developers to build industry-leading Bitcoin and Equibit infrastructure. With certified FIPS 140-2 security over your private keys and high speed, hardware-based encryption you can be sure your application will perform under even the heaviest loads.  We are currently working on a soft-launch of Equibit and are working with interested miners. Once the wallet is ready, and a sufficient seed of miners has been formed everything will be made public. We should be ready for soft-launch in December 2017, with hard launch following not long after.   ICO Information  The Equibit crowdsale is officially closed.  We would like to extend a sincere thank you to all participants as we now shift our focus to the next phase of development. You will be able to collect your EQB tokens once the wallet is released.  We thank everyone for their support of Equibit and look forward to this new and exciting chapter.  We are planning another opportunity to buy tokens before launch.
