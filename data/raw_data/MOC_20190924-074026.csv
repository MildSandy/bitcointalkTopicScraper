A player can identify real properties anywhere on the globe and add them into our virtual universe so that everyone has a chance to obtain them. Virtual objects in the game can be sold and traded for cryptocurrency, so users have the motivation to spend time and effort on raising the value of their real estate. Mossland is based on blockchain cryptocurrency, so it is somewhat similar to the real-life property market in terms of profit. However, this is a completely new system in gaming, where people can interact, show their creativity and intelligence in unique ways.  Mossland itself, as a virtual world and a platform is outstanding and impressive in many ways. First and foremost, you can own a landmark that represents historical value, fame and beauty: it can be the Eiffel Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge or any other famous place around the globe. Having bought a property, you can add colorful AR objects to increase the number of visitors or simply to make the property more fun and attractive. Mossland also provides the possibility of location-based advertisement: your architectural object or building becomes a popular ad spot for making money. And unlike the physical world, you have less limitations and more space for creativity. In our universe, players can become professional landlords, trade property to build an empire, acquire Moss Coin and cash out for real money.  The platform uses GPS technology: users will be able to compete to acquire virtual property buildings and shops in their immediate vicinity. These “check-in games” will be exciting races to see who can get the coolest landmarks first. General smartphone performance has significantly increased in recent years, so by combining location-based technology with AR/VR, we can create a completely new and unique mobile service experience. Ultimately, Mossland is the next step in the evolution of gaming: it is a deep system, driven by human interaction in a beautiful virtual world, where people can use their mind, imagination and inventiveness to buy, change and trade anything from their own house (in its virtual version, of course) to something as prominent as the Louvre or the Colosseum.  https://medium.com/@moss.land/mossland-the-evolution-of-virtual-gaming-34fecc34d53",False

The colorful neon cityscapes shown in Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell and other futuristic films will soon combine with anything we can imagine, create and design. It can be mysterious and enchanting: a contrast between the dark sky and a man-made neon rainbow. Or it can be full of sunshine, clouds and childhood dreams — a forest of vibrant green inside a concrete city. The ultimate choice of how to enhance reality is ours alone.  The boundaries are limitless, driven by the most powerful graphics engine of all: the human imagination. This is the philosophy behind the creative vision of Mossland, powered by our expert team and awesome AR tech.  We aim to take locations, landmarks and architectural objects that are already famous, beautiful and full of history… and infuse them with a new level of technological magic that will allow our fantasies to become real.  Imagine the elegant streets of Paris: the Louvre, the Elysian Fields, the Arch of Triumph… the tiny coffee and croissant cafes, the art galleries and sunlit wine shops with dusty barrels, the smell of oak and fruit. And now imagine this already amazing city infused with bright colors impossible to see outside of a dream, populated with legendary creatures from mythology and pop culture. Look up: there, intertwined in the steel framework of the Eiffel tower — a giant, snake-like dragon with red and gold scales, sleeping in the morning sun. Puffs of smoke rise from his nostrils as he slumbers. Beneath him, in the streets, over the busy people heading to work — a vibrant web of neon signs advertising the city’s most interesting businesses, its secret areas and delicious restaurants.  Imagine the brightly lit, colorful and active nights of Tokyo and Seoul, already fascinating in their technological inventiveness and vibrancy. See them now in your mind, populated by digital reflections of humans, beasts, fairy-tale spirits and animals. Get a seat in your favorite karaoke bar, full of red and green lights, listen to the energetic music and have a drink next to the kaiju monster that lives next door. See your name blazing above the two skyscrapers you just bought, in bright purple letters, like a bridge between two towers. Let everyone in your city know who you are through the creativeness of your design, in the magical second reality that Mossland paints over the usual one.  The world that we are building for the Mossland universe is more than a game, it is a second home, full of things to spark your inspiration and sense of beauty. We invite you to become part of something wonderful, to be one of the people to establish this new reality for everyone else. Climb the Statue of Liberty with us, plant a digital tree atop its crown that will flower with bright crimson, orange and violet above the majestic skyline of Manhattan. Place a manticore or griffin egg in the Colosseum, so this fantastic beast will soar above the sandy arena. Write a neon sign over the main entrance that says “Gladiators welcome!”. Combine the old, the new, the imagined and the real in a captivating image that will amaze both friends and strangers.  All of these things can be made possible in augmented reality, where dreams are more important than the laws of physics.
