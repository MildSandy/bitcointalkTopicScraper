Gnosis is the second largest prediction market platform by market cap behind only Augur.  After acquiring an affinity for cryptography from Simon Singh’s “The Code Book”, Stefan realized that one of the best use cases for blockchain were prediction markets. At first, he decided to build on Bitcoin. However, after one conversation with Joe Lubin, Co-Founder of Ethereum, the team was convinced to make the switch.  Gnosis is also building a decentralized exchange (DEX), DutchX, to remedy problems inherent in both centralized and decentralized exchanges. By leveraging an auction-style trading model, DutchX removes the unfair advantage of miners known as “front-running,” and enables fairer price discovery mechanisms.  Stefan was a member of a panel on decentralized exchanges at Fluidity Summit that also included founders from of IDEX, Airswap, Ledger, and others. After hearing about the potential (and flaws) for decentralized exchange, I felt compelled to learn more.  So please enjoy this chat discussing barriers to adoption for DEX’s, and Gnosis’s strategy for solving these shortcomings.",False

These deployment gas costs can bar some dApps from reaching a wider audience. Mitigation of these costs using monolithic smart contracts carries the risk of having to maintain a large monolithic smart contract.

We’ve demonstrated that the mechanism of the Gnosis Dutch Exchange remedies these drawbacks: it allows for a fair price finding mechanism that encourages participants to reveal their true willingness to pay and eliminates front-running, a major problem that both order book based centralized and decentralized exchanges are facing. Front-running is the advantage of someone being able to act on information that is available to them first (e.g. miners who can decide in which order they are putting transactions into a block, and in which block they’re putting the transactions into).  In the first state of the DutchX, when sellers deposit their sellTokens, they potentially have more than 6 hours to do so. This reduces the emphasis on which block their sellOrder is mined. Bidders, being active in the second state when the auction is running, have a similar advantage: The price function decreases so slowly that the price will not significantly change over the course of a number of blocks. The price for all sellers and the price for all bidders will be the same — making it irrelevant at which point their transaction is mined. The exchange itself also cannot act on information ahead of time: the smart contract code of the DutchX matches automatically and on-chain.  Hence, with batched orders entering the block at the time the auction clears with the same price for all bidders and sellers, neither miners nor the exchange itself, or other participants will be able to game the system.  The traditional order book model of a centralized exchange, which is a continuous auction model executing orders one-by-one, seems inadequate to be implemented on the blockchain — it even amplifies the front-running problem. There is no continuous time on the blockchain, there is only block time! On the one hand, this leaves more time to front-run, but on the other hand, it also allows for more parties to front-run due to already publicly available information (before the transaction is executed).  The DutchX implements an entirely different design which is more suitable to the technological environment of the blockchain, and results in a number of additional benefits compared to other decentralized exchanges.",False

We hope this series will shed light on the exchange’s features and leave you not only well prepared for the DutchX launch (planned for start of Q2), but also ready to participate.  This week, we’d like to run through all things tokens.  Trading Tokens on the Gnosis DutchX The written smart contract for the Gnosis DutchX is compatible with any ERC20 token. When we talk about a particular auction, we mean any token-pairing, i.e. Token A is being “sold” (auctioned off; sellToken) and Token B is the token used to buy Token A (buyToken). Auctions for any token-pairing run independently from one another.  Fiat currencies as well as crypto-currencies that aren’t ERC20 compatible (i.e. ETH) will not be tradable on the DutchX. Hence, users need to hold WETH (“wrapped ETH”) to be able to trade ETH for other ERC20 tokens.  Anyone is able to list ERC20-compatible tokens following a standardized process, as explained in detail below.  Listing Tokens Let’s assume you’d like to trade the Y Token which is not yet listed on the DutchX. If you’d like to introduce the Y Token to the exchange, you will first have to list the WETH/Y Token pairing. To do so, WETH will be the token auctioned off (sellToken) and the Y Token will be the token bought (buyToken).  For the WETH/Y Token pairing to be listed, you will have to fund the auction with at least $10,000 worth of ETH as sellTokens. You will also have to set a price for the WETH/Y Token pairing as we will start the auction at twice that chosen price. The auction will start 6 hours after the conditions for the token listing are met.  When setting the price, you’re incentivized to choose the real market price. If you quote a higher price than the market price, you increase the running time of the auction — other than that, this strategy won’t have an impact. If you quote a lower price than half the market price, the auction will start running at below market value and hence also clear below value, resulting in you selling your initial ETH funding at a loss. If the price you quoted is marginally too low, you simply decrease the running time of the auction.  Initiating any particular Token-Pairing After the new Y Token has been listed using WETH, every specific Y Token-pairing to be traded will have to be initiated separately. To ensure that there is sufficient trading volume, this initial listing will have to be funded with the equivalent of at least $10,000 worth of ETH. For example, if you’d like to trade the Y/A token-pairing, and A as well as Y are already listed on the DutchX, you will have to initiate this particular Y/A token-pairing by funding the auctions Y/A or A/Y with at least $10,000 worth of sellVolume combined. You will not have to set a price — we calculate the price based on the A/ETH and Y/ETH rates on the DutchX.  https://blog.gnosis.pm/on-all-things-tokens-1fd977184649",False

We have a long road in front of us, and are moving forward with increasing momentum.  Both our website and white paper haven’t seen an update since our token sale, and certainly didn’t reflect all the things we’re currently working on, or convey the mission that drives us every day. That’s why many of us have bundled their last energy of 2017 working on a website and white paper overhaul that was long overdue.  We’re glad to welcome 2018 with a new website. New year, new me!  What's new?

Here are some interesting stats: https://steemit.com/ethereum/@kingscrown/gnosis-ico-raised-12-5million-dollars-in-10-minutes-making-the-token-312-million-usd-market-capitalization-worth  The article mentions these stats:  Average (mean) address sent 330 ETH ($16,550) The median (50th percentile) address sent 20 ETH ($1,004) Participation: 758 addresses Users bought: 418,777.777777777777427493 Gnosis  We have only 758 different addresses. Let us assume there are different persons. 758 persons own Gnosis Tokens... This means if nobody sells they have 758 potential active users. I assume most of them are investors and are not interested in using Gnosis. Users would not buy at this crazy price. They can just buy when the token is out. Well great, they will probably have almost no active users on their platform. Investors will not sell because there will be no demand for the coin at these crazy high prices and most investors will most likely not go down below the ICO price. This will seriously damage the project as many people will not recognize why they would join at these crazy prices as this feels like a ripoff. Great stuff Gnosis, Augur is already rising. A project needs active users, if it has no active users it is called dead. This outcome is not favorable when trying to gain new users and if it does not gain new users it will lose in value. Conclusion: they shot themselves in the own foot! Seriously this ICO is a fucking joke and the investors will learn the hard way that they were just way too greedy. And yes Gnosis will learn that too. This will be like ZCash on the first day all over again starting at some crazy high price and going fast down. If this coin SHOULD go up I lose all faith!!!

I invested yesterday while it had already said ""auction ended"", and the transaction went through with the eth adress created by Gnosis, and I just tried 0.5 eth now at the time of writing and transaction still went through. It would not be the first time an ICO page is showing wrong informations. I would not see the point of the Gnosis team to create such an abnormal situation. Also, Vitalik Buterin, not known to be a scammer clearly approved this ICO management and is an advisor, and when we see Ethereum I would not understand why back up Gnosis if the project is shady or bad handled. What is sure is that this ICO was not clear as to the model, many people did not understand the concept, and with othe ICO's like Melon or IEX ending in matters of hours, people just did not want to miss the train. Another important thing, if we look at 2 of the top cryptos who are Bitcoin and Dash we know for both that the creators both hold large amounts of tokens in wallet (1 million for Satoshi and 2 millions for DASH founder) and both have not used their tokens and did not even ""lock"" their wallet, and still people ""trust"" these coins even if some will disagree for sure specially about one of the two examples. So Gnosis clearly is not ideal regarding the process, but it does not mean the ROI will be catastrophic, just it will take some time to be positive ROI. Eth did not trade after ICO for example and it did not matter, only made the project more strong. So let's wait and see how this turns out. After reading a bit on Gnosis, it is reasonnable to think other ""future token launches"" will be made. And I sure hope a big part of remaining funds will be locked for a long period, a statement from Gnosis will be reassuring.",False

Investors will have around 10-20% of the gnosis tokens, gnosis will have the other 80-90% of the token. Because Gnosis made such a shitty blogpost about the ICO that can only be described as a marketing paper, people did not exactly realize what they got into and when they realize that it will be too late. The ICO already ended. Now with a sell price of around 25$ people realize what a bubble they created, which will lead to a massive orice decrease and panic sells. Think about it, if this ends at 25$ and there are 10 million coins and investors have only about 20% of these coins, then these 10million coins are worth about 250million dollars. Augur has a market cap of 140million dollars. And there the majority of the coins is not in the hands of the developers. If the developers in the case of gnosis decide to sell some coins... Oh boy... This thing will fall apart! This may be an extreme example, but do the math for 10$ or for 5$ and the result will be quite similar...

From my point of view, you should consider doing more rounds of ICO instead of one with a cap of $12M.

If you have a question that has not been answered here, go ahead and ask here, on our Slack, or on out forum. Common questions will be added to this post.   What is Gnosis?  Gnosis.pm is a decentralized prediction market built on the Ethereum protocol. Gnosis provides an open platform for anyone to predict the outcome of any event and plans to drastically simplify the creation of customized prediction market applications. We view financial and betting applications as ripe for innovation using our open and decentralized model. Our vision is a future in which prediction markets are used to optimize an incredible range of processes and to provide a platform for information sales. Gnosis is a ConsenSys backed project and was founded by Martin Koeppelmann and Stefan George, who previously founded and built Fairlay.com, a centralized Bitcoin prediction market. Together with ConsenSys we are excellently positioned to execute on our ambitious vision.  If you'd like to learn more about gnosis and prediction markets, we have some great articles on the Gnosis blog; Martkets for the Future, and Markets for Security are a good starting point.   What is Ethereum? Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third party interference.  These apps run on a custom built blockchain, an enormously powerful shared global infrastructure that can move value around and represent the ownership of property. This enables developers to create markets, store registries of debts or promises, move funds in accordance with instructions given long in the past (like a will or a futures contract) and many other things that have not been invented yet, all without a middle man or counterparty risk1.  Ethereum allows censorship resistant execution of smart contracts, which secures users as well as market makers on our platform and makes our software globally available.  1 https://www.ethereum.org   What is a prediction market? A prediction market allows users to buy and trade binary positions on the outcome of any arbitrary event. ""According to most experts in economics and finance, speculative markets are exemplary info institutions. That is, active speculative markets do very well at inducing people to acquire info, share it via trades, and collect that info into consensus prices that persuade wider audiences."" (Hanson 2013) As such, prediction markets provide an interesting, and potentially more accurate, oracle for the outcome of future events as well as for the reporting of the outcomes of past events.  * Hanson 2013 - Futarchy: Shall We Vote on Values, But Bet on Beliefs?   What is the difference between Gnosis and Augur? The two main differences are:  1. Gnosis is a platform for prediction market applications. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for 3rd party developer to build prediction market applications which are all based on the same liquidity pool. 2. As a platform Gnosis is oracle agnostic. We support all kind of oracles, centralized, decentralized or combinations.  Find more details in this blogpost.     Will all markets be priced in Gnosis tokens? No - a market creator can choose any token they like - Gnosis is currency/token agnostic. Gnosis tokens are only relevant for the fees that the Gnosis system will charge. All fees can be paid with the token the market is traded in or alternatively with WIZ. It will always be possible for an end user to use a Gnosis application without caring about Gnosis tokens.   Will Gnosis be available on other Blockchains other than Ethereum?  The Gnosis team is deeply involved in the Ethereum community. Nonetheless is our main goal to build a successful prediction market platform. Currently, Ethereum is to us very clearly the best choice to reach this goal. But we can imagine a future in 3-5 years in which a platform like Gnosis can become blockchain agnostic and operate across multiple underlying blockchains. It is also possible that this will be realised purely within Ethereum whereby different shards would be equivalent to different blockchains with different trade-offs for different parameters.   How will trading on Gnosis work?  At its core a prediction market does two things - it allows to create predictive assets (tokens that represent a specific real world even and which will have a guaranteed value of 1 unit if this outcome happens - 0 otherwise) and second the trading of those assets. Since Gnosis is an open platform those assets can be traded on any exchange (decentralized exchanges, centralised exchanges or even services like “Shapeshift”). However - predictive assets have some properties which make some market mechanisms more effective - like the use of automated market makers that guarantee to provide liquidity. Those mechanisms will be the focus of the Gnosis team but will actively contribute to making predictive assets tradable on many places. You can find a bunch of fairly technical discussion around this topic here (https://forum.gnosis.pm/c/technical).   What is the current status of Gnosis? Gnosis is currently in early stage beta and is geared towards developers for the time being. You can find the code on our GitHub. We have three live versions right now, each with different purposes:  Live main-net beta: This version is live on the main-net using real ETH. It is designed to be a real-life test case for the economics of the gnosis platform. Test-net beta: The test net version exists so that you can try to break things without any financial risk. Uport version: Another main-net test, this one is designed to test our uPort integration.   Where can we meet the team? Starting in 2017 we are based in Berlin. We regularly attend Ethereum related conferences and meetups all over the world.   When is the token launch and where can I find more details? We hope to be prepared for the token launch by the end of march 2017. We will make sure to have all relevant details released to the public with plenty of time for review prior to the start of the token launch.  There are already some articles explaining the mechanics of the token launch up on our blog; What are Gnosis Tokens?, Introducing the Gnosis Tokens (GNO and WIZ), and Why so complicated?.   Why are there two tokens and can you explain the difference between GNO and WIZ? There are two separate tokens on the Gnosis platform to accomplish two separate functions. Broadly, GNO is used to incentivize long-term participation in the platform, while WIZ is used to interact with the platform.  Gnosis Wisdom (WIZ) can be used to pay platform fees on the Services layer, subsidize the fees of other participants, provide initial subsidies for markets, or for market trading. WIZ will be pegged to $1 USD worth of fees. In this way, WIZ acts as a coupon for $1 of use within Gnosis. Gnosis tokens (GNO) are the generator for Wisdom token (WIZ) creation. WIZ can only be created via activating the utility of the Gnosis (GNO) tokens. This is done via a smart contract system. The smart contract works as follows: GNO token holders agree to “lock” their tokens in a smart contract (30–365 days). A multiplier is added for longer lock durations. The smart contract determines the user selected lock duration and applies that duration to a formula that is designed to regulate the supply of WIZ tokens currently in use. Prior to locking their GNO tokens in the smart contract, users will be able to see exactly how much WIZ they will receive as a result of executing the smart contract. Once users execute the contract, 30% of their WIZ will be distributed for immediate use, and the remaining 70% will be distributed proportionally over the locked duration. Once the lock duration expires, the locked GNO ceases to generate WIZ and the GNO becomes freely transferable by the holder. There is no limit (other than duration) for how many times GNO tokens may be used to create WIZ.   How will the token launch work?  There are two great articles up on our blog post that explain the token launch in some detail; Introducing the Gnosis Token Launch and Why so complicated?.  Exactly 9 million GNO tokens will be created during the token launch, which will use a modified dutch auction mechanism. This essentially means the value of each token will start out ridiculously high and slowly get cheaper over time. Participants place a bid at the maximum value they are comfortable with and the token launch ends when one of two conditions is met; 1.5M ETH* is contributed or 9M GNO tokens are sold.  EVERYONE PAYS THE SAME PRICE! No matter when you place a bid, you will pay the same price as every other participant. For those that bid early, this means you will get more tokens for you contribution than you originally expected for your contribution.  So what happens if 1.5M* ETH is contributed before 9M GNO tokens are sold? Any excess tokens not sold during the token launch will be held by the team and used to support and grow the gnosis ecosystem.  *Due to the recent $/ETH price increase we will lower the cap significantly. The new cap will be announced when we announce the date for the auction.   If I bid early will I pay a higher price per token?  No - everyone will get the same price, which is the price of the lowest accepted bid.   So if I get a lower price will ETH be refunded?  No - you will just get more tokens. E.g. if you decide to buy 10 tokens and you are willing to pay up to 1ETH per token you would send 10ETH to the contract when the price function is at 1ETH per token. If the auction is sold out then finally at a price of 0.5ETH per token it will mean that you will receive 20 tokens.   What is the token for?  The core value of GNO tokens is that they will create fee credits which can be used to pay fees on Gnosis or alternatively can be used for trading in specific market. Those credits are called WIZ. You can find a detail blog post about or tokens here.   What will you do with the Ether collected in the token launch?  We are striving to fulfil our mission to source the world’s wisdom. More concretely that means that we will expand the Gnosis platform according to our roadmap. As a practical decision, we intend to hold most funds in Ether. We believe that the success of Gnosis at least in the next few years depends on the success of the Ethereum platform. In that sense, Gnosis is a bet on Ethereum. If we are taking this bet anyway it makes sense to hold Ether.   What will happen with the GNO tokens that are not sold in the auction?  The Gnosis company will retain tokens not sold in the token launch. These tokens will serve three main purposes including supporting and subsidizing applications building on top of Gnosis, reserves for potential future token launches, and long term incentivization of Gnosis employees.   What is the relationship between Gnosis and ConsenSys?  Gnosis is its own independent company but we have a strong relationship with ConsenSys. This includes ConsenSys holding equity in the Gnosis entity and vice versa, Gnosis founders and early employees will hold equity in ConsenSys. Most importantly, Gnosis will utilize many ConsenSys services, projects, connections, and other benefits. A few examples of this are the wallet and identity solution uPort, the accounting solution Balanc3 to transparently keep track of the funds, and the back-end infrastructure component Infura. Additionally, ConsenSys projects such as  http://boardroom.to/ are looking into using Gnosis's Futarchy solutions.   How many tokens are there?  The total amount of GNO tokens is fixed to 10 million. The amount of WIZ is flexible and depends on platform usage. The more WIZ is used in the platform to pay the platform fee the more WIZ is generated by GNO tokens. The issuance rate of WIZ per GNO is set algorithmically. The algorithms adjust the issuance rate to target 20 * the monthly average use of WIZ. If on average 1,000,000 WIZ are used to pay fees each month that would mean a target of 20,000,000 WIZ in total existence.  The coupling of WIZ issuance rate to its actual usage will ensure that WIZ does not inflate and will have a relatively stable value. Therefore it will be possible to use WIZ in some markets as a collateral. (in plain English: users can make predictions with WIZ and not just pay the fee with WIZ)",False
