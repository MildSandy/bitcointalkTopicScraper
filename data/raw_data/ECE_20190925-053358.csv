Currently estimated projections based on EC Business profit history and historical market data indicate that EarthCycle Coin will increase in value more than 100 times in the next 20 years. Explore our whitepaper for more information on these estimations.

A majority of profits from facilities funded by EarthCycle Coin funds are returned to the EarthCycle Center Pool, to be redistributed to additional businesses, as decided by holders of EarthCycle Coin on the EC Coin voting platform.  20% of received profit revenues from EC funded businesses will be used to buy and burn EC Coin.  All EC funded businesses will offer a 10% discount on products and services when the EC Coin is used.  These mechanisms will continuously increase the trade value of EC Coin, without speculation, by consistently reducing the supply of the coin while increasing the demand.  During our Pre-sale, EC Coins are being offered at between 15-25% discount depending on the volume of purchase.  We are offering bounty and commission payouts. Details can be found on our website in the ""Buy Coin"" section.  Problem:  Widespread systemic issues including homelessness, extreme poverty, malnutrition, environmental pollution and others are currently widely unaddressed across planet Earth.  There exists already technologies capable of solving these issues on a mass scale. Already, there are several extremely profitable businesses with fantastic annual ROI that utilize these technologies. Currently, there are 41 EC Partnered business facilities with a combined asset worth of over 400M USD located across 6 continents. EC Business partners are prepared to deploy more than 100 business facilities in the next 2-3 years. However, we lack the up-front capital required to propagate facilities as quickly as we want to.  Solution:  Use the EarthCycle Coin to gather additional funds for current and future EC Businesses. Find and develop the leading edge of modern technologies across the world, facilitate the development of businesses to utilize these technologies, and then use the EC Center Pool and EC Voting platform to fund the propagation of enterprise solutions for the most major problems that plague our planet and species.",False

Economics, a throughput of resources and needs matching, when done with heart and smart business design, can and will change the course of direction for humanity towards the better.

Our claims are backed by profit history data of EC businesses and math.  I will quote part of our whitepaper for you, to better understand.  ""All numerical data in this section is estimated from profit-history of EC businesses and historical market data. The numerical estimations listed in this section are not guaranteed as the future of EC Coin, rather these estimations are intended to provide a shared understanding of the scope of success available to the EC Coin.   If the EarthCycle ICO sells only 43,000,000 Coins, the following facilities will be funded. If we sell twice as many EC Coins estimated profits and demand for the Coin will also double.  EarthCycle Pesco Beam Facility:    $ 10,000,000 EarthCycle CarbonCycle Facility:    $ 10,000,000 EarthCycle EcoBuilt Facility:       $ 5,000,000 EarthCycle Chrysalis Facility:          $ 5,000,000   If individuals/businesses interacting with our EarthCycle facilities desire to obtain a discount, they will have to purchase the EarthCycle Coins on the open market. If 50% of EC business customers use the EC Coin to obtain a discount This will create more than $12 million US dollars worth of EarthCycle Coins to be purchased by consumers and therefore increase the exchange price through buyer demand.   During the second year of operation, we estimate that the yearly combined investment return back from EarthCycle businesses will be between $15 million and $20 million USD.   For the third year of operation, we estimate that the yearly combined investment return back from EarthCycle businesses will be between $20 million and $25 million USD.   The fourth year of operation will generate an estimated $30 to $35 million USD in combined investment returns and over $100 million USD in customer purchases from the exchange.   The tenth year of operation will generate an estimated $250 to $300 million USD in combined investment returns to EarthCycle non-profits. If only 50% of the individuals/businesses interacting with our EarthCycle partners desire a discount by using the EarthCycle Coin, it will create a demand for over $500 million USD worth of Coins to be purchased and then sold on the open exchange.  By year 10 more than 150,000,000 USD worth of EC Coins will be bought from the open exchange and destroyed/burnt. We estimate that this market influence (in combination with other market factors) will increase the price of EC Coins to a minimum of $30 per Coin.  The twentieth year of operation will generate an estimated $2.5 Billion USD in combined investment returns to EarthCycle nonprofits. If estimations are correct; by this time over $3 Billion USD will have been used to purchase and burn the EC Coin. We estimate that this market influence, in combination with other market factors will increase the EC Coin to a minimum of $200 per Coin.  Coin value estimations were made considering 1. 40% of coins purchased by year 10 are still held by original purchasers. 2. 20% of coins purchased by year 20 are still held by original purchasers. 3. 10% of all coins purchased are locked into Earth Power by year 10. 4. 20% of all coins purchased are locked into Earth Power by year 20. 5. 80% of all coins distributed to nonprofits are still held by nonprofits during year 10. 6. 50% of all coins distributed to nonprofits are still held by nonprofits during year 20. 7. 70% of all coins sold by original purchasers and EC nonprofits are bought by private individuals and groups other than EarthCycle nonprofits. 8. 50% of all coins repurchased by private individuals and groups in the first 10 years sold to EarthCycle nonprofits during the 11th-20th years.  Are nonprofits are contractually obligated to hold at least 80% of all combined coins distributed to them by year 10, and at least 50% of all combined coins distributed by year 20.  If these conditions are met, by year ten 7,740,000 Coins will be bought and removed from circulation by EarthCycle nonprofits. As the coins bought this way are purchased at a steady increase over the years, by the tenth year EC Coins will be worth more than 30 each.  Between the years of ten and twenty, 21,500,000 Coins will be bought and removed from circulation by EarthCycle nonprofits. As the coins bought this way are purchased at a steady increase over the years, by the twentieth year EC coins will be worth more than 200 each.    Examine this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A28kVfFimDlyu5WNDRfIsIxs16pCCrXjYOO0froR4Pk/edit?usp=sharing for more detailed business profit estimates. The exact profit potential of EC businesses is directly related to which businesses Earth Power holding voters choose to fund. By year 7 we foresee there will be several more businesses with a wider array of annual returns for Earth Power holders to choose from.  All estimates made are based off historical profit history from our partnered businesses that have been running and producing indicated profits. We are able to provide tax histories, business plans, profit records and other critical business documents to parties interested in purchasing 1 million or more EC Coins.

The numerical estimations listed in this section are not guaranteed as the future of EC Coin, rather these estimations are intended to provide a shared understanding of the scope of success available to the EC Coin.  With our ICO and friends/family pre-ico sale we expect at least $36,000,000.00 will be raised.  Using this amount as an example, there would be an estimated 65 million EarthCycle Coins created.  Approximately 43 million EC Coins will be distributed to the contributors of the ico to be available on the open market. The other 22 million EC Coins will be controlled by the EarthCycle nonprofit organizations and trusted individuals, to be used for funding future projects to support Earth Cycle.   With $36 million in cryptocurrency contributed to the ICO, $30 million will be contributed to the trusted nonprofit organizations to be invested  into the top four pilot businesses.  The remaining $6 million in cryptocurrency will be held in reserve to maintain the EarthCycle Coin’s value by placing buy orders on the open exchange. This will give us the opportunity to purchase the EC Coins at discounted rates as fluctuations in the market occur.    The EarthCycle Coin will grow in value naturally and without speculation.  This will be accomplished in three main ways.  The $30 million allocated will go to fund our three pilot businesses.  After their development and bringing them up to 90% capacity, we estimate the EarthCycle partnership businesses will generate more than $1,500,000 USD a month in revenue.  Twenty percent of the funds received back to the nonprofit organizations will be used to purchase Coins from off the open market. The nonprofits will then burn these Coins to reduce the total supply of EC Coins.  Customers desiring to save money with our partnered businesses will use their EarthCycle Coins for purchasing products or services. As these Coins are pulled from the market to be resold for a minimum of 5% increase, naturally we would expect the value of EC Coin to rise as the supply of lower cost Coins is reduced.  People are awakening to the problems that uncontrolled greed has caused to our planet. They can easily see that if this destructive cycle is not broken then our future generations will suffer greatly. Most people feel overwhelmed at the daunting task to shift our planet back into a more sustainable future. Now with the EarthCycle Coin, any person worldwide can contribute to being a part of the solution.          We also expect the EarthCycle Coin to grow in value with speculation. As the mainstream population begins to realize the benefits of taking back control of money supply, they will flood into the cryptocurrency markets. The EarthCycle Coin will naturally attract these speculative investors in a few ways.  The EarthCycle Coin has a specific use by the general population and is not just a store in value Coin like Bitcoin or many of the other early cryptos. The EC Coin can be used to save a minimum of 10% off purchases from our partnered businesses. As more partnered businesses join our organization, the more the excitement for using our Coin will grow.  Investors are looking for Coins that not only have a store in value but also have a practical application in the marketplace.  The EarthCycle Coin has asset backing through our partnered nonprofits.  The nonprofits will fund green businesses and own a portion of their companies. These businesses will generate assets and revenue which is partially used to back the value of the Coin. Coins that have associated asset value will naturally attract more investors.   As investors see a steady increase in value for the EarthCycle Coin, they will naturally be attracted to Coins growth.  Our partnered nonprofits will be purchasing Coins from the open market and only selling those Coins at a higher price point.   During the first year of operation of our top four partnered businesses, we expect there to be many millions of EC Coins purchased off the open market. These purchases will start out slow but increase as the business move to 100% operational capacity. This natural growth in the Coins price will attract speculative investors.  As the first four partnered businesses reach full capacity, many millions of dollars will be contributed each quarter. Now as more partnered businesses join our ranks, the amount of money used to purchase the EarthCycle Coins from the open market will increase and so naturally the value will increase as well.  Speculators that see this rise in price will purchase the EC Coins which will just supply the EarthCycle partnered nonprofits with more funds to add more and more sustainable earth-friendly businesses to our ranks. This will just continue to generate greater future revenue and therefore greater price growth for the EarthCycle Coin.   Currently, billions of dollars of speculative investment is involved in the cryptocurrency industry. This value is projected to grow into the trillions over the next few years. Our goal is to quickly get the EarthCycle Coin into the top 20 cryptocurrencies by its market cap value.  If this is done with 65 million Coins, then the value of each Coin would be almost $25.00 each at today's downturn market cap price. With the EarthCycle Coin’s vision, it can easily jump into the top ten cryptocurrencies. At today’s market rate that would be a value of approximately $92.00 each.  In the investment world, speculation moves prices above the true value. Here are some examples.  Apple (AAPL) has a market capitalization of almost $900 billion but a true asset value of approximately $134 billion.  So the speculative value is approximately 6.7 times the true value.  Walmart (WMT) has a market capitalization of almost $264 billion but a true asset value of approximately $78 billion.  So the speculative value is approximately 3.4 times the true value.  Bitcoin (BTC) has a market capitalization of almost $184 billion but a true asset value of zero.  However if you factor in the cost to create the current Bitcoin supply in the market, its value would be approximately $2 billion. So the speculative value is approximately 92 times the creation value. This high speculative value is all due to the limited supply and high demand.   We conservatively estimate by the end of the second year that our four pilot EarthCycle partnered businesses will stimulate more than $2,000,000.00 per month in demand for the Coin and contribute more than $1,000,000 per month to the nonprofit partners.  Also, our EarthCycle project funding social media network will be online and will create further demand for holding the EC Coin long term. The EC Coins used in our project funding portal must be taken out of circulation to be used for voting. This mechanism will take several million EC Coins out of circulation, further increasing the scarcity of the Coin while simultaneously fueling increased demand.  During the third year, all of our EC businesses will stimulate a conservatively estimated $3,000,000 per month in Coin demand while returning more than $2,000,000 per month to EC nonprofits.  With continuing to add partnership businesses along with the growing revenue, we expect the value of the EarthCycle Coin to rise significantly.     In each year after the third, returns stimulated from EC businesses will continue growing exponentially.   The demand simulated from our partner businesses in combination with our nonprofits ability to buy and burn/destroy mass amounts of EarthCycle currency over time, will ensure that long-term holders and short-term speculative investors will always receive a significant return over time.  With the global cryptocurrency excitement just beginning to launch, the growth and demand for the EarthCycle Coin given in the above examples may be significantly undervalued.
