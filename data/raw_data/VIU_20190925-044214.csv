Some projects did airdrop instead of ICO and most of them are in top 50 crypro in the world. I guess we can expect similar results, as we actually have a working video platform.

We are going to close our ICO at 19:00 GMT Tuesday the 17th of October, and instead airdrop EVERY ETH wallet VIU tokens, at a rate of 5 VIU for each ETH in their wallet.  The airdrop date and time is to be announced soon to give people time to transfer their ETH to a wallet that can receive the tokens, such as myetherwallet.  Immediate changes:  - Viuly will be closing the pre sale at 19:00 GMT Tuesday the 17th of October, and there will be no future public ICO rounds - Instead of focusing on ICO funding, Viuly will instead focus on building the platform at https://viuly.io, which was always our number one focus - ~500 Million VIU tokens will be airdropped to every ETH address, at a ratio of 5 VIU per ETH. To be able to claim these tokens you must have the ETH in a wallet that supports ERC20 tokens such as myetherwallet, or Mist - If you have already contributed to the pre sale, you have the option of either: 1.) Receiving 3x the number of tokens you have purchased as a thank you, and Viuly keeps the ETH you have donated to help us fund development 2.) If you would like a full refund, please just email support@viuly.com with your Ether address. As soon as you have sent the VIU tokens from your wallet back to our address, your refund for your Ether will be processed.  Please stay tuned for our official announcement of the airdrop.  We are excited to be making these changes! We believe an airdrop of VIU tokens to ALL ETH wallets will greatly help drive adoption and use of our blockchain video platform.  It will mean everyone will have VIU tokens they can use to promote their videos on the platform, and can become involved.  Please stay tuned for more updates, including the VIU airdrop time and date!  Come and join our amazing community on Telegram: https://t.me/viulyofficial  And follow us on twitter for more updates: https://twitter.com/ViulyOfficial  A new bitcointalk thread about our airdrop will also be created soon.

As you, our supporters know, our Alpha platform is already live at https://viuly.io and users can sign up and earn VIU for registering, watching videos, uploading videos, and for referrals. We have had a lot of early positive feedback about the platform, especially in our Telegram group and we are grateful for all of our supporters.  So that we can continue the development and deliver on our mission, we are making the following changes to our crowdfunding rounds:  - The Viuly pre-sale will now run until Sunday the 22nd of October, 24:00 GMT with a new cap of just 5 million VIU tokens.  The pre-sale takes place on our site https://viuly.com  - The Viuly public ICO will now take place on the Monday the 20th of November, and finish on Saturday December 2nd.  This decision was a hard one. But we believe these changes are necessary for the longevity of the Viuly project, and are also in the best interest of all our supporters.

Quote from: DirkDiggler1911 on October 12, 2017, 08:34:26 AM Since videos will be stored on other people hdd, could internet speed be an issue, since IPFS is p2p.  Not at all! IPFS is fully decentralized and the video is pulled from many people's hard drives simultaneously so it will not affect the speed of viewing videos.

TOKEN PRE-SALE | WHITEPAPER  | ALPHA (LIVE FROM SEPTEMBER 25TH)  | SLACK  | FACEBOOK  | TWITTER  | TELEGRAM    â–„â–„â–„â–„ WHAT IS VIULY  Viuly.com is a first decentralized video sharing platform. It is built and curated by the Viuly user community. Our end game is to disrupt the video market as we know it by becoming the biggest global decentralized video sharing platform.  Viuly takes the power from the centralized platforms and puts it back where it should be - in the comminity hands.  Authors can sell their premium content, receive pledges from users and at the same time, earn from advertising revenue sharing program. Users watch free videos and get rewards. Advertisers place ads and pay directly to authors & users. No more middlemen.   All payments on the platform are carried out automatically in VIU tokens and the transaction history is stored on the blockchain.  VIULY tokens (VIU) are based on the Ethereum blockchain smart-contract and represent the main tool for transferring the value between advertisers, content creators and users.     Video content storage is decentralized and built on top of the IPFS protocol.  Here are a few key features, that make our platform unique and revolutionary:  Upload free videos and create channels Sell access to your premium content Be rewarded for watching free videos Support and pledge to content creators Buy premium content with VIU tokens Advertise and pay directly to our users   â–„â–„â–„â–„ MISSION  Our goal is to create a completely decentralized video sharing platform with no middlemen, where authors and users rewarded for doing things they love and enjoy!    â–„â–„â–„â–„ NOW YOU'RE PAID  Are you ready to get a reward just for watching the video content you are interested in? Are you ready to get paid for what you used to do for free?  Yes, that's right! User attention is the most valuable resource on the Viuly video platform. Now you're paid for watching videos.  You can withdraw and spend the tokens received, or you can support video creators by pledging, or pay to unlock access to the premium content, training courses, etc.     â–„â–„â–„â–„ CONTENT CREATORS EARN MORE   1. Video creators can upload their video and specify the price on a pay-per-view base. Users, who are interested to watch their premium content, pay the indicated cost and automatically get access to the video. 2. Video creators can create paid channels, for which users pay a daily, weekly, monthly or yearly subscription fee. 3. Video creators can upload their video and specify them as free to watch. In this case, advertising may be embedded in these videos and they will automatically receive in their wallet 65% of the cost specified by the advertiser for each unique ad view. 4. Video creators can upload their video and specify that users can watch the video for free, and that the video is ad-free. In this case, users can find the ""Donate"" button below the video, and if they liked it, they can support the author by sending any amount of VIU tokens.     â–„â–„â–„â–„ ADVERTISERS GET DIRECT USER ENGAGEMENT AND LOYAL CUSTOMERS  Viuly provides advertisers with accurate statistics for each ad view. All data is recorded on the blockchain and can be checked either by an advertiser as well as by third party auditors. The payments for user's attention are made directly, without intermediaries and is completely transparent. The advertising cost is lower by 20% than on centralized video platforms.  1. Advertisers may upload on the platform their advertising video that promotes an event, a website, a product or a service, by indicating in the settings a cost-per-view and choose targeting audience based on country, city, gender, age and interests. A video will be shown only to those users who are in the selected targeting group. Important! Users never know for which video they will receive a reward. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a reward based view. 2. Advertisers may add their banner or a short promotional video for up to 30 seconds to appear in the videos that are listed as free to view by their authors. It is possible to choose targeting audience based on country, city, gender, age and interests. 3. Advertisers may add a video that promotes a specific product or a service, to the Viuly marketplace, along with a text description, technical characteristics and price. Users can buy the product or the service, advertised in the video, by clicking the ""Buy"" button and pay with VIU tokens.      â–„â–„â–„â–„ VIDEO MARKET IS HUGE AND GROWING  By 2020 more than 80% of internet traffic will be video The total number of people watch video online daily â€“ 2,700,000,000 5 billion videos are watched daily on Youtube alone The market volume of online video $ 30 billion by 2018    We together enter the huge multi-billion video sharing market and completely change the game.   â–„â–„â–„â–„ TEAM  The team behind the project is a combination of experienced managers and developers.

Content creators upload videos. Advertiser adds an advertisement to it. The cost of advertising is distributed between the creator of the video and the user who has watched this video. Everything is done automatically. The advertiser reduces his advertising costs by saving on intermediaries. The video creator earns many times more than on other video platforms that take 60% -70% of his income. And users are rewarded for watching videos. It's a win-win situation for everyone.
