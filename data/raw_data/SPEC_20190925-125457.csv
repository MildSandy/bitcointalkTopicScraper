Firstly, get to know SpectrumNetwork  The position of cryptocurrency in today’s world is growing rapidly. The invention of the blockchain, being the underlying technology of Ethereum & Bitcoin, has proven its unlimited capacity at even being more valuable than cryptocurrency itself. Reason being that it has various applications in the development of diverse kind of decentralized based applications (dApps).  Corporate structures and regulatory bodies in spatial data management have in the past faced some problems, seemingly undeniable. These problems include; cost of purchasing spatial data, storage and management. Spatial data is overbearing and takes up tons of space for its storage; on the cloud (Enterprise/Web GIS) or on a physical workstation.  This where SpectrumNetwork comes in.  SpectrumNetwork (SPEC), being the first global prototype crypro project in this regard, was able to infuse spatial data within an ERC20-standardised token, making location data decentralized, lighter, more accessible and inter-operable via a blockchain.  Yes in other words, SPEC tokens has utility.  SpectrumNetwork tokens are encoded with spatial properties to bridge a recurring gap between spatial data, it’s collation and cost management. This is as against the regular conventional techniques.  SpectrumNetwork is seeking to replace the now obsolete conventional technique of spatial data management and display, using a blockchain-based platform.    ""Keep your mind wide open. Look at it this way. instead of storing gigs of location based data on a hard drive or on the cloud, we have converted digitized spatial datasets to a light cryptocurrency token""    SpectrumNetwork Project Development  SpectrumNetwork is already accomplishing quite a bit; the team behind this elaborated vision has an accumulated combined experience of 33 years in programming, GIS based projects, app development & cryptocurrency payments.  We are presently working on a blueprint which will be made available in few weeks. This blueprint will showcase a modelled diagrammatic representation of how our tokens work in real-time. As well as how it can be used in for the future.   SpectrumNetwork’s Roadmap  SpectrumNetwork has laid out an ambitious set of self accomplishing goals on its whitepaper 1.0. Having a first mover advantage, SpectrumNetwork is poised to take the CryptoSphere to heights that were never attempted or probably unforeseen in the past.  Link to whitepaper: https://github.com/SpectrumNetwork/docs/raw/master/SpectrumNetwork%20Whitepaper.pdf Link to one pager: https://github.com/SpectrumNetwork/docs/raw/master/One-pager.pdf  Right now the next project on the launchpad is an initial pre-sale. The objective of the initial pre-sale is to raise funds needed to complete the technical implementations of our project. The interactive UI/Ux is 75% completed, awaiting full deployment. Our minimum viable product (MVP) is  designed to link desired spatial datasets to our utility tokens, to make it interoperable as we claimed. SpectrumNetwork tokens are erc20 utility tokens with unique coding that makes it possible to import them into basic enterprise geomatic softwares as a replacement for conventional extensions like ArcGIS Data Interoperability extensions, ArcGIS Bathymetry extensions, ENVI extensions for spatial autocorrelation statistics & ENVI 3D surface area ; to mention just a few.  A little further down the road “SpectrumNetwork Token,” is a retail token which holders can market on exchanges as valuable token assets. Presently speaking, the only use for the SpectrumNetwork token is resale. But, “SpectrumNetwork” is initially coded in its smart contract for technical decentralized application alongside enterprise based geomatic softwares. {As already explained}    ""We have taken advantage of blockchain tech to break grounds in a scientific field not yet tried before.""  ""Ignoring blockchain today is like ignoring the internet 30 years ago” — Jim Sinegal    SpectrumNetwork’s expected financial performance  The ERC20 SpectrumNetwork Token is projected to be traded on five (5) major exchanges namely; Binance, Fcoin, BigONE, Kucoin and Bitrex. Our sole aim from the inception to the conceptualization of this project, is to be traded on exchanges with very tangible daily trading volume. As well as exchanges who will encourage an insurance of asset’s value. Key criterion considered by the R&D team in our listing options, is in favor of the trans fee mining algorithm, which is the most systematically effective method for preserving a crypto asset’s value. A token traded on an exchange which support this newest algorithm, will possibly stay stable and guarantee positive management for stop losses in cryptocurrency trading. This is why SpectrumNetwork will be selective in its listing choices.  Being a unique utility token, with un-plagiarized applications in spatial contexts, SPEC is projected to surpass unimaginable heights to even $1 and even more. SPEC will be offered at $0.005 during our initial pre-sale.  1). Soft cap is set at $750,000 (1500ETH) and; 2). Hard cap is set at $1,400,000 (3000ETH)  It’s very important to us that no one owns more than enough SPEC tokens to individually influence or control the market. Therefore, we limited the individual maximum contribution in the initial pre-sale to 50ETH.   SpectrumNetwork and Community Service  We at SpectrumNetwork, value our community and prospective partners. Quite a few of our tech inclined subscribers have privately contacted us via our telegram and discord channels, appealing for the open source code to our project on github. We heard you, please wait for a full deployment of our prospective project. Surely you know why this is so, to avert plagiarism.  That aside, our team is committed to the community. Please feel free to always address your questions and concerns through our various social handles OR email. This may not fix all problems to the best of your satisfaction. We just want to clearly show you that we are aware and steadily making implementations, whilst awaiting further progress after the pre-sale.  Only 50% of the total supply will be allowed into the market, this is graphically described in our whitepaper v1.0. The specified percentage is available for the pre-sale, airdrop allocation and other future bounties. 30% will be locked to the the admin and programmers, and the remnant 15% is allocated for our future API implementations, research and test running.  Verdict on SPEC token  As expected, our Verdict about our tokens would always be good words, being the devs. But in reality, SPEC token is a ground breaker, and a unifying X-factor between spatial data and blockchain.  SpectrumNetwork is a modest project, with so much to be modest about. Unlike the billion-dollar projects planning to spend a decade or two remaking the internet, We have a simple, doable goal: giving GIS inclined developers an edge with blockchain tech & our implementations. At the same time, creating an easier unique gateway for all other kinds of crypto investors to own a share of our platform via extremely valuable assets.  Governmental bodies, multinationals, mititary outfits, the SCC, CIA and hosts of other major parastatals; who utilize location based data would in the future need lighter secure spatial data. Which is a perfect alternative solution to compete with heavier storage gobbling satellite imageries.  Our subscribers have been quite supportive. Believing in our viable project and supporting us all the way. We are here because they are making it possible.   “Having a set of marked milestones and delineated deadlines, is a requirement for viable projects.”   We are airdropping 15,000,000 SPEC at 5000SPEC each to 3000 people, after our first pre-sale.
