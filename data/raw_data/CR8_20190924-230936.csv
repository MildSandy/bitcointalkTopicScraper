They offer authentic personal experiences — YouTubers have a way to engage vast audiences through authentic storytelling. By creating engaging branded content in a unique and often humorous style, they speak to their subscribers on a deeper and more personal level, which creates a feeling of trust and gives them motivation to just go and buy a certain product.  They are not celebrities — Although people like to look up to celebrities, they cannot truly relate to them, so chances are they will have more trust in regular people whom they’ve gotten to know through numerous videos that always have a certain personal aspect.  They are often cheeky, friendly and funny, all of which appeals to their subscribers and makes them easy to relate to. This sense of familiarity creates a kind of intimacy that cannot be achieved when a celebrity presents a certain brand.  They can reach audiences worldwide — YouTube is now accessible to almost everyone. The majority of people worldwide spend a lot of their time watching YouTube videos. The content creators have a great global appeal, as some of them even add subtitles to their videos so that they can reach out to customers all over the world.  They follow trends — YouTubers are usually the first ones to try the latest trends, discover new products and ways in which they can be used. Through them, people can get in touch with brands and be encouraged to try things they haven’t tried before, or didn’t even know existed.",False

Marketers use CR8 to pay Content Creators and Community Content Reviewers. Anyone can use CR8 to utilize the Insights protocol to view actionable data about their social media accounts or any public accounts. Token holders can stake CR8 to either receive insights, bring a dispute to arbitration, or potentially get chosen as an arbitrator during disputes. A three-step POC (Proof of Creativity) system will reward reviewers of content with a portion of the transaction fees. It’s technical, learn more about it on page 25 of the whitepaper. The token allocation is as follows:     35% Crowd sale     20% Reserve     20% Community/platform development     15% Team (vested 1 year)     10% Advisors (vested 6 months) Below is a breakdown of the use of funds:     45% Growth     37% Operations     15% Marketing     3% Legal All bonuses will be locked up for 2 months after the end of the crowd sale. Unsold tokens will be burned.  Team Creator.ai is a wholly owned subsidy of Captiv8.io, the world’s largest enterprise influencer marketing platform. Captiv8’s DApp is the first to use the Creator.ai protocols. The three founders of Creator.ai have been together for years. They partnered up and created Mobclix in 2008, which became the largest mobile ad exchange before being acquired by Vilti. Then in 2015, the 3 of them founded Captiv8. Co-founder Krishna Subramanian is the absolute real deal. He served as VP of marketing at Yahoo in 2007, Founded Mobclix in 2008 and served as CMO at Vilti for three years. He was on the board of directors for the Mobile Marketing Association from 2012-2014. He co-founded Captiv8 in 2015. Co-founder Sunil Verma also founded Mobclix and worked for Vilti as Chief Business Development Officer. Co-founder Vishal Gurbuxani worked five years as a manager at Accenture before founding Mobclix and Captiv8 with Krishna and Sunil. The advisers are extremely impressive. Distributed Network Advisors, Galaxy, and WAX are three of the biggest players in the game.  Verdict Influencer marketing is a $300 billion industry that is growing fast. This revolutionary protocol will open up the entire world for marketers. This includes no language or currency barriers, as well as the dissolution of borders. The team already proved they have the chops to scale when they built the current largest AI influencer marketing platform, Captiv8.  Risks     In a way, this project is similar to Cambridge Analytica. Facebook and other platforms will be coming up with new ways to protect user data. This could hinder Creator.AI’s data collecting. -1     This project on Ethereum, which means they will need to integrate different scaling solutions that haven’t been perfected yet. This is a challenge all DApps on Ethereum with micro-transactions face. -2     There is already, and will be in the future, tons of competition. So far though, Captiv8 is No. 1 , and Creative.ai is by far the most advanced project out of its current competition. -0.5  Growth Potential     The token sale allocates 20% to be locked in a reserve for two years. This reserve will be used for growth operations and marketing.+1     DNA and Galaxy Digital are just a couple of their high profile advisers. After six months, they will receive 10% of the total token allocation. These guys don’t back projects they don’t believe in. They will be putting in their resources to get this thing mainstream.+3     The first DApp to use the Creator.ai protocol will be Captiv8, whcih is already partnered with the three top global talent agencies (CAA, WME, UTA). In Q3 of 2017 they became the first influencer marketing platform to become marketing partners with both Facebook and Instagram. In Q4 they partnered with Forbes to provide social media insights data on their articles. These are world class partnerships. +3     The roadmap is vague, but does list the most important milestones: The Insights Protocol will be complete in Q3 2018, Reporting Protocol complete in Q4 2018 and the Content Review Protocol Q1, 2019. +1     Influencers can now get value in CR8 tokens from their Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook followers, something they’ve not been able to do  This is righteous stuff. +3  Disposition It’s rare that an ICO hits on all cylinders like Creator.ai seems to be doing. This looks like a great opportunity to get in early on a game changing protocol. 7.5/10  Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-creator-ai/",False
