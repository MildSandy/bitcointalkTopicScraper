CEEK is a platform that is designed to eliminate the limitations that currently exist in the showbiz industry, where artists are not able to maximize the potential of their products. This happens because of the fact that space and geographical restriction are taking their toll on the industry’s expansion.  Each year 60 million concert tickets are sold in the USA alone. The demand for iconic music artists to perform at live events far outweigh their capacity leaving them with missed revenue opportunities and fans without the chance to experience live shows. Therefore, the adoption of VR technology which enables fans and followers enjoy the same ambience and feel of being present in event arenas is helping solve the issue of satisfaction and revenue generation as well....",False
