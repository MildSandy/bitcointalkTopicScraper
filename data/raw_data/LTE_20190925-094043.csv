We love the flexibility of trading in multiple cryptocurrencies, but we were fed up with the inefficiencies of centralised exchanges. So we created Local Token Exchange to integrate the best of a P2P decentralised exchange with the deep liquidity of a centralised exchange, which makes trading faster, easier, more secure and gives the token holder a share in the profits.   Private Sale: We are conducting a Private sale in the month of July, as of today we have raised â‚¬400K.

Local Token Exchange will offer: - The possibility to trade a comprehensive range of cryptocurrencies - Combined with the deep liquidity normally offered only in centralised exchanges - Fast and easy KYC/AML verification process - Transparency - Pay regular dividends - Future cryptocurrencies by allowing ICO airdrops  This innovative model will give traders the perfect space to transact the vast majority of their trades, whilst allowing them to participate in the success of Local Token Exchangeâ€™s business with regular dividends for token holders.  THE PROBLEM Centralised cryptocurrency exchanges in their current form are fraught with inefficiencies. There are long wait times, security risks and time consuming verification requirements as well as high barriers to entry for a large proportion of potential users, especially novices.  THE SOLUTION P2P marketplaces and exchanges provide direct access in a decentralised way to connect buyers and sellers directly, which represents the truest form of free market trading. The future of the digital currency ecosystem relies on the development of robust P2P decentralised exchanges that support a diverse range of cryptocurrencies and at the same time provide traders with sufficient liquidity, a significant feature of the best centralised exchanges. The innovative distributed ownership and business model offered by Local Token Exchange will bridge the gap in the market, whilst delivering the majority of the profits of the platform directly into the wallets of token holders and users.  By harnessing the free market aspects of the Peer-to-Peer model and enhancing with the liquidity from centralised exchanges, Local Token Exchange will become a force in the cryptocurrency exchange space.
