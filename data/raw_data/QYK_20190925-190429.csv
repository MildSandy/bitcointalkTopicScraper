Despite the successful start of our marketing campaign we can see that our supporters’ interests and QYKBAR’s credibility could be jeopardized in the future due to the lack of regulation in the ICO space.  Having that in mind, we have decided to start preparations for SEC regulated ICO – Security Initial Offering (SIO) under Regulation A that allows crowdfunding for general public under US laws. We believe that QYKBAR’s business concept has huge potential and our main goal is to see it succeed long-term. Therefore, we are ready to take one step back at present, so that we and our investors can be more confident and protected in the future. We would be looking for clear start and relaunch of our campaign after legal procedures to do with Regulation A are completed. Saying that, we are to refund ALL the proceeds raised by QYKBAR as of today within 3-5 days after the announcement. Please, send all your inquiries to vipsale@qykbar.io . I do want to say big THANK YOU for all your support, especially to all the bounty hunters. We are to consider all the balances due for Bounty campaign once the project is relaunched, so all your rewards won’t be wasted. Your sincerely, Vlad Dobrov, CEO, QYKBAR",False

It's core idea is not even about alcohol in itself, but rather about the unique concept when a consumer is able to purchase liquor, spirits or beer at disctributor's  discounted price,  allocate it on his/her account in our App - QYKBar...and consume the drinks at the bars that join the loyalty program across the world...and ATTENTION...AT THE SAME PRICE as it is stocked on their account at QYKBar app. Moreover, it can be consumed partially at different locations. Thus, we offer the consumer an opportunity to SAVE money on the price of the drinks he/she consumes at their favourite hangout places. We are not in competition with alcohol retailers or liquor stores, or on-line alcohol stores. Our project is targeting the folks who enjory going our and spend money on drinks at the bars and restaurants and we save them money. We would also like to grow the number of common people who could not afford to visit fun places and drink there because it was too expensive. Instead they've been drinking at home. Now they can have fun and enjoy the night out with friends at affordable price in their favourite watering hole! We are going to make the visits in the favourite drinkiing spots AFFORDABLE! On top of the great pricing policy we offer on-line automated credit solution that would be built-in to our QYKBar app. Thus, in the near future, one can come to the bar without a penny and have ah affordable drink just because he /she has smartphone with our app in it. One more thing. We support the healthy living! According to our analysis the overall effect of our concept would be declining of the alcohol consumption since it is a well-known fact that you consume more alcohol when drinking at home (as an alternative to night-out).
