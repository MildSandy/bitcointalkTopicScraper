Dentix offers its own uniqueness compared to existing dental/electronic health records blockchain projects and I strongly believe that they offer so much more to patients, dentists, doctors and dental staff.  The Dentix platform provides real added value to both sides of the user base, some of the services included are; work plan scheduling, booking appointments, trusted reviews, finding new patients, confidential messaging service, electronic health records, records about the dental practice, referral system  You can also earn DNTX tokens for using platform which can be redeemed and used to pay for services, dentists that use Dentix can also become part of an international community and work with some of the best doctors in the industry.

Dentix plans to revolutionize the way that Dentists work and how patients interact with their dentists.  It will cover all aspects of a Dentist's day to day activities from scheduling patients to sending out prescriptions.  Patients will be able to use the Dentix platform to book appointments, communicate with their dentist with the Dentix messaging service and they will be able to use the DNTX tokens to pay for their dental care.  DNTX tokens can be earned by performing different tasks on the platform. For example, patients can earn DNTX by leaving reviews on the Dentix True View(™) platform. There are many other ways of earning tokens.  Being able to earn DNTX tokens benefits patients because they can use their earned tokens to pay for their dental care.
