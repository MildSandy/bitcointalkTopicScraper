As cryptocurrencies are exploding in value (well, not alt right now, but in the larger scope of things ), they are becoming more and more popular. But they are still largely unpredictable, like the early days of stock markets. One way to stabilize is to start using tokens for purchases and make it have an inner value somewhere like PEER will have within the Peerity platform.

We think that cool and meaningful human interactions are happening both online and offline. So Peerity will help combine the two. Help groups get together, get to know each other and do something together if it's just an outing, a concert, a seminar, or perhaps exercising together, or crowdfunding for something in the neighborhood.  The exact method how is still in the works. There are many ways to do this like geofencing or logging in with special codes. The beta launch will help optimise that",False

For one, Peerity platform won't use your data and track your online behaviors and habits to sell to marketers or to put you in the target groups for ads. Current big networks like Facebook and Facebook-owned Instagram, do this all the time because their 'business model' is based on selling you as a product. This is why their services are 'free' and it's how they make money. They are often breaking the privacy laws of the countries, just because they can afford the fines. The fines cost them less than they are making by breaking the law!  By introducing a distributed blockchain tech to social media we make the platform self-sustainable in an almost automatic way so it doesn't need ads or user data to function. And in the future it will become a democracy that is fueled with self-minted cryptocurrency, belongs to the users, and rewards them (not shareholders) for the content, activity and all the stuff they usually do on socials.  Now, how are we different that Steemit? Here is a cool interview with our CEO who explains it really well: http://bitcoinchaser.com/ico-hub/peerity-ico-interview  We respect and love Steemit. We also work hard to avoid the problems they have encountered, for example, the 'whale' oligarchy. Peerity will be more accessible and intuitive for an everyday user who's not necessarily that techy.",False

Peerity doesn't use your data, and the value you add to the platform by spending your time and energy there is actually redistributed back to you via the Peerity token.",False

Tokens are being sold via an ethereum smart contract (ERC20) that has passed an extensive third-party audit.   1 ETH = 1500 peer tokens   Compatible with all ERC20 Wallets.   Send ETH to Peerity’s address from your Ethereum Wallet in order to be credited.   Please see the pre-sale page for more information. What is Peerity.io?    Peerity is a revolutionary social network and a community building tool that puts your well being, happiness and privacy ahead of ad revenue and data mining.   We want to bring back the genuine human connections and interactions, add real value to your social and professional life, and sparkle a change in the social media landscape.   Whether you are a new rock band on their way to fame, an artist throwing an expo, a blogger looking to share and help others, or a company crowdfunding a new product, Peerity.io offers you endless possibilities to organize, initiate, create and make a difference, all while getting rewarded for your positive input.   Why Peerity.io?  With Peerity you no longer need to watch endless ads, low-quality clickbaits, and fake news. Our content assessment algorithms and super moderators promote a positive, valuable and pro-social content and interactions.[\B]   You, your habits and your friends stop being a product exploited by big tech giants. You get back control over your data and your copyrights, and have an equal vote when it comes to the future of the network.   You get rewarded for your pro-social positive content, initiatives, events and participation both online and offline     How will it work?  Peerity will look and work a lot like the traditional social media, where you make an account, and join interest groups, and share, post, or like.   Under the hood the platform will run on a Tendermint blockchain solution which means that the activity on the platform will drive the production (minting) of Peerity tokens which will then cover the maintenance costs (5%), peer nodes operators and delegators (30%), stake pool (5%) and the rewards for contributing users (60%).   Users will earn Peerity tokens based on their participation in online and offline events, and their input in form of original content or positive interactions on the platform.   The tokens will serve as an in-platform currency used for voting on platform features, crowdfunding initiatives, tipping other users, and buying products and services. They will also be available to exchange for cryptocurrency at the standard, compatible exchanges, list of which will be announced at a later date.   THE PEERITY NETWORK    The Peerity blockchain runs on Tendermint. We decided to use Tendermint because of its superior speed and BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) consensus engine. It also allows us to make our blockchain flexible and dynamic, not just for us but towards other existing projects as well.   Peer Servers are the validators in our Tendermint-based blockchain. They are responsible for committing new blocks on the chain. The amount and selection of Peer servers is done by Peerity Inc. If you are interested in becoming a Peer server operator, get in contact with us at info@peerity.io   The access to our alpha and beta testing networks will be based on first-come, first-serve basis, reserved for Peer server operators and participants of the private and public crowdfunding rounds. Invitations will be sent on a first-come, first-serve basis.   THE PEERITY TOKEN  Peerity uses a native crypto token to reward pro-active members for their participation in the building of their communities and the platform  The Peerity token can be used for voting on platform features, crowdfunding projects or purchase items on the Peerity platform, giving it an inherent usability.  The token will also be available for an exchange at the cryptocurrencies market, with the list of compatible exchanges to be announced at a later date.  To ensure survival and a steady growth of the platform the tokens will have an adaptable minting rate based on activity level of the platform. This means fewer tokens will be minted into the system with the lower activity taking place.  During alpha and beta stages, we will minimize the token supply rate as much as possible, and test the overall scalability and the functionality of the model.     The Peerity token supply will be created through two processes.  1. An initial pre-allocation of 100 million tokens in the initial block of the blockchain which will be used for the crowdfunding campaign of the Peerity platform. 2. An ongoing creation of tokens through our Distributed Proof of Stake system based on the Peerity platform’s activity level. The more activity there is on the network, the more tokens will be created.   The initial Peerity token allocation is 100 million token, generated in the genesis block. These 100 million are distributed accordingly:    The Peerity Team    The team behind Peerity.io have an extensive combined background in blockchain development, data center networking, finance, and project and community management. We have experience building websites handling millions of daily visitors and operating data centers serving millions of customers for global multi-nationals. Our team is growing rapidly and we are always on the lookout for highly skilled professionals to strengthen our project. If you have any interest in collaborating in any way to the Peerity project, please reach out to us at info@peerity.io.     The Peerity Crowdfund      The Peerity token pre-sale is open NOW and offers 20 million tokens at a ground floor level price ~20c (1 ETH = 1500 PEER).   Token pre-sale start date: November 1, 2017  Token pre-sale end date: November 30, 2017   The pre-sale will be based on an Ethereum ERC20 token, which will be redeemable for our native Peer tokens after the Peerity beta platform launches, spring 2018.   The public crowd-sale with exchange rates 1ETH = 750-1000 PEER will start on the 1st of Feb 2018.
