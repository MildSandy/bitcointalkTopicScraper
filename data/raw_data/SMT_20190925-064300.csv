To proof it's value there is a great chance in countries where the 3G/4G network isn't available or affordable.

I spent the last 5 hours trying to research this ICO and company. Let's just say I would be extremely cautious.  The project is all very new, having started in October. The Github isn't very active. The founder, Henry Wang does not really seem to have any employees, the people listed aren't directly involved. The organization he founded and is president of; International Blockchain Application Federation (IBAF), is just this project, some similar Israeli federation which hasn't started yet, and a conference in Singapore he attended. They claim to have international companies... I think they would be listed in that case.  If you see their webpage, they started their ICO on the 29th Nov, and it's supposedly 99% done. Yet very little has been contributed today. There was 2 transactions of 1 ETH each... then unfortunately someone dropped nearly 100 now. :/  The Raiden Network interview/QA was with ""someone important""... completely unnamed.  He claimed to have had meetings with a member of the chinese standing politburo etc etc. I can't disprove it, but there is nothing to back it up. There is an image of him with Obama, but I don't think it's the real Obama. According to the timeline, Wang was in Singapore at a conference. Obama didn't visit Singapore at that time...  Now the white paper is impressive, the idea seems good to my untrained eye. But the company don't seem to have the know-how to implement it at all.  Last but not least the terms and conditions are horrible, and lets them get away with the scam.",False

However, Henry Wang presented on stage at Coin Telegraph's Blockshow Asia a few days ago, and the project seems credible to me. I also met some of the team at their stand and nothing seemed off. I asked about the high percentage of funding already completed and was told most of it was done during presale. The funds flowed in pretty fast in the hours after the presentation, including a drop of 300 Ether. So my guess was that at least some due diligence was done at least by that particular investor.

Yeah, you will receive the tokens for sure, but I doubt their intended future use will be there. It is interesting that you talked to them. I knew they were at that conference for real.  Of course, the reason I researched them in the first place is because the idea was good.  Their plan is to release the mobile wallets and off-internet communication platforms this month (and very little github activity to back that up) Then delays across the board will happen.  Also even with the ICO the team won't really have capital to hire developers, even if they offer their tokens as payments they have to be locked up for 24 months according to their plans.

We provide secure, private, off-internet communication and payment services globally. http://i1.fuimg.com/629419/ebddaf8ad94f521d.png The SmartMesh app and protocol allow users of smartphones, tablets to form Mesh networks at any time and any location without requiring internet or telecom services.  When a Mesh network is formed, users have all the functionality of standard social media, messaging, communications and data transfers and can also make secure offline payments and transactions.  A Mesh network could be as small as 2 people or as large as hundreds or thousands.  People can discover other users, chat with them, send photos, video and files and make transfers in various cryptocurrencies.  Since a SmartMesh mesh network runs its own blockchain and leverages Lightning Network and Raiden technology, transfers can be kept secure and private, as well as performed when both users are offline.  SmartMesh mesh networks run parallel to the internet and can sustain themselves anywhere regardless of the level of existing infrastructure.  Villages, regions and terrains that never before could benefit from internet connectivity, can now be enabled with their very own network ecosystem complete with communications, data sharing and payment abilities.  SmartMesh is the next stage of internet, networking and digital payment evolution.  http://i1.fuimg.com/629419/287fb63664712c3d.pnghttp://i1.fuimg.com/629419/f570034f7aa68694.png  SmartMesh is a User Autonomous Communication Protocol through which smartphone users are incentivized with tokens to build a decentralized mesh network. SmartMesh will also feature multihop functions where users can supply their device as a data packet relay node in the mesh network and receive crypto micropayments in SMT Tokens in return for supporting the network.  SmartMesh's SMT Token had a hugely successful ICO in Q4 of 2017 completing it's fundraising goal in a mere 6 days.  Now the SMT Token is being traded openly on cryptocurrency exchanges such as huobi.pro and gate.io and will be listed on others very soon. http://i1.fuimg.com/629419/97e0a46839ed42ce.png http://i1.fuimg.com/629419/97e0a46839ed42ce.png SmartMesh will be augmented by MeshBox technology (MeshBox.Network) which will allow MeshBoxes to support and strengthen SmartMesh Mesh networks.
