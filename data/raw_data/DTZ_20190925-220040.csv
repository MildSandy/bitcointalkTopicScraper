Their solution involves an Acorns-style approach to change. According to the official whitepaper, “Digitize is an ecosystem which will provide users with a digital wallet, and allow them to save their loose change and cash digitally, at the point of a transaction.  Token The Digitize token is the entire foundation upon which the ecosystem rests. The utility of tokens are as follows:  Incentives For Businesses     An innovative payment option.     Increased security as currency is kept on a digital platform and not physical.     Ability to accept multiple payment options for goods and services;     Reduced reliance on physical currency i.e. to keep coins to give as change.     Networking opportunities to interact with new businesses that will complement their own business.     Provide attractive promotion and loyalty rewards to acquire and retain consumers.     Get direct customer feedback.  Incentives For Consumers     Being able to use Digitize tokens to purchase goods and services.     Carrying less physical currency.     Not losing money as it will all be digital in their own personal wallet.     Ability to exchange to Ethereum and invest in the Crypto-index.     Having new innovative rewards programs with retailers.     Ability to earn Digitize Tokens for referrals.  Token Distribution According to the white paper, Digitize will initially keep 10% of tokens in reserve to ensure liquidity and supply. Once the reserve is diminished, Digitize will purchase tokens regularly to ensure liquidity remains positive, by buying tokens at market price when token allocation is below 5% of total supply of Digitize holdings. The total allocation of tokens will be 60% to sale to the public, 20% will be reserved for the team, 5% will be saved for advisers, 3% will be used to fund the bounty and airdrop programs, and 2% will be allocated for community managers. The remainder 10% will be used as a contingency for future reserves. The whitepaper states that an airdrop will be scheduled three weeks after the ICO for individuals that refer a friend to Digitize, through their unique link. The proceeds from the token sale are allocated as follows:     Research and Development Costs 65%     Sales and Marketing 23%     Admin and Operational 10%     Legal Costs 2% Any tokens not sold in the token sale, will either be burnt or distributed equally to existing token holders.  Team The Team looks pretty legitimate and appears to be doing their best to follow ICO best practices, including getting their smart contract audited. Their CEO has double bachelors in Engineering and Business Management from The University of Technology, Sydney. He has over 6 years of experience in the tech industry last working as a portfolio manager with IBM, where he managed the Westpac account, which is one of Australia’s leading banks. Their head engineer is a blockchain engineer particularly interested in Ethereum and Smart Contracts. In the fiat world, he has over 10 years of international experience in Big Data and Machine Learning projects. He got his MSc in High-Performance Computing with distinction from the University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Notably, he also helped create the backend for PlayStation 4. He is also a triple winner in two different international IBM Apache Spark competitions and a handful of other successful hackathons. The rest of the team is fairly large with skills useful to this type of project. Their ICO advisers are also fantastic. For example: One of them is Lead ICO Adviser at MoonShot Asia and also the Senior Talent Acquisition Specialist at CryptoRecruit. Another is the founder of OpenInfluence, featured in Forbes 30 under 30 in the area of Marketing and Advertising. Another is currently a Director at Kapronasia, one of Asia’s leading financial technology research and consulting firms. In short, this is a well-rounded team with good advisers.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and opportunities associated with Digitize.  Risks     When completed, the Digitize platform will be dependent on third parties to adopt, implement and to continue to develop, supply, and otherwise support the platform. There is no guarantee that those third parties will uphold their end of the bargain which will have an adverse effect on the Digitize platform. This is an example where relinquishing control could be problematic. -3.5     While the Digitize team does seem to focus heavily on marketing at the outset, it seems problematic that there won’t be a dedicated sales team to onboard retailers. This seems like a problem stemming from worshipping the decentralized ideology of the blockchain over actual business value. -2.5  Growth Potential     Low token supply is always a plus. This means it will not take a lot of capital to raise the price. +2     The team seems highly qualified and has gotten out of their way to legitimize the project. They did this by getting a trusted third party to audit their smart contract (it was cleared with flying colors) as well as by putting their own exhaustive list of risks in the whitepaper themselves. +4.5     Every use of the proceeds of the token sale is painstakingly mapped out in their roadmap. +3  Disposition We arrive at a score of 5.5 out of 10 for Digitize. While this could be a worthy investment, the Achilles heel for long-term hodlers will be whether mass retailer adoption actually occurs.  Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-digitize/",True

PHYSICAL CURRENCY CHALLENGES With the increased number of governments and central banks wanting to digitize their national currencies, it reinforces the disadvantages of physical currencies and the wide scale benefits of digital currencies (Young, 2018). One of the critical factors in moving away from physical currencies is the large cost involved in manufacturing notes and coins. A report published by CoinDesk estimates the global production cost of notes in 2014 as $26.5 billion USD and $1.5 billion USD for coins. These figures are extrapolated only from the materials and labour operational costs needed to manufacture currency, and do not contain any other factors like environmental implication and energy costs.

Today, I'm going to give you a quick presentation of Mr. Umer Aslam The founder of DIGITIZE  Umer started his career at a young age working within the retail sector. Through his experience working in both fast food restaurants and grocery chains, he understood behavioral patterns of consumer purchases. Umer then went on to complete a double bachelor in Engineering and Business Management from The University of Technology, Sydney. He kick started his corporate career within the IT industry working within the project management space and has over 6 years of experience in the technology space, recently working as a portfolio manager with IBM, managing the Westpac account, one of Australia’s leading banks. In this role Umer gained valuable experience managing projects within the payments domain, as well as Big Data. Umer was quick to realise market shifts in consumer behaviours and payment platforms, which led to Umer’s interest in digital currencies. Umer’s extensive experience in project management and payment technology, as well as his network of connections provides him with a strong foundation to lead the Digitize project and team.",True

Enabling the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency through the conversion of loose change  Good morning,  I'm campaigning for DigitizeCoin Coin, which you can reach :  Here are a few lines from the document provided by DigitizeCoin that made me choose this project and that shows you how DigitizeCoin can improve parts operation and shows you the cost of manufacturing some parts in the world.   A report published by CoinDesk estimates the global production cost of notes in 2014 as $26.5 billion USD and $1.5 billion USD for coins. These figures are extrapolated only from the materials and labour operational costs needed to manufacture currency, and do not contain any other factors like environmental implication and energy cost.  Surprisingly, some of the coins cost more to produce then they are actually worth. Statistics from the US Federal Reserve Mint show that both the nickel and penny cost more to make than they are worth. A quarter, worth 25¢, only costs 9¢ to make while a dime only costs about 4¢. On the other hand, a penny costs 1.66¢. The nickel, with a face value of 5¢, costs 8¢ to produce. It can be noted many government bodies are budgeting billions of dollars annually in the production of physical currencies, while majority of the population are more inclined to move away from physical cash to digital currencies (These Coins Cost More to Make than They're Worth - Wall Street Survivor Blog, 2018).  With new technical advancements, digital payments are becoming increasingly faster and preferred payment option when compared to cash, a recent study by the Reserve Bank of Australia shows with retail transactions increasingly move to cards. A big reason for this change is the speed and convenience of contactless payments, which now make up two thirds of all card transactions in Australia. Further research shows Generation Y and Millennials prefer to not carry and hold cash due to the growth of other payment options. With the introduction of card holders and NFC based payments from mobile phones, more people are moving away from carrying cash, and more specifically, coins. An estimated 56 percent of Americans build up their change rather than spend it on a day to day basis. As many as 77 percent have a jug of coins around the house, worth an average $40 (Lubbock online, 2018).  How DigitizeCoin can help us, below an example:  Mainstream Adoption DigitizeCoin’s aim is to promote mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. Our target in achieving this goal will be realized through enabling the conversion of loose change into crypto-currency at the retail point-of-sale which will then be held on an easy to use mobile digital wallet. The DigitizeCoin mobile wallet will be available on android and IOS markets to download and use by anyone. In addition, there is no restriction of the type, size, or location of retailer who may use the app. This combination of features allows retailers to quickly on-board onto the DigitizeCoin platform and start using QR codes and Blockchain technology to help users convert their change to cryptography.  That is why I am doing this campaign to promote DigitizeCoin which has a promising future. What do you think of that?",True

I frequently get asked the same questions : - Why Digitize? - What is the vision?   I thought I'd take some time to answer these questions for the community.  WHY DIGITIZE?  Digitize was founded through two frustrations:  1) Carrying loose change.  2) Difficulty in purchasing cryptocurrencies.  Let’s focus on the first point to begin. Frustration of carrying loose change. Let’s face it, no one likes loose change! Whether it’s crammed in your wallet or moving and jingling around in your pockets, loose change is a burden that everyone has to deal with because it’s valuable and throwing it away doesn't make cents or sense. Digitize will solve this problem by letting you save your change at the point of sale, straight into your own digital wallet. The main goal here is to cater for the general public. We are specifically catering for the public who know nothing about crypto. We believe we can help them into our platform by providing a 'digital piggy bank'. Once we have these users onboard saving their change digitally, we can educate them about cryptocurrencies and the benefits, hence building trust with the technology and enabling mainstream adoption.  The second point focus’ on the difficulty in purchasing cryptocurrencies. The majority of the public still views cryptocurrencies as a nightmare to purchase - especially given the technicalities involved. Digitize will make this process as simple and seamless as using cash through registered retailers. Further, with the recent bans of credit card and debit payments worldwide, there is an even greater need for a cash based purchase platform.  Hope this helps and gives you more information about digitize",True

OUR VISION  Provide the public ways to convert loose change and spare cash into cryptocurrency. Our team believes this will create mainstream adoption. If you’re thinking, “Ahhh, who uses money for purchases anymore?” or “The world runs on plastic”, have a look at these stats.  Australians toss $39 million in loose change each month. Americans throw away $62 million (USD) in coins each year. Brittons have 1.1 billion (GBP) in loose change. Airline passengers lost $675,000 USD at Los Angeles and San Francisco International Airports alone. And if you’re still thinking cash isn’t used anymore to facilitate loose change, consider that today, worldwide, two billion adults remain without a bank account. This is just under a quarter of the world’s population. This means they’re only using one thing. Cash. And do you want to know how many use mobile phones? Six billion. We have a nice amount of work ahead of us. We hope that you’ll join our team and introduce cryptocurrency to the world, no matter how small those corners may be.

We will be announcing soon  Quote from: richelle87 on February 15, 2018, 10:42:00 AM In order to become a retailer we need to store some cash or to buy digitize token. And for the consumers, do they need to have also an investment or to purchase a token in order to be able to use the platform or it will be open for all? Correct me if i am wrong, as what i have observe, it was introduce as a mobile application. Therefore we need to manually scan the consumers barcode in order to transfer the change. How about the shops which hire employees, do every employee need to download the app or you have a way in order to connect this platform to the cashier's computer?  Thanks for your query. The platform will be on a mobile application for anyone including retailers and consumers to download and use, provided they pass all KYC checks (this is needed as per regulation). Yes, the way it will work is the retailer will act a middleman for consumers to purchase DTZ from Digitize. Retailers will be incentivized for their service. The retailer will need to scan the QR code from the consumer to transfer DTZ.  We have refrained from connecting our platform to a retailers POS system as this involves lots of work and configuration issues. Each retailers POS system is different, and it is virtually impossible to connect it to POS to reach a global market. For this reason, and to avoid extensive costs, we will deploy our platform on a mobile application for all to use. It is up to the retailer on how they use our services, either from personal devices or a shared device among employees.  Quote from: yuisefb8 on February 15, 2018, 10:59:26 AM If the project is in mobile, can we still be able to access the platform while in offline mode or will it not cause any errors in scanning the codes? For some countries, especially In Asia which is part of your targeted areas of where this project is to be launch have a problem on internet connections. Also some people are short tempered type of person, so how will you deal with these?  You can access the platform in offline mode, however you will not be able to facilitate transfers or payments while offline.  Quote from: tophe15 on February 15, 2018, 11:08:22 AM Great concept for this will also help cryptocurrency users to save some tokens and coins easily by just receiving the change as a digitize token instead of a fiat, and as we get to store more tokens it will be able to use also to purchased items in a store which support this platform. Once this will be used by some stores, i believe that it will become popular quickly. My question is, is there a fee for choosing digitize token as a change instead of fiat or will we receive the exact value of our change in tokens?  Yes as stated in the whitepaper, the consumer will pay a 4% fee to use the platform. 2% of this will go to the retailer - as an incentive to provide this service. The other 2% will go to Digitize.",True
