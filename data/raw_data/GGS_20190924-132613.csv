We are guiding you through how you can participate in the Gilgam.es pre-sale ICO If it is the first time and you don't know how to buy ETH and use a decentralized wallet: 1.   Find a safe and secure exchange  (e.g. Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp) that supports cryptocurrency tradeing and set up an account there. 2.   When you have an account, find out and calculate how much ETH you will need in order to buy the desired amount of tokens; and buy the required sum of ETH. 3.   When this transaction is closed and you receive the required sum of ETH,  you will have a centralized wallet. 4.   However, for buying and handling your tokens, you will need a decentralized wallet (e.g. MyEtherWallet, Jaxx) with a private key. 5.   Generate a wallet. Important: back up both your password and the generated private key, because if you lose it, there is no way you can get back the ETH in your wallet! 6.   Now you will get a public address. Copy it, and go back to your centralized wallet. From here, send your funds to the above address, i.e. to your decentralized wallet. 7.   Now you are ready to send ETH! If you already have some ETH in your wallet: 1.   Give the address of your Ethereum wallet 2.   Give your referrer code (optional) 3.   Accept conditions of buying by checking the boxes (Risk Disclosures, Presale Agreement, Acknowledgment and Declaration) 4.   Verify that you are not a bot and check captcha 5.   Check if you have filled in everything correctly 6.   Send, in order to confirm your intention to buy 7.   We check the address you have given and if you have accepted the conditions 8.   If everything is OK, you will receive a smart contract address from us 9.   Enter your own wallet and make a transaction with the smart contract address If you do not have any Ethers, calculate how much ETH you will need for buying tokens. Pre-sale price will be 850 GGS=1ETH. It is important to buy before registration! If you do not know how to buy ETH, send us an ask invitation to our slack channel and we will help you!",False

Whitepaper | Website | Website Asia | Twitter | Facebook | Slack  ICO will starts 06/20/2017 12:00 CET The crowdsale site is: https://ico.gilgam.es/ico  E-SPORT PLATFORM FOR EVERYONE! MAKE PROFIT FROM EVERY GAME YOU PLAY! Gilgam.es is planning and preparing to launch a platform allowing both individual players and teams to compete in popular eSport games – DOTA2, League of Legends, Counter Strike: Global Offense, Call of Duty, etc... – supervised by our own artificial intelligence.  The client application, which can be downloaded from our landing page, will run within an electron framework on JavaScript, HTML, CSS basis platform will not depend on the operating system of the user. The first anti-cheat defense line is embedded in the the client application. It monitors the programs used by the user and their interference with the running game program. The interface will allow the user to create an account by funding a new Ethereum address with Ether via an established payment processor.  SECURITY OF PLAYERS The biggest problem in every online game is cheating, either financially (credit card frauds) or in-game cheating. We aim to eliminate the risk of the former by decentralizing transactions on the basis of ethereum blockchain; while in case of the latter, we are planning to eliminate in-game cheating by means of strict KYC software monitoring, using our own artificial intelligence FINANCIAL DECENTRALIZATION Financial transactions of players will be conducted by smart contracts running on Ethereum blockchain, the execution of which cannot be manipulated externally, thus they are executed in accordance with pre-coded outcomes. Fast payments Secure transactions Smart-contracts AUTOMATED FILTERING The artificial intelligence developed by us will analyze the outcome of every match and determine the result of the game. Parties may accept this outcome or place their complaints. Client based app filtering AI based match filtering KYC based user filtering ELECTRON CLIENT The platform will be developed divided into several regions in order to keep pings low and distribute network load. The regions are planned to be the following: Asia Australia Europe North America South America  HOW IT WORKS LIVE TO PLAY, PLAY FOR A LIVING Gilgam.es Ltd. is developing a platform independent E-Sport platform. This platform will allow every e-sport fan to make some profit from their skills. Using the platform is very simple.  OUR MARKET WHY ESPORTS MATTERS TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING YOU ""Esports is the biggest disruption to hit our industry since the iPhone in 2007"" The traditional focus of game publishers has been on the gamers themselves, who spend money directly in or on their titles. More recently, publishers have put another group at the center of their marketing effort: the content creators who create and share game video content on channels such as YouTube, Hitbox, DingIt and Twitch. This group has proved to be a valuable and cost-effective marketing tool for publishers, bringing increased attention and players to their games. Esports is a prime example of this. Esports competitions and the content around them help publishers to grow engaged and active communities around their titles, prolonging the lifespan of their gamers and transforming their titles into true entertainment brands. The number of viewers can easily outnumber the number of gamers and could provide as much monetization opportunities as the players themselves.  The global eSports market generated $748M in revenue in 2015E, and is expected to grow to $1.9B by 2018E. North America and Europe comprise 52% of the market as they continue to rapidly invest in the space. One American analyst even predicts that the eSports market in the U.S. alone will grow from $85M in 2014 to $1.2B in 2018, a compound annual growth rate of 93.8%.
