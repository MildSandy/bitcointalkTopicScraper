So, we’re inviting you to go to our Lendo website, explore our videos and white papers, and then sign up.  What is Lendo?  At the heart of the Lendo concept is a blockchain-based platform that enables conventional loans companies to provide loans in Euros, Pounds or other fiat currency against cryptocurrencies as collateral. The crypto collateral will be stored in Lendo’s ultra high security Crypto Vault, built with Lendo’s proprietary software.  In the future, as part of Lendo’s roadmap, we will build a complete cryptobanking ecosystem that would offer a one-stop shop for cryptocurrency owners who want to store, exchange, trade or spend their crypto assets, plus a payment system that will online sellers to accept BTC or ETH as payments. These may be major retailers, or a small boutique business selling a single product line. Size doesn’t matter; Lendo provides a service to everyone.  The Lendo Team  The Lendo team is an exciting blend of seasoned business professionals from the conventional world of finance and cutting edge experts in blockchain technology. We believe this combination of youth and maturity gives Lendo an edge over other ICO projects where proven and balanced business experience is lacking.  ELT — the Lendo Token  Lendo is a UK-registered company and it is offering you its Ethereum Lendo Token (ELT), which is on the Ethereum blockchain using standard ERC223. Each ELT costs €0.20 (20 cents) and during the period of the pre-ICO, token buyers will get a fantastic 50% bonus.  During the ICO, which lasts for four months from April 30th, the ELTs will remain at the price of €0.20. However, there are bonuses starting at 30% and dropping to 10% during the period of the ICO — meaning, the earlier you buy your ELT, the less they will cost you. Detailed information about this is at Lendo’s ICO Hub.  So, please visit Lendo.io and discover the best choice ICO for 2018.",False

The rest of the tokens are split between the Founders and Advisors and a Reserve bank of tokens. Lendo is actively working towards an application for an initial listing on the GBX (Gibraltar Blockchain Exchange). We have taken this step because the GBX which is a subsidiary of the Gibraltar Stock Exchange will shortly be fully regulated by the Gibraltar authorities. This will mean that the Lendo ICO is fully regulated in line with our policy of seeking maximum regulation. The process of becoming listed is exacting and there is no guarantee of a successful listing at this stage, however it is a primary focus for the team, so that when the ICO closes, token holders will be able to trade on a fully regulated exchange. It may be that other exchanges will wish to list the tokens also, and in the nature of the free market they are free to do so. We expect to be listed by coinmarketcap.com as soon as ELT is listed on its first exchange Internal Exchange An internal exchange will go live from June 2018 onwards enabling token holders to exchange ELT for BTC, ETH, and fiat currencies.  I would invite you to join our telegram channel where you can ask all sort of Lendo related questions. We have 24/7 admins and also an AMA meetings with the management. those are links to our website and SM Channels  Lendo official website - https://lendo.io/ blog - https://lendo.io/news/  Facebook  - https://www.facebook.com/Lendoio-347976328995672/ Telegram - https://t.me/LendoPlatform Medium - https://medium.com/@lendoplatformltd LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/company/lendo-io/ Twitter - https://twitter.com/Lendo_io  Regards, Asya Karsheva Social Media Consultant Lendo Team",False
