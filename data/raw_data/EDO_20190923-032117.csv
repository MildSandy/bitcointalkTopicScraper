Returning to your main question about the future of EIDOO, I tell you that it will have a bright future and I am almost certain that it will enter the Top 20 market.

Dollar price is not looking good right now, but at least we did not go down too much in BTC and ETH. Also I would not expect any significant price changes when the exchange is finally delivered, at least not during such market. Hopefully they will burn some tokens soon.

Dont be funny. Today we learnt that EDO has frozen 6million tokens and released them in an unknown period of time. Just as you guys, we were suspecting who was selling EDO from 2900-3000 sats.. Then we thought it might be EDO itself founders. We decided to follow up Circulating Supply and Total Supply through Coinmarketcap. (because it would rise if founders etc were selling) Circulating supply was around 20M as usual.. We didnt check last 10-15 days.  Today we noticed that Circulating Supply is now 29M.  Then we asked how and when it happened at EDO Official Telegram Channel. They said that, ""Old circulating supply on coinmarketcap was wrong. It was about 24 Millions EDO. Then at the beginning of January was unlocked 6 Millions EDO (as you can read in the whitepaper). Last week it was updated on coinmarketcap""  Here is the proof of what they said; https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DU4EU_LWkAAmmII.jpg:large  So guys, they have embedded this information into hidden corner of Whitepaper and Medium Blog. They didnt mention on Twitter, Telegram, Facebook or Coinmarketcalendar.  Do you now understand why we couldnt break that 5000 satoshi wall ? Yea, that was him ! It was impossible to break 6 million tokens wall. Do you now understand who is selling tokens from 2900-3500 satoshi ? Thats him again.

This means that we need a robust branding to be recognizable and have a consistent theme because we want to establish a significant and differentiated presence in the market to attract and retain loyal supporters like you. To do so, we are working on our branding, improving our logo, app design, colors, and more.  ICO Engine On Friday, we launched a new service called “ICO Engine” to help new startups in organizing their token sales through our mobile app available for both iOS and Android. This tool has already been used by us to organize our successful token sale a few months ago.  The main advantage regarding the use of our ICO Engine is security, as Eidoo has a reliable system that ensures the safety of the funding avoiding the risk of assets loss that might be due to computer hacking or scams. In fact, we want to provide a safe tool that guarantees that the ICO address is always the same so that funds arrive at the startup correctly. Another advantage is that Eidoo has high visibility, thanks to our 130k downloads and, because of that, we have a massive potential for airdrops that are becoming a useful for new tokens for creating a significant advertising effect for users who recognize receiving a gift that has a quantifiable value.  To better advertise and explain this new tool we have also created a new section of the site that you can visit here.  ERC20 Tokens List A few days ago, we updated our official website adding a new page called “Supported Tokens,” as you can read in the top right menu. This page contains a vast ERC20 tokens list. Eidoo, in fact, supports all the ERC20 and ERC223 tokens, so you can use our wallet to store these Ethereum-based tokens.  This ERC20 tokens list has been filled automatically with all the tokens included in Coinmarketcap, so it is almost complete, but it might happen that some tokens may be missing, especially if they have an ongoing ICO or pre-sale.",False

This ICO is only about the release of a multi-cryptocurrency wallet with an integrated Exchange (for ETH tokens). So, not very different from WAVES with their embedded DEX exchange in their wallet (website and soon mobile. Waves app with exchange is currently in pilot).  So, I guess the value of the EDO is determined basis the usage of the integrated Exchange. Probably, EDO has to be paid (as a fee) for every transaction made on the integrated exchange.  I understand the money-making (EDO coin value) concept but how is it different from WAVES? And, why is the start-price for the token so incredible expensive? 130 tokens for 1 ETH?! Today, that's around $2.15 per EDO coin! Why is that? Today the coin is of zero value, not being used and the multi-cryptocurrency wallet with an integrated Exchange has not even proven itself today.
