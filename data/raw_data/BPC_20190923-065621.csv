We understand this Developing blockchain-based Programmatic Ad Platform is a very complicated task, associated with many risks like any other technology business. Most important risks worth mentioning include:  Competition: existing large players in programmatic advertising, including Google or Facebook may introduce their blockchain architecture and issue their ownprogrammatic ad tokens. There are also numerous early-stage startups chasing the same niche with brilliant engineering talent and sufficient funding. At the moment we do not see any sign of Google and Facebook activity pursuing this opportunity, however, there is no guarantee for them not to change their minds.  Internal execution: BPC will fail to deliver blockchain solution. BPC owns patentpending blockchain technology allowing to support over 100K transactions/sec, which is unprecedented both for traditional programmatic applications and existing blockchain-based solutions. This technology implementation requires proper verification and validation in real life. Demand generation and market growth: BPC will fail to conquer sufficient market share and produce revenue flows to cover expenses. Like any marketplace, ad programmatic exchange only works efficiently when there is a critical mass of sellers and buyers adopting the platform. The concept of blockchain and use a transaction coin is novice and currently unknown to publishers and advertisers. A significant marketing effort is required to convince publishers and advertisers to join BPC platform as an alternative to existing solutions. Let me know if you'll have more questions.",False

As the ICO concludes we will start negotiations with exchange platforms. The final decision of listing us on exchanges lays upon exchanges their self. The first exchanges to list tokens are usually Liqui, YoBit, Tidex, HitBTC. You can liquify your tokens any time you wish. However, we aim to succeed.

Many of the larger web publishers of the world use a supply-side platform to automate and optimize the selling of their online media space.A supply-side platform interfaces on the publisher side to advertising networks and exchanges, which in turn interface to demand-side platforms (DSP) on the advertiser side.This system allows advertisers to put online advertising before a selected target audience. SSPs send potential impressions into ad exchanges, where DSPs purchase them on marketers’ behalf, depending on specific targeting attributes. By offering impressions to as many potential buyers as possible publishers can maximize the revenue. Therefore, SSPs are sometimes referred to as yield-optimization platforms. Often, real-time bidding (RTB) is used to complete DSP transactions.",False

They are not large enough to be highly demanded and join profitable private marketplaces. The open market though makes them earn less as a significant share of their traffic is being rejected based on traffic quality providers evaluation, which is neither transparent nor predictable. BPC would offer convenient self-service tools and the excellent opportunity to earn more compared to what these publishers are offered participating in ad networks, that are suggested to increase publishers revenues instead of biting even more off them. BPC Platform will support a wide variety of services for publishers and advertisers. CPM tokens will be used as an accounting unit in insertion orders and smart contracts. Due to the platform versatility, we expect our customers to use CPM in traditional operations and create novel services.  Such novel services which do not currently exist in today’s programmatic industry could include sale of options to buy publisher’s future inventory, to reward users for cooperation, content review, traffic quality recommendations, etc.",False
