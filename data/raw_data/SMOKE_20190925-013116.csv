Please remember that ICO participants will get early access to the Smoke Network main-net compared to Airdrop and regular users. This will allow ICO users to start earning Smoke on Smoke.io sooner than everyone else.   To recap by owning a stake in smoke network you will have the benefit of:   Earning additional cryptocurrency for posting and promoting content and getting content upvoted by the community on the Smoke.io social network (you get paid when you or your fans like your content) Purchasing Ads using the SMOKE cryptocurrency on the network to target relevant cannabis users Paying a low price per SMOKE compared to its future potential value after our main network launch,False

Most coins only have ERC20 contract and raise millions. Here you are, have working blockchain testnet code up and running and softcap and hardcap very small numbers.  i will explain the reasons why i am investing in SMOKE.  1 :Tired of the SCAM and P&D coin around the forum which is manipulated by big investors and 'influencers' and almost impossible to get the same price for normal people like me as all the big investors get large discounts and dump, 95% of the shitty coins are just made for a group of peoples who can control everything including exchange listings and all aspects of play and when they get some BTC from sells ICO/instamine/secret pool/premine they just disappear and create a new coin and start up a new ICO, sometimes even with the same advisors on the team! ....there is no end because there is always peoples how don't know that and follow the wolf like McAffee and others online.  2 :I am bibg supporter of cannabis and specially if it's for medical.  3 :BTC had this success because of SR and black market so i go back to the fundamentals with SMOKE as I see people talk about encryption and a fast chain here.  4: If lots of dispensary and auxillary businesses buy SMOKE to make a social media account the value will become very real in the eyes of the cannabis community at large and with real value comes real good deal for holding long term (I hodl gang).  5 : For the moment supply is very low and with only 10% inflation it will stay low which means the moon later.  6 : I did not smoke for a month so buying SMOKE ICO is like buying weed, that rush you get.  i am sure that this community will grow up strong and this coin will become a major coin and success of the cannabis industry.  i hope all is real and this is not a scam .

Correct me   Thank you!  ---   Smoke.Network is a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) blockchain tailored to the needs and wants of cannabis users and SMOKE is the coin that powers it. To learn more read our whitepaper. Our first minimal viable product (MVP), Smoke.io is currently in development and is scheduled to be released in Q3 2018 along with our mainnet blockchain.   The SMOKE cryptocurrency is not like other cannabis coins as it has different functionality to just a store of value or transmitting money. It is the backbone that runs the Smoke Network blockchain and will power important aspects of the network including content rewards for high quality content. It will also have additional use cases such as buying advertising credits on the Smoke.io DApp in SMOKE and unlocking new features for the Smoke.io app and website.  At Smoke Network we respect all cannabis cryptocurrencies in the scene and their ideas for a better future with cannabis. That said, we have been careful to position ourselves as the only decentralized cannabis social network on the market and the only cannabis project aimed at the social networking and media space. We are also the only project in which we believe our Coins have direct utility value on our social network for the average user.  ---   Quote from: ckybe on April 26, 2018, 09:20:14 AM Smoke get paid, repeat huh?   How does that work?   Our blockchain is a fork of Steem based on a delegated proof of stake blockchain (similar to EOS and Bitshares, etc).  (Delegated Proof of Stake).  In this model instead of miners like on Ethereum and Bitcoin we have witnesses and proof of stake consensus. The new rewards are daily put into a reward pool that is then split as follows: 75% goes to the reward pool to reward users on the platform, 15% goes to holders of smoke and 10% goes to the miners. This model has worked great for Steem as users have to Power Up their coins in order to vote on where the daily rewards go as well as vote on who should be the block producers.  This creates an environment whereby anyone that powers up has stake in the network and can influence where and how new coins are distributed via voting on content.   Long term holders also get issued 15% APR in SMOKE Power if they have vested Smoke.  Vested SMOKE (Smoke Power) cannot be sent or moved, only used to vote.",False

You can expect stake in the network itself, yes.  They actually made a decision to basically modify the number available as well.  Those buying in are getting a higher % than before.  One could say they are ""on sale"" because of this (in a way) since buyers actually receive a higher % of the stake per BTC than before.      Great answer.",False
