Passive increase of returns and capacity.   Weekly returns but NOT a security token!!!   Smart contract integrated system.   ETHernitymining will exclusively use renawable of grid resources OR on grid resources if they include at least 90% green energy. One of ETHernityminings main goals is to deliver a mining services that contributes to a much healthier environment. That's why we obtained to exclusively use green resources. Using renewable energy gives us an additional advantage => cheapest energy in the world.  ETHernitymining will deliver returns and capacity that increase in time. ETHernitymining uses a self expandable model which results in an increasing weekly return and mining capacity. 20% of the weekly mining returns will be used to expand existing facilities or set up new facilities. In this way our mining facilities will expand without extra funds needs to be invested.  ETM is not a security token Compared to other services ETM will be one of the very first that is not a security token. ETHernitymining organizes a hardware group bulk purchase through its token sale. So by contributing to the ICO you actually purchase your personal share of the mining equipment. ETHernitymining doesn't share company profit but only acts as a service that organizes the group purchase and manage the mining facilities. The weekly profits that are paid to your wallet are earnings on your purchased equipment share and not company earnings. Therefore ETM isn't a security token and has no country restrictions.  Smart contract integrated system We deliver the very first mining service that will be managed by smart contracts and verifiable on the blockchain. We do not use a payment platform for deposits or withdrawals. Every sunday @ 6pm CET our smart contract tracks all wallets holding ETM tokens and will distribute the mining returns directly to the token holders wallets. This is the most secure way. No more worries your account gets hacked, funds stolen, waiting for withdrawal requests to get processed, no more waiting until you reached the min. withdrawal limit,... Every week you will get paid straight into your personal wallet.  HOW DO WE WORK?   STEP 1 Contribute to our token sale. By purchasing ETM tokens you actually contribute to our hardware bulk purchase and you will become owner of the hardware you paid for. As soon as the ICO ends our attorney will legalize a document where every contributor is listed together with his share in the bulk group purchase. If we sell out completelly 1ETM will equal 0.00000067% of all future ETHernitymining projects.  STEP 2 As soon as our first facility is up and running your ETM tokens are granted to receive weekly returns on your share in the mining hardware. As long as you keep your tokens in your personal wallet you will receive your weekly returns directly into your personal wallet. ETM tokens are a proof of ownership of the mining hardware. So as long as you keep your tokens you will keep receiving returns. You will receive returns on the core mining facility and on every other facility we set up with the 20% compounding model.  STEP 3 You are the owner of the mining hardware backed by your token. This gives you the freedom to do whatever you want. You aren't tied to a certain duration. If you want to quit or urgently need money you can sell your token on any exchange that accepts ETM trading. By selling your tokens you sell your mining hardware share and hand over the right to receive weekly returns to the person you sent the tokens to.  ADVANTAGES  Most secure mining service Everything is managed by our smart contract. We only need to convert all different mined coins in ETH. All the rest is managed by the smart contract. As long as you keep your private keys there will never be someone able to get access to your mining returns.  Up to 30% bonus We negotiated a deal with a South African mining company and hardware provider. Depending on the succes of our token sale we will receive a discount up to 30% rewarded in extra mining hardware. This means you will receive up to 30% more mining capacity for the same invested amount.  Transparency All transactions and hardware owners will be visible on the blockchain and in our smart contract. There will be a platform where everyone can track the results of all our mining facilities in real time. Token holders will have the opportunity to visit our facilities. We have an agreement with Price Waterhouse Cooper. They will regularly audit our company and will deliver an audit report with all details about our mining facilities and returns.  Freedom Other mining services offer mining participations with a predetermined duration. During this period you are tied to their services. Our service uses its tokens as a proof of ownership. You are free to buy or sell tokens as soon as they are tradable. So actually you can quit your mining service at any time. You only need to sell your tokens.  Most profitable mining opportunity Depending on the succes of our token sale you will instantly receive a bonus up to 30% as a direct result of our deal with the mining company and hardware provider. Beside this bonus we use a 20% reinvestment strategy. By using this strategy we can manage to let the capacity and returns grow with 2-3% on a monthly basis. A combination of the bonus and the compounding we are able to create a mining opportunity that will not be affected that much by difficulty increase and other external factors.  Exclusivity All unsold tokens will be burned. People who miss out the token sale will only be able to benefit from our mining services by purchasing tokens on the exchanges.    TOKEN AND ICO DETAILS  Token details  Name: ETHernitymining Symbol: ETM Total supply: 150.000.000ETM Token functions: - Your amount of ETM tokens indicate your share in the group purchase.                          - ETM tokens proof your ownership of mining hardware and give you the right to receive your returns.

POWER OF OUR SYSTEM         This box shows the approximate results of a 10GPU mining rig at our South African facility outside the ETHernitymining environment. Calculations based on current values provided by our SA mining partner - 8100$ cost for the 10GPU rig - daily return +-28$ - monthly 840$ - monthly expense 130$  Result 710$ net profits and break even point at 11.5 months. ( Difficulty increase not taken into account)     Following box shows the same 10GPU mining rig running at our facility within the ETHernitymining environment -8100$ cost for the rig -30% extra capacity (when ICO entirely soldout) -Monthly cost decreases to 100$ per rig for large scale mining. -Daily return 28$- Monthly 840$  Result - You start with a 130% capacity. - Even with 20% reinvestment you earn about 8% more first month. - Break even point decreases with 2 months. - Returns increase 2-3% monthly. - Your mining capacity increases with 2-3.5% on a monthly basis.    Some nice statistics. - Break even point 2 months earlier ( market value increase not taken into account) - Your REAL token value increases together with the increase of mining hardware. - After 24 months you will have received an estimated return of 23.050$- mining capacity increased to almost 200%. So a 8100$ rig turned almost into 2 rigs. Tokens will have a value of approx 16.000$. So in 24 months your investment value increased with approximatelly 500%.  *This calculations is based that you have an amount of tokens that cover the expense of a complete 10GPU mining rig.  ETHERNITYMINING BOUNTY AND REFERRAL PROGRAM  Bounty program  2% of the total ETM token supply is reserved for our bounty program. Our bounty program will be announced in the bounty section within next 24 hours. Bounty thread ==>here   Referral program  We will run a referral program for our token sale. Running a bounty program can be active but there is nothing as powerful as a referral system to spread the word and go viral.  We will use a 4 level deep uni level referral system. This means you can have as many referrals in each level.    This is a perfect way to earn some extra tokens on top of your purchased balance or a perfect way for people that aren't financially capable to join the token sale to earn some tokens and benefit from our mining service.  EARLY BIRD ADVANTAGE!!!!  Of course early contributors will be able to take advantage the most. At this moment we are finishing our automated platform to run the public pre sale and the main token sale. Our Early bird sale will run before this platform goes live.

We deliver a solution for all those cloud mining projects.  Firstly our attorney files every contributor in a legal document that you own a particular share of the mining hardware. And every contributor receives a copy. Secondly you don't close a mining contract with us. The hardware is automatically linked to the tokens. So you can quit whenever you want. If you sell your tokens you give up your rights as owner and right to receive weekly returns. Thirdly as soon as our mining facility is fully operational there will be a platform where contributors can follow the mining in real time.  Compared to a cloud mining service we will be fully transparent, contributors not tied to an unprofitable contract, and all returns will be managed and processed by our smart contract which every contributor can verify. We are absolutely no shady, scammy or ponzi cloudmining service.  You don't have to put money in a payment platform. Its simple, you buy tokens and you own a particular part of the hardware which will be filed in a legal document and delivered to you. Beside that we don't charge any fee like cloud mining does. We offer a service and as reward we keep a percentage of the tokens which will generate returns for us. We only act as organizer of the bulk purchase and deployment of the facilities.   According to the mining facilities and resources.  Our first location is already locked. Our first facility will be in South Africa and will be provide with on grid power which contains 91% electricity generated with wind turbines and solar power plant. This will be our core facility and from there on we build out our new facilities.  We are negotiating with several possible partners in Europe, US and Asia for our next facilities. Depending on the most profitable location it is not yet determined if it will be a hydro, solar or wind turbine plant. We have several options open and we are prospecting with our local engineers which on will be the most profitable.  But we are already set to fully deploy our facility in SA.   So you don't like cloud mining services, neither do i. And ETHernitymining can't be compared with any cloud mining services.  Summary: -Not tied to a contract. You can buy or sell your tokens whenever you want which means you can buy and sell mining hardware at any time. -transparency. Legalized docs by our attorney + visits to our facility possible at any time + platform to follow our mining in real time + verifiable in the smart contract. -No service fees that decrease your returns. -No unprofitable cloud mining contract. By our bonus rigs on purchase + 20% reinvestment we can manage to stay profitable for a way longer period. By the reinvestment we can let our mining capacity grow with 2-4% monthly without fresh funds need to be added. -earnings distributed by our smart contract directly in the token holder his personal wallet. Fully verifiable. So no need to signup on a platform, no worries to get hacked or scammed, don't have to wait till you reached your minimum withdraw limit.   And you are fully covered. All purchases are legalized by an attorney and filed. In legal documents will be stated that ETHernitymining only has a certain percentage of the tokens and hardware.  We will also have a smart contract available for possible disputes. If you hold tokens you will be able to receive a request an official document which contains how much you own of the hardware according to the amount of tokens you hold.   So i don't think this project can be compared with cloud mining in any way",False

Owning your token is just like you're in the trading business only. No contracts. Okay, I agree that's different from cloud mining. But maybe I'll just wait for you to deploy your first facility in SA. And let's see how things go from there. Good luck!",False

Based on the recent boom from past 1-2 years cryptocurrency has increased in mining industries. Power used for crypto mining is greater than the usage of electricity that can be used all over the world in a year. As long as the value of crypto currencies increases there will be an increase in electricity consumption. Miners will earn more in $ value and will spend more on electricity costs.  Based on the place where you are located you need to create an account and need to check how much you are going to charge per KwH for the supply of the electricity. Power is charged based on the power used by you and it is one of the huge elements that will confirm your profits.  Green energy is increased by a strong solar PV market, in 2016 they recorded and the net power carries with a capacity that is of two-thirds which are recoverable and almost 165 gigawatts (GW) collects through online. Solar Pv sets a record in a year, China and other countries around the world show the high development in the Solar Pv market which leads in reducing the cost and gives policy support for the customers. When it comes to last year, solar Pv grew by 50% and it reaches over 74 GW so, here China decided to expand the solar Pv. Solar Pv is entering into the new era and for the rest of the five years, solar Pv figures that it is one of the largest annual capacity that is available to increase the renewable. International Energy Agency (IEA) analysis finds out that the renewable growth of the solar Pv will be boosted by another 30% and total it leads to 1,150 GW by the end of 2022 which lead by China. When it comes to Solar Pv and wind capacity China reaches the total power capacity than Japan. China alone takes the responsibility for over 40% capacity growth for the global renewable energy. By 2022, China expected to reach the target of solar Pv is to beat the wind target in 2019.",False
