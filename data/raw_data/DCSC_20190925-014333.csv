SOLUTION    The DACSEE platform returns the power and control back to the people and utilises the newest trends  and technology in the decentralisation and cryptocurrency spheres to create a self-regulating and self-expanding ridesharing network that requires no central authority and therefore no middlemen fees. This peer-topeer system brings the sharing economy back into the ride-hailing economy and empowers the individuals to create their own incomes unencumbered, in a multitude of ways, while expanding naturally and virally into markets that have thus far been inaccessible to centrally-run ride-hailing services.
