SHORT SUMMARY:  WHITELIST FOR PRESALE - HERE  PRESALE DATE: 22 June 2018 Crowd SALE DATE: 5 September 2018 Current status: Private sale Min. Investment (until Crowdsale): 5 ETH SOFT CAP: $3,000,000 HARD CAP: $15,000,000 Total tokens minted: 300,000,000 Price per token on CS: $0,10   ---------   WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER  |TEAM | TELEGRAM | BOUNTY | INSTAGRAM | FACEBOOK | REDDIT | TWITTER | MEDIUM| APPLY FOR WHITELIST    WHY THE FASHION INDUSTRY? ---------  Projectdresscode connects two industries, fashion and blockchain technology, and will achieve its set goals through platform development. The technology will set trends for the fashion industry, decentralise its core businesses and create and maintain a community regulated ecosystem. The dresscode protocol supports both the originality of items on the one hand, and businesses and community on the other, all interwoven with simplicity, automation and a decentralised influence on the fashion community.      4 CURRENT INDUSTRY PROBLEMS WE ARE SOLVING ---------   1. Fashion item counterfeits → authentication of luxury fashion items 2. Simple way to sell/buy authenticated luxury fashion products 3. With fashion market becoming more and more interspersed throughout the new digital technologies, our goal is to provide an up to date, exciting and eclectic new  conglomerate of services that will satisfy the needs of an ever growing pool of blockchain and fashion enthusiasts, high net worth investors, mass market investors, established as well as up-and-coming professionals... from all over the world 4. Lack of a community that will be able to connect Sales professionals in the fashion industry, limited edition fashion consumers and multibrand stores and help them prosper in their individual respected fields   SOLUTION - PROJECT DRESSCODE ---------     We are creating a platform that builds on the reality of a limited edition fashion frenzy and translates it onto the blockchain. With a help of the latest technology our platform engine authenticates, certifies and traces; and in so doing enables the community to buy/sell, bid/ask for the most sought after objects of desire.    PRODUCT - DRESSCODE PLATFORM - Coming Soon ---------      The platform will be a conglomerate of limited edition and pre-owned fashion marketplace. There will be three sources from which limited and pre-owned fashion items will be supplied to the projectdresscode platform:  1. B2B brand collaborations with limited edition items 2. individual sellers of pre-owned items will publish items they want to sell; 3. multibrand sellers (stores) can sell their items through the platform (B2B);  In order to buy/sell items on the projectdresscode platform each user has to register. Two levels of individual users of the platform are planned, as listed below.  LEVEL 1 USER characteristics:  1. free subscription; 2. t the seller level: freeupload of the items to the platform without certification of the items; 3. at the buyer level: access to all the published items, except for the limited and exclusive edition ones (limited edition items to be released also for the level 1 users if they were not sold at the pre-sale period).   LEVEL 2 USER’s characteristics:  1. monthly payable subscription, with subscription packages based on the number of items put on the platform; verification and certification of the items included; 2. benefits at the buyer level: pre-sale access to the limited and exclusive edition items, access to special events, invitations, etc.  Based on the above two types of pre-owned fashion goods can be found on the platform: pre-owned certified items and pre-owned non-certificated items. In order to distinguish between them and showing the added value of the certification the former will be more prominently placed on the webpage than the latter.  Collaborations with multi-brand stores will proceed the same way, just on a larger scale and under different conditions. From the buyer’s perspective, there will be no direct distinction made between items coming from individual sellers and those from partner (multi-brand) stores.  A mobile version of the platform will be available from December 2018 on, and the desktop version will be live from March 2019.    HOW DO WE UTILIZE BLOCKCHAIN? ---------  One of the primary goals of the token involves traceability of products. It will be resolved  with a Dapp solution in connection with DRESS token. The creation of the projectdresscode certificate will transform one DRESS token to certificate smart contract, that will enable users to follow, transfer and destroy the authentic certificate.  Furthermore the Dapp solution will allow us to create internal tracking and connection to off-chain data where each holder/user can verify the content of the smart contract.  This solution will enable us to create verification certificates distributed directly at the manufacturers facility for their products. With such shortened chain of verification route, we quicken and disable doubt in the authenticity of the product.  We understand that a lot of owners who own exclusive products don't want to be identified. The solution with blockchain is perfect for that matter,  because transaction cannot be linked to a specific person. Users can also use the platform, which with the escrow procedure, enables us to avoid any link or data exchange between seller and buyer.   TOKEN GENERATION - CROWDSALE: 5 September 2018 ---------      INTRODUCING THE DRESS  TOKEN ---------  The Dress token itself will offer a variety of use cases besides its core purpose of certificating and tracking items.  1. Buy, Sell and Bid - The platform users will be able to buy exclusive items offered by various brand with Dress tokens on the DressCode platform. There will be also option to buy and sell pre-owned exclusive items with unique bidding system integrated into the DressCode platform. 2. Reservations - Reservation or pre-emption of tickets for events or items will be possible exclusively with Dress tokens. The reservations will be in correlation with coin age and token amount. 3. Vesting tokens - Vesting tokens to gain various benefits such as reservation of items, which are later paid in FIAT currency. The tokens will be vested for certain amount of time and later returned to owner without loss of tokens. 4. Social marketing - Platform user can acquire Dress tokens by marketing on Instagram and other social networks. This is financed with a part of the tokens, which companies earn by selling their items on DressCode platform. 5. In store purchase - Possibility of using Dress tokens to buy items at actual stores of certain brands and their online shops simply by a DressCode mobile app to make user experience as smooth as it can be.
