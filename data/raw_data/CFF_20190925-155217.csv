The only known decentralized consensus algorithm that is proven can satisfy the requirements to the productivity of applications on blockchain (speed, scalability, etc.) is the algorithm of delegated proof-of-stake (DPOS)2.  According to this algorithm, blockchain token holders trust to the block producers (“Block-Producers”, “delegated trust nodes”) to confirm the transaction exactly the same as the Bitcoin holders trust to confirm transactions to the miners. Producers are selected through a system of continuous random distribution. Any producer in the system can get the right to create the blocks, and after the creation of a block, he again gets in the queue among the other producers.  The right to confirm has all producers of network (Block-Producers), whose are the owners of large packages of COFFE tokens (including the projects realized on the COFFE ICO Standard platform), but not miners. This means the absence of competition for the highest commission to confirm. It means a constant price of commission (if it is provided), as well as the possibility of deployment in the COFFE blockchain the decentralized applications working without commissions at all.

For the illusory “increase of the value of records in the distributed register” the users of blockchain pay the commissions to a huge number of fans of simple solutions (mining farms), spending the computing power and energy on the tasks that can be successfully solved without them, using much less resources. The proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm is, in my opinion, a much more advanced technology, but it also has the weakness to impose the payments for the blockchain on ordinary users in the form of network fees.  We expect the blockchain to be more simple and practical. In our coordinate system, the main place is given not to the miner / producer / validator and his desires, but to an ordinary user of the blockchain — an investor, a programmer, an ideologist, an expert and a beginner — from any sphere of activity. We don’t think outside of crypto sphere, but we think the “crypto sphere”. Crypto sphere must be convenient and useful to the common man.  We have identified the project EOSIO based on the DPoS algorithm for many reasons (this is a separate big question and we do not speak about it now). The free license and open source gave us the opportunity to make a legal fork of the EOS blockchain and start the practical implementation of our idea. We began a painstaking and very time-consuming process. But we had the main thing — a team of like-minded professionals: the ideologists, programmers, designers and marketers. And although there were no professionals among us in the field of “presentation”/ ”sale” of blockchain projects, we did not need them at that time. We decided: first the product, and everything else will be later.  You can get more information at the site https://coffe.io/",False

But why would an Expert share his or her knowledge or experience with the non-professional participants? And how to ensure the trust of non-professional participants in the selection of an expert?  The answer to the first question is simple — “the benefit”, and not only financial. First, the PACK gives the opportunity to sell the expert’s competence to a wide range of unlimited players. In fact, through the PACK, the Expert provides the non-professional investors with a professional asset management service (most of the investors have such assets and they “do not work”) and gets payment for his work. At the same time, the Expert, attracting the funds to the management, receives a greater resource and the possibility of greater gross earnings. Second, the best results are demonstrated by the Expert, the higher is his verified status in the cryptosphere.  The trust is built on two things: an objective transparent evaluation of the Expert’s competencies as a manager and the Expert’s personal motivation to manage effectively. An objective public evaluation of an expert is his / her rating in the management system. A rating is an independent integrated evaluation. It is automatically calculated from the rates of return of portfolios (PACK) under the control of an Expert for a certain period. It depends from the ratio of successful deals to unsuccessful (adjusted for market state in general), etc. This rating is the basis for guide for non-professional participants and investors in the choice of the Expert.  Personal motivation for the effective management of the Expert arises only if the Expert risks by his own capital. Expert is the architect of PACK, participating in his own tool. The Expert is the same investor of the PACK created by him, together with the other participants, whose funds he additionally attracts under his management. He studies the market, clearly distinguishes the horizons of events, sees the dynamics of projects, clearly represents the immediate prospects, because he is a professional.

All investments are made only on terms of investment.  Each expert managing the iPack invests in it at least 30% of his own funds. It increases his responsibility and reduces the risks.

He can do it only by selling the assets and distributing them among the depositors, in the proportion to their investments. There are still many risks associated with the dishonesty of the expert. The system monitors his actions in the real time and analyzes the possible options for fraudulent actions. In case of emergency (the deals of expert coincide with one of the template of fraudulent actions), the system will block the transaction immediately.

The expert does not just gain control over your funds, to some extent he does not participate in this, but if this happens - he in some way contributes a percentage of the portfolio to insure in this way. This is not like the usual trust management. This is actually very different.  Quote from: Milamol on October 15, 2018, 01:15:42 PM Well, you fantasize!  In the crypto exchanges, you can act anonymously and withdraw amounts on a day not exceeding the specified amount. For example, in Binance, without verification, you can withdraw any cryptocurrency the day before the 2 BTC or equivalent; in Cryptopia, to 5K NZD.  I think that the sum of the output in 2 Bitcoin - this does not confirm the reliability. Of course, we can set 10 bitcoins for output without confirmation. And it does not confirm our seriousness. Then you can do this - make a conclusion of 100 bitcoins per day, and by this we will be more serious than Binans? or Cryptopies?",False

The COFFE Protocol provides the market with the indicators on the basis of which the traders choose an asset. The COFFE Protocol is a complex work on processing a huge amount of data related to crypto assets. It is a huge responsibility, since the financial result of all participants of the system depends on the decisions made by the intelligence of the Protocol. The Protocol is a living mechanism, constantly developing and growing with the system.  We cannot guarantee the infallibility of its work, but we can guarantee that the Protocol will be constantly developing and improving. Thanks to the Protocol, each crypto asset, including the derivatives, receives its own reliability indicator, each trader receives its own rating based on both his activity and the results of his work. The COFFE Protocol does not know how to predict the future. It simply provides the traders and crypto-investors with the objective data that allows them to make decisions. For today the degree of readiness of the Protocol is about 30%. It requires the large amounts of statistical data not only about crypto assets, but also about the work of traders in the COFFE system.

In short, the Pack is a set of crypto assets, which together create a more stable and profitable asset, reduce the risks, since the fall of one asset is compensated by the growth of others. Pack is not an index, each Pack is unique because it contains an arbitrary number of arbitrary assets.  Using the Pack you can pay for a product or service, or send a Pack to any user of the COFFE network with an unlimited number of different cryptocurrencies by one click.  In order to choose the assets to form the Pack, it is necessary to correctly evaluate each asset on the market separately. For this purpose, an Intelligent COFFE Protocol is created.

All parts of the system are being designed and developed with the aim of improving the work of each member of the community from private investor to the professional trader, by reducing the costs of startups and existing established business-projects wishing to receive funding according to the principles of the ICO/ITO.  Elements of the system are a protective mechanism for investors from unfair projects. Fraudulent (scam) projects remain outside of the open window of opportunities, which includes only the best, most interesting and economically reasonable ideas. Ideas that pass through the check of the community and get the approval of the majority without the intervention of mechanisms of promotion and pressure, only on the basis of objective data.

Early investors will have the opportunity to introduce their ideas,  to improve,  to modernize, probably, to add their functional capabilities already at the start of the platform.  Probably this will look like one of the directions for attracting business / participants / ideas that is interesting to the first investors.  We do not say that we will be only a platform of COFFE, direct and unchanged.  We understand that business is a movement, it is variability under the current situation.",False

That is why the tokens are speculation becouse they do not have any more use.  I understand what you are talking about. You mean that - the token, most often, or always, is used only to raise funds. And it exists separately from the idea, setting a goal only to make a profit by speculating on a project token in the market. We plan to use the token as a basis. All that will happen on the platform happens only bypassing the token.  But this is only a small part, and not the main point. Of course, the basis is the use of the token as the energy of the system, but this is only the tip of the iceberg.  I think it is impossible to explain .... It is so difficult ... You need to read WhitePaper a little later also.  Quote from: Milamol on October 09, 2018, 05:53:01 PM I do not understand why games in the market are harmful to the project?

One expert says that Bitcoin will never become an universal meaning of payment becouse the blockchain of Bitcoin is so slow that you never buy a cup of coffee in cafe by Bitcoin.

If you have already created own blockchain, why are you selling tokens? Why don't you use your coin in your blockchain?  Selling tokens, we thus attract funds to stabilize the token on the exchange.

All unsold tokens will not be burned, all calculations of economic value indicate some lack of tokens in the system, but in order to raise the value of the token, we decided to stop at this amount. Unused tokens will be frozen. The defrosting will be carried out by voting of the block-producers. All this and much more will be reflected in the Constitution of the system. It will be discussed and put to a vote, which we will hold among the block producers. In addition, tokens will be used to conduct ICO on the COFFE platform.
