We have to inform You that Hard Cap was not raised during the ICO.  We‚Äôve analyzed and revealed some shortcomings in our work on the ICO project. The major flow of money was in fiat from large investors, this is because our advertising company was not massive enough and aimed on communications with major investors, presentations and road shows, and also because of not correctly chosen strategy on the functions and economy of the token, which was not clear and attractive for private investors. We decided to fix all the shortcomings. On March, 1 we are going to present an updated roadmap where you will see short-term scheme of token use.  Till that time we‚Äôll continue to work under the previous roadmap: - complete the design documentation of the plant; - purchase, place and after a few months, without waiting for the plant construction, start mining power and realising of contract for hashrate sale and rent on attractive terms for which you can pay ZET with discount; - get credit funds of customary investors in the Project.  We plan the output of the Project on the second round of ICO with a work product (hashrate sell and rent of mining facilities) and a clear position as for the token use and its benefits. It will be more transparent for the investor and give more confidence when buying the token. Also the roadmap will contain plan and time of the token release on cryptocurrency exchanges.  Release roadmap scheduled on March 1, 2018, you‚Äôll be informed by e-mail and in social networks.",False

PROBLEM  Every person living on the planet ""produces"" about 300 kg or 1.5 m3 of waste per year. In the EU countries, about 2 billion tons of garbage per year are formed, of which about 200 million tons are household waste. Lands under dumps remain toxic for 50-100 years. In recent decades humanity has realized - either humankind wins out garbage, or garbage destroys humanity.  SOLUTION  ZEUS ‚Äì the first company that offers an innovative approachin the field of garbage waste recycling.  The most effective way to reduce the amount of garbage is to recycle it at waste processing factories. The effect of the activity of such factories is undeniable - 70-80% of the waste received by the factory receives a second life, and when burning garbage, electricity is produced, which will always be in demand in the modern world.  The main difference of the company is the recycling of garbage into electricity, which is used for mining cryptocurrencies, thus contributing to the development of world‚Äôs crypto economy and decentralized systems. Thermal energy produced by mining and processing, as well as other by-products of the recycling are used by the Government to serve the needs of the population.    The mission of our project ‚Äì by cleansing the planet from garbage, develop the crypto economy.
