Blocnation will be the worlds first Decentralized ICO  What is Blocnation?  Blocnation‚Äôs BNTN Token will be used to unlock crypto-payment capabilities for PouchNATION, Southeast Asia‚Äôs leading cashless payment community of events and venues.  The Blocnation app will function as a hub for the token economy at PouchNATION events and venues. The app will enable users to hold altcoins, acquire event tickets, book stay at venues, top-up online, and get cash-back.   What is PouchNATION?  PouchNATION, established in 2012, gives people access to wristbands that allow cashless payments at events, festivals, and venues across borders.  They offer event organizers, brands, and hostels an end-to-end guest management platform for audiences ranging in size from 3,000-150,000 people. PouchNATION helps their clients manage the guest experience from ticketing, registration, cashless payments, and access control to social media engagement, brand activations, data and merchant management.  PouchNATION is currently serving Southeast Asia, and this Blocnation update is accelerating partnership opportunities in the United States, Europe, and everywhere else in the world.  What problem does BNTN Solve?  Blocnation‚Äôs BNTN Token will act as the universal currency of PouchNATION and remove many pain points that are common for event-goers and tourists. These problems arise due to varying fiat currencies that force people to exchange and perform extra steps when planning to attend festivals, conferences, concerts, etc.  How is BNTN using blockchain technology?  Blocnation operates on its own decentralized blockchain built with Komodo Platform, which will also be integrated into Komodo‚Äôs atomic swap-powered decentralized exchange BarterDEX.  When will Blocnation‚Äôs dICO take place?  Blocnation's dICO will begin CET +7 on April 17, 2018, and the BNTN Token will be available for purchase via the blocnation.io website.
