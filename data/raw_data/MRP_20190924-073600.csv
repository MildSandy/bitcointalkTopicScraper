The existing database will be further enriched by other data collected through various services (one of which being the Event Registry). All this is basis for choosing a way to improve the arbitrage algorithm. The role of the Jožef Stefan Institute in the development of artificial intelligence is the complete automation of the implementation of crypto arbitrage, which is currently in a semi-automated phase. That means that today, it still requires a human factor in order to set certain parameters depending on developments in the market, while in the future this will no longer be necessary.

We have already received enough contributions in the PREICO phase to start building the Money Rebel Platform right away. We are also working on extending our team!  When does the ICO (initial coin offering) start? Is that still 8th November 2017, as planned? The Team decided to postpone the ICO phase to when the beta version of the Money Rebel Platform is available. That is foreseen to happen in Q1 2018.  How does postponing the ICO influence the project timeline and the milestones foreseen? The project milestones and development timeline has not been changed. This means the Money Rebel Platform will be delivered in Q2 2018, and other milestones as planned and according to the results of the ICO. Unchanged roadmap is available at www.moneyrebel.io.  How many supporters took part in the PREICO and how much did they contribute? Until now 847 supporters contributed 2.127.418,36 EUR (cumulative, in BTC, ETH and EUR).

We did think about all the aspects of our strategy adaptation, and we stand behind it 100%. Now, for the answers.   Couple of comments: Well, all nice and dandy but I can't lose the feeling we've all funded an APP instead of ICO. Since you already developed MojBudged, Money Rebel seems to be an upgrade of that and nothing more.  Money Rebel ICO is not cancelled, we have just rescheduled it. The ICO market is changing rapidly, also there is the Segwit2x hard fork coming, so we are confident that we made the right choice.  We are working hard to get all the milestones funded, if possible, through the ICO - what we clearly stated in the message is that for now we have already secured funds for the Milestone 1.  Milestone 1 is not ""an app"", it is a Platform, as outlined in our Whitepapers. Existing apps, modules, whatever you call them, will be reworked, some parts reused, some not. Our partner in this project has 100+ developers on hand, with extensive experience in developing software for the banking sector.  Also, do not forget, that ICO is not a securities issuing operation, but it is an operation of issuing a token - the MRP tokens will be used for payment of services on the MR Platform and MR Bank (if that gets funded in the ICO).  The MR Platform itself will be multi-functional, and it will enable users to: - have complete overview of their finances (also accounts open with other banks and financial institutions will be included) - access top expert financial advisers for personalized advice - see trends and follow news - allow advisers to offer and conduct advising services to the users of the MR Platform - etc.    As one of the previous users stated: cant wait to see a 2mio app.  Sorry to let you know that the budget for the app itself will be much less. We would love to have 2 million just for the app itself. Just for iOS. And another 2 mil for the Android app.    You know, there are specific platforms for sourcefunding, KickStarter to name one. Yes. But they do not enable tokenization, and they do not make it possible for contributors to sell tokens for what they are worth in the future.    Now, seriously, how do you plan to get banking licence in order to deliver this merge of Fiat/Crypto services and rest of classical banking services? You are not a bank, your company is registered as a programing company. This is quite a leap don't you think? Will you establish a new company? Whats the deal here?  The MR Bank is Milestone 3 - when 8 million EUR or more are contributed. We hope to receive that support in the ICO, which will happen Q2 2018. So, for now, we do not need to be registered as a bank - when the MR Platform itself is launched, it will be a Platform that enables users to access their banking accounts at other banks), etc. When we receive enough support, or we grow the money ourselves, we will do everything necessary to receive the banking licence and register as such.    All of this reminds of soooo many ""success"" stories from Slovenia that my gut feeling might not be wrong afterall. Gut feeling - everybody has his own. As a PR professional you know what all someone has to go through sometimes when delivering news that is not exactly what people expect. As a PR professional you also might know that sometimes not going with the flow and rescheduling something important may make such a great difference in the long run.   Now, being an advertising professional with 20+ years of experience, please, no PR, straight facts. Thank you.  Thank you for coming out with your thoughts - someone had to address these questions. We will be glad to be of any further assistance. Humbly, we also hope to gain your trust in the end. You might as well wait it out and see the end product's deploy in 2018/2019.",False

""Now, being an advertising professional with 20+ years of experience"" - that makes you credible, for not understanding ICO's, or what did you want to say here?  It seems you like talking about credibility, so let`s look at some real facts, regarding Moneyrebel: - company established on 27th of June 2017, with  share capital of 17.500 EUR from 6 investors (BTW, mr. Urban, who is very loud here, invested 1.625,75 EUR and ABC accelerator invested 700 EUR). Just imagine, you invest 17.500 EUR, and get 2 mio... - no employees - no office, it is registerd on adress of co-founders - founders don`t want to invest their own money (accept already metioned share capital) - remeber: condition for even starting work was to reach first milestone. They actulay want to open bank, not to invest anything in it. - no working app or anything else - MR is at the moment only idea on paper. BTW, Moj Budget is/was totaly unusable app... - crypto arbitrage Kriptel or whatever is this thing called - why the f....can I not invest directly in it? Does it even exist? Well, we have to belive to founders of MR that it exists and not only that - it makes 16% yearly return. Again - why can I then not invest in it? Why do they even want to collect funds through ICO, if they have such great product. Why don`t they just put it on the market...? And at the end - crypto arbitrage is nothing new, new is here only that MR founders are claiming, that there are no risks in investing in it. - founders of this idea are, let`s say in some way experts in the field of financial consulting for retail clients (although this is also discutable), but with absolutely no experience in developing banking services, not to talk about actualy establishing a bank... - PSD2 directive, which is one of the main conditions for MR idea to work,  is about to be implemented, they say, but I can tell you from my professionel experience, that banks are not even close to it, if ever.  And on the top of it, as soon as they reached 2 mio, they wrote nice PR for making even nicer excuse, why puting everything on hold.  Should I continue...?  Do I think MR is scam? No I don`t think so, however it would be nice to see how much of collected funds will end on accounts of founders. What I actually think, is that: A: founders have already reached their goal and got funds for investing in this crypto arbitrage, since all in all this is the main idea of MR B: Are actualy not aware, what are they promissing and will sooner or later found out, that they will not be able to deliver their promisses. It would be not for the firts time in this start up ICO scene.  Do you still think, this is good investment...? Good luck with that...",False

The most frequent answer we hear is — fast earnings! Human greed really knows no borders, but on the other hand — by supporting a real project you really get more than the opportunity to earn fast: a lot more! I dare to say that supporters will benefit the most from our project, the Money Rebel ICO. No other project offers so many benefitting features. Other projects will offer benefits to founders and advisors, yes. But not to supporters who contribute their own money!  I know this is a BOLD statement, and it needs to be supported by firm arguments. Bear with me, I will provide them in a minute. But before I do, I need to come clear about one thing — Money Rebel is not the most hyped ICO, not at all. It is true that we did not work on the FOMO effect, which might not be the smartest thing, but it surely is the fairest! There are too many great marketing projects surrounding us, too many promises, if not scams, which create unreal expectation about fast and easy profits. About securing 10x the contribution in a month, as we can read many times … No, that is not us, that is not Money Rebel! We have worked too hard to gain the trust of more than 23,000 individuals in Slovenia, and we will not throw away our principles! Integrity, independence and putting our client’s interests before ours are most important to us. We will not throw all that away just to collect millions and then let’s see what happens … if it happens … No, we would rather not succeed than succeed in this way! Now let’s look at the arguments.  Why is Money Rebel the best ICO for the supporters?!  Of course, everybody, who supports our project, will receive our MRP Tokens. But there is a lot more besides tokens, since every supporter will receive:  1) Free banking account, forever! Can you imagine a modern mobile bank which does not charge you for account management, money transfers, ATM withdrawals and Mastercard payments? But it does offer a 10x interest rate for your saving account, as compared to the next best bank’s offer, a connection between the fiat and crypto money world, a selection of real licensed advisers and robo advisers, etc? No? Meet Money Rebel at bank.moneyrebel.io.  2) Exclusive access to the MR Kriptel.de PRO MR Kriptel.de is an investment product, which is currently only available to a selected group of our clients, but will be accessible to all the Money Rebel Platform supporters. It is based on the fully operational automatic trading platform Krip.to. It uses a unique trading strategy, which enables it to conduct arbitrage between crypto pairs (for example BTC/ETH) and crypto/fiat pairs (BTC/EUR). By using this strategy, MR Kriptel.de has managed to gain a net monthly profit of 1%-1.5%, which is 16% annually. By collaborating with the Jozef Stefan Institute we will upgrade the investment product into the MR Kriptel.de PRO. This is how we will improve the trading strategy by using artificial intelligence. We will enable many more investors to gain access to this investment strategy. Only those who support the development of the platform by purchasing the MRP tokens, will be enabled to invest directly in MR Kriptel.de PRO — the 2x sum of their investment in Money Rebel.  3) Guarantee this is not a scam! Yes, unfortunately every good idea unleashes bad ideas as well. Scams have become part of cryptocurrency world. There are many, and there will be more — money does make some people crazy. That is why we cannot stress enough that this is a real project which solves real problems for people, and it is managed by real people. People with references, proven performance, and foremost people who will not go crazy because of a heap of money. Just check out our team references and our customer testimonials. For start you can find out more about me and my work at www.vezovisek.si/mitja (in Slovene, use translate).  4) Total transparency. What is the company issuing the tokens, where is it registered? There is no dilemma with Money Rebel — we are registered in Slovenia, which is a EU member state. We are not registered in some third country. Slovenia, being among the top of the countries supporting crypto-economy, and with aspirations to become the leading state regarding the blockchain technology and start ups. The well-known crypto media Cointelegraph published an article on that, you can find it HERE!  5) The most for your money! The price of Bitcoin is at its historical high. This means that right now you get the most MRP Tokens for every bitcoin transferred into the Money Rebel ICO wallet. Every bitcoin or ether we get is first calculated into Euro (Bitstamp exchange rate is used), then the number of euros is multiplied by 20 to calculate the number of MRP Tokens. We will add the PREICO 15% bonus you can receive, after registering at presale.moneyrebel.io.  For those who do not yet operate with cryptocurrency we have partnered with BitIns and completely streamlined and lowered the price of participation — funds can be transferred directly from your bank account, and you do not even need a crypto wallet. And, yes, we did manage to lower the price of money exchange service, provided by BitIns, for more than 50%!  Besides all this, maybe the most important thing is, that this project is connecting the two worlds. The new (crypto) and traditional money (fiat) world. Because most of the current supporters came from the fiat world this means that we bring new, fiat customers, into the crypto world. This is how we are opening the market, raising awareness, educate, and, most important of all — we are raising the value of crypto currencies and tokens, as we are injecting new money into the crypto economy.",False

Obviously arbitrage profits depend on market conditions and strategy you're using - but feel free to check some arbitrage data here http://data.bitcoinity.org/markets/arbitrage/EUR.

ICO whitepapers never have detailed business plans professional and experienced VC investors are used to see. I think the reason is because ICO's are open and meant for everybody not just professional investors like you seem to be. And the truth is if they were written in a way you'd expect them to be 99% potential investors wouldn't understand them and ICO's would have hard time collecting money. And Money Rebel explains their idea very well to an average Joe, but their idea is still explained very much in detail. Maybe you shoud have opened some random ICO whitepapers to compare them.  And I wouldn't say investing in ICO's is same as donating. It's very risky that's true, but that's true for any new business no matter the way it is funded. To be honest even more than 90% of VC capital funded businesses fail within first few years of operation so it seems having professional documentation and being supported by professional investors doesn't give them much more chance of success.  And most projects in crypto market are trading at higher than their ICO price. Many of them made much more profit in some months time than I doubt any of businesses with detailed plans you've invested in have.

Actually arbitrage is not about growth of the currency - but price difference in various exchanges (here explainer in Slovenian https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Psj2FOilXo). So what we actually do is, we always keep ratio fiat:crypto fixed, so if crypto is rising, we do not use this as profit but we sell crypto to preserver this ratio. Arbitrage is not risk strategy.  And this answers this observation ""What I also do not like, is that investment in crypto currencies is promoted as financial product which is appropriate for everybody."". So yes, it actually is. Crypto in this mean is only mean of doing profits and do not relies in growth of cryptocurrencies.  ""Maybe once in testing period"" actually this are live results, not in testing. http://kriptelde.moneyrebel.io/en  ""Investment in crypto is very risky."" - yes, but not with arbitrage (ok - if they steal funds from wallet, or exchange is being hacked/closed).",False

Money Rebel is not worse in that matter. I think their team seems legit and does have some experience. Will it be enough? Who knows, but that's the risk you have to take with every ICO you invest in. Their project isn't dealing just with cryptocurrency investments but is connecting any kind of investments in a single place. I think I would use their services because it would be very convenient to manage all my investments and my bank accounts from one place. Arbitrage is trading taking advantage of different prices of same asset on different exchanges. Why do you think that has anything to do with bubble? Even if bubble pops there will still be differences in price accross different exchanges. Arbitrage can make same profit in updtrending and downtrending markets. I would be more worried in years to come when crypto space gets more regulated and volatility goes down. Lower volatility will probably mean lower price differences between exchanges and less opportunity for arbitrage. But on the other hand their current arbitrage bot can only trade BTC pairs. BTC transactions are expensive and slow. When they add faster and cheaper cryptocurrencies I guess the arbitrage bot could take even more advantage of those.  I find your opinion of their whitepaper very surprising. Because I think it's one of the best I've read. If you think their whitepaper sucks, could you point me to a project who's whitepaper doesn't suck? I'm really interested in what other people look at when they're assessing whitepapers.",False

I do not doubt that your intentions are not honest, but I think you are not realistic.  What I wanted to say is, that you are to optimistic in your promises. Your whole idea relys on some PSD2 european directive, which probably will never be fully implemeted. You have to know one thing is theory which is written from EU birocrats, and other thing is reality. PSD2 directive was published already in 2015 - and we are about to enter 2018 - what has changed in this time regarding PSD2 directive?  And already in theory -  without full implementation of PSD2 will your platform be just another application without real advantages for client. But nevertheless - do you actually know, how many regulations you would need to fullfil in order to be able to deliver all these services? I think not.  Regarding your experience - how many credit cards did you develop, how many online banking sistems did you develop?

I am talking about technical issues, not about delivering ""financial advice"" - because your main exeprerience is in giving financial advices to retail clients, not in development of complex financial products. Do you understand difference?  Regarding whitepaper - if somebody tells me, that this whitepaper is one of the best ever, then I'm really worried about the entire ICO scene. Where is business plan? You are asking me to invest in your idea, so I want to see your business plan. Otherwise you are not asking me for investment, but more for donation.

Idea is worth nothing if it is not implemented in reality. And I can`t imagine, how do you plan to implement this.  Yes, I have experience in investments - I have already supported some projects, but until now not yet through ICO, (and I also do not plan to in near future, since things here are not clear enough and not regulated at all and therefore to risky), always directly and with condition to get share in project and future profits.  I am just follwing, what is happening in this area and since I am from Slovenia too, you got my attention. My oppinion is, that ICO is more appropriate for small investments, few 100 EUR max., more for fun than to expect real results and is more donation than investment, similar as on Kickstarter and similar platforms. And this euphoria in last months is just not normal, people are forgeting on really important things or are totaly uneducated investors and this will not have happy ending for most of them - this is just my oppinion and I do not expect that you will agree with me.  Regarding PSD2 you will see what will happen in future. It would not be for the first time, that some directive would not be localy or even on EU level fully implemented, because practise shows that sometimes full implementation of theory into practise is just not possible. I do not now how can somebody expect that banks will invest in some APIs to enable communication with external providers.

One is automatic - 25% of arbitrage profits go to buyback of tokens. Second one is individual - amount invested in our project x 2 is amount you get direct access to Kriptelde!  So an example of direct access - you invest 5000 eur, you get access to 10000 eur in arbitrage, so you could achieve 1600 eur (16%) yearly profit. Interested?",False

AND why i will invest today in PRE-ICO of Moneyrebel?  Becouse of that facts!  You should too, you will be happy in future    Why is Money Rebel the best ICO for the supporters?!  Of course, everybody, who supports our project, will receive our MRP Tokens. But there is a lot more besides tokens, since every supporter will receive:  1) Free banking account, forever! Can you imagine a modern mobile bank which does not charge you for account management, money transfers, ATM withdrawals and Mastercard payments? But it does offer a 10x interest rate for your saving account, as compared to the next best bank’s offer, a connection between the fiat and crypto money world, a selection of real licensed advisers and robo advisers, etc? No? Meet Money Rebel at www.bank.moneyrebel.io.  2) Exclusive access to the MR Kriptel.de PRO MR Kriptel.de is an investment product, which is currently only available to a selected group of our clients, but will be accessible to all the Money Rebel Platform supporters. It is based on the fully operational automatic trading platform Krip.to. It uses a unique trading strategy, which enables it to conduct arbitrage between crypto pairs (for example BTC/ETH) and crypto/fiat pairs (BTC/EUR). By using this strategy, MR Kriptel.de has managed to gain a net monthly profit of 1%-1.5%, which is 16% annually. By collaborating with the Jozef Stefan Institute we will upgrade the investment product into the MR Kriptel.de PRO. This is how we will improve the trading strategy by using artificial intelligence. We will enable many more investors to gain access to this investment strategy. Only those who support the development of the platform by purchasing the MRP tokens, will be enabled to invest directly in MR Kriptel.de PRO — the 2x sum of their investment in Money Rebel.  3) Guarantee this is not a scam! Yes, unfortunately every good idea unleashes bad ideas as well. Scams have become part of cryptocurrency world. There are many, and there will be more — money does make some people crazy. That is why we cannot stress enough that this is a real project which solves real problems for people, and it is managed by real people. People with references, proven performance, and foremost people who will not go crazy because of a heap of money. Just check out our team references and our customer testimonials. For start you can find out more about me and my work at www.vezovisek.si/mitja (in Slovene, use translate).  4) Total transparency. What is the company issuing the tokens, where is it registered? There is no dilemma with Money Rebel — we are registered in Slovenia, which is a EU member state. We are not registered in some third country. Slovenia, being among the top of the countries supporting crypto-economy, and with aspirations to become the leading state regarding the blockchain technology and start ups. The well-known crypto media Cointelegraph published an article on that, you can find it HERE!  5) The most for your money! The price of Bitcoin is at its historical high. This means that right now you get the most MRP Tokens for every bitcoin transferred into the Money Rebel ICO wallet. Every bitcoin or ether we get is first calculated into Euro (Bitstamp exchange rate is used), then the number of euros is multiplied by 20 to calculate the number of MRP Tokens. We will add the PREICO 15% bonus you can receive, after registering at presale.moneyrebel.io. For those who do not yet operate with cryptocurrency we have partnered with BitIns and completely streamlined and lowered the price of participation — funds can be transferred directly from your bank account, and you do not even need a crypto wallet. And, yes, we did manage to lower the price of money exchange service, provided by BitIns, for more than 50%! Besides all this, maybe the most important thing is, that this project is connecting the two worlds. The new (crypto) and traditional money (fiat) world. Because most of the current supporters came from the fiat world this means that we bring new, fiat customers, into the crypto world. This is how we are opening the market, raising awareness, educate, and, most important of all — we are raising the value of crypto currencies and tokens, as we are injecting new money into the crypto economy.  Why is the MRP Token going to be among the most stable tokens? How will it grow value in the long run? Public initial token offerings are becoming more and more popular. Because the regulation is weak, almost anybody can do it, even if it is about the financial operation of raising capital, sharing value (tokens, in this case), and getting listed on an exchange. This is where the story, often, for most people without financial knowledge, ends, even though it should only just begin. The supporters expect a product, but even more — they expect their investment to grow. And this is where most of the ICOs fail — they run out of knowledge and interest. We, the founders of Money Rebel, are experienced finance and wealth managers, we manage the assets of hundreds of customers, worth together tens of millions of Euros. We have more than 20 years of experience, we know how to trade stocks, forex, invest in traditional and alternative investments. We have survived through numerous ups and downs in the market, therefore we know what influences the price of a financial instrument — as opposed to others, who just let their token flow in the market with limited liquidity. That is why we are planning for a marketing campaign after the ICO, and we have foreseen to spend some of the contributed funds on it.  Besides, we will use our crypto arbitrage platform and our partners Quantum Project (their founder is also the founder of Bitstamp) to provide permanent growth, liquidity and stability of our token. So, now we all know why money Rebel is the best ICO for supporters.  If we think again — for whom are the initial coin offerings intended? For supporters, of course! Because therefore we all gain access to all the interesting early stage projects — that is when the biggest parts of the cake are cut! We want you to have a piece of that cake, enjoy it — but be careful and only support the projects that put your interest in front of their own! Money Rebel for sure is such a project!

Yes there is a world who is not aware of crypto yet, they don't have wallets, exchanges, etc, but they want to go in our project. This is the service for them not for you.  We have bussines in Europe so SEC is not in our concern.  So what does  ""receive, transfer grow and manage your money"" means? - Receive - you will be able to use ore app to receive money (eg sallary) and cryptocurrencies. - Transfer - you will be able to transfer fiat or crypto or combination to another account or for payment purposes. - Grow - you will be able to use ur grow products, like arbitrage to row your funds while having them in account - Manage - one example would be to you could have your portfolio under management expert, or you could manage your income and expenses with budgeting app",False

I must say it's one of best whitpapers I've read. It's very thorough cowering just about anything an investor would like to know, it contains almost everything a whitepaper should but still it's not too long. It's well structured and quite easy to understand text, but still written in enough professional manner reader can't doubt it's a serious project. But as many other posters I also missed the explanation of the actual use of MRP token on the platform.  I'd like to know if MRP token will be used as exclusive mean of payment for using services of your apps, or will payments by other means be possible too?  Otherwise this seems to be a very good project for long term investors. But those looking for quick flip and profit won't be interested in it. Because there's no hype around it. Only 3 pages on this forum. And your website has very low traffic according to statistics from Similarweb. Such great project would deserve much more hype, but it seems not many people have heard of it.",False

We provide fully automated contribution for traditional money clients. You just wire the money and bitins automatically exchanges the funds 50%50 btc and eth and sends it to our wallets - the fee is one of the smallest for such service 3%!  Of course crypto world doesn't have to pay any deposit or exchange fees as you can do direct deposit with  ETH and BTC.  MoneyRebel is about two different worlds coming together with one reason - we want to be the link between traditional financial and the new crypto world by providing very simple services for users on both ends - allowing anyone to enter crypto world and use it and allow any crypto user use crypto in traditional fiat environment with very little or none friction. We believe that we can boost the adoption and usage of crypto currencies and other blockchain services by providing a single mobile app that will rebel against current situtation of services being focused only crypto or traditional.. and that's why we call our project  Money Rebel Platform  We're currently counting down till official public global PREICO launch next week - where early investors will be able to get 15% bonus on deposits. If you wan't to participate early then you should add yourself on our whitelist as pre-ico phase won't be open for grabs -- you'll need special invite code and there are limited tokens available at 15% bonus. You can add yourself to whitelist here: http://moneyrebel.io/whitelist.html . Or message me and I might push few bitcointalkers that share our vision on the list  Also check out the sneak peak of our PREICO site waiting to be opened to the world on 3rd of October!,False

So 25% of the net profits will be used annually for token buy backs so that keeps this clear of being a security correct? You will be a utility token instead if I read things clearly. ,False

To explain how the value will be created -  The currency will become the payment currency of choice for services on our platform in the lon run. But before we get there we wanted to minimize risk for our investors by including using proven kripto arbitrage strategy in our kriptel.de arbitrage fund that ensures regular profit  payouts (dividends) right from the first day. - in form of buybacks - So token has value right from the start no need to wait to finish development. And as we put online more products more profit will be payed out in such way - first yearly later we want to do it monthly.  As we reach a mobile banking app launch date - an exchange will be integrated in the app - so if you want to purchase some service on our platform (added functionalities, advisors, etc..)  with eur or bitcoins for example - they will be converted in to MRP tokens first and then sent.. this will create a steady demand on the tokens and therefore making them more valuable in the long run. So regular demand - and regular buybacks with burns from us should create good conditions for investors and those who will accept MRP as payment currency.  Regarding minimum contribution is up to you to decide we don't draw lines here - everyone is welcome. But Keep in mind 15% bonus will not last forever.  New markets? for now our target market in first years is definitely Europe as legislation is good to us and there is good market share to be seized. Also having licenses in one eu country allows you to operate in all eu countries.  Let me know if you'll have any further questions.  Regards,",False
