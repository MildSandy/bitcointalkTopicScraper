I bought it and it came automatically in my Mew wallet In myetherwallet i cant see an option to store bbo...Any ideas? did you buy BBO yet? If you bought it already, you should add the address contract to get the token out. New  contract address : 0x84f7c44b6fed1080f647e354d552595be2cc602f Participated in the pre-sale and now see 3 tokens namely BBO in my wallet. What happened? Bigbom had changed the contract address, More information please check https://medium.com/@bigbomeco/new-bbo-token-contract-address-a1101ab743fd What is the benefit of holding BBO? Do customers receive a portion of the transaction fees? You don't receive a portion of the fee. Instead, a large portion of the fee is burned.  So, with a decreasing supply, it's theoretically similar to receiving a portion of the transaction fee. Do people earn anything other than price increase from this partnership as Bigbom holders? By collaboration with Bigbom Eco, the project can offer their 15,000 customers using Bigbom iAds to optimize their ads campaign. I wanna get some bbo. What steps shell I do for it? You have to wait ICO to get BBO tokens. Sign up and wait for KYC. Learn about ERC-20 wallet and MEW if you dont have any infomation about them, and last but not least you have exchange to ETH to jump in ICO. Do you have formal confirmation about ICO start? Bigbom will announce exact date and time within this week. Pre-ICO was done, you can join ICO next month. other ICO normally freeze their tokens for months, why bigbom freeze tokens for 2 years, can you explain me more about it? Just the Founder , Co-Founder , Dev Team BBO will be locked for 2 years. It means there is less BBO on the market, and the price may be increased. what will happen with unsold tokens? Will be burn. But I think there will be no unsold tokens, this is a digital advertising project that will advance the next generation of advertising, and certainly a lot of enthusiastic investors to buy this token. Can anyone tell me why bigbom is increasing? Bigbom is not listed on any exchange yet, so hard to tell. But this is a real project, apply on real Marketing & Advertising market, so believe me, it will increase in the near future.",False
