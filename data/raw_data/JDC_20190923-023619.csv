I just didn't got time to visit wavesdex the past couple of days. I have to disagree, right now what this project needs is some exposure, it needs something to attract people, the coin's been dead for months now, no movement, no trading is happening in wavesdex and only people on here knows about the project. If the dev will start the buyback program then there is a possibility that people will start taking interest with this project again and the price can finally go back to the way it is during the ico because if you've seen the price at wavesdex is just so undervalued and so low for its real worth.",False

Normally, at other exchanges, they'll emptied out the 8,000 satoshi order before moving to a higher sell order, means, that buyer should get their 71 JDC at 8,000 (and not 58,000), leaving only 14 JDC left at 8,000 satoshi.

I've heard great feedbacks so far about this new innovations that you're talking about on here and seeing that they're gonna introduce smart contracts then that will really be a huge step for the project and also for the platform. It's great that they're pushing their limits to be on the same level with eth, even though eth's way older than waves it's nice that wave is trying to catch up with eth's features. I do follow wavesdex on twitter and so far it seems like 2018 is a bright year for the platform, I hope by next year I won't have any more problems with the platform, hoping they can really improve and fix those bugs and glitches that I was talking about anyway just a quick update on JDS, I read on telegram that 2018 will also be a bright year for this project, it seems like this 2018, JDS will finally be introduced to a larger market.

That's why, for those who got the airdrop of 10 waves, they received the equivalent amount of JDC, which is 85. And now, no more buy orders for waves/JDC pair. So I'm wondering what is happening to this project. I'm not a member of their chat channel because you can always refer to the ann thread if some updates are currently happening to the project. That's where a lot of people check the progress of a certain project and not in a chat channel. So many chat channels to attend to if you want to be a member of every coin you want to be in.
