The main question shoud be why some other icos that don't have a thing to do with blockchain try somehow integrate blockchain in their core business like blockchain is a new ""database"" and suddenly they needs such a huge amounts to raise? Major diffrent is we want to enrich the humans live and not our pockets as I can't think of a single reason why we should need 30 million for example like some other ICO's",False

I'm surprised you're not aware of that.  Quote from: yayat on November 14, 2018, 09:38:15 AM But I see SECURYPTO is under the PIVX network, why not use the well-known Ethereum network?  Securypto is based on PIVX, just like PIVX is based on DASH and DASH on bitcoin. We are working on our own blockchain which is similar to PIVX in code. So we have our own blockchain. However to raise funds we use the ethereum network token for now and tokens will be swapped later for SCU which is the native token on the Securypto blockchain.  Other ICO's use only eth to raise funds, we are creating our own blockchain!  Quote from: defc0de on November 13, 2018, 10:11:47 PM Hi, is this the new official ANN page?
