It looks on the first glance that domain name investing has one of the lowest barriers of all investments. Hey, a .com is $10 or less!  There are hundreds of thousands, probably millions of people, who tried their luck. A forum like NamePros alone has nearly 1 million members.  But for most people buying a domain for resale is like buying a lottery ticket. The truth is that a very small minority do this professionally. There are probably less than 500 full-time professional domain investors worldwide.  Most people are not very good in recognizing what makes a great domain. They fall in love with a word and think that is the greatest name on earth and must be worth millions. But as the years go by, no-one agrees, and they continue to sit on their name.  It takes analytical skills, experience and tools to identify good names at scale. Even in a good portfolio, sell-through rates are below 5% yearly. Therefore it also takes significant funds if you want to make a business out of domain investing.  This is with .com. Things gets even more complicated if you start looking at ccTLDs or new gTLDs. They have different legal and technical requirements, different price, different languages, etc.  So tldr, low barriers to entry, high barriers to success!",False

The total budget allocated for bounties is equal 350000DDF=350BTC which is a good amount. The problem is the percentage of distribution on each bounty category is a bit problem at the end and set some limitation to the participant or even provide some list because it can be easily abused especially the social media campaign. For example on twitter campaign. Everybody can do the task especially the retweet even after the ICO end and it is unfair.,False

Proven Model, Team DDF was established in 2010 as “Domain Developers Fund” and has a solid track record in domain investing. To expand, we are adding crypto currencies and other digital assets to our portfolio.  Initial Coin Offering Through an Ethereum-based ICO, DDF will raise up to 249,000 ETH.  ██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████  Who Is DDF Established Fund Founded as “Domain Developers Fund” in 2010 as Cayman Island Open-Ended Administered Fund, administrated by JP Funds Administration, audited  by BDO, regulated by CIMA.
