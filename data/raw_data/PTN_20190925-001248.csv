The company is headquartered in Kingston, Jamaica with rapid expansion plans for the region and onwards. (See Caribbean roadmap)  Though primarily considered a healthcare services platform that supports the entire ecosystem: Consumers (patients), Healthcare Providers and Services Providers; As of January 2017, Potion Owl has captured majority share of the Electronic Health Records (EHR) market within its founding country‚Äôs major cities. These are also primary tourist destinations which translates to easier access to healthcare for visitors from other countries.  Misconceptions  Potion Owl is often termed an Electronic Health Records (EHR) or Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system - we are not. Potion Owl is a healthcare services platform that embraces P2P in its own sense by allowing both consumers (patients) and healthcare providers to have access to our services in ways that are focused on both parties. A standard Electronic Health Records system is ‚Äúdoctor-facing‚Äù meaning it caters to the doctors first then considers the patient afterwards.  Potion Owl reverses this approach by asking questions that are ‚Äúconsumer (patient) facing‚Äù:  If you‚Äôre feeling unwell, what healthcare provider do you contact? Will they be available? Will they be able to locate your file? If this is a different provider, will you be able to provide information about past visits to other healthcare providers? If you would like a second opinion, do you have enough detail after your visit with the healthcare provider of your choice? If you are in another country or foreign location, will the task be more daunting? Particularly if you are prescribed medication?  In essence, Potion Owl‚Äôs platform focuses on the consumer (patient) but also provides tools for healthcare providers by implementing an ecosystem.  Ethos  Potion Owl‚Äôs aim is to make healthcare services accessible - anytime, anywhere.      Currently, Potion Owl‚Äôs platform provides an avenue for healthcare providers and consumers (patients) to engage meaningfully. This includes but is not limited to:  Sharing of consumer (patient) information with other healthcare providers by the original author Sharing of consumer (patient) information with other healthcare providers by the consumer (patient) Consumers (patients) monitoring multiple accounts for e.g. a mother monitoring her child‚Äôs account Appointment to healthcare providers and requests to pharmacy regarding over the counter drug consultation Anonymous prescription viewer for pharmacies in order to protect consumer (patient) identity     The Current Structure of Healthcare & Its Difficulties  The need for interaction between various healthcare providers and service providers (such as insurance companies) has resulted in an increase of digital technology implementation. Though these solutions have improved the tracking and efficiency for delivering care, they have resulted in creating isolations of healthcare services.  Health and government organizations spend a significant amount of time and money setting up and managing traditional information systems and data exchanges; requiring resources to continuously troubleshoot issues, update field parameters, perform backup and recovery measures, and extract information for reporting purposes. The result has been that most systems still are unable to easily access their data let alone share it.  As a result, healthcare providers are spending more time with acclimatization of varying systems and troubling shooting problems which has ultimately led to a distraction in consumer (patient) care. For example: Physician burnouts jumped from 45 to 54 percent between 2011 and 2014 due to such circumstances.  Potion Owl can help resolve these issues by providing an avenue for easily accessible, reliable, verifiable and secure data by building an ecosystem that is designed to facilitate on-demand, secure and universal access to healthcare services.    Complexity vs Simplicity  ‚ÄúOne of the most challenging aspects of digital healthcare is that systems are chalked up as being not user-friendly. Healthcare providers feel they are cumbersome and very complex. Consumers (patients) on the other hand feel completely disengaged.‚Äù - www.cio.com     Consumer Engagement  According to a survey conducted by Accenture, more than 40% of consumers (patients) would change healthcare providers if online access with the ability for optimal engagement was available. - www.accenture.com     Digitizing healthcare helps consumers (patients), healthcare providers and service providers. When developing new digital health platforms for our consumer (patients), convenience should always be the supreme consideration. - Healthcare in America      Potion Owl‚Äôs Future with Blockchain  Neblio Platform is built with focus geared towards a suite of RESTful APIs using programming languages that are not only the core strengths of our current team but will also have future implications on recruitment. These languages include but are not limited to: JavaScript, PHP, Python and Java.  Through decentralized mesh networking, Neblio nodes connect to each other relaying blocks around the globe. Every functional node contains an entire copy of the Neblio blockchain which will allow the Potion Owl platform to utilize the performance benefits through interaction with the closest or fastest node. This magnitude of scalability will improve application performance and response time while ensuring the information on the blockchain can be accessed nearly anywhere which is a part of Potion Owl‚Äôs ethos in ensuring that we are accessible at anytime from anywhere.  Nodes are capable of joining and leaving the network autonomously without harming the network. Potion Owl will be able to communicate with another node that contains a full copy of the Neblio blockchain.  Consumers (patients) within the ecosystem will be afforded interoperable access to healthcare and service providers and vice-versa whilsts observing laws within each medical jurisdiction through the implementation of smart contracts which will be powered PTN tokens.  Potion Owl intends to introduce a token (PTN) by utilizing Neblio‚Äôs Blockchain Network. The creation of the PTN tokens will emulate all characteristics of Neblio‚Äôs NTP1 standard.    Potion Owl‚Äôs Planned Ecosystem with Neblio  In the next phase of development facilitated by a token sale. Potion Owl intends to improve its existing services with the development of a fully decentralized ecosystem for healthcare services on the Neblio Network. The Ecosystem will consist of four (4) new components:  Smart contracts that govern the ecosystem‚Äôs authentication and authorization An indigenous utility token known as the Potion Owl token or ‚ÄúPTN‚Äù Turnkey solution for Potion Owl‚Äôs platform to be integrated with existing systems An SDK geared towards the creation of healthcare applications within Potion Owl Ecosystem Med rep (incentivization through transaction fees - see here for more details)  Our mission is to make healthcare services seamless and easily accessible at anytime from anywhere. All the characteristics and developments outlined by Neblio as mentioned above has provided the ideal environment for Potion Owl.   Medical Representative (Med Rep)  Potion Owl‚Äôs white paper (page 9) states that ‚ÄúPotion Owl‚Äôs Ecosystem will be designed to incentivize participation through the use of PTN tokens both as a method of authentication and validation‚Äù  In order to generate meaningful data for pharmaceutical companies, research facilities, insurance companies and governments among other organizations. Potion Owl intends to introduce a feature called ‚ÄòMed Rep‚Äô which facilitates information organization without patient identification. PTNs will have a specialized wallet which shall require the holder to have a minimum of 50,000 PTNs in order to toggle the ‚ÄòMed Rep‚Äô feature.  The inherent benefit of such a feature bodes well not just for Med Reps but also for all actors involved including: Pharmaceutical companies, research facilities, insurance companies and governments among other institutions. For example, statistics desired by research facilities such as the number of cancer patients within a given region and how they are treated may be required and as such PTNs will be required to harness this information meaningfully. Med Reps will be incentivized in the form of transaction fees.      The Potion Owl Token (PTN) will have a maximum supply of 50 million. 7.5 million for the presale, 25 million for the main sale, 2.5 million for the Bounty Campaign. 5 million will be designated to Potion Owl for the current team members and recruitment equity (vested at four (4) years for founder and two (2) years for team members), and the Ecosystem as well as Partnerships will be designated 5,000,000.      Economics   Token Distribution      Budget     Ecosystem Distribution Map        Kindly see the current timeline below as it pertains to 2018 (See the whitepaper for more details):    Before pursuing other regions, we aim to occupy all 28 Caribbean countries within a 6 month timeframe starting with Kingston, Jamaica, and ending with Puerto Rico. After this, we will then pursue Central and South America over the course of 24 months. The Asian/Oceania region will also be pursued in parallel to this. Below is an aggressive timeline which indicates a projected monthly progress:    *Projections for Central, South America and Asia/Oceania will be released after token sale.       Check out our entire team by here.     Potion Owl envisions a world where Healthcare Services are easily accessible to everyone regardless of the time and location. E-commerce, accommodation, ride hailing and communication among other industries have all been disrupted by technology. Healthcare has yet to undergo this transformation.  Technology should be a part of everyone‚Äôs daily routine with meaningful use and positive impact. We share this sentiment and embrace it through healthcare services. We are solving this by creating the digital healthcare tools necessary for consumers (patients), healthcare providers and service providers to effectively engage within a standardized ecosystem. Potion Owl is making healthcare services accessible - anytime, anywhere.                            ",False
