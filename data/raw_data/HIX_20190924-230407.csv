Mark H. van den Arend: Van den Arend is a former employee of Deutsche Bank where he has worked over twenty years.  Advisors Sooyong Park: Park is the director of Blockchain Research Center at Sogang University.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Helix Orange.  Risks     It is not clear that a blockchain implementation for KYC/AML procedures is needed in the space. Other similar projects such as CoinList seem to do quite well without minting their own tokens. A hard-cap of 35 million USD for a project that does not necessitate the use of blockchain seems way too much. (-2)     There is very little incentive to buy HIX tokens unless you are not running or planning to run your own ICO. ICO investors could do well buying HIX tokens only when they are necessitated to do so. Furthermore, speculative crypto-traders who do not plan to participate in ICOs have no reason to hold any. (-1.5)  Growth Potential     Platforms such as Helix Orange is much needed in the space as ICOs are getting more and more interest and the legal landscape is changing all the time. (+2)     Helix Orange‚Äôs s exclusive focus on countries‚Äô legal regulations on cryptocurrencies and ICOs is definitely worth noting. (+1.5)     Many team members and advisors have prior experience in ICO management. (+1)  Disposition Helix Orange is trying to fix an important point in the cryptocurrency market. Making KYC/AML procedures easier for ICO investors and ICO teams would make both sides‚Äô work much easier. Yet it is certainly debatable that a token is needed to fulfill this need as projects such as CoinList do well without using any. Helix Orange receives a 1/10.
