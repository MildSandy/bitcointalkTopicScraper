Just do as follows:  1. Confirm your trash or alias email on https://coinpot.co (this is the microwallet for all faucet payouts; payouts are free at an amount of e.g. .002 LTC or .0001 BTC) 2. Then head over to https://moonbit.co.in/?ref=ff6bd276c782 (you can take this referral link of mine, or just get rid of the ‘?ref=ff6bd276c782’). There are daily and mystery bonuses in this faucet, so if you just login in twice a day you receive ca. 200 Satoshi a day.  Additionally, there are some coinpot tokens which are relatively stable (you get three per claim) and could be converted too. And bonus bitcoin (https://bonusbitcoin.co/?ref=22D8B6B4AAB3) is another faucet to get currently about 40 Satoshi each 15 minutes (but it is a little more tricky to explain, because of all these pop-ups and new loadings of a page. But if you are on the web page, it is not that hard to understand. I prefer to change the claim settings here to ‘Always receive the average claim amount’).  What I finally do on coinpot is to convert every coin to LTC, as .002 LTC are ca. .00001500 to .00002000 BTC, and withdraw it to an exchange of my choice. Works well!",False

And, if one clinic strayed away from this pool, then the calculation won't be valid, and as they offered an ""unique method"" of payment where they accept fiat, it'll attract consumers, which means the said clinic will have a chance of having better visitors, thus the number on your theory will ince again changed. Now, let's apply the scenario to a worse situation where at least there is a nine tenth of clinic that didn't use DCN, your number will significantly decreasing.

I only wish that the development and management team would see the economics of giving this some serious thought. I do understand the argument of having the tokens locked in and released on a predetermined schedule and the justification of having enough coin supply for a global market, but the economics just does not make sense when it boils down to the competition faced by the vast majority of coins out there on the market, some with very similar objectives and use cases and with drastically lower supply.  Etherium current supply= 98, 000, 000 Ripple= 39 B,   and total supply 100B  As for medical tokens;  Medibloc total supply= 4B Medicalchain total supply= 500 mln  Dentacoin current supply= 325 B and Total supply is 8 trillion  Now how can you possibly compete sustainably with such high supply???  Another argument that I've heard is juxtaposing the supply to the total number of circulating USD fiat currency thereby justifying the need to allow for enough circulating supply. I simply don't buy that argument because simply, crypto currency in generally is seen as deflationary by nature and can't be seen in the same  light as fiat currency. Not to completely forget utility tokens, but even they are also used as store of value based on a very speculative crypto market. if we are to see crypto tokens as having some form of store of value definition, then the economics would make sense to reduce the price. As a holder of this coin, I honestly believe in the vision and the team, but I would again urge the reduction in the supply to at least less than 100 billion to allow for sustained growth and attract more investors (what have we to lose, but a lot to gain)",False

The associated Dentacoin ERC20 token was conceived to be used globally by all individuals.  The Dentacoin team launched its first tools last year:  Trusted Review Platform: this framework rewards patients for posting unedited reviews of the care they have received onto a blockchain.   Dentavox: a customer intelligence platform which seeks users’ opinions on dental health topics.  Dentacare: a mobile app that rewards people for establishing healthy dental care habits.   VIBE (VIBE) Market Cap as of 01/15/2018 ($224,683,933 USD)  https://www.vibehub.io/  VIBEHub is aiming to become a substantial VR and AR marketplace and hub. VibeHub’s initial token offering (ITO) recently made a lot of noise, becoming sold out in less than 5 minutes, raising $10 million (USD) in the process. Furthermore, the value of its token “Vibe” increased by a staggering 400% on January 10 (which put the price per coin above Ripple).  The project’s FAQ provides some insights on what users can expect in the future:  “You will be able to attend concerts, education seminars, play games and go on virtual dates all in VR on the VIBEHub application. VIBEHub will also focus on AR (Augmented Reality) as well, and will be available as those device become mainstream. You will also be able to access the platform without a VR or AR device, in a less immersive experience through modern browsers, Allowing everyone to participate.”  CYBERMILES (CMT) Market Cap as of 01/15/2018 ($167,413,783 USD)  https://cm.5miles.com/  CyberMiles is a new blockchain platform designed for commercial applications. CyberMiles has announced its first strategic partnership with peer-to-peer marketplace, 5miles. The platform aims to empower the decentralization of online marketplaces, it recently concluded an initial coin offering, raising close to $30 million (USD) from more than 100 countries.  2018 is a promising year for crypto tokens and I’m looking forward to learn about new exciting blockchain-related projects.

This is a ton of change happening in the good old dental industry.  There is consolidation happening on a large scale.  For example based in Fort Washington, PA there is a company called DentaWeb.  They are an Indian based company of highly successful Dentists that has interesting things going on - most of which involve data centralization. They are cash rich and have purchased well over 600 private dental practices in the Northeast US.  All practices are tied back to Ft Washington via a VPN. They have a centralized English speaking call center in Ft Washington where all patient calls are fielded, appts are made, billing, records etc.  They are also a distributor and enabler of modern dental technology. They have classroom learning where they bring in experts from abroad to tech the very latest and most advanced techniques.  Its an old industry that everyone needs especially the immigrant population.  Overseas having straight teeth is not nearly as important as it is here in the USA therefore tens of thousands of those people will be spending their present and future income on dental. They tend to have big families - again more demand for Dental - an industry that traditionally is funded more out of pocket than plan paid - trust me I know from experience even the very very plans max out quickly if your mouth is having a bad year.

One would only be worried about the total coin count if it was for pure speculation and investment purpose. Dentacoin has a use case and will need this QTY in the long run.

It has suggested that “saver coins” are the best way to achieve lasting savings. The argument is that a rising price, such as Bitcoin has enjoyed, is an important deflationary component to successful long-term savings.  “Spender coins”, on the other hand, are theoretically inflationary and are not good long-term stores of value. The argument is that as the price of everything goes up, a coin that actually buys things will automatically decrease in value. According to “experts” and many recent blog posts, this makes “spender coins” a poor choice as a way to build value over the long-run.  Problem #1 This line of thinking has many mistakes, but the greatest one is a complete misunderstanding of the meaning of value. A currency – crypto or otherwise – only has value because it can be converted into something the holder wants. Dollars can be converted into a house or a car or a meal, so dollars have value.  What individuals who argue that Bitcoin is a “saver coin” forget is that Bitcoin only has value because it can be converted into dollars! While the original intention was to create a way for anonymous transactions, most people own Bitcoin for the potential price appreciation. They have no intention of ever buying anything with their Bitcoin without first converting the cryptocurrency into dollars (or Euros or some other national currency).  It’s true that some retailers are beginning to accept Bitcoin as payment, but the bill that is being paid is still expressed in dollars! Accepting Bitcoin is just a way to make paying in dollars (or Euros or some other national currency) easier. The retailer does the conversion to dollars, and gets a marketing edge over competitors by accepting Bitcoin.  Problem #2 Acceptance and use determine value, not intention. The price of Bitcoin has skyrocketed because more and more people are accepting it as a legitimate investment. It’s that simple. Any coin that grows in acceptance and use will see an increase in value. This happens with national currencies too. A loss of confidence in a national currency causes an increase in the acceptance and use of dollars (or Euros or some other national currency) in that nation.  So a coin like Dentacoin that is growing in acceptance and use in the global dental industry should see an increase in value, even though it is a “spender coin”. It will be deflationary and a long-term “saver coin” even though it is supposed to experience an erosion of value due to inflation in the upcoming years, until 2042, when the planned annual distribution will be completed.  In addition, acceptance and use for a “spender coin” like Dentacoin means getting a dental treatment, dental supplies or a dental review with the cryptocurrency. Acceptance and use for Bitcoin means being able to quickly and easily convert it into dollars. A single incident where multiple investors cannot do this – known in financial circles as a liquidity crisis – would damage Bitcoin’s acceptance and a part of its value.  Problem #3 No one can overcome the laws of supply and demand over the long run. Gold has value in part because it is rare. All the gold that has ever been mined in the history of the world would fill less than 3 1/2 Olympic swimming pools. Bitcoin has profited from a perception that it is scarce, but that perception is a mistake.  First of all, every Bitcoin can be broken down into 100 million Satoshi. This is the real unit of the cryptocurrency. In comparison, the total amount of Dentacoin that will ever be issued is less than the current supply of Bitcoin units (a.k.a. Satoshi) currently on the market. In addition, new Bitcoin is being added to the supply continually.  While much has been said about the “total supply” of Bitcoin as a fixed amount, the reality is that “hard forks” in the Bitcoin blockchain have eliminated this limit.  Although the new cryptocurrencies have names like “Bitcoin Cash” or “Bitcoin Gold”, they have value because of their association with Bitcoin and effectively increase the total supply of the Bitcoin “brand”.  So, What is Value? The acceptance and use of a cryptocurrency gives it real long-term value. This is the next development in the world of blockchain, and it is already taking place. Political arguments regarding de-centralized authority are less important than the real-world goods and services that can be obtained with the coin.  As a cryptocurrency designed for the global dental industry, Dentacoin is tied to the value of the services it buys. An increasing cost of services will increase the value of Dentacoin. Keep in mind that this is only a measure of value, so better services at a lower price – better value – will also be reflected in the market price of Dentacoin.  The Dentacoin Assurance smart contract is another significant value creation opportunity.  The unique approach – which will only be available through the Dentacoin Ecosystem – aligns the financial incentives of both dentists and patients in achieving better dental health. This value should also be reflected in the future market price of Dentacoin.",False

Cryptocurrencies based on Blockchain technology are hotly debated in many industries. One aspect, which is usually the focus here, is the potential increase in value, which in the ""Bitcoin boom"" has turned into a real - and not insignificant - increase in value.  But the potential of Blockchain goes far beyond mere monetary benefits. Due to its intrinsic properties, it is ideally suited as a basis for various technologies and concepts that are geared to accuracy and transparency. In terms of a ""digital database"", the blockchain has three main features:  Decentralization : There is no central authority exercising administrative power. The data is in the form of a network structure in copy with all users involved.  Transparency : The decentralization results in a transparency for all users who have corresponding access rights.  Immutability : All data added to the blockchain will remain in its original state. They can not be changed or deleted. This makes the digital database almost completely tamper-proof. The Dentacoin Foundation from the Netherlands has recognized and exploited the opportunities offered by blockchain technology to implement a revolutionary project in the field of dentistry. With the first Ethereum Blockchain-based custom token especially for the dental industry, it has paved the way for a modern and, above all, patient-centered dentistry.  SWISS Dentaprime has integrated this custom token - called dentacoin (DCN) - into its treatment concept as the first dental clinic to focus even more on consistent patient centering .  In the 3-month trial period (March to May 2017), Dentacoin has proven to be the optimal integrative tool for daily workflow.  The key features of the custom token are developed as part of a patient loyalty program, helping to strengthen patient loyalty and optimize quality management. Patients receive Dentacoin credited to their digital wallet for their feedback on each treatment step. These can be credited to the payment amount at their next treatment. Through constant and authentic feedback, the Dentaprime Dental Clinic can make processes that increase service and treatment quality more targeted and thus more effective: a win-win situation. Because the patient benefits not only from a discount on the invoice amount, as is the case with conventional coupons or the like, but also from a treatment based on his feedback or adapted.  The patient reactions in the test phase were consistently positive. Even if it is of course a concept that needs explanation. In constant exchange and with constant support from the Dentacoin Foundation, communication concepts tailored to different audiences have been developed to help all patients understand how the loyalty program works.  Although many patients have used their dentacoin as a means of payment for their treatment, there are some who are so intrigued by the cryptocurrency that they consider it an investment with potential value and even ask for additional ways to obtain DCN. Therefore, the Dentaprime Dental Clinic has extended the loyalty program to various evaluation options and referrals.  In addition, a catalog of selected dental care products is planned that patients can purchase with their DCN.  Since the possibilities for using the custom token are basically unlimited, the Dentaprime dental clinic is very excited about future developments and of course keeps you as a reader up to date.

How will you distribute the 1.9% on 2018? I'm quite confuse with the distribution because there's the possibility of price decrease if you directly add it in the blockchain without a price on it.  Based on the https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dentacoin/, the circulating supply is 323,507,001,026.00 and the market cap is $41,899,333.00. If we divide the two:  $41,899,333 / 323,507,001,026.00 = $0.0001300 - This would be our Dollar price as of today November 16, 2017.  If you add 1.90% in 2018 that is:   8,000,000,000,000.00 x .019 =  152,000,000,000.00  So the total circulating supply in 2018 will be:  323,507,001,026.00 + 152,000,000,000.00 =  475,507,001,026.00  And we will get the value of 1 DCN in Dollar based on the current market cap:  $41,899,333 / 475,507,001,026.00 =  0.0000881  So, from 0.0001300$, the value on 2018 will become 0.0000881$ if the market cap will not increase. Hope you will get my point sir. I'm sure This will not be application of your token.",False

Thank you for your feedback!  However, let me emphasize again that Dentacoin, unlike most of the other projects, is all about its implementation into the real world. That's what would give it value. Speculations are nice short-term value triggers and I am not underestimating them, but the viable real value of a company/ a coin like ours is mainly built around the number of its users. On that note, these ""few places"" that have already implemented Dentacoin are essentially important first steps in that direction. At the moment our industry acquisition team is actively communicating with a big part of the dentists registered on our review platform who are willing to test our next tools and implement DCN into their workflow. More partners will come very soon  What you can and should expect from our team is hard work towards achieving the next targets on our Roadmap. As per this moment, we are even ahead of the plans described in the whitepaper, we are highly focused on attracting new participants into the Dentacoin network, we are working on the development and the constant upgrade of our tools, we are creating strategy to gain wider global awareness step by step and we are happy for the engagement and involvement of some of you in this process. The Assurance model, which a lot of you have already rightly recognized as a crucial part of our project, is being discussed and clarified at the moment as well.  Seeing the interest from the industry and people all over the world towards Dentacoin, I personally am convinced in its adoption and success. Yes, it might take time, it might be difficult sometimes, but the most important thing is to make steps. Every day. In the right direction.  I would like to come to my favorite topic ""community"" again... Your involvement always matters. You have an idea how to accelerate the good results? Share it. You have constructive critics against something we've done? Say it. But even better: Suggest what we could do to improve it. You want to see Dentacoin listed on a major exchange platform? Let this platform know about it. You want to be able to pay with DCN at your city? Let your dentist know about it. There is a meetup/a conference or any other event that you think could be of benefit for us to participate? Tell us about it. You would like to contribute in any way? We will be glad to cooperate with you.  At the end of the day, we all want this project to be successful, so we might as well make it possible together!",False

A first clinic in India accepts Dentacoin as means of payment: Dentech Dental Care! ""I believe that Dentacoin has the potential to improve the dental condition of the population on a global scale and to also strengthen the relationship between patients and dentists”, explains Dr. Yogesh Khadtare and adds: “In the long run dentists will get even more benefits from accepting DCN in their practice. The idea to shorten the supply chain by removing the dealer between dentists and manufacturers will make a revolution in the dental industry.”  Dentech Dental Care is the third clinic which has not only implemented the Dentacoin tools, but also accepts Dentacoin (DCN) as means of payment (after SWISS Dentaprime, Bulgaria and F3T Dental Clinic, United Kingdom).  Meanwhile, on our pilot tool - the Trusted Review Platform - there are already over 490 dental practices registered. A big part of them have expressed their interest in implementing Dentacoin at their practices and are eager to test the upcoming  Dentacare Mobile app with their patients. At the moment, our Industry Partner Acquisition team, headed by Dr. Klaus-Christian Werner, is actively communicating with them in order to establish cooperation.  https://www.dentacoin.com/blog/dentacoin-expands-accepted-means-payment-india/",False

The event in July was presale (1 ETH = 8 million DCN), and now we are having an ICO (1 ETH = 2.5 million DCN), so that was the incentive to join the presale - you get more for your support. The ICO price is still very low, if you read the Whitepaper you will see the fundamental price is much higher than the current ICO price. So there is an incentive tojoin the ICO. The current rate is the ICO price, which was fixed a few months ago. It will not increase during the ICO, but after that - nobody knows what will happen. Before the ICO, Dentacoin had a much higher market price, which shows the potential ahead of Dentacoin. The ICO ends on Nov 1st, so still some time to join and buy Dentacoin cheap. The value of the token increases through the value generating tools. The first tool is already launched, the next 2 tools are on a test phase - once they are launched, more activities will be created to contribute for Dentacoin mission.

As you said, the coins will be released gradually until the year 2042. Nobody knows what the future holds, but for now, we see that there is an increasing interest for Dentacoin concept - the first tool already has 4000+ registered users and 400+ dental clinics. The next 2 tools are on a test phase, so as soon as they are launched the awareness will increase even further. Many dental clinics and companies from the dental industry have expressed interest to integrate Dentacoin into their workflow. Once the ICO is over, the team will work towards these activities more. For the few months since being launched, Dentacoin has gained pretty good popularity and demand. If you remember, right before the ICO, Dentacoin had reached a 55 rank on coinmarketcap, with 10 million marketcap and over 158k trading volume for 24h. It is natural to have a steady price during October, because our ICO is with a fixed price. Very few people know that this is the reason for the low price, so they wait to see what happens.

In return for leaving detailed reviews of their actual dental treatment, patients are rewarded with Dentacoin (DCN), the custom token being sold as part of a current ICO and which is already accepted as payment by dental clinics across Europe.  $440 billion spent on dental treatments globally, but up to 90% of these expenses could be avoided if patients had early check-ups three times a year. By launching the review platform and linking it to DCN, Dentacoin Foundation hopes to leverage the network effect and increase the value of tokens for all participants. “With this latest update, we hope to make it very easy for people to contribute with reviews and trusted feedback about their dental treatment experiences”, says Jeremias Grenzebach, co-founder and core developer of Dentacoin alongside Alexander Atanasov, Trusted Review Platform developer.  Dentacoin already counts over 290 practices and over 2,400 registered users on the platform since it launched on 17th August. It hopes that the combined payment and reviews solution will create a more functional dental care system. Funds raised through the ICO will be used for focused regional targeting, with the aim of global coverage.  By encouraging direct feedback to dentists and clinics, the platform should lead to improved service quality. All DCN bought by users and issued as rewards by Dentacoin are held in an integrated blockchain wallet.  https://www.dataiq.co.uk/news/dentacoin-launches-blockchain-enabled-dental-reviews",False

As startups in different sectors use blockchain to drive greater transparency, veracity and automation across the digital information ecosystem, they’re boosting awareness of the technology in sectors ranging from payments to dentistry. Yes, you read it right. It is looking as though the Global Dental Industry is set for the greatest makeover within the Healthcare sector thanks to the Netherlands-based startup Dentacoin. Its custom-made token of the same name is already implemented at partner clinics, exchangeable on international exchange platforms, distributed through the first developed tools and since recently – accepted  as means of payment by a German-based manufacturer of high-tech dental equipment. But let’s first go back to the basics…  Using the Blockchain technology to start a global movement  Dentacoin is the first integral Blockchain solution for the Global Dentistry, aimed at improving dental care worldwide and making it affordable through creating a network of patients, dentists, suppliers, who trustfully cooperate between each other and act in mutual interest. The essence of this unusual Blockchain-based model lies in activating the decentralized power of all market participants through a custom-made utility token that serves numerous tailored Blockchain-based tools and powers the whole Dentacoin network. Within the network, network effects are expected where the value of the whole network increases with every new participant added to it. The token itself is used for rewarding network participants for their contribution to the Foundation’s mission; it is utilized as united means of payment and ensures access to services provided within and across the network. “The Blockchain technology is the only way to automate data security, protect from counterfeit and achieve low costs. It is the only way to integrate a currency system at low costs and with maximum security, independent of authorities and banks. The technology enables more and more decentralized, autonomous processes that return the power back into the hands of the people”, explains Jeremias Grenzebach, Co-Founder and Core-Developer at Dentacoin.  Already implemented as means of payment at partner clinics  If you are not aware of the current state of dentistry and its utter need of industry-centric solution or you are generally skeptical about the wide Blockchain acceptance, you might ask yourself if Dentacoin would be applicable into the real world anytime soon. You will not need to wonder for a long time though as Dentacoin has already been implemented as means of payment and as a part of their Patient Loyalty Programs at two partner clinics in Europe for months – SWISS Dentaprime (Varna, Bulgaria) and F3T Dental Clinic (London, United Kingdom). Therefore, even prior its ICO, Dentacoin already had its proof of concept.  Desislava Dimova, Manager of SWISS Dentaprime, the first clinic to implement DCN back in March 2017, shares more about their experience: “We are convinced that every business could and should benefit from collective customer wisdom in order to improve their service quality. […] Patients were also very excited about this new opportunity. Giving a discount in euro was nowhere near the excitement of receiving Dentacoin. Dentacoin felt like some kind of magical money to them. […] This creates a special bond between our clinic and the patients – all parties working together to improve the quality of dental services.”  Another key partnership with the German-based manufacturer CruisAIDer  Recently, the team behind this ambitious project made a significant breakthrough towards wider acceptance of Dentacoin within the industry. As of 9th of October 2017 CruisAIDer, a European company, specialized on digitalization of dental clinics in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, accepts Dentacoin as means of payment for its innovative product Powercart – a powerful machine that does everything the dentist needs to facilitate digital workflow and chairside treatment in a much faster and more efficient manner. Powercart is already being widely applied for intraoral scanning and compatible with the world’s leading brands for intraoral scanners.  “The dental industry is highly decentralized when it comes to parts and materials – we rely heavily on effective transfer of funds to increase productivity and live up to the fast-paced demands of our clients. Up until now we were stuck having to change between currencies to source the materials we need to manufacture our CruisAIDer Powercart for Intra-Oral scanning. In my opinion, Dentacoin is not only the future of the entire dental industry; it is what lies ahead for all connected supplementary industries. I wish we had this tool handy when we started out. Making the international acquisition of parts more efficient means we can cut prices”, says Simon Sostmann, CEO of CruisAIDer.  “Having a partnership with yet another European company, which strongly believes in digitalization and efficiency only proves the strong potential and opportunities which lay ahead of Dentacoin”, comments Philipp Grenzebach, Co-Founder and Business Developer at Dentacoin Foundation.  Currently, Dentacoin is raising funds for the further development of the project through an Initial Coin Offering which will be open until 1st of November 2017. The ICO is also a chance for early supporters to contribute at the lowest possible price (2 500 000 DCN/ETH, 33 000 000 DCN/BTC). The main modes of payment accepted during the ICO are Ether (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) and Indian Rupee (INR).

Coins and bills have different values relative to each other. Although the math may be easy to grasp, the practical application of using the physical currency can create problems for the non-native. This same problem actually also exists in the world of cryptocurrencies.  Satoshi are Bitcoin Denomination  Of course, denominations of a national currency are necessary because cash is physically carried around and used in commerce. Bitcoin can also be divided into smaller units to accommodate any size transactions by simple math done automatically and invisibly by the transaction software. A portion of a Bitcoin can be split off to pay for something that costs far less than one Bitcoin, making denominations unnecessary.  This seamless splitting of a cryptocurrency into smaller units has a limit. For Bitcoin, the limit is 100,000,000. The term for each of these infinitesimally small units is a Satoshi. This means that one Bitcoin is actually worth one hundred million Satoshi. In the rapidly changing world of cryptocurrency the term “satoshi” may come to mean the smallest unit of any cryptocurrency, but for now it is limited to the smallest unit of Bitcoin.  When it took 10,000 Bitcoin to buy two pizzas worth $41 in 2010 the idea of Satoshi was nothing more than a programming feature, but as the value of Bitcoin increases Satoshi will begin to become useful denominations. In fact, the lexicon of Bitcoin includes units of Satoshi! One million Satoshi is called a Bitcent. This goes all the way down to one hundred Satoshi which is a “Youbit”.  Satoshi Defines Supply  There has already been some discussion in the Bitcoin community of reducing the standard unit of this cryptocurrency from the Bitcoin to one of these smaller units. While irrelevant from a mathematical perspective, this would have a positive psychological and practical value. Smaller units of Bitcoin would be understood more easily relative to what they can buy, which may increase the value.  This is an absolutely fascinating progression in the perceived value of cryptocurrencies as a deflationary hedge, but the practical application is more meaningful. As of October, 2017 there are 16.6 million Bitcoin in circulation. In fact, this number is misleading. Because each Bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,00 parts, the actual number of units of the Bitcoin cryptocurrency in circulation is 1.66 quadrillion!  Moving decimal places around by breaking one Bitcoin into its component parts is not an academic exercise. Currencies have denominations for a variety of reasons, and only some of them are practical. The psychological impact on the market value of Bitcoin could be significant if people realized the large number of units actually currently on the market.  Satoshi vs. Dentacoin  This fact is demonstrated by the concerns about the number of Dentacoin that have been pre-mined. 8 trillion tokens seems to be enough to permanently reduce the value of each token to an infinitely small value, but this concern ignores the fact that Bitcoin has achieved significant value with over 200 times this number of units in circulation.  There are two important points to be made here. The first is that Dentacoin is not divisible into any smaller unit. For Dentacoin, one Dentacoin equals one “satoshi”. So the comparison between one Dentacoin and one Bitcoin is inaccurate. The real comparison is between one Dentacoin and one Satoshi. This is parity and the honest basis for any comparison of the two currencies.  Secondly, not all of the 8 trillion Dentacoin will be released onto the market at one time. The total supply is designed to facilitate the use of Dentacoin as a global unit of currency in the dental market. Dentacoin will be released on a pre-determined, set schedule that will increase the supply as the demand and awareness for the coin grows. This is intended to provide a firm foundation for Dentacoin from which it can increase in value.  Understanding the actual underlying unit of a currency, either national or crypto, is key to appreciating both its utility and its true value. And the fact is that it is easy to get lost in the math of decimal places.

Dentacoin has the potential to become one of the global currencies, therefore it is essential to have enough tokens to match this. On the other hand, over 96% of all tokens are locked in time lock contracts, and have a strict distribution mechanism until the year 2042, which allows only a small percentage to be released each year. In case the unlocked amounts are not utilized within the given year through the planned activities, they will be locked for after the year 2042. This is an intelligent distribution mechanism, which is similar to the growth of GDP for countries. In a perfect world, national currency would be distributed in a similar way - matching the increasing demand (and awareness). We have also described an interesting perspective, which shows that the actual circulating supply of Bitcoin units (a.k.a. Satoshi) are over 200 times more than the ENTIRE Dentacoin supply Here you can read the article: https://www.dentacoin.com/blog/total-supply-bitcoin-200-times-token-supply-dentacoin/ . Very few people understand that Dentacoin has no decimals, therefore 8 trillion is the maximum amount there ever will be. For people understanding the concept and the idea of a global currency, this supply may even not be enough. Nevertheless, there are many true supporters of our mission - both from blockchain community and dental industry, which understood the power of Dentacoin to really bring positive changes. We are currently having an ICO with very low initial price, which allows everyone to join and buy at the lowest price (3 Satoshi per Dentacoin). In case you want to join our ICO you can visit our official website https://www.dentacoin.com/ico/ or buy from one of the 5 exchanges which support the ICO, or directly through wallets, such as MyEtherWallet, Coinomi and imToken. Please reach out with any additional queries you may have.",False

Yes, 8 trillion is the total DCN supply and there are good reasons for that. 76% of all the coins are locked in contracts and will be released bit by bit from 2018 to 2042, following a certain schedule. Around 40% of the total amount of Dentacoins are reserved for EARNING (through tools and value-generating activities, contributing to the improvement of the dental industry), 40% are reserved for BUYING (ICO and presale activities, crowdfunding) and the other 20% are to be utilized by the Dentacoin Foundation for development of tools, marketing activities, bounty programs, future projects and unpredicted expenses.  See details here: https://www.dentacoin.com/blog/why-did-we-premine-8-trillion-dentacoins/  The planned allocation of the total DCN supply is described in the Whitepaper, chapter Allocation and supply: https://dentacoin.com/white-paper/Whitepaper-en.pdf  Actually, if you understand our distribution concept, you might even get concerned if there will be enough coins, as it happened with BitcoinChaser: http://bitcoinchaser.com/ico-hub/dentacoin-interview",False

Amalgam is probably the most controversial filler in dentistry. Although it is easy to use, it involves immense health risks.  It can not be in the air because it is a mercury alloy. Mercury exists in liquid or solid form but can not be gaseous. However, if the mercury is open, it is possible to slowly form fumes even at room temperature, which can cause poisoning. Mercury itself is highly toxic, harmful to health and the environment.  For this reason, not only the use in humans, but also the disposal of the material is dangerous. Both of these factors have led to amalgam being discouraged and a general ban is now being considered. Whether this will be the case will be the pending test.",False
