This merchant solution is available for traditional-economy enterprises to get paid with cryptocurrency and receive fiat, a different cryptocurrency, or any combination of the original payment currency with the aforementioned. Another aspect to this solution is enabling multi-currency payments for the purpose of ICO.  We are happy to announce that we are planning to deploy our solution to be used on our own ICO (naturally). This solution also has fiat & KYC integration, but for now, for regulatory and ideological reasons we do not intend to accept local (fiat) currency as part of our crowd-sale.

One that is designed to have no conflict of interest with the client and which has the potential to become the first, regulated, A-Book broker in the crypto sphere.  We have designed our system to have the smallest possible attack surface and, where possible, to take no custody of customer funds, whatsoever.  We strongly believe that, in order for this sphere to prosper, one of the key principles of the newly-minted crypto economy, decentralization, must prevail.  Therefore, we encourage every customer to take custody of their own funds, and to use the variety of services we offer to exchange cryptocurrency, fiat or goods, using the merchant solution; and to mine or remit cryptocurrency, all under one roof, securely, transparently, and with zero transmission time.
