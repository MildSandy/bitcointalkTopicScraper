Saledrop ICO Ends: December 4th, 2018.  Bounty Thread | Website | Whitepaper  | Twitter | Facebook | Telegram | Youtube  What is Tunez?  Tunez is a platform designed to be a tool for mass adoption. It features a cryptocurrency wallet, music and music video player/store and encrypted chat messenger. The platform is a blend of several viral industries intended to bring users to the blockchain. We have combined the blockchain, entertainment and social media market into one beautiful piece. TUNEZ mobile app, a cryptocurrency wallet for mass adoption.  The Problems: In todayâ€™s music industry, a poor release that is well marketed will fare better than a great release poorly marketed. In addition, centralized streaming platforms take up to 70% of the entire revenue stream, therefore making it unprofitable for small artist. Big artists that rely on tours and sponsorships can handle this, but smaller artists who only have a fan base of a few thousand cannot survive in this industry with such a small revenue stream. There is no way for music to incentivize music lovers to stream music they love.  How does Tunez solve this? The platform is a blend of several viral industries intended to bring users to the blockchain. We have combined the blockchain, entertainment and social media market into one beautiful piece. TUNEZ mobile app, a cryptocurrency wallet for mass adoption. We are appealing to people to use cryptocurrencies through what they like doing best. Almost everybody owing a mobile phone has a social media app and music player app on their mobile device. We are aiming to chip in a cryptocurrency wallet to every mobile device through TUNEZ app. We are also building an application for the unbanked as we would be integrating a faucet that pays you for your activities on our app in a decentralized manner in TUNEZ TOKENs. Artists get paid in a decentralized manner through a smart-contract for revenue generated by their music, we charge only 1% from them. Unlike other music store, artists on TUNEZ gets 99% of revenue generated by their music.  We have a working demo!!!! The Tunez team knows the requirements to run an ICO. As a modest team we have developed our MVP and it appears as a video on the site. Post-ICO, we would employ more developers to improve the UI/UX interface.  Watch the demo live in this video https://youtu.be/AbjePK7Hm3M   Tunez Platform Features:  THE TUNEZ DECENTRALIZED MUSIC PLAYER  Tunez music player is a fraction of what our application can do. We have implemented a pay to download and a pay to stream model. The model ensures that artist get maximum revenue from their music and we only charge 1% of their revenue. We are facilitating this via tunez tokens on the platform using smartcontracts in a decentralized manner.     TUNEZ CRYPTOCURRENCY WALLET  The wallet section of the TUNEZ App allows users to store, spend, receive, and transfer cryptocurrencies and tokens to their friends.     Tunez wallet facilitates the following:  1. Send, receive, and exchange cryptocurrencies (cryptocurrency amount and respective fiat currency value is clearly displayed with real-time exchange rates)  2. Check account balances  3.Transaction history and exchange rates.  4.Cold Storage of cryptocurrencies to ensure userâ€™s funds are safe.   TUNEZ DEBIT CARD   One of the things we would like to do to give our tokens more value is the Tunez debit cards. The biggest advantage of Tunez Card is making payment and using ATM to withdraw cash in any fiat currency at anywhere in the world, using cryptocurrencies.    TUNEZ GIFT CARD  We are also going to issue gift cards. Gift cards would be purchased in any tunez legalized store all around the world. Gift cards are generally redeemable only for purchases at the relevant retail premises and cannot be cashed out, and in some situations may be subject to an expiry date or fees.    TUNEZ SALESDROP ICO  The tunez team is a modest team. We know that part of the requirement for organizing an ICO is to have a minimum viable product that's why we have taken our time to develop a prototype of our platform. We are running the first sale drop ICO to further the development of the platform and foster partnerships with artists and brands. We would be attempting to partner with mobile phones manufacturers so that our app can be pre-installed on several mobile device from the manufacturers. We have a very low hard cap that is very sufficient enough to get us listed on five exchanges and develop and market the TUNEZ App.  Saledrop ICO starts: November 4th, 2018. Saledrop Ico Ends:    December 4th, 2018.   TUNEZ TOKEN METRICS   ALLOCATION OF TUNEZ TOKEN  Available for Sale drop ICO: 2 billion TUNEZ (83.33%).
