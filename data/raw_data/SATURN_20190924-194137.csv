Saturn Network is a protocol that allows access to a decentralized order book in just one transaction. Allowing decentralized exchanges to share a liquidity pool and feel the benefits of a much higher trading volume. It requires no deposits and runs completely on the blockchain, making it always accessible to everyone. Furthermore, it has been built with shared ownership in mind to ensure there are no imbalances of power: holding SATURN tokens means you are part of the Saturn DAO.  Saturn DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organisation) ensures our protocol is built for the people and governed by the people. We have chosen this path because it corrects any imbalance of power that developers or exchange owners have over a project. Once you buy SATURN tokens you will become an essential part of our development team. Changes to the protocol can only be made if you vote for them to happen with your tokens.    You can learn more about Saturn DAO in the following blog article:    The voting will be done via blockchain and enforced in the form of a smart contract. This means our protocol is 100% transparent and uncensorable, and once launched on the blockchain it can never be stopped or taken down. Your vote matters!  Scenarios of token use:  ● Change the default Exchange Fees. ● Payout Dividends (collected fees) to SATURN holders. ● Decentralized Loyalty Program (Exchange Mining).  We are currently discussing how the voting should happen & what Saturn DAO members will be able to vote on, please come and join in here.  To remain completely decentralized every chain that Saturn Protocol supports will have its own Saturn DAO and therefore its own Saturn tokens. Currently, we have a token on Ethereum & Ethereum Classic.
