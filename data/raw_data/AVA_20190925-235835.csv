I've tried to be as patient as possible but this is getting out of hand.  Like any good horror movie, things got off to a nervy start. Any momentum the ICO could have hoped to generate with its launch was stopped dead in its tracks when the website (and its pretty videos) was DDOSed, leaving people unable to contribute for some time after the official launch.  Disrespectfully to contributors, the terms of the ICO were then changed on two occasions: first by decreasing the minimum target, and second by increasing the period of time the ICO would run (notwithstanding that it was clear, at that stage, that the project wouldn't come anywhere close to reaching the soft-cap).  The refund process has been even more poorly managed than the ICO itself. Avalon/TokenLot had at least a week to prepare for the reality that refunds would need to occur but it felt like an unexpected pregnancy in Avaland when the deadline mercifully arrived after two weeks in which a total of about 3 people threw their lunch money at the project. A highlight (lowlight?) for the project in this time was the signing of convicted drug-cheat cage fighting champion, Jon Fitch, as an official sponsor. Move over Groupon  After the deadline passed, there was no official word about the refund process released in a timely fashion on the website, twitter, or on reddit. There was, eventually, a post made on this forum, albeit lacking specificity and clarity generally. The post set a deadline for refunds which wasn't honoured and foreshadows a 'phase 2 announcement', 'coming back huge', and we (apparently) 'won't want to miss out'. Needless to say, I'm giddy with excitement.  After not meeting the self-imposed timeline for refunds, there was further delay before any update was received. The team appeared to be tweeting people saying a refund would occur 'soon'.  Some contributors then received an email which advised that 'you have required action to get your refund processed' and that a refund address would need to be verified. No indication about how that verification process should occur was provided and so, causing apparent shock to the people down at Avaland, concerned contributors (presumably) provided their refund address via reply email. Despite advice that the refund would be processed 'as soon as' this information was received, this did not occur.  The next chapter in this sorry story was a further post on this forum advising that, surprise surprise, the TokenLot email address had been overloaded with refund requests and questions but that all refunds would now be processed 'at the very latest' by 10pm EST on Friday. It is left to assume that this was Friday, 6 October 2017, but why be specific when hundreds of thousands of dollars are being transacted internationally, right?  As at the current time - around 6pm EST - I have: verified the address, received no refund, and no reply to two emails sent to TokenLot. I genuinely cannot believe the Avalon squad thought they could manage a multi million dollar project which would be market disruptive.  I will sit here for the next 4 hours staring wistfully at the picture on Avalon's website of the project 'Treasurer and Financial Markets Expert' as he stares back at me with that moronic grin. Please sort this out.",False

As Avalon reaches the final hours of its crowdsale - we are fully prepared and equipped to refund all donors. In the last few weeks we have made some serious behind the scenes partnerships with large, institutional donors and notable crypto advisors. These partnerships were blown away at what Avalon was able to raise without an official partnership from a large donor; as we have been counselled, we have discovered that nearly all ICOs sell out with the aid from a large partnership/donor group. This is great news for Avalon going forward, as now we have both the interest and the education from large groups going forward. We know what to do and where to allocate resources and best of all, these entities are already aware of our project.  That being said, it is important that we close out this first ICO and get everyone a refund accordingly so we can come back strong with the second chapter of the Avalon book. In the next 24 hours, please be note the following things: 1. Refunds will begin once the clock strikes zero - and may take up to 72 business hours. 2. The refund will be issued to the refund address you provided when you donated. 3. You will not have to do anything on your end to activate the refund, this will happen automatically within the next 72 hours. 4. Any refunds that are not able to be processed (incorrect refund address, no refund address provided) will be handled on a case by case basis and there is no guarantee of a refund if you did not provide the correct refund address (per the donation terms of service). We will absolutely try and solve all issues, however, it's not technically feasible to guarantee 100% resolution. The window for a manual, case by case, refund is 30 days. After 30 days, refund support will conclude.  If you foresee any technical issues with your refund, please take the time now to reach out to Tokenlot at Avalon@tokenlot.com  For all of those who supported Avalon Please remember we raised nearly 500k in cryptocurrencies with little to no large donor partnerships! Avalon will be back and we’d love to have your support for the second launch! All bounties have been recorded and will be honored if and when Avalon materializes with a token/cryptocurrency in circulation at later date. As of the end of this first crowdsale, NO (AVA) tokens will be in circulation in any capacity! The original 10million AVA tokens are safe and secure and ready for whatever comes next.  We appreciate you! We, as well as our new advisors were absolutely floored by the amount of support we received and we take this as a future barometer of Avalon’s bright future. As we prepare for the second chapter of Avalon’s funding - we will still be working daily to add new partners, vendors, ambassadors, advisors and features to Avalon. The development of the Avalon platform and business does not stop in this downtime!   In conclusion: Be sure to sign up to our newsletter, continue following our socials and bookmark our website. When we come back with the phase 2 announcement, we will be coming back huge and you won’t want to miss out.  Warm regards, The Avalon Team",False

For those of you here since the beginning of our ICO you may have noticed some irregularities in the initial days of the crowd-sale. Unfortunately, we were experiencing a DDOS attack heavily during the initial opening that extended periodically throughout the weekend (as well as some clerical concerns that led to incorrect listing times on notable ICO calendar sites). This complicated a crucial window in our crowd-sale’s progress. We’ve also received an incredible amount of e-mails and private messages from the community expressing their concerns about the now shortened length of the ICO window due to the aforementioned reasons.  After speaking with some newly interested political and VC advisors, they have counseled us to counter these incidents and to rectify the situation and to allow time for some very exciting announcements. Furthermore: we have elected to extend the ICO for an additional 15 days, ending officially on the 30th of September.   Despite these events, Avalon has recently breached the 1000 Ether mark!!   An exciting development in our potential coin supply:    We are slashing the potential circulating tokens!  To our valued contributors, that managed to donate early we’ve decided to reward those of you who have been here since the start; we would also like to announce that the tokens sold in this crowdsale will be the only ones ever sold! Any unclaimed tokens in Avalon’s ICO window that ends on the 30th with be slashed and burned, potentially reducing the supply and increasing the scarcity of any tokens claimed!  1. Avalon is excited that the right eyes are seeing our project! We’re dedicated to promoting businesses, assisting consumers and contributing to the implementation of digital currency in our society and this kind of responsivity is always nice to see.      2. Within the next few days Avalon will be announcing an additional large partnership/advisor!  3. We are diligently preparing the beginnings of our platform and aim to be able to display its functionality in the very near future. You can already view our demo HERE - however, a walkthrough video will be posted navigating around the user interface that will be built out around the demo. We’re excited to give you a virtual tour of our future navigation!   Additional Details:  In the rare event that the minimum threshold is not met, every single donor will have the option of receiving a full refund. Every single donor who entered their information properly has their tokens locked in escrow with TokenLot LLC and will absolutely be refunded if needed - this will never change.

As Avalon reaches the final hours of its crowdsale - we are fully prepared and equipped to refund all donors. In the last few weeks we have made some serious behind the scenes partnerships with large, institutional donors and notable crypto advisors. These partnerships were blown away at what Avalon was able to raise without an official partnership from a large donor; as we have been counselled, we have discovered that nearly all ICOs sell out with the aid from a large partnership/donor group. This is great news for Avalon going forward, as now we have both the interest and the education from large groups going forward. We know what to do and where to allocate resources and best of all, these entities are already aware of our project.  That being said, it is important that we close out this first ICO and get everyone a refund accordingly so we can come back strong with the second chapter of the Avalon book. In the next 24 hours, please be note the following things: 1. Refunds will begin once the clock strikes zero - and may take up to 72 business hours. 2. The refund will be issued to the refund address you provided when you donated. 3. You will not have to do anything on your end to activate the refund, this will happen automatically within the next 72 hours. 4. Any refunds that are not able to be processed (incorrect refund address, no refund address provided) will be handled on a case by case basis and there is no guarantee of a refund if you did not provide the correct refund address (per the donation terms of service). We will absolutely try and solve all issues, however, it's not technically feasible to guarantee 100% resolution. The window for a manual, case by case, refund is 30 days. After 30 days, refund support will conclude.  If you foresee any technical issues with your refund, please take the time now to reach out to Tokenlot at Avalon@tokenlot.com  For all of those who supported Avalon Please remember we raised nearly 500k in cryptocurrencies with little to no large donor partnerships! Avalon will be back and we’d love to have your support for the second launch! All bounties have been recorded and will be honored if and when Avalon materializes with a token/cryptocurrency in circulation at later date. As of the end of this first crowdsale, NO (AVA) tokens will be in circulation in any capacity! The original 10million AVA tokens are safe and secure and ready for whatever comes next.  We appreciate you! We, as well as our new advisors were absolutely floored by the amount of support we received and we take this as a future barometer of Avalon’s bright future. As we prepare for the second chapter of Avalon’s funding - we will still be working daily to add new partners, vendors, ambassadors, advisors and features to Avalon. The development of the Avalon platform and business does not stop in this downtime!   In conclusion: Be sure to sign up to our newsletter, continue following our socials and bookmark our website. When we come back with the phase 2 announcement, we will be coming back huge and you won’t want to miss out.  Warm regards, The Avalon Team",False

In exchange for there service, typically the GPO will generate its revenue in either membership dues, administrative fees tacked onto member's orders, or in some cases both.  I personally have been lucky enough in my past positions to work alongside 3 of the 5 largest healthcare GPOs in the United States, and although they occasionally dip there toes in other revenue streams, the bulk of their business model relies on acting as facilitator/negotiator of best pricing, they tend to shy away from distribution and other tangible, high-over head thing, and the GPO business model is a very healthy one at present.  I'd love to discuss in further, if you want to PM me we can meet up on Skype or Telegram!   - Colin from Avalon",False
