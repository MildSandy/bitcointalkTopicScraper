The website refers to Rothfield as the “leading force behind the experiential design of the WatermelonBlock app suite.” He’s launched businesses before and has a penchant for “creating communities … around empowering millennials.” Sonia Miles-Khan is COO and an alum of blockchain-friendly financial firm EY. Verdict WatermelonBlock has the potential to resonate with both newbie and experienced traders alike, given its access to real-time data analytics based on the crypto community. The website could be a little cumbersome to navigate, particularly the team section, but the overall project has the potential to strike a chord with retail consumers. Its use of AI and its access to the IBM supercomputer stand to give it an edge over other projects, but there are also other ways for novice investors to trade. Risks     Technology. The WatermelonBlock (WMB) token is an ERC20 based asset, while the company’s products will be built on the NEM blockchain. As a result, there is an increased chance for a malfunction in either of those technologies to impact either the ecosystem. (-2)     Competition. There are other options for novice investors looking to trade like an expert. eToro exchange, for instance, lets investors copy the investment portfolio of successful traders without having to make their own decisions if they don’t want to. (-0.5)     The app remains under development and isn’t expected to be unveiled until Q4 2018. While this is a common feature of ICOs, that doesn’t diminish the risk of possible delays for one reason or another (think Tezos ICO). Also, as is the case for most innovation, there’s no precedent to determine the effectiveness of the data analytics tool, no success stories from average traders who have made successful investment decisions from the app. (-0.5) Growth Opportunity     Key partnership. WatermelonBlock has inked a partnership with Big Blue, otherwise known as IBM, to access the AI and the Watson supercomputer. This is a boon for any startup, especially one that’s looking to win investor trust.  Both sides seem similarly enthusiastic to work with one another. (+4)     Technology. AI is underrated and is likely to grab more of the tech spotlight in the coming decade. WatermelonBlock’s focus on AI now positions the project for long-term success and gives it a key advantage over its peers.

WEBPAGE | MEDIUM | TELEGRAM | FACEBOOK | TWITTER | YOUTUBE | WHITELIST | REDDIT  WHITEPAPER  WHITELIST NOW!       A New World In a world full of data and new opportunities, making the right decisions about cryptocurrency and ICO investment at the right time requires keeping a constant eye on markets. While many skilled investors spend day and night researching and analyzing their portfolio choices, millions of retail consumers are looking for trustworthy insights.  WatermelonBlock is designed with retail consumers in mind, making cryptocurrency and ICO investment simple enough to fit any lifestyle by leveraging the power of big data and Artificial Intelligence.  Without knowing the sentiment of the market, investors are missing crucial information required to make informed, accurate investment decisions. This is why WatermelonBlock collates technical and social big data sets in real-time. WatermelonBlock applies specialized criteria to: Discern the tone and credibility of media sources and authors. Factor in their level of influence on the market. Identify and weigh opinions based on the credibility of their market influence.   Why Blockchain? Providing seamless trading to a high volume market requires technology that can handle large throughput and constant scaling whilst providing assured data integrity.  WatermelonBlock Tokens (WMB) are built on the NEM platform, leveraging its track record for robust and scalable blockchain architecture. The WatermelonBlock Token (WMB) is a utility token used purely to pay for optional premium products made available under Phase I implementation, in addition to products available under Phase II implementation, including trades using WatermelonBot.  NEM blockchain is the perfect complement to the WatermelonBlock network, as it provides low latency scalability, secure decentralizaton and is based on the same blockchain that global banks use. WatermelonBlock utilizes a closed group of nodes deployed across enterprize infrastructure services. Record credibility at node level is of key importance to WatermelonBlock in making sure all investor data and transaction values are secure. The NEM Consensus Protocol ensures that WatermelonBlock’s blockchain can provide adaptive record security at all times.[size]   How does the WatermelonBlock Technology work? WatermelonBlock’s business logic and algorithms leverage the IBM Watson AI platform.  In Phase I, Watson gathers mass social big data, such as opinions surrounding cryptocurrency topics and issues, to score cryptocurrencies and ICO investment data in order to provide summarized insights for investors and traders.  In Phase II, WatermelonBlock will utilize machine learning in conjunction with generated data to help predict market outlooks.

It's currently in Private Sale and soon in public pre-sale. Meaning it's still in very early stages, and the ICO date has yet to be announced.  You're right Twitter is salty right now & the market has been in a long bearish situation. Afraid I cannot speculate on the future, price wise. However, I can predict the team will continue to work extremely hard and focus on their roadmap, while our marketing efforts spread the word. Check out watermelonblock.io and find out roadmap! Please, let me know what you think.

Thank you Samle! I'm glad you find it interesting. WatermelonBlock has launched an Earndrop campaign that you can join the earn tokens, it's like a bounty, but much easier as everything is automated, meaning you will not have to submit your stakes every week anymore.  WMB Tokens are $0.116 each excluding bonuses.

Just asking, since right now I suppose 1 ETH is not much, but who knows at the end of the year.  Hi Ludootje, I'm afraid I don't know the future minimum contributions for the ICO. The ICO date and bonuses have yet to be announced, and a minimum could always change if a team decides to do so. However, looking at the current available information there's no expectation of changing this.  Regardless of the $ value of 1 ETH, 1 ETH remains 1 ETH right!

As you can see in the bottom of the announcement thread, the team has chosen to go for an Earndrop campaign instead of a bounty campaign.  A bounty campaign is very similar to an Earndrop campaign, however the Earndrop platform has many benefits that made it more interesting.  For example for users: - Users will only have to create an Earndrop account once to be able to participate in all listed Earndrop campaigns - Userse will only have to configure this account once (meaning one-time verification & only have to submit your public wallet address once) - Your stakes are submitted automatically using APIs of your social media channels, so you will not have to submit this anymore & the team will not have to hire a bounty manager anymore who has to keep track of it (meaning no errors either)  There's more benefits, which you can find when you register to participate in the WatermelonBlock Earndrop campaign earndrop.io <- On top of that, there's a referral program as well for the Earndrop platform, so you can earn extra tokens for referring people to Earndrop!

What do you like most so far?  Quote from: lukikato on June 30, 2018, 01:52:37 PM WatermelonBlock is a project with a unique name and has a good concept, but I want to ask if this project has special features?  Thank you! It sure has! WatermelonBlock will create an app with both free-to-use and premium functions. So, as you've read WatermelonBlock will help you to get access to an easy overview of the market sentiment in cryptocurrency and ICOs, and gives you scores based on this sentiment on how the market will most likely react. Additionally, the WatermelonBlock TradingBot will allow you to invest automatically in cryptocurrency using AI, based on your personal preferences.
