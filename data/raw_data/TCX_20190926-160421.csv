WEBSITE | WHITEPAPER | BOUNTY        The Tiberius Coin (‚ÄúT-Coin‚Äù) is the first crypto-financial product which grants you direct ownership to a basket of strategic metals that are key to future technologies. Tokens act like ownership receipts for an identical allocation and quantity of metals. The metal is held and audited by independent warehouses, and available for delivery on request.  We only mint tokens after the metal has been independently audited, so you know that it corresponds to existing material and thus the token price can never hit zero. The Tiberius Coin has all the upside of technology markets, but none of the downside of bitcoin. This composition has been specified to optimise the risk profile, volatility, and storage costs of the underlying basket. We firmly believe this basket to be one which outperforms over the medium term, as the implementation of new technologies such as robotics, drones, and wearable technology becomes more prevalent. Investors in cryptocurrencies are by their very nature forward looking, and we see the technology metals growth story as being a key driver. In terms of the Electric Vehicle/EV play, we have already seen a great appreciation of key battery metals (notably cobalt) and much of the future growth projections for other base metals (notably nickel and aluminium) incorporate a view which sees much more demand stemming from Technology and Electric Vehicle proliferation. Stability metals have been chosen to lower the storage costs and decrease volatility. The usage of gold also provides enhanced liquidity and rotection against currency risk.   Asset-backed Cryptocurrency with an actual intrinsic value. 1 Token is equal to and can be exchange for metals in its basket:      The Goal:  To create a low-volatility stable coin, 100% backed up by tech metals used in Electric vehicles, IOT and Space Engineering.   Value:  Based on the current prices of metals in Tiberius basket, each token intrinsic value is approximately 0.70 USD as of Q3 2018. Given the market use of these metals, experts predict rise of metal prices in the basket by over 120% in the next 5 years. Which means, slow and guaranteed rise in value of Tiberius coin, marking it low-volatility stable crypto currency.   The Team:  Project is led by Tiberius Group, Swiss commodities asset manager with over US$ 3bn in assets under management founded in 2005.   Regulations:  Tiberius Asset Management and Tiberius Coin are fully regulated by FINMA (Switzerland).   Exchanges:  Tiberius Coin has an agreement with Lykke, Swiss complaint crypto-exchange, is in place to start trading after Token Issuance in Q4, 2018 Notable Advisors: Phillip Zimmerman is the creator of the first large-scale public key cryptography system. Stuart Prior- Fintech veteran with over 20 years corporate experience, an advisor for Zilliqua.   Interesting Facts:  Not a single dollar from an ICO will go to the team or for development of technology. Every coin including bounty allocation is minted by purchasing metals in the basket and is fully backed-up with metal assets.       Benefits of investing into Tiberius Coin:          Secure & Stable  You can‚Äôt fool the blockchain. Tiberius Coin uses smart contracts that allow  it to  function like digital cash. This means less risk, less speculation, and an easy way to invest in technology. Zero is impossible with Tiberius Coin.

Crypto and blockchain is way more than trustless systems. I agree that it's about trustless systems  BUT its also about independence, stability, sustainability and a robust legal protection. This is important, and it seems like most of the people forget that. Of course trustless system is cool, but what about the other features? Can I safe my pension in a coin which is subject to 100% volatility? Can I put all my savings into a coin that is shut down for some reason the next day?  Metal on the blockchain offers the following things 1. Trustless: All on the blockchain, everything traceable and reconciled by the network. 2. Stability: Because our coin bears an tangible asset the volatility is capped around 10% (way more stable). 3. Sustainability: Most of the project that i've seen do not offer a sustainable business model. Our structure is from that angle almost ""unique"" compared to most other ICO's. 4. Legal protection: You can have lengthy discussions about whats a security or whats a derivative or whether bitcoin shall be treated as a commodity. In our case its even more simpler. We sell metals, thats its. The coin identifies you, however, the purchase and sales agreement between you and us is about the metal we sell. The metal belongs to you. We as a service provide store it, but - and thats important - it doesn't belong to us. The aspect of having these information on the blockchain makes it so convenient because thru the blockchain everything is on your phone....no need to store 25 tons of copper in your backyard. The blockchain confirms you a legal owner and no one can change that.  Last but not least, the fact that our coin is subject to a volatility around 10% is very interesting from a investment point of view. Not so much from that perspective of getting rich very quickly but rather from that angle of fighting inflation. Metal are the best protection against hyper inflation and although a lot of people think that bitcoin is the solution for everything, they forgot that a billion people suffer from currency devaluation and high inflation. So offering them a ""trustless"" and decentralized coin with a 100% volatility - with a valuation based on ....nothing but the perception of the community - is not helping them. This is not a solution. The can't do LITERALLY NOTHING with that type of coin. On one hand they lose more than 50% per year in their local currency and on the other they have 20% swings a day.  Remember one thing, we're not here to replace any existing cryptocurrency, we're here to offer an additional new type of product category. We're more than convinced that as of now the Tiberius Coin might be the only product which offers all these features.",False
