Studies have shown that in the US 1 in every 3 Americans does not trust charities. (Perry, 2015)   These non-profit organizations do not see the uncertainty of public trust as something that will affect their business‚Äô financial models. As a result, donations will potentially fall even more making it increasingly difficult to regain trust once it is lost.  Transparency is a major link to trust. By being transparent with their operations, priorities and financial expenses, charities show the public that they are honest and allow donors to engage more actively in the process.  üëçüèª THE SOLUTION  Trust and transparency have to be restored. And this is where the solution of the problem comes in and promises to completely revolutionize the nonprofit sector.  The introduction of Smart Contracts through the Blockchain does not only offer full transparency for all donors but also cuts down the intermediary costs and is much faster to process.  Transactions made on the blockchain are recorded on the public ledger, which is distributed across hundreds of thousands of computers for anyone, including the donors, to see and verify.   üîß   ABOUT THE PLATFORM & TOKEN   ClearAid is a digital platform that aims to connect the non-profit community through an easy-to-use interface which allows full transparency and traceability of donations made on the blockchain.  The platform is supported by an ERC20 token, named CAID, which is based on the Ethereum blockchain and serves as the donation method of the ClearAid platform.  You can read the whitepaper here.  Here is great and playful video, that perfectly describes our goals and vision.  üí∞   CROWDSALE OVERVIEW   ‚Ä¢   Maximum supply: 100,000,000 CAID ‚Ä¢   Pre-Sale and ICO supply: 50,000,000 CAID ‚Ä¢   Token price: 1 CAID = $0,15-$0,24 ‚Ä¢   Soft cap: $1,770,000 ‚Ä¢   Hard cap: $8,850,000  Bellow, you will find more information regarding the Pre-sale and ICO of ClearAid. Even though CAID is an ERC20 token, ClearAid has decided to set the softcap and hardcap in a representation of $USD. This is due to the fact that Ethereum has seen a lot of volatility in the year 2018. If the softcap is not reached, all contributions will be refunded.  üí∏   PRE-SALE  In total, 15,000,000 CAID will be sold for $0.15/CAID with minimum purchase being set at 1 ETH.  Pre-sale will start on July 7th, 2018 and will end whenever the hard cap is reached. We expect this to be within 24-48 hours. Tokens acquired during the Pre-sale will be distributed immediately and will be transferable as soon as the ICO ends. How to buy CAID tokens ‚Äì The official guide.  üîÉ   ICO  The ICO of ClearAid will start on July 17, 2018 and will end on July 29, 2018 or whenever the hard cap is reached. There will be 3 consecutive rounds where the tokens will gradually increase in price value and decrease in bonus. Therefore, the earlier you decide to purchase, the more tokens you will be able to receive.
