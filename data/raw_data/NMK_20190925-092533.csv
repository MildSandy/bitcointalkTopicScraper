NAMEK is an ICO provider & services oriented company, that makes ICO for other organizations. They create a blockchain solution as requested by collecting all the requirements, and they promote projects through their growing community with Airdrops and Bounty programs.  One of the aims through this project is rewarding users with tokens and tokenizing the current business model of  the company, helping startups and entrepreneurs using the Blockchain technology and leveraging on it to strengthen their cause.  Crypto economy, ICOs and Airdrops  The crypto economy refers to everything related to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. Bounty programs are a way to earn cryptocurrencies before the ICO and without investing any money. Because Blockchain startups are looking for people to enhance their ICOs and product, Namek is a way to get involved in an ICO project with an ICO team and get paid for your work. Networking, translation, coding, early adopters... and much more! This whole new world may seem complicated for a newcomer, but don't worry, We provide advices and training for free. First read the docs, and feel free to contact us if you have any questionsüòÑ   Crypto revolution is coming   We believe in a new economy based on a fresh type of currency with a radically different meaning for what we call ‚Äúmoney‚Äù. Nowadays, startups can create their own currencies and this new capability supports further economic advancement. The new process enables us to distinguish the ‚Äòcurrency‚Äô from its ‚Äòvalue‚Äô. This way we can build the currency here and now as the smart carrier of a future value to be generated based on a well-defined project. We believe in a world where everybody can design and implement project ideas by searching and building the right team at the right time. As startup founders, we would like our projects to go as far as possible. To make such big plans feasible, co-founders need to hire more people to join the project from the very start. Often they need a small crowd to pump the project with right momentum and the right impulse.  Nowadays with Blockchain, Smart Contracts and financial technologies such as cryptocurrencies, we can handle the whole process with an unprecedented efficiency. Namek is the way to recruit and compensate a host of motivated people as effortless as a cakewalk.
