I've got some news for the community and feedback!  Firstly, on the 22nd of December, we updated the pre-alpha server with the first round of major bug fixes! We're currently listening to the communities feedback on gameplay and squashing more bugs!  Secondly, Hash Rush has started its own forums! We are using Discourse as our forum software, and whilst it's currently mainly aimed at the pre-alpha squad, fans of the game can register accounts already. We are still working to make it look fancier and work better so we're open to suggestions. Check out the forums here.   Feedback time: @dspencer, that's one way of looking at it. But to give a better explanation. Every game round there is a pool of #crypto that is given to the game, this is based on how many players are playing. Players earn their share of the total crypto-pool based on how much in-game crystals they mine. You can read more about it in our project update entry  @wgd, thanks for bringing that up! We are totally aware of the need for more videos and a much wider marketing, quite a lot of the HR team have a really big background in gaming! The reason that there is nothing out there just yet is mainly because there is not much ready to show just yet. The ICO was the our fundraiser and that was completed successfully only 2 months ago (October). The pre-alpha is out now, but that was a fundraiser promise to the larger backers to really give them proof that we are giving life to this game. However, whilst our progress is really great and we're going ahead on schedule, we are not at a stage where we should start to involve the press/larger media outlets. If we did so now, we would burn the hype out far too quickly, so whilst people will be ultra excited 'now' by the time the game launches properly (Q3 2018) a lot of that hype and excitement would have died away. The entire Hash Rush team are working like mad to make this game succeed, and with that, we do know the importance of a proper marketing campaign. There will be one, that I can promise, but when the time is right",False

We're doing our best to solve all outstanding issues (mainly Social Media), and obviously we are working day and night on the actual project itself; progress has been quite awesome and we'll give you a recap in this post!

We are planning a major clean up of our threads (I've mentioned this before) but we hit a small roadblock so for now. That said it should be resolved soon and in the meantime I'll be replying on our existing threads.  Hash Rush News The best way for you to stay up to date with all of our progress would be best to follow us on Steemit @hashrushgame or on Medium @Hash_Rush.  The highlights of what we accomplished in the last month: October 25th: After a long count up, we got the final figures for the ICO fundraiser, it came to $1.83 million. November 10th: We announced the Pre-Alpha along with who qualifies for instant access. More info here November 15th: We announced a special competition where players can win one of 10 places in the Pre-Alpha. The top 5 winners will also get a Hash Rush branded T-shirt. More info here November 20th: The first of our Exchanges was announced: Etherdelta. There will be more in the future but this is the starting place that we needed! This has allowed people to begin buying and selling RC. More info here  Along with the above listed articles we have interviews with various members of our team and articles on how we develop our in-game concepts; taking you through the steps from playing around with a basic idea to developing an actual concept.  Future Events: Pre-Alpha and your first look at the actual game. From then on we'll be giving you a lot more actual in-game footage and you will be able to follow our progress much better!  Some notes on the Pre-Alpha People who directly qualify for this are: Everyone who participated in our pre-sale. Anyone who participated in our ICO during the first three days — between 20 September 20:00 UTC and 23 September 20:00 UTC. The 10 winners from our competition will also get access.  Regarding Rush Coin (RC) in the Pre-Alpha We are not planning to have any RC spending or crypto earning in the pre-alpha (remember that RC is going to serve as the in-game currency for Hash Rush). The purpose of the pre-alpha is to allow people to see the early gameplay and get a first experience of starting, growing and managing your Ernack colony. Additionally, we are looking to get feedback from the players to see what they think of the game, what they felt was good, what they felt needs improvement and general suggestions.  That's all for now, if you have any questions on the game, the team or Rush Coin just ask and I'll get you an answer!",False

If you'd like come over to our Discord server and meet some of our community members and the other members of the Hash Rush team!  About the minimum cap and ICO questions. There is no minimum cap, what siddartha1492 wrote was correct (he's in our discord server, you should join too). The funds that Hash Rush has acquired so far has been great, obviously the more the better, but even if things were to end right now with no change we'd be in a strong position. The % bar that you see on the website simple indicates how far from the hard cap the ICO stands.  Also for the record, bdstar is no longer working with Hash Rush (nothing negative involved there so no worries). If you wish to contact the Hash Rush team outside of the forum posts then please do so via a private message to this account, or as we always say join our Discord server to talk to the team and the community directly!

We currently only have the capacity to respond to messages in and around European business hours, but will be expanding our hours very soon. The success of the pre-sale has allowed us to grow our team considerably, with one of the open roles for a dedicated community manager. We're well aware that without this key role, some of our channels (including this Bitcoin talk thread, unfortunately) may not get the attention they deserve at the moment. Like some posters have mentioned, the best way to reach us and get a quick response is to contact us on our official Discord server at https://discord.gg/y6f64c  2. As mentioned, we are hiring for the role of community manager and you can find that listing here if you're interested to apply, or know someone who may be suitable: http://jobs.gamesindustry.biz/sia-hash-rush/anywhere/community-manager-for-upcoming-rts-cryptocurrency-mining-title-id93614  3. We are aware that some users who participated in the pre-sale with less than the minimum amounts may not have received their tokens yet. The pre-sale had minimum entry thresholds and because we did have users coming in below those minimums, it was decided that those participants would receive their tokens and their 20% bonus as per the first three days of the ICO. However, this has slowed a few things down as we sort out everyone's allocation. We're dealing with every case as they come in and we do apologize if you are still waiting on confirmation, or replies to your emails. Again, coming in to Discord may help, as our team are generally online during working hours.  4. We're not yet set up with but are in the process of getting full-time support staff to help with all of your queries. We ask that you please bear with us while we go through this process of rapid growth. The way we're seeing it from our side is: you guys have shown your belief in our project and have made this all possible with your contributions. Only 4 days in and you've already backed us to a level that many Kickstarter projects haven't even achieved, and we're extremely grateful and humbled by the overwhelming support and interest shown in Hash Rush, and are now doing all we can to bring on additional team members and make this game the best it can possibly be.  5. As for the money raised to date, the most recent figure of Rush Coin tokens (RC) sold is displayed on the progress bar at https://www.hashrush.com/ico/ and currently stands at 3,766,620 RC. Please note that this is currently manually updated as we have multiple wallets in multiple currencies, and work through some tickets to verify certain transactions. At a rate of 1000 RC to 1 ETH, you can always divide that figure by 1000 and compare to the current ETH price.  6. Some ICO participants are saying that they have not received their RC yet, but upon investigation, every case so far has been resolved and is usually due to the type of wallet used. As a reminder, never participate in an ICO with a wallet on an exchange. If you're still having trouble seeing your RC in your Ethereum wallet, please drop by to our Discord channel and either one of the Hash Rush team or one of our awesome community members are there to help.  Thanks again for your patience, and of course for your support - I'll be checking in here more regularly now that I see how active the thread is!",False

I only received only 1.5 RC token?? Another issue is on the ICO site you did not clearly list a minimum investment amount of 50 ETH. Etherscan shows multiple purchases below that amount because you didn't clearly list it? It should show that as a message before anyone makes a purchase. I only made a small investment of 1.5 ETH and noticed the minimum after the fact. According to Etherscan It appears only three people caught the message of a minimum buy.

Think of it as Age of Empires with a huge twist: All the ore you mine, you get to keep.  At its heart, Hash Rush is an RTS game — the goal is to conquer the galaxy, by building, maintaining and expanding your colony.  But what makes Hash Rush unique is its focus on cryptocurrency mining. Over the last year or so, we have developed an Ethereum-based crypto token called Rush Coin (RC). Rush Coin is the main currency of Hash Rush.  Players can get Rush Coin in four ways:     ▮ Mining the in-game Crypto Crystals    ▮Exchanging items and units with other players    ▮Swapping currencies with other token holders    ▮Completing specific missions  Once you got a hold on some Rush Coins, you can use them for in-game transactions. Spend Rush Coin to upgrade your colony, fend off natural disasters or create more miners — it’s your choice.  Hash Rush official Trailer   Trading valuable items  Hash Rush comes with a trading system used for trading valuable items. This allows you to sell unwanted items and get some Rush Coins in return.  So how does this work?  Well, Hash Rush comes with a variety of items, which may help your miners, engineers and prospectors to do their job better. For instance, binoculars allow your prospectors to look farther and reveal more territory.  Every unit and item a player buys or receives, comes with a card. These cards are tradable. Once you own a card, you also gain its perks.  A strong pick axe provides a miner with more mining power  For instance, this card provides the holder with extra mining power. But this is just one example. We are planning on releasing a variety of cards that provide different perks. Some are common, and others will be more unique (and more valuable).  Trading simply brings another dimension to the Hash Rush game. As you can see, there are many ways to earn Rush Coins — and many reasons to keep playing.  Participating in the Hash Rush project & Rush Coins ICO   We truly believe Hash Rush will be a great game. But with all that said, we need the participation of the wider crypto and gaming communities to make this project into a success.  There are three ways to take part in the Hash Rush project. First, you can join our Hash Rush mining pool later this year. Should you choose to mine with us, you will receive in-game bonuses and Rush Coins on top of your normal payout in ETH.  Second, we have are currently launching the Hash Rush PR Campaign. Participate in this campaign using Facebook, Twitter or the blog of your choice. Active participation will be rewarded with real Rush Coins, so make sure to take a look!  Third, this September we are organizing our Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and pre-ICO. This means you can purchase the first (ERC-20 compliant) Rush Coins.  You will be able to purchase RC with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) or Ethereum Classic (ETC). The initial conversion rate is 1000 RC for every 1 ETH, and the advantages of purchasing Rush Coins during the (pre-)ICO are:    ▮ Beta access to the Hash Rush game   ▮ Choose your own faction without waiting in queue   ▮ Get special in-game titles, badges and tradable cards   ▮ Receive a Rush Coin conversion rate bonus of up to 25%   Token Launch Details  The Hash Rush ICO will run from 20:00 UTC on September 20, 2017 to 20:00 UTC on October 20, 2017 unless a cap of 64,050,000 RC tokens sold is reached earlier. You can participate in the ICO with ETH, BTC, ETC, QTUM.   Distribution and Rates   Early Bird Discount    ▮ RC can be acquired with BTC, ETH, QTUM or ETC by participating in the ICO that will take place from  September 20, 2017 to 20:00 UTC to October 20, 2017  ▮ Transfers can be made from any BTC, ETH, QTUM or ETC wallet.  ▮ The minimum Token Launch entry is 0.1 ETH.  ▮ On  December 1, 2017, RC tokens will be issued to participants Ethereum addresses automatically.  ▮ Original  payments  made  in BTC and ETC will  be  converted  to ETH  at the rate effective at the time when the rights to RC tokens     were  reserved.  RC  coins  will  be  sent  to  the  Ethereum  address  that will be provided in the contact form or by e-mail.
