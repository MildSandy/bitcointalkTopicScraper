Take products as an example, customers rely heavily on the reviews and ratings of the products on a marketplace to make decisions on their shopping choices. Therefore it is important to prevent people from manipulating the review system and encourage genuine reviews from verified buyers. To accomplish this, ApolloX reputation protocol is created to reward authentic reviews and penalize fraudulent reviews.  When ApolloX Reputation Protocol confirms a review as fraudulent, the reviewer will be punished by losing a certain amount of ApolloX tokens and be prohibited from posting future reviews. Below is a brief explanation of the lifecycle of a review posted on ApolloX network.  1.Buyers are invited to post reviews for their purchases once the delivery has been confirmed. 2.Buyers are promised a small amount of tokens (3 APXT) as compensations for verified reviews from the ApolloX marketplace. They are also told that a small amount of tokens (3 APXT) will be lost if their reviews are determined as fraudulent. 3. The review is processed by the automated review filtering algorithm and examined by a randomly selected committee if necessary to determine their status as verified, unknown , or fraudulent. 4. Only verified reviews will be made public and received a rewards token. Unknown reviews will be discarded. And fraudulent reviewer will receive warnings.  For more details on how our reputation protocol as well as how the review moderator committee system works. Please checkout the chapter about Reputation Protocol in our whitepaper.",False
