Your comment led to a rather difficult but, hopefully, productive discussion within our team.  Concerning the date of pre-ICO. Despite the complexity of this solution, we decided to postpone the start of the pre-ICO on 26 February.  Regarding the 11 page whitepaper. In the near future, we will complete and publish an updated and more detailed document.  Now about the lack of links to the founders' profiles. The problem is that our founders are representatives of the real sector of the economy, who simply did not use social networks. Initially, we decided not to create new profile pages for them, that this will be regarded as negative. We still believe this is the right decision, but in the near future we will add information on the founders on our website.",False

Anyone can post information about the goods. The owners of the token can vote on this information, determining the quality of the descriptions (from 0 to 10). The best description is published, and its author receives a portion of the revenue for the product in the form of tokens.  Information on the goods will be presented in the form of structured data, almost immediately ready for use, including for SEO. The information on the goods will be available free of charge under the license CC-BY, i.e. any (including commercial) use of this information will be allowed, provided that a link to its source is published.  On the product description page, proposals for buying it can be placed. These offers are paid by the sellers, and the price of the initial placement is the equivalent of 1 USD for one product per month. The offers are displayed based on the user's location, and in order of decreasing the placement price. Thus, natural leveling of prices is achieved depending on demand, and limiting the location avoids artificial competition.  The authors of the descriptions receive up to 10% (depends on description quality) of the income received from the offerings for the goods.  Holders of the token receive regular payments on income, after 12 months from the beginning of the ICO. The percentage and regularity of payments is determined by an open vote of the holders of the token before the first payment.",False
