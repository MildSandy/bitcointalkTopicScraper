Bountie will come in as a sponsor and try to get Bountie tokens used in their dojos  Verdict Overall revenue for eSports is expected to reach $700 million this year and then grow to $1.5 billion by 2020. Bountie will primarily target the Asia gaming market, which makes up almost half of the world market. China alone is responsible for a quarter of all revenues in 2017. These projections, however, mean little to token holders unless the Bountie platform gets adopted.  Risks     This will be on the Ethereum blockchain, which means it could be a year or more before the platform is fully functioning. -1     The eSports industry is really new, and there are already lots of startups and current players to compete with. -1     The ease of adoption might not be there with this project. For example, you need referees in order to confirm who wins the tournaments.  -1     The best part of this project is their stated partnership with Twitch. However, there is no official announcement on this partnership. When we asked the telegram channel for some sort of evidence, our question got passed along and then dodged. When we do get confirmation, this analysis will be updated. -0.5     According to their road map, there’s supposed to already be a demo out of their platform. Their Telegram spokesmen says its still in development and will be out in a couple weeks.– 1  Growth Potential     The Twitch and MSI partnerships are huge. +4     According to their chief marketer, Daniel, the Bountie website received over 162,000 page views and 53,075 new visitors.

I also read many free tournaments and events with good rewards. And also first opened will go directly to the user market asia and related to streaming platforms like twitch.

We have been working really hard leading up to our ICO.  Bountie began in July 2017 and amongst everything that we have achieved thus far, we are happy that we have our idea and blueprint being made in the progress. Building on our life long dream where gamers get paid doing what they love. We want to make sure that our upcoming app and its subsequent iterations and ideas go off without so much as a hitch. We are humbled by everyone’s support for our bold-yet-crazy idea.  But here’s the thing: reality kicks in. Hard. Moments after our pre-sale started, we had noticed some hitches and kinks in the system popping up. Even the best-laid plans can turn south. No matter how much planning is done, sometimes these things happen. Specifically, we were noticing some egregious quirks in our current whitelisting process.  Bountie opted for stringent vetting by processing our Whitelist and KYC investors manually. We noticed errors while whitelisting ETH addresses during this process.  Because of this, we have decided to re-open our pre-sale period on 11 June 2018, 12pm. We are truly sorry that this has happened, and we take full responsibility for these series of events.  Do take note that yes, we are still active and we are still hard at work building the Bountie platform as we speak, while also keeping our community, website, and blog active. We’ll make full use of the additional time to debug and make sure everything will work as intended. On top of that, we will be launching our MVP in the coming weeks!  Once again, we thank you for your undying support and we deeply apologize for this sudden turn of events.  Finally a quote from Mark Twain - “you are never wrong to do the right thing”.  - Team Bountie",False

Thank you for your inquiry.  Bountie Coins would have an initial value of around USD$0.30 to USD$0.50 depending on how much the price of ETH and how much bonuses you're getting them at. Ideally, when we list on the exchange, our price should move further north from these numbers.  After that, it's our community, gamers together with Bountie to drive up the demand of the coins. We have many plans set place to increase the adoption of our coins both online and offline.

New website layout – Previously, Bountie’s website followed a typical gaming theme of being dark and mysterious. Thanks to our incredible design team, we have switched to a purple and orange colour scheme for our website. We’ve also included a couple of new elements in the website for better user experience.  Do check out the new design at bountie.io if you haven’t!  2. Whitelist - Due to the increasing number of interested parties in our ICO, we’ve created a whitelist to prioritise you, our beloved community. Head over to Bountie.io and enter your email.  3. ICO Dates – Earlier this week, we have released a new announcement regarding our ICO details. Read all about it on bountie.io/announcements  4. Partnerships – In the last two weeks, we have secured partnerships with SCOGA, MSI Gaming, and DXRacer.  5. Upcoming event – Bountie will be co-hosting an event called Crypto Startup Night on 29 March 2018 @ IM Pixel.

Sponsorship: We'll approach sponsors for our tournaments and leaderboards for products and prize pool for our gamers, while taking a small portion for organizing.  3. Twitch and Youtube Videos: Bountie will have our own content team in the form of Pro-Gamers on Bountie's pay-roll and also content producers doing up videos on these platforms for ad revenue.  4. Platform Fees, Sales Commissions and Transactional Fees: These are fees that we collect from the transaction on our platform in regards to the tournament buy-ins purchase of Merchandize, transferring and exchange of funds etc.  5.

Let me list some of the reasons why Bountie will succeed and be better than our competitors:  1. Bountie is a first in Asia. Even though there are platforms like FirstBlood that already exist, they are focusing alot in Europe. Leaving a huge gap in Asia. Gamers in Asia are looking for similar platforms to play but there isn't a major one like Bountie yet.  2. Gaming Hub. We are starting a Gaming Hub in Dec 2017 or Jan 2018, most ICOs are purely online, some don't even show the founders' identities. But we are creating a physical location for gamers to play, work and hangout. In day to day operations, we will run as a lanshop. Weekly tournaments will be held  and we'll also invite merchants to setup booths to sell their products. It will be a mini-wcg(World Cyber Games).  3. Vision. Most Gaming projects are focusing on the Virtual goods market. For Bountie, we have a larger objective in mind, which is allowing Gamers to make a living on our platform. With this vision, all our actions will lead towards that direction, which is serving the gamers and helping them create an alternative source of income to do something that they love, which is gaming.  4. Our core team. We are all gamers and entrepreneurs. We know what gamers wants and we are constantly engaging with our community to find out more. We are here to stay and to make this space even better.  Alot more details are in our whitepaper, more exciting updates will also be up on our social media. Do follow us for more information. Ultimately gaming is such a huge space, we see that there would be space for many players to compete and still strive.",False

And as elimi mentioned, success is subjective. And what success means to Bountie is when we hit our pre-set timeline listed on our Whitepaper and website. These targets are thoroughly thought out and set as a challenge for Bountie to strive for and hit.  As a start-up, I would be lying if I tell you that we are guaranteed to be successful. As serial entrepreneurs, we have done many other businesses and we will be taking lessons learnt from those successes and failure and in hopes reduce the risk of Bountie. However we also would be pushing the envelope, making sure that Bountie reaches new frontier that no other gaming companies dare to dream about.",False

Thank you for your clarification  GameCredits looks very interesting as well. It's such a good idea to be the universal currency for all gamers and games. But it's gonna very tough to execute. They will have to get Gamers and Game Publishers onboard.  Bountie would be starting out as a ""niche"", serving Asian gamers who want to make a living while playing their favorite games. We are very laser-focused on what we want to do at the very beginning and the next few years out. This allows us to direct all our time and resources to solving these challenges before we move outwards geographically and technologically.  Many gaming ICOs and companies are thinking about ways to make gamers spend money, Bountie wants to help gamers MAKE MONEY. That's the key difference.",False

Of course, the most basic ones would be the anti-hack software that will eliminate 90%-95% of the popular hacking tools out there. The remaining 5-10% would make it more manageable for Bountie administrators, community managers and our gaming community to monitor.  As we have many mechanisms in place: - Gamers who have been verified and played in Bountie's platform would have a trusted level higher than new players in our platform. This ensures that the transaction goes through and get approved faster. - Because of the blockchain technology that captures vital stats of each and every gamer, we are able to track the gamers' skill level and playing style. Any huge variations over short period of time would flag the system and investigation would take place. - Gamers suspicious of hacking can be reported by their opponents and this would be immediately looked into and payments would be halted for this particular gamer.  We admit that we do not have all the answers and able to cover all the loopholes for now. And as technology advances, there would be more creative methods that gamers can cheat within games. We would act and react as a startup, always moving quickly and covering the holes once they have been discovered.",False

You're totally right about this point, that's our frustration as well. I guess that's an Asian upbringing and cultural issue that most of us are facing and it's also our motivation to make Bountie a reality for gamers in Asia.  Creating the platform is relatively easy however creating a platform of the standards that we set for ourselves is tough. What we are building would 2x the capabilities with better UX/UI with Blockchain + our own cryptocurrency. A combination of these makes Bountie platform a really tough project(even after taking on many clients' projects via our agency in the past).  Yes, our key focus is design and we differentiate ourselves against other platforms by this. Most industry rewards the top perfomer as well, we would like to change that with Bountie. With the introduction of different tiers flattens out a bell curve into multiple ones. Adding other sources of revenue for the gamers also allow diversity in the way gamers can make a living. This essentially allows more gamers to make a sustainable living doing what they love.  Based on the reason that our supply is finite, we are indirectly rewarding early adopters of Bountie. Gamers who join early would see an increase in demand of Bountie Coins when our platform reaches out to more gamers throughout the region. If we are doing our jobs well, which is giving value to the community in terms of a solid platform, we should see gamers keeping a portion of our Bountie Coins and not just for in game purposes. That's not what we are/will advertise but this is the same throughout all other Utility Tokens.  As promised, technical whitepaper is in the works and we'll publish it as soon as we can. Hope to hear more from you again soon Hexcolyte!",False

At Section 1.1, a small typo can be spotted: ""PlayerUnknown’s Battledgrounds"", should be ""PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds"" Section 4.2, ""2018 December ICO"", I suppose it is 2017 December or 2018 January.  From the information I have gathered from the website, there is no details information regarding the team, or the company backing Bountie. All I know is that the team is based in Singapore. But I can still find Linkedin profiles of the team's members from simple search on the internet, perhaps you can put the Linkedin profiles on the website as well.  I would like to know the technical details of the project instead of the fancy whitepaper. As far as I know, most of the features provided by Bountie platform are centralised, for example most of the revenue streams, matchmaking, tournament, quest rewards system, platform's search function and player's profile. Since many are still controlled by Bountie Pte Ltd, will the company open all of the sources?  I think what Bountie platform provides is more like an all-in-one platform for gamers to show themself. But it might simply become another place where gamers are hard to get exposure, just like most of the current existing platforms. Do you think 80% of Bountie users are able get a reasonable stable revenue from Bountie (provided they are playing/streaming seriously)? Is there any feature that makes Bountie platform different from the others (excluding the currency)? I know Bountie aims to decentralised the revenue sharing method, but it is still easy to create a website, allowing registering of users, embed Youtube/Twitch streams, fetching match's data, organize tournament and enable PayPal transaction.",False

We are currently in the works to upload our version 1.4 of our whitepaper with some of the details you mentioned and edit the typos that you have pointed out. We are also adding our youtube channel where you can see interviews & vlog coming up. Linkedin profiles will also be added to both whitepaper and website.  We are also having a vlog session with Darren our CTO to touch more on the technical details of our project. A technical whitepaper is also in the works. We'll update it into the site and the other channels when it's ready!  Just to clarify by ""most of the features provided by Bountie platform are centralised"" do you mean that we lack API to allow other platforms or users to tap into our network, features & functionalities? If yes, here's our take on this: Most of the larger platforms out there have a certain level of API available for other platforms to tap on, Bountie have plan to do that as well. However as a startup, we have limited time and resources to execute everything on our ""wishlist"", which is why we our first step is to finalize and create a platform that gamers will love using. Only after that would we be able to let others tap into our platform.  That's a tough challenge that we trying to solve, how do we structure our platform mechanize so that the majority of the gamers are able to make a living while playing games that they love. Based on our existing model, we would have multiple source of revenue streams(3 types tournaments, seasonal leaderboards, content producers, Bountie gaming team, daily quests, referral program, etc) that gamers can employ to allow more of them to make money from gaming. By increase the pie overall, more gamers would be naturally rewarded. We also listen closely to our gaming community to understand further what's their frustration and how we can improve the gaming as a whole. That's the whole purpose of our existence. Not to be a tech giant that is just looking to improve shareholder value.  You seem like someone who's very knowledgeable and cares deeply about gaming. We would love to hear from you on and off as we launch more updates in near future. Do keep in touch with me via email(lex@bountie.io) or join our telegram group chat.",False

By centralising I mean the ability for a single entity to shut down the entire platform and not going to recover soon. In Bountie situation, the platform is solely owned and managed by Bountie Pte Ltd as far as I know. The only information/data that is going to stored on blockchain is the currency transactions and tournament prize pool sharing. Since putting everything on blockchain is impossible at the moment, I hope that the platform is at least open sourced so even if Bountie Pte Ltd decides to close the platform or delete all the data, the platform can still be run by others and so the platform never die. If Bountie Pte Ltd only source of revenue is through ICO and the amount of Bountie tokens they hold, in this case, open source might not be a big issue to stop Bountie Pte Ltd from profiting, provided Bountie Pte Ltd is not taking cut from the player's revenue. As of development, open source allows other talented developers to help develop it, for free.  Matchmaking is a really tough area to step in. Big companies have been trying to provide a properly balanced matchmaking experience for decades, but none has succeed to create a fair matchmaking. I am not expecting to get a totally fair matchmaking since it is basically impossible, but a basic matchmaking should be there. It is better if the tournament is being adjusted to suit all sort of players, building different levels of tournament, seperating the beginners, intermediate and advance players, so not only the most talented players can gain prizes, but the general players can make it too.  In my opinion, the big issue in E-Sports in general is the unfairness of revenue for the players. The amount of tournament/prize is still unable to meet the high competitiveness that currently existed. Beside, from what I know, the E-Sport players are also not receiving full profit from their prize due to taxes and those companies behind each E-Sport teams. Gambling on blockchain with cryptocurrency might be able to solve this issue, every players has the chance to gain money, no big central entity can take a cut from their earning and government cannot apply taxes on them. But this solution has been out for some time as far as I know. I think gambling, audiences and advertisement will create big revenue for the players provided they actually love to play game and is taking them seriously.

I'm so happy to see your reply because you go really deep into topics that really makes Bountie think from another perspective.  We do see the pros and cons of going down this path and open source have created so many great projects that's we thought it's impossible. We are definitely open and interested to explore this option, however as of now, we really want to make sure that we as the founders get the initial base up and running first, after which we will look at ways on how we can open up and let more developers, stakeholders and gamers improve on and grow Bountie. Our plan for ICO isn't focused so much on the profits of it or the coins we'll hold(10%). But the eventual value of the platform and ecosystem that we'll be building. ICO and Bountie Coins holding in the grand scheme of things would be just something to help us kickstart Bountie and accelate it in a way that we ourselves couldn't. The ICO funds(inside our whitepaper) are all allocated for building the platform, improving our business and marketing to get gamers to use our platform, in way giving back to the gaming community. Which is why you'll see a Revenue Streams on page 6 of our white paper. We only start making returns if and when we have a robust and successful platform, without that most of those revenue streams wouldn't be significant.  Yes, matchmaking isn't easy and this would be a constant feature that we'll be always testing and improving on like how Google Search is always changing since the beginning of Page Rank. I believe other games have lesser stake on this and treats this as a small focus of their game. For example Starcraft 2, their main focus is balancing the game, adding new content, not so much on improving matchmaking or making it perfect. But for Bountie, this is a key and essential feature that will make or break Bountie. We will be launching with 3 tiers, Silver/Gold/Platinum as you suggested, each has its own difficulty and rewards.  We do agree on that, if I'm not wrong it's 3% of the whole gaming pro get the prize money. For taxes, it's unavoidable and we would encourage our gamers to declare their income from any sources that they get it from. As of the companies behind E-Sports team, there are pros and cons on that as well. Some of them really value add the team by giving them a fix income, a proper structure, guidance and more. But of course that costs money which is why they are entitled to a certain amount of the prize money. Ultimately we exist to give gamers a platform to make a living, that's our over arching goal. We'll explore and look at more ways to allow gamers to get returns on their time spend on playing games.  For Uproar.gg they are something like our Free To Play Tournaments, but even for our Free To Play, gamers would be getting Bountie Coins and not virtual points. Bountie Coins would be tradable on Exchanges or able to be sold for $ via our e-wallet in the platform.  Really hope to hear from you again soon! If I may ask, which country are you from and what do you do?",False

Maybe I have misunderstood the Revenue Stream section from whitepaper, so it is the revenue for Bountie team instead of the players? So Bountie Pte Ltd is gaining money from advertisement and transaction as well? I was confused and thought all those mentioned revenue are targeted at the players. I am waiting for a more detailed whitepaper.  If Bountie Pte Ltd is generating revenue from activities throughout the platform, closing source is totally understandable. Beside, earning money is not a bad thing, as long as players and audiences are satisfy with the services provided by the platform and Bountie Pte Ltd. We all know that keeping platform alive needs constant revenue stream.  From the vlog, I can see that you guys are passionate on what you are doing, it is great to see startup wanting to create something revolutionary. From what I know, your team are lacking backend developer and advisors. Advisors is not a must but I hope your team can use the raised funds from ICO to expand the team, and in return accelerate the development speed. In my opinion, taking more than half a year to complete platform with existing technology is a bit slow.  If I am not mistaken about the vision of Bountie, I still think Uproar is somehow simillar to Bountie. Both share the same ideas in my opinion. Sure the currency or points are different, but the way Uproar functions, such as wagering, competiting, player profiles, quest and rewards for playing games are the proposed solution by Bountie. But uproar is much smaller in terms of scale, hope Bountie can do better than them, or perhaps learn from them.  Side note, as far as I know Starcraft 2 is constantly making better matchmaking, but they do it silently.",False

You're the perfect demographic we are interested to talk more deeply with. Hahahaha. And yes, we want to grow Bountie this way. Community-driven approach.  Yeap, I will get the team to improve on the whitepaper so that it's clearer for all. That's the revenue streams for Bountie Pte Ltd. We would like to sustain our platform without raising too much funds from traditional Venture Capital so the control would be retained in the core team. This would allow us to continue further down the direction and mission that we set forth for Bountie.  Appreciate you spending your time on our Vlog. We are doing 1 vlog a day at the current moment, but the video editng portion is taking a little longer than we would like, we should be posting another 2-3 video up today or tml. For backend developers our CTO's agency Fixx.sg is running the show. They have around 18 developers and designers located in Singapore at the moment. We are only listing the core team members in our whitepaper and website for now, we may be adding more of the members with other roles in as well. For adivsors, we have 3-5 that are interested and currently we are discussing deeper details with them. We'll be putting them up sometime next week. On the development timeline, we have listed a conservtive 6 months period to develop and trial run the system before we launch it to the public, this is because Bountie's business is solely dependable on our platform and we need to make it as secure and perfect as it can be. With the detailed design of UX and UI, features and functionalities we are implementing on Day 1, it should take others much longer than 6 months that we project.  Yes we do take references from all our competitors or people in the industry to better understand what's the landscape as well as the pros and cons so that we can learn from their businesses. Our aim is to be at least 2x the improvement of the existing platforms out there if not there won't be a strong enough reason for gamers to switch over to Bountie.  In all fairness, I haven't touched Starcraft 2 for years, so I am in no position to comment hahaha.",False

To me, Bountie is trying to change how competitive gaming industry works. I personally not feeling happy with the current industry where only the ""game experts"" can get global exposure, while the other still struggling to survive. Most players have gave up due to financial issue, if someone is really dedicated in playing competitive game, he can't pursue his goal without sacrificing his time, which also means sacrificing his chance to work for stable income. Without a proper revenue stream, he needs to withstand the pressure from parents and maybe friends, since most of the parents hope their children can gain sufficient money and make a living, so those who are under the radar will experience a harder time in doing what they like to do.  What Bountie platform wants to provide is generic, it seems like something that can be done easily, since most of the required technology involved web development. Blockchain on the other hand is harder to code due to the lack of knowledge in the current industry, but a smart contract that solve revenue sharing is still not that hard in my opinion.  It is a common issue that the industry focus on the top performer, not only limited to game industry. If Bountie can solve the unfariness in competitive gaming, then it sure will brings something to the industry. I can see the team has some talented artists working on the UI, a great experience for the users can attract audiences and players to join. As far as I know, many projects are still suffering for their non user-friendly interface. If Bountie can bypass this by creating an easy-to-use platform, then it will benefits everyone without questions.  About the Bountie token. Bountie Ptd Ltd should already understands that in order to get general people onbaord, fast and easy currency exchange is a must. From what I know, Bountie token total supply is finite, which mean the price will fluctuate a lot especially at the initial stage. Also, since I don't know the details on how the reward system work, but if players are getting rewarded directly from the company using Bountie token, they are going to sell it for fiat currency or exchange with other assets as soon as possible, so the Bountie token itself has no value or function. Maybe I am wrong since I don't know yet how will the tokens work in Bountie. I am waiting for a detailed technical whitepaper.  Thanks for reading",False

This significantly increases the chances of Coins failing because their intentions are not right to begin with.  For us Bountie, we would be lying if we say that we won't fail, but we are taking necessary steps to balance between taking risk and failure. Our team's made up of seasoned entrepreneurs and we have been through so many business failures. It's really tough to start a company, grow it and make it successful(whatever the bar of success means).  First thing I feel our community and investors should worry about is whether Bountie is a scam or are they really serious to do this, with this out of the equation, a big part of the risk is already eliminated.  Next, we look at the progress and are there actual business activities, partnerships, and updates from Bountie. This will determine whether our Bountie Coin will continue to grow, with more adoption,  more interests this will happen naturally.  Judge us not by our words but by our actions, because people lie, actions don't. In the coming days and weeks leading up to our Pre-ICO and Public sale, there will be a lot of updates from us. From there our community and investors can see whether or not Bountie is a good investment/project to back.",False

First thing I feel our community and investors should worry about is whether Bountie is a scam or are they really serious to do this, with this out of the equation, a big part of the risk is already eliminated.  Next, we look at the progress and are there actual business activities, partnerships, and updates from Bountie. This will determine whether our Bountie Coin will continue to grow, with more adoption,  more interests this will happen naturally.  Judge us not by our words but by our actions, because people lie, actions don't. In the coming days and weeks leading up to our Pre-ICO and Public sale, there will be a lot of updates from us. From there our community and investors can see whether or not Bountie is a good investment/project to back.  Nice answer developers and good thing question like that are not being ignored compare to others. Since the project is long term, let's see if this project will make changes to the outcome of gaming project who always ended up fail. Goodluck as I see your team is active. Hardwork pays off.",False

Seems like Shadowtoken took the money and ran? I do agree some of the projects they try to do take the easy way out which is to use platforms to do their ICO, it's really low risk/cost for them to do that method. But that's just my opinion.  Gaming is usually the main and first adopter for most tech advancement, just look at Mobile, VR, AR and now Crypto. To be an early adopter and succeed is really tough as we are ones setting up the path as compared to those that just follow after without making the same mistakes. But if we do succeed as the pioneers, the rewards would be significantly larger.  We have automated and reduced our roles in our personal businesses and spend 100% of our time on Bountie. And we do agree with you that hardwork will pay off, not in 1-3 months time but 6-12 months time. We hope that our community will watch our progress and continue to grow stronger and bigger with us. And in return the early adopters and backers of our project will hopefully be rewarded with the trust and faith in our business and Bountie Coins.  Lots of updates coming up! Very excited to share with you all soon!",False

Thank you for your interest and it's a great question you raised.  For SoStronk they are based in India which is where they are really excelling in at the moment. For FaceIt, they are in London. As for Bountie, we are based in Singapore and we'll be moving from here on out. There really isn't much love in e-Sports/gaming platform over in this area of the world.  There are many value proposition that Bountie offers that many other platforms don't/can't, I'll just list a few: 1. Peer to Peer competition/wagering. Right now most of the platforms offer platform points when you play or win tournaments, for Bountie, gamers would be able to wager fiat currency or Bountie Coins for our tournaments/leaderboard. When they win the gamers they get rewarded back with fiat currency or Bountie Coins, not points. This allows gamers to actually make a living while playing their favourite games.  2. Bountie's own game. We are planning out to launch our own game in the near future. A game built from ground up with the gamers' feedback and participation. Many platforms are just aiming to be aggregators and tournament organizers.  3. Many more games offering. We are starting out with CS:GO and Dota 2 but we will be quickly moving into many more games like PUBG. Most of the other platforms offer a limited number of games or only a few popular games.  4. Carefully crafted platform. Most platforms(in general, not just gaming) are built without much thought into the User Interface and User Experience. Our team has been building websites, platforms and mobile apps for our clients for years. We have also researched deeply into other platforms before we finalized on ours. We will be building a platform that gamers will feel excited to use, easy to navigate and be a part of. This level of execution will be a key difference between something like Slack Vs Hipchat.  5. Marketing and Building Community. A platform is only as good as it's community and user base. We are currently building our gamers community even before we launch our platform. Most of the platform has very limited number of gamers, this results in the same few players always playing against the same people in the same games of the platform. We have allocated a significant percentage of our ICO funds to do marketing heavily and putting in mechanics to reward our gamers to join our platform and community. This will ensure that we'll have more than enough liquidity in our platform for gamers.  There are many more reasons why and how we are differentiating from other platforms, some would be public in the near term and some would be revealed further down our roadmap.",False

Thank you for your feedback  We will have anti-hack software to prevent cheating for our first level of protection, followed by in-game analytics to monitor each and every gamer's actions. Because we realised from our research and experience that everyone is unique, the way we move our mouse, the way we type, the way we play our games, even we make changes to our gameplay, it happens gradually, not immediately. From these analytics, we'll be able to pinpoint whether this gamer is playing as himself or differently.  We also encourage better rewards by using game mechanics to get our gamers to stick to their main account longer. This prevents pro gamers from recreating new accounts to cheat/win the lower tiered games. It won't be worth it for him to do that.  Of course we will also have the reporting of hack/foul play feature for our gamers to report on their competitors should he/she feel that the game has any element of cheating. Our community leaders will assist in the investigation through the video replays that are saved on our servers.",False

These items we are referring to merchandize like Razer Mouse, Steel Series Headphones, Dell Monitors etc. We would not be selling items that increase the odds of the gameplay for gamers with more Bountie Coins.  More about the balancing the competition, we have 3 tiers that we'll categorize our gamers, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Base on our analytics, we'll sort out our gamers and match make them to other gamers that are closest in terms of their gaming skills at the present moment.
