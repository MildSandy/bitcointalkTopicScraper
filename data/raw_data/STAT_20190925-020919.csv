All unsold Stater coins will be burned after the ICO. Stater is created as a medium for crypto investors to use and spend their Cryptocurrencies without having to convert them to fiat, thus from the first moment we aimed the majority of coins to be distributed amongst different investors. There is no point on the unsold coins remaining in our possession.  2. The price of Stater in ICO will be 0.000125 BTC from the initial 0.000250 BTC. The reason behind our decision has to do with the massive increase on Bitcoin. When Stater was created as an idea, and later when it was announced the Bitcoin price was much lower that it is today.  3. All early investors will be rewarded with a 50% bonus. All our investors who bought Stater they bought it in the discount price of 0.000125 BTC. We will compensate every one of you with 50% more Stater coins. (It will not apply on nodes). For those who bought nodes, the additional 50% will be given in Stater coins as well. Meaning anyone who bought a Masternode will get 500 more Stater coins, and everyone who bought a Meganode will get 5,000 more Stater coins. Snapshots was taken on (7–11–2017)  4. ICO will be extended to December 15 2017. We received numerous emails and messages requesting an extension to our ICO. Many of the potential investors are trapped due to the massive drop of altcoins and they would like to have some extra time to move their BTC to participate in our ICO. We plan to have Stater listed on exchanges on December, and that will not be affected by the extension of our ICO.  Thank you so much for your support.  For any questions please join our telegram group: https://t.me/StaterChat  Sincerely Stater Team",False

Our masternodes are limited, we are the only Masternode Coin who does that. The reason is to have a stable ROI that will not change in time. The reason to have coins is that you want to use them on our platforms, not all people are Masternode/ Meganode holders. Last, if you have a 1000 STAT and you want to form a Masternode you will have the option to apply for it, go in a waiting list, and if a masternode space is open (only 1,500 masternodes) you will receive a key and instructions to host yours.
