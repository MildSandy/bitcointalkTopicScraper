No one gives a shit about your ""We hear your concerns and we're doing everything we can to remedy the situation"".

The outright theft of a 13% cut from the miners for your own greed by using authoritarian votes that MOSTLY you control in for any outcome  This isn't an open consensus of users believing in your project.  No investor in the history of any organization or token would have allotted a 13% cut off of al profits.

To answer the question correctly and without being misleading, yes, Aeternity collected funds in a fundraising effort so that they would have the capital to implement their vision, and at the time it was a fairly substantial amount of money collected over 2 separate fundraising time periods.  So for the purposes of the question, yes there was an ""ICO"" in the sense that the team collected money to fund the project and assuming it proceeds accordingly, participants will receive what presumably would be considered a utility token.  Whether or not it passes the Howey test is something that you most likely ran by counsel and I would assume they are helping you to mitigate any potential issues in the future.

While getting the project right is more important than simply getting it out as fast as possible.  What steps (if any) are you taking into consideration to prevent another delay to 4th quarter (which I believe is a distinct and likely possibility).?  Thanks",False

The æternity project posits that functional languages like Erlang are the solution to scalability and reliability.  æternity has put together a team of well-known professionals from the Erlang/Elixir communities, including Ulf Wiger, John Hughes, Robert Virding, and Erik Stenman. Guided by Yanislav Malahov, æternity’s founder, these brilliant minds are building a next generation blockchain.  æternity is a decentralised æpps platform. It scales through state channels that run smart contracts. It introduces a new language that supports formal verification and allows to write simpler, safer code. The VM accommodates compiled Solidity contracts. æternity uses an ASIC-resistant, memory-bound Proof-of-Work (PoW) with less than 15 seconds block time. It features an integrated naming system and oracles, which could be used to request and access data from various data providers.  Most importantly, all components are native features of the æternity system. They are not meta layers on top of a blockchain (like Lightning, Raiden, Oraclize), but parts of the core protocol. This ensures unmatched efficiency and significantly reduces the cost of running smart contracts and making lightning fast transactions. https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/Stockholm-Erlang-Meetup/events/250982064/",False

Firstly, this update provides a version of State Channels that allow for basic off-chain functionality, for example a client can open a state channel, update it (send tokens inside the channel) and mutually close it.  Secondly, we have provided a significant update to smart contracts functionality:  The state of a smart contract can be stored in a Merkel Patricia Tree and retrieved later. Calls and return values are stored in a separate MPT for one block. Sophia smart contracts can handle the state. This allows for the execution of non-trivial Solidity and Sophia smart contracts. If you want to get a taste for yourself, check a Sophia smart contract implementing Dutch action. In addition, a first version of the Varna syntax and a compiler were also added.  Another significant update is switching the cryptographic signing to Curve25519. Why? In addition to this curve being all-round awesome, it is fast and it allows us to use shorter addresses, which is a significant UX improvement for mobile-based æpps due to their limited screen size. This update also allows us to implement Schnorr signatures, which are efficient, short and provide multisig out of the box.  We also made a number of fixes and improvements:  Enforcement of contiguous nonces for transactions from the same account. Enforcement of positive transaction fee for all transactions. Persistence of the pending transactions in the DB.  https://blog.aeternity.com/state-of-development-week-of-may-7th-2018-c1356ac0db3d",False

The Easter holiday affected the work of æternity’s developers this week, but progress was achieved nonetheless.  After successfully introducing Noise for secure peer-to-peer communication, we have moved on with the next release that will be primarily dedicated to improving and optimizing peer-to-peer synchronization as well as introducing support for backward compatible chain change (hard fork without restarting the chain).  At the beginning of this week we identified several issues in our synchronization protocol and to ensure smooth operation of Testnet, a decision was made to create an unscheduled maintenance release 0.10.1 with fixes for these issues. The release is available under in GitHub.  The team also keeps making good progress in Bitcoin-NG implementation and was focused on extending validation to handle micro-blocks and key-blocks as well as on handling of micro-forks.  State channels team has implemented HTTP APIs for the unsigned on-chain transactions and is coming close to having a working test case bringing an off-chain channel up to the state (which would include verifying the channel on-chain).

We have some news for you.  We have been saving this one for a nice sunny Friday (at least where we are ). This is the recording of Ulf Wiger's presentation from the Erlang Meetup in London. He discussed the applicability of Erlang for blockchain development - strengths and weaknesses.  Here is some information about Ulf:  Ulf became one of the first commercial users of Erlang when he bought a license in 1993. In 1996, he joined Ericsson and became Chief Designer of the AXD 301 development, arguably the most complex system ever built in Erlang. In recent years, Ulf has been involved in products based on the AXD 301 architecture, and has been an active member of the Open Source Erlang community. In February 2009 he became CTO of Erlang Solutions. He is currently working on aeternity.  Trivia: There was also a live streaming of Ulf's presentation in Facebook. Interestingly, that was ""loved"" by Ethereum's official Facebook account.  On another note: there are AE scams still happening in Telegram. BEWARE Here is an extract from a dialogue between one of æternity's community managers - the lovable Vanessa - and a fake account impersonating our precious Marion. Needless to say, we will never organize such affiliate programs.    That's all for now!  Kind regards, The AE team",False

There are two kinds of TX speed in æternity: on-chain and off-chain. Regarding on-chain, new blocks should be found in about 15 secs.

This week we have introduced our next release that is dedicated to improving and securing peer syncing protocol:  A secure peer-to-peer communication will be facilitated by the Noise Protocol Framework. In addition, multiple improvements have been made to the stability and performance of the sync. In parallel, we are working on extending the instructions set of the VM and we have began to implement state channels — a component allowing for the off-chain execution of smart contracts and transactions.  We are also evaluating Bitcoin-NG as a possible alternative to the current consensus algorithm. One major advantage of Bitcoin-NG is the shorter block confirmation times, which is very desirable when building user-centric distributed applications.  https://blog.aeternity.com/state-of-development-week-of-march-5th-2018-ea50dcc35950",False

The new release is mainly dedicated to improving the stability of the testnet. The following improvements have been included in this release:  Oracle fine-tuning: Refunding the oracle query fee when the oracle does not answer on time. This impacts consensus. Adding the possibility to extend the time-to-live of an oracle. This impacts consensus. Fine-tuned coinbase transaction by including block height in to make its hash unique in the chain. This impacts consensus. Fine-tuned the Naming System user API, by ceasing the resolving name in revoke period. Enriched user API re unsigned transactions by returning its transaction hash so to enable querying it. Enriched WebSocket user API by tagging request-response. Enhanced contract creation user API by returning the address of the contract to be created (#800). Enriched user API by adding functionality for getting a transaction by hash. This works both for transactions already included in a block as well as pending transactions. Optimized memory usage of cache within naming system and oracles. This impacts the persisted DB. Optimized memory usage when launching mining. Refactored transaction-related internals. This impacts the persisted DB.  We have also started to implement parts of the Kademlia peer discovery algorithm to make peer-to-peer node discovery more efficient. In addition to this, we are working on an additional security layer for node-to-node communication that will be based on the Noise Protocol Framework which will significantly improve the overall security of the system.  https://blog.aeternity.com/state-of-development-week-of-february-26th-2018-bc42ec456def",False

It is time to do a formal introduction. Community, meet the Elixir team.  We are thrilled to present you the experts in æternity’s Elixir team. This will be done in two parts — one dedicated to the team leads and one to the developers engaged in learning and experimentation.  The æternity Elixir team is based in Sofia, Bulgaria and is supported by Quanterall, a local tech company with extensive experience in Erlang and Elixir development. Before we start with team member introductions, it is important to present the raison-d’être of æternity’s Erlang/Elixir dev crowd.  Elixir Team Goals  Educate new developers about blockchain technology by implementing a research-level blockchain for æternity in Elixir. Learn more on GitHub. Educate developers about the BIP standards used in HD wallets and implement them in Elixir. Get the details on GitHub. Build an adequate codebase for developers in order to enable them to experiment with implementation of advanced æternity features such as oracles, state channels and governance mechanisms. Manage a hardware team whose goal is to understand the architecture of existing hardware wallets and improve them. Build an æternity wallet and a minimized wallet with different functionalities and better security. Propose and build a prototype specification and implementation of æternity’s oracles, voting, governance, naming, payment and state channels, smart contracts, as well as onchain-scaling and sub-tokens. Organize a web team for implementing a HD web wallet and explorer for æternity’s Elixir research blockchain.  The current Elixir implementation of æternity blockchain features spend transactions and is synced over the network, enabling multiple miners to reach consensus on the chain validity.  https://blog.aeternity.com/introducing-%C3%A6ternitys-elixir-team-da731b46319d",False

Looking back to the token/ICO exhuberance, I understand Vays' position that Bitcoin is the mainframe and 99% (99.9% in Vays' version) ICOs are scams, not necessarily by intention, but by economics. They are marketed as solutions for not-yet existent problems, that ""require"" the transfer of value for a special token. I value PoW coins higher than PoS for a simple reason - PoW coins have an actual cost, they were mined <> electric energy was converted into coins with a certain purchasing power. In my opinion, PoS coins have only 2 advantages - reduced environmental cost and higher-than-PoW transaction speed. Out of Top-20 CMC, 1/2 of coins don't belong there simply because they are either too centralized, are faulted by design or no resources have been spared for their creation: Centralized - Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Stellar; Faulted by design - IOTA; Free of creation cost - Tron, Cardano, Bitcoin Gold. Corolary to PoW superiority - PoS coins will come and go in Top-20 CMC, while major PoW-coins will only advance to higher positions. I am as confident in Aeternity as I am in all the startups - i.e. 1% condifent. If Aeternity fails ""at least code"" the principles and mechanisms from the Whitepaper, and a new PoW mechanism was a major value proposition, it will top up my scam list and will only reinforce my belief that we are in the most stupid, irrational and ignorant bull market run ever described to our days.",False

Nobody knows Actually people do know. They are all implementing their own ideas. Aeternity does know and they have been implementing their ideas since day one. LONG before Tezos/Cardano/Tauchain. Tezos? Are you fucking kidding me?  Quote -Erlang has nothing to do against oCaml and formal veritification What language used can be argued forever. Who cares? What's been implemented is all that matters. I can tell you I am using F# because it's the fastest most secure language to use for blockchain. And then never make anything like half the new pump vaporware projects out there.  Quote -Why PoW/PoS if you can have only PoS? Maybe the first CTO knew it, the third one probably has no idea Again you show your complete lack of insight. Zack, the former CTO who is building Amoveo IS now implementing POW WITHOUT STAKING. Why not go take a look at his repo or join his telegram channel? He is using SHA-256 POW. No POS even on the roadmap as it stands. Does Tezos still exist?? or only in the minds of the scammed bagholders?  Quote -The team of course is not gold if you compare it with Tezos/Cardano/Tauchain which have PhD teams, relevant genious from universities, people who started at university at 13 years old like Ohad Asor Bud go and compare repos. Again with the Tezos.. it's funny how many idiots are duped by believing having an academic golden sticker is a free pass from actually being productive and WRITING code. PUMP is only going to get you so far. Look at IOST. Do you think maybe these professional scammers are on to the fact that filling their webpage with 3rd rate graduates of ivy league schools is good for a pump? Which if any of these projects are lead by people with a proven track record of PRODUCING a product, running a successful company? They all paint a great picture so you can dump your real money into their vaporware. What is their intention? Their intention is to PUMP and DUMP. Not make a product. If they hire some peons with degrees to paint a repo.. hey it's worth it after they have all your money.  Quote -Regarding the most hyped thing in AE...

In my opinion PoW is old and was chosen when Aeternity designed the ICO... the new projects are all born with PoS. The old projects that are able to migrate (such Ethereum) are also trying to migrate to PoS.

Do not invest more than you’re willing to lose. 2.   Do not keep coins on exchanges unless you are actively trading them 3.   Do not keep coins or wallets on any mobile devices as they are easily hacked 4.   Do not access your wallets, coins or bank accounts on any Public network (Too many man-in-the-middle attacks) 5.   Use a VPN service  (Top 2 =  PIA VPN and TorGuard) 4.   Avoid keeping coins or paper wallets on computers as they could also be compromised via various exploits (Please view Example #1 regarding wallet obfuscation) a.   Recent Meltdown & Spectre Intel vulnerability means 98% of ALL computers/ servers are vulnerable.  5.   When creating a paper wallet make sure you only use the following sites below or a site you are 100% certain is legitimate (too many phishing sites out there) a.   https://www.myetherwallet.com/#view-wallet-info b.   https://www.bitaddress.org c.   https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/ i.   Make sure you bookmark trusted sites / do not continuously “Google” for wallets as you could be going to a scam site ii.   When you are on a “trusted” site make sure not only to look for the green [SSL] padlock in your browser, but make sure that you click on the padlock and view information regarding the security certificate and who the issuing authority is.  6.   Paper Wallets are “burn-n-turn”.  Once you have unlocked it for any type of transfer (i.e. transferring to app or digital wallet) make sure NEVER re-use it. 7.   Be wary of coin forks as in some cases (i.e. Bitcoin Gold) a user can withdraw all of your coins using a replay attack.   a.   To retrieve coins from a forked wallet, move all funds to a new paper wallet.  Use the “old” wallet to try to retrieve the new forked coins, thereby preventing any replay attacks as your coins are in a new wallet.  8.   When sending coins, quadruple check the address (even if you copy and paste).  You can’t imagine the millions of dollars of locked-up coins because someone sent funds to either a wrong address, or sent Bitcoin coins to a Bitcoin Cash wallet.   Remember, once it is sent there is absolutely no way to retrieve it. 9.   Do not disclose to online how much coins you have.   People are murdered for few dollars alone.  If you have a sizeable amount, it might be worth the risk for a criminal. 10.   Make sure to have multiple backups of your private keys.  At least 3 on-site and one off-site in case of a fire or theft a.   Might be a good idea to create a PGP public/private key pair and then encrypt your private key and email yourself as an alternative backup.  11.   Educate your significant other on how to retrieve the coins in the unlikely event of your death (maybe give your significant other 1/3 of the private key, your attorney another 1/3 and a trusted 3rd party another 3rd)   just a suggestion… 12.   Create 2 wallets for each coin in case you are forced to give up a private key under duress.   a.   Example you have a total of 10 BTC i.   Keep 1 BTC on one wallet ii.   The other 9 on another iii.   If you are forced to reveal your private key, you would give up the wallet with the least amount.  13.   When printing out your wallet (or storing it on your computer) make sure to obfuscate the private key and delete the QR Code of the private key.  Below are the steps I would take if I owned Bitcoin as an example.   -------------------------------------------------------------  Example of Obfuscation:  1.   Think of word that is very memorable to you.  In this example I will use the word  Bobby       (We will call this my secret key) 2.   I would go to https://www.bitaddress.org a.   Follow steps to generate address 3.   This example the bitcoin address created is: a.   14V1pAf2XLPu5K1gvKn3Q6DLcANLguuSxe 4.   Corresponding bitcoin private key is: a.   L4S2Gn9vqk2d9F7B7utirKKcwrs6ev2RbFNZbgH1EXgFZyfxpzmN   Unfortunately, there are no letters or numbers that correspond to my secret key.  I would then continuously click on the “Generate New Address” button on the top left to generate new keys until I found a Private key that includes my secret key (Bobby)  This may take lots of attempts, but I found one close in this particular example.  Public Address:   1AmCCwwdZrbD18RguxPSykZNFSC2CpBbqL  Private Key:  L41RdYAS53B6s2cSadhKEDoBhK2P2SeDFF4fxbbAanz4C4VoX51i  You would then replace the letters B-o-b-b-i with asterisks like this below:  O-Private Key:  L41RdYAS53*6s2cSadhKED*BhK2P2SeDFF4fx**Aanz4C4VoX51*  Finally, you would add some additional characters and words to the beginning (possible middle) and end to make sure you secure your keys substantially.  (make sure to complete this next step as it would NOT be difficult to brute force the original private key if it is missing only a few letters)  Final Key:   Exam*L41RdYAS53*6s2cSadhKED*BhK2P2SeDFF4fx**Aanz4C4VoX51*Test*   Using the Final Key as an example, it would be very difficult to brute force this as the attacker would not know where the start or ending would be not to mention the extra asterisks.   Obviously the “Exam*” in the beginning and “Test*” is just so you see what I am doing.  In reality you would make sure it would be more complex.     At the end of the day, you are the protector of you wallet.  If you are a victim of a phishing site or don’t regard security highly you are making yourself a more enticing target.  The responsible actions you take will help protect you in the dangerous crypto world..  Where millions of dollars are made every day and millions are stolen every day.

My reason is not volume (although thats  fine and nice with me) BUT its the change of the token API after MainNet.  Does anybody think Liqui.io, Gate.io and especially HitBTC are just waiting that they can install AEs new token API?  Does anybody think they will do it for free and quickly?  And what will happen if you change AE ERC-20 token to MainNets new coin format and people aren't able to trade them? Situations with exchanges have seriously changed since the last 4 month. I can tell from experience with BOScoin.  ICOs piling up at the doors of exchanges, why they should go through the hassle of adapting their API or install a new blockchains node, when fresh ICOS are willing to pay ANYTHING to get listed???  Again my suggestion to get listed at KuCoin, now, with a contract to have the API exchanged later at MainNet. Why KuCoin exchange?

I didnt think about the points you made though, if its really a big deal for the exchanges to work with new blockchain apis than it really should be cared for rather sooner than later. Maybe Ae could get in touch with exchanges to sort this stuff out and make a contract with them to set the trading start to the mainnet launch date?

But still i didn't loose my interest in AE and purchased ""some"" recently after you announced the TestNet, because I believe we need more and differenet blockchain platforms and I like the improvements of AE over ETH. I'm pretty sure the value of AE will rise quickly into 2 digit no. the closer MainNet launch gets.  Now: From my experience with BOScoin I'd like to draw your attention to a problem with exchanges you'll run into with the new AE token API at MainNet, leaving ERC-20 standard. (BOScoin isn't ERC-20 and started with its own Stellar API.) I can predict that HitBTC will not  change it!!! Since 3 month we (BOScoiners) are waiting that HitBTC installs our API, that our coins can be desposited and withdrawn (HitBTC purchased around 700k BOScoin at ICO and sells them still as IOU at their exchange). They just don't do it! (Btw. HitBTC charges new ICOS with ERC-20 token $400k to be listed. Got that from a CEO of a coin, who asked 2 weeks ago.)    The situation with exchanges have dramatically changed since May 2017. Many ICOs are piling up in front of known exchanges and doing ""nearly"" everything to get listed.  You can dream of binance and bittrex, but IMO they will not list you or without an exorbitant and embarassing fee or some ""connections"". And I don't know wether Liqui.io will change the token API ?? I heard from several ICO CEOs that they don't answer to any way they tried to contact them.  I'd suggest that you don't wait but try to get listed to some more and new exchanges, now, that might change the API quickly after MainNet, when heavy volume will be traded.  One recommendation for that would be www.KuCoin.com at which BOScoin will be listed soon. They are a fast growing and clever, gathering all major blockchain platforms and pairs!  And they are eager to grow and attract more volume and you get quick responses from their Telegram channel or Twitter. IMO KuCoin would be one of the perfect places for AE and the change to MainNet. I'm sure they would be glad to take AE in (to their regular listing fee, which is reasonable and btw. negotiable.)  Please don't wait with that step to add more exchanges until MainNet, but do it now.",False

From what I get, the algo hasn't yet been defined (no technical specs available), thus no mining is possible - correct me if I'm wrong. Even if PoW mining existed at this moment, it would work only on the testnet and the coins cannot migrate between mainnet and testnet. Creating and implementing a new algorithm takes a bit of time - I make an analogy to Zcoin, that announced the migration to Merkle-Tree Proof in July-August. They needed 2-3 additional months to assess the academic paper of MTP PoW algo, kicked a miner release contest that lasted ~1.5 months and the transition period from Lyra2REv2 to MTP is still unclear. Haven't heard of MTP mining on testnet either. I have also witnessed the creation of new algos out of thin air - Skunkhash, Timetravel10, possible Polytimos. These are not genuinely new, just a reworked sequence of already existing algos (Skein, Fugue, SHA256, SHA3, etc), used as cash cows by fraudulent developers (Dr. Asif Baloch from Signatum) and miner developers - namely sp_.

Price has steadily grown over the past few months (with natural highs and lows) and has currently settled on $0.60   Testnet has been launched successfully and test-users are able to mine test AE coins right now and AE team are working out minor kinks while simulatenously working on all the the aepps for our blockchain platform.  Currently Mainnet is slated to launch Q2 of 2018 (just around the corner) and as we start approaching this goal, the price will inevitably match.  As Bitcoins surge continues, the investments are beginning to pour into it and trickle down into all of the major alt-coins.   If you are reading this you know that the cryptocurrency space is still in its infancy with the general population only being familiar with Bitcoin (not knowing about other alt-coins or what blockchain really is).  With that said, AE is starting to climb slowly and based on my market research it would not be surprising to see AE rising as high as $5 USD with a bottom of $2-$3 USD.  The Team does regular AMA's on reddit and our active/ growing community is very involved/ actively engages the team on telegram.  Please post any questions you have about this project.   Very Important:  AE will be kittenware proof ",False

Something which makes me a little scared is seeing that no one in this thread is actually talking about the project, rather every post is on the value of the coin. There is more than the coin - the project itself. They are inseparably bound, however I feel like no one is critically challenging the development team. Is anyone actually looking at the coding, seriously?  Point of the post: the value of the coin is based on the project, so just challenge the team and the development and your coin will rise eventually. The value seems to stable around 60c now. Now the development team has to deliver to justify another increase. Recently we've seen another change in the development team, after zack leaving approx. 4 months ago, which is normal in any company. Now it's on all of you to place trust in the team, but stay critical.  In my critical role I'm wondering if the AE team has any (large) companies already interested in the technology?

Way back, when cryptocurrency was not yet in the mainstream, the investors are the techie people who understand those techie terms. But now, the investors are those people who were just amazed with the new idea whenever they are imagining it.  I joined the 2nd phase of ico and used my 2 eth(932 dollars now) and got 900 tokens(It is 530 dollars now). Everyone is rising because of their marketing and showing the people what their product is and how unique it is. Cryptocurrency is in the bull run now except for aethernity. This is the right time to market it while investors are overflowing now. Aethernity only has a godfather of Ethereum which not even marketed now. It will be great if aethernity will be known to public using a simple  title/term that will attract everyone to be followed by the godfather of ethereum.  ""Scalable smart contracts interfacing with real world data."" Whats unique with it? Just sounds like Ethereum. Do you think the mainstream will understand this?

I really like this website made by a community member: http://www.aenews.io/  We need more sites like that one.

Aeternity has had a great bull run in the last month after hitting an all-time low of $0.156 on 24 October 2017, based largely on anticipation of the upcoming launch of test net on the 15 November 2017.  As with all projects, dates are often subject to change, and as a result of aeternity's focus on getting things right rather than rushing a substandard product to market, the test net release was pushed back a few weeks due to further testing, debugging, and the aeternity team meet up in Malta where plans for the main net were developed.  Regardless of the minor setback of the test net release date, the price reached an all-time high of $0.823 on 24 November 2017, and moved aeternity well into the top fifty cryptocurrencies in coinmarketcap.com's ranking.  As an investor it was wonderful to see a project like aeternity finally getting the attention it deserved.  But as with all cryptocurrencies, especially those in their early stages, the unexpected often occurs.  The loss of the CTO, Joel Reymont, who had been instrumental in the rapid progress made by aeternity over recent months but decided to pursue opportunities outside aeternity, caused the price of AE to plummet more than 30%, hammering investor confidence and causing doubts about the capability of the team and the technology.   The incident happened at the wrong time.  Investors were eagerly anticipating the launch of the test net, and getting involved in the aeternity hackathon and enjoying the price rise after many months of being undervalued.  The loss of a CTO is a major event, and this has now happened twice in a short period of time at aeternity.  As an investor I would like to see contracts signed by all the aeternity team members to stop this from happening again - surely a simple step to prevent private disagreements turning into public battles.  All companies around the world have dissatisfied key workers leaving and new ones being appointed, but the public never hears anything because these human resource matters are dealt with discretely and according to contractual terms of employment designed to make such transitions smooth.  When these matters become public, it's the investors who are hurt the most, many of whom now look at aeternity as a bad investment with bad management, which is absolutely not the case.  Aeternity has the potential to be a powerful and influential blockchain in the very near future, with a great team behind it working towards a world-class blockchain solution, yet this message gets hidden behind the drama.  Investors in aeternity have nothing to worry about.  One key worker leaving does not affect the development of the project.  Aeternity is not a one-man band and nobody is irreplaceable.  There are eight highly-skilled Erlang developers on the team, and investors should remember the original vision of creating a game-changing blockchain.  Remember why they invested in the first place.  Those fundamentals haven't changed.   As of now, all we can do is move on with the aeternity project and our lives. Aeternity will survive, and aeternity will thrive.  The official releases from the aeternity team are a great place to obtain the most up-to-date information about how the project is progressing, and rumors and gossip should be avoided.  Joel Reymont has been replaced with Sascha Hanse, who is taking up the role of aeternity’s new full-time blockchain lead developer. In addition, one of aeternity’s first contractors, Michal Zajda, will step up to lead the core blockchain development. He will be supported by Erik Stenman, former CTO of Klarna. Aeternity has responded rapidly, put into place some top-quality leadership on the technical side to fill the gap left by Joel, and doubtless will push forward with increased intensity and focus to deliver a working product that will become a leading blockchain.

He's pretty focused on the trillion dollar derivatives market but there are a lot of obstacles with regard to making crypto-derivatives work.  Here he analyses the top 5 blockchains from the POV of oracles but with a view to the crypto-derivative prize. https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/amoveo/blob/master/docs/progress_reports/october_2017.md  However getting a good oracle is only a miniscule part of the problem.  BitShares has had functioning fiat, metal and commodity derivatives for years using price feeds provided by elected block producers, however creating a liquid crypto derivative that trades 1-1 with its real world counterpart is very challenging.  Love or loathe him, Daniel Larimer, the founder of BTS ($130 million), STEEM ($220 million) & EOS ($215 million) put a lot of his effort into solving that for over a year but with limited success.  https://bitshares.org/technology/price-stable-cryptocurrencies/  BitCNY, a CNY derivative has been the most successful with $6 million BitCNY in circulation and a few hundred thousand in daily volume https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcny/  However this is after years of work on areas it doesn't seem Zack has even contemplated yet and a motivated third party supporting that particular market. If that is his focus & as he states 'The biggest prize of any competition on earth', it's strange that he did no analysis on BTS in that overview & it seems based on my experience of watching BTS & Daniel tackle that challenge, Amoveo will have years of work to create a liquid crypto derivative and many years longer for it to gain any traction.",False

In my own opinion, People were tricked that the supply is not big because of the image or idea is somehow a bit the same with ethereum as they used the term ""father of ethereum"" during marketing.  We thought that the tokens they sold during ico are not too many because of the idea of ethereum. But after the ico, they created a lot of supply so the tokens that they sold are just a little percent of what they sold to us. So they still owned big numbers.  And it is like selling us a too small piece of the pie for a big price. How much was the total cost of their sales during the ico?   I think they should update us about the development so new investors will trust them as they see the progress. I still believe the price will go up in the future because of the hype and will get affected of the rise of bitcoin.

Dear trolls, potential investors, speculators, software engineers, and geeks-alike.  I've been in the crypto market for few years.  With that said, half of the technical jargon that is explained on various coins (including AE) are foreign to me.  I am not educated enough in programming languages to discuss the pros and cons between Erlang or any other language.  I have a high overview of how blockchains work (including BTC).   Basically I'm not an expert (financial or programming).     HOWEVER, I've been in business and work with businesses for a long time.  I've hired, fired and trained my fair share of employees and am currently an IT consultant.  I can say, without a doubt, that AE is NOT a SCAM.  But if you truly believe it is, then I would encourage you to either [obviously] not invest.  And more importantly, take the time to put/ invest (your time, money energy) into something you believe in (instead of trolling on various sites)  Go plant a tree, do some charity work, pray.  Do something (anything) positive.  In any business, relationship or project, communication is key.  No matter how great your product is, if you are unable to communicate with your team and investors, there is a high probability your project, program will fail.  Without communication your best employee becomes unreliable.  Even when you are waiting in line at your local grocery store, it is important to simply be acknowledged despite the long wait.  By acknowledging you, they are communicating that they see you and will be with you shortly.  So what am I rambling about in this post?  Communication.  AE team has been in full communication with eyes and ears on the ground in regards to what the community wants.  Even with the Hack (that affected multiple companies due to the fault of the multi-sig contract) they stayed in touch and provided all of the investors with their AE.  They are bending backwards to get this project going.  Blockchain technology is still very new, and what AE is trying to achieve is ground-breaking in various aspects.  Delays can and will occur.  They are inevitable.  Developers come and go, but the team's strength is not reliant on one person (look at Apple / Steve Jobs).        Believe what you want, you are absolutely entitled to your opinion.  And I understand emotions run high when there are investments involved.  I have done extensive research on AE, and while all of the puzzle pieces may not fit correctly in my mind, they have satisfied any concerns I may have.   Will AE be as successful as I/ we all want it to be?  I don't know.  The team and time will tell.  But you are also investing at ground level.  If you want a sound investment go and buy gold.  Go buy Amazon stock.  At the ground level (especially at current price-point of $0.40 a share, you are taking a risk.  It is your responsibility to calculate this risk to the earning potential.  Good luck with the Team.  I/We hope it works out and goes to the moon.  I'm hoping we have our own tokens/ mainnet launched by mid-next year.  If we are able to launch by Q1, it is certainly a positive.  Also, Kudos to the team and the new CTO. ",False

I assume your posting was not intended to do damage to Aeternity investors who did not know about all this happening behind the curtain.  If your plan is to launch an own blockchain, you could do the following: Everybody who invested in Aeternity could get some coins from your new blockchain launch for a discount. There would be several positive consequences:  You receive the share that you deserve for development and have money to hire new programmers. People stop blaming you, as they can become shareholders of the better Amoveo project for a good discount. There is a positive competition ongoing based on your original code base.

I left Aeternity. Many of you have been wondering why I have been so quiet lately. Usually Zack loves talking about himself. For my own safety I waited until I was far away from the rest of the Aeternity team.  How did this happen? I am young. I didn't think it mattered who owned the company ""Aeternity"". I didn't find out who owns Aeternity until the token sale was over, and all the $77 million were controlled by the owner of Aeternity.  Things I have done for Aeternity:  I invented and implemented Turing complete state channels. I invented and implemented off-chain markets, which is Aeternity's killer app. I invented and implemented an oracle mechanism which is orders of magnitude more efficient than the competition. I invented and implemented the Aeternity governance mechanism, for updating variables like block-size and block-reward. I answered technical questions. I came up with the ideas in the Aeternity white paper. I gave training in Aeternity technology. I implemented a merkel trie database for Aeternity. I implemented a virtual machine with compilers for Aeternity. I wrote the Aeternity testnet. I wrote the lightning network on top of the testnet. I wrote an off-chain marketplace in the lightning network. I helped Aeternity to raise over $77 million from an ICO. I gave talks, I flew places to interview people. I memorized lines and was an actor in the Aeternity movie. I did livestreams of software development. I maintained the testnet and github for over 9 months. I let Aeternity use my name. What I should reasonably get: The team that raised the money had about 6 members. Out of these 6 people, I was the only one working on the technology. Since this is a technology startup, I should be controlling at least half of this money. I should be deciding how Aeternity uses it's money in regard to developing the technology. I should be deciding what programmers to hire, and what tasks should be worked on. Instead the anonymous owner of Aeternity is deciding how the money is spent.  How much I was willing to work for: For about $3.5 million I was willing to work exclusively on Aeternity.  For about $1.7 million I was willing to make Aeternity secure and work on Aeternity non-exclusively.  For about $300 000 I was willing to leave Aeternity, as long as Aeternity didn't use the technology I invented.  To the Aeternity investors: I am very sorry that this has happened to you. Many of you were tricked because I was tricked first. I shouldn't have let myself fall for this. I apologize.  Timeline January 2015- I began programming the blockchain that would eventually be called Aeternity. At the time it was called ""Flying Fox"". I invented turing-complete state channels for this blockchain, and I did the research necessary to be able to build the Aeternity oracle and governance.  March 2017- Aeternity tells me I am the founder and will be highest paid out of Aeternity, and that I will control at least 10% of the budget.  May- I keep bringing up how much I want to get paid, and asking to see how the budget is planned to make sure I can get paid. The owner of Aeternity says that we will discuss it more ""tomorrow"", or ""after my trip"", or ""after I sleep"", or ""later"". The owner of Aeternity says that if I mention anything to the community about how unstable my relationship is with Aeternity, that Aeternity will not pay me anything, and Aeternity will sue me for damages.  June- Money was collected from the contribution campaign. Other programmers were getting paid regularly, but I have still not been paid. So I went on strike. I stopped answering technical questions, and I stopped helping with Aeternity software. I demanded that Aeternity and I come to agreement about how I will get paid.  August- The owner of Aeternity tells me that I am not a founder. The owner tells me that I am a junior erlang programmer, and that he already has other more experienced erlang programmers who want to work for him. The owner tells me that Aeternity is not interested in using any of the technology I invented, or any of the software I have written. So, he asks me how much I think would be a fair payment under these circumstances. I am comfortable being paid $300 000. If Aeternity doesn't want to use my technology, then this means I have failed, so I am willing to be paid a small amount.  Aeternity developers are still working on the technology that I invented. Aeternity is still describing itself to the public as using the technology that I invented. I think that the owner of Aeternity is lying to me. Aeternity wants to use the technology I invented without paying me.  August 17- Aeternity finally makes an offer to hire me that I am comfortable with. In the process of negotiating my employment, the owner of Aeternity was asking me technical questions, and the honest answers I gave made him angry. He wished that universe worked differently, and he blamed me, the messenger of bad news. The owner of Aeternity was so upset by the technical limitation, that he did something to me that both scared and injured me. I no longer feel safe working with this person. I am walking with a limp a week later.  The owner of Aeternity is someone who punishes people that tell him uncomfortable truths. So, it is impossible for the owner to understand the technology, or to hire people who understand it.  Immediately after the awful experience, Aeternity's owner and three other employees get together to pressure me into signing a contract where I would agree to not talk about what happened to me. They tell me I wont get paid unless I sign. The contract says ""Zack agrees that all of his work is worth $300 000, and that Aeternity owes him nothing more"". and ""Zack agrees to never say anything about Aeternity, or else Aeternity can sue him for damages."" I have not signed.  It is very hard for me to program while in a state of fear. I cannot work with people who make me feel this way. I stopped communicating with the community because I was afraid for my physical security.  August-  The Aeternity lawyer spent 5 days with me, begging me to sign the contract. I wonder how much lawyers get paid per hour. He kept saying stuff like ""This contract is only for you Zack, it doesn't benefit us at all.""  Aeternity hires a ""new CTO"", as if I was stepping down from some kind of power. In private I was an unpaid ""junior erlang dev"" with no control over how funds are used, essentially an intern, but in public I was the ""technical lead"". It is not fair that Aeternity uses my name this way when they don't give me any power. This is a trick so that they can blame me for their mistakes.  September-  I have left Europe. I am in a safe place. I finally feel safe enough to communicate with the community again.  What comes next? If Aeternity is going to use the technology invented, and they wont pay me to make their software secure, then my only way to get paid is by selling zero-day exploits for people who want to attack Aeternity.  As far as I know, Marion also has not been paid. Aeternity might steal from her too, which could be a disaster.  The Aeternity leadership doesn't understand the technology. So it is impossible for them to hire programmers who do understand. They will be able to sell most of their AE tokens before the blockchain gets launched.

It was a hectic birthday I must say.  Let me update you.  The team just published a blog post.  The distribution contract is actually ready and has been deployed on the testnet a few times already without any issues. However, the team wants another round of testing which will lead to a slight delay.  You will be able to use the testnet to access your AE tokens and check if they are ok. Also, you will be able to check how the AE access process works - for ETH and BTC contributors.  I have prepared a guide that will be shared as well, so you know what to do. It will be very simple for ETH contributors and just a little more complex for BTC contributors. Emin from the team has prepared a video on what BTC contributors need to do and that is included in the guide.  That is all for now.  Regards, Vlad",False

So now we are 4 months in and in a much worse place than at the start (ie, almost no visible progress other than Zack's work, which has now become Aeternity's competitor).  There's $50 million floating about. Almost none of it has been used so far for some reason.  How about a commitment to using that money, including a specification of the budgets. Like every other ICO has. Aeternity can still become a success, but only if the money is used. And I'm not sure anyone believes it will be.  And otherwise, people are going to think that the intention is for someone to keep that money.

You can be sure that I have clearly communicated to the entire team that you are looking forward to the token release before the end of August. I think that I might have been even too aggressive in that.  I actually have a birthday on August 30, so I am hoping for an amazing birthday present - happy community.  That is the way I like you - happy. You definitely deserve it.  Regards, Vlad",False

I see some very good point raised here. Contrary to what some people believe, we are working quite hard to build up the dev team and have the AE testnet/pre-mainnet running. It is important to have it so apps can be built on top by our commencing incubator program (which is also something being worked on currently).  The above are just examples of the different processes that we are currently engaged in and how they are interlinked. There are numerous others.  Please have in mind that we are trying to make aetenrity a success and take the right decisions on the path there. The team has been in crypto for years now and we believe in the blockchain vision. We want to change the world and make our community part of that success.  Earl mentioned that aeternity is OUR project (the community) and he is 100% correct.  Repeating and constantly asking ""Where is our AE token"" does not help at all.  Deliberating on the consequences of doing so is more valuable. I wanted to learn what you, the community here at Bitcointalk, thinks is best.  As far as I can see there are the ""I want my AE token now"" and the ""Maybe it is not a good time"".

Moreover, it sounds off to speak to the devs by giving them orders.  1) Either you decide that this project is a scam, and at that moment no point in yelling 2) Either you dedice the project is solid, and then why the rush?  Investing is always about patience and delicate money management. These 2 qualities are just mandatory for success.  By saying ""release the coin now"" you show impatience which is probably your base of decision. It will not help any of you or the devs.  Another point I'd like to clarify : The project holders are here for long term, to maintain the project for the years to come. Releasing a product too soon can have devastating consequences, especially if the coin is already on an exchange. The devs simply have no choice but to hold off the release until the project is deamed ""good enough"" to say the least. This decision will be made whatever the investors say, for the aforementioned reasons (to ensure quality and duration).  Again as you understand, ""release the coin now"" is plain irrational. if they did it while the coin is not ready, the project is over or significantly damaged. At that point, everyone will cry of course ""why didn't you hold off the project?""   Communication wise, with a ""release the coin now"" attitude, nothing they can say will ease your impatience, just because the problem is your impatience.  Follow the slack channel, the telegram channel, the annoucements here. Either you have faith in it or you don't. If you do, then just go do something else. Good things come to those who can wait right?  My 2 cents contribution here",False

Very little communication, and understanding about what is really happening    ""I dont know who makes me more angry: the team of this project, that is almost non-existant, lacks basic comunication regarding the 8000+ people who financed the existence of this idea and show sporadically to say nothing, or the patient Aeternity believers, who show up here asking for more delay and try to appear as experienced people. For these kind of people, Aeternity will surpass Ethereum and Bitcoin in one year, they are completelly dellusional on their predictions, so theres not much to argue with these crypto-jihadis. These radical believers try to defend with all their disgusting arrogance something that isnt right!!! Period! I wish so much to be wrong about this, Im trully wish to regret what Im saying, but people, please! This delay, without proper feedback, is not acceptable by any means!!! If more people of the AE comunity react, complain, maybe they will work harder on getting things done!!! Even the angrier complainers, in the end, want that this project to be very sucessfull. Now I see Marion, with all due respect, talking about hiring processes, building a solid team...Jesus Christ!!!! You guys waited to get 24 million dollars to start building a team? Dont you should have done this before? The coding of token allocation is not another thing! The token allocation is the PRIORITY guys! You sent us deadlines. I really can understand that deadlines sometimes cannot be met. I worked on several programming projects. Things like this happen all the time. But that fact is not a safe-conduct to work isolated from the comunity! Wheres Yanislav? The man disappeared! Zack, who Im sure is the most overloaded from the team right now, is the only one who show up randomly in the comunity to say something. We want more engajement from the team to tell us whats happening. If you disappear, not saying whats making this delay so long, people start to panick and thats terrrible for the project.

On one side there are the people who already contributed and there are the future contributors. Both have diverging interests. We believe that the best way to balance those is not to change what has already been announced.  There are factors outside of our control. The best way to adapt to them is to persevere.

You say that AE has access to real world data. I don't understand how other projects don't have that. There are many blockchain projects already started to work with real stock trading data and other kind of data , so I wonder how you can use this as a selling point.  You talk about prediction markets ... there are many projects already working on that.  You talk about offchain solutions.

Let me address them in turn.  1. Real world data is available, sure. However, it comes from ""centralized"" sources. That means that if the incentive is high enough (the smart contract ""listening"" for info from that source manages a lot of value) these centralized sources might ""malfunction"" and produce bad info for the benefit of a certain third party. æternity wants to address this issue by producing and using information through prediction markets.  2. Other prediction market projects already available are ""attachments"" to blockchain platforms. For example Gnosis is built on top of Ethereum. This creates numerous complications and rises the cost of using the markets. In æternity, prediction markets are built-in in the consensus mechanism.  3. Off-chain solutions currently discussed relate to transactions primarily (for ex. Lightning Network). As far as I am aware, putting smart contracts in state channels is an innovation that will be introduced by æternity.  For detailed information about the aforementioned features, please refer to æternity's whitepaper.  Thanks!  Regards, Vlad",False

Projects that have 1 coder and 10 marketing/advisores etc fail IMO. How is this scalable?  2) When someone participated in the first ICO phase he paid 1ETH=30$ for 1000 ae tokens. Now he will pay 1ETH=85$ for 800 ae tokens.  This is not 1000->800 but really 0.03 -> 0.10 difference or put it another way getting 3 times less ae tokens for your money.

If AE were to change it so the second round got a better ETH deal, I think there would be a big problem with that.  Am I talking my book? Sure, but that is what everyone does.  Honestly I never actually invested that much, but if they turned around and said the second round got a better ETH deal, I would ask for a refund.  Why? Because people invested in round one already knowing the details for round two, in fact everyone did, that was already on the ICO page, what the ETH price for round two is going to be.

Because translator looks into every post and tries to answer if required & also post in the thread about official updates. So how we can only count OPs posts?

About bounty situation https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1819473.0  I spent a lot of time researching this situation. And let me explain the real truth. The problem is one! Official ICO project developers always create two separate topics - about project and bounty topic. Yes, russian translator targetmlrd is good man and doing his job well. But he's cunning and greedy! He understood: to earn much he does not create separate bounty topic. As a result - hundreds of the same stupid messages like ""when twitter bounty"", ""how to claim"", """"where is my bounty"" and many others. And he answers them. Say, how this helps for the project? Many russians (and not only russians) created a lot of multiaccounts on BTT to earn by signature campaigns. But the problem - they don't know English and forced to write the same messages only in russian topic from each their multiaccounts. That's why, you irfan_pak10 wrote, other languages translators are not active in their threads. Because it is not actual. Those participants (french, german, chinesse and others) read and write in official English thread! By this reason (russian bounty questions spamming) translator targetmlrd earned bounty about 70 000 $ in Edgeless (2000 posts). He grabbed more: eGAAS, aeternity, TaaS, exscudo and others. And the same situation in Taas now - 1600 posts in russian thread, more than in official ANN. And in all those ICO projects he did not created separate Bounty thread. Guess, why?  Reason of that - stupid rule ""5 stakes per post"". Hmm...  100 stakes for translating and 5 stakes per 1 any message: it's only 20 spam messages for a few minutes = 100 stakes. CRAZY! History! During 2016 there was NOT this rule in many ICO projects. This stupid rule only was created by ICONOMI. And all ICOs in 2017 copy and paste it. And as a result Translate/Moderate bounty became ""Bounty only for russian"", i called them so!  I think, to be fair, all developers must pay for moderation separately at first. Second, necessarily translators must create separate Bounty topic. Third, must be about 0,1 stakes per post and to count only posts made by moderator (if one common bounty pool with translation) Also must be maximum limit.  I am investor in Aeternity and other ICOs. And I don't want that somebody become a bounty millionaire due to my money and money of other investors.",False

Crypto is maturing with the day. Projects evolve and need to act more like real businesses. The investors are taking a risk to put money into your project. As an possible investor for me its important to know that you have thought about the financial aspect.  Just like a real business who seeks for investment, they would need a solid business plan and also a plan with the costs and return of investment for the possible investors.  In crypto it would be enough to know how much funds you would need for your project. I am sure you guys have calculated these kind of things, cause you seem like a really professional team. Any decent professional team would know these things before starting an ICO.  So the way I am looking at it. I want the project to have enough funding for development, marketing etc. But I also want the investors to have a fair chance of a ROI. They are putting the risk into it at the end of the day.  The best way to achieve this, is to put a cap onto it. For example your budget shows you, you need around $ 5 million, you would take some % for unexpected costs and that will be your cap.  Taking as much money as you can get is greedy and is a bad sign to your investors who helped made the project possible and successful. Most investors become valuable members of the community as well, and help with promoting, testing etc.  You have mentioned before that you value your early investors and community. A cap would fit with those words.  So in my eyes a cap would be to show your good faith to your early investors and community members and also would show us your professionalism by knowing the amount you need to fund your project. As every legit project / business should know.  ---------------  In the blog for the ICO I saw the first 1.000 investors with 12 ETH or more will get a special threat. Does this only count for investments in ETH or also for BTC. It still isn't clear how the BTC investing works to me.  Also is there an instruction regarding how one can participate in ETH. I read somewhere you need to have an Aeternity wallet? It would help if there are instructions before the ICO is launched.  Thanks for your consideration and good luck with the project.",False

I'd like some of that action. Please put me down as one of the first 1000 contributors to have contributed 12 Ethereum or more to your campaign, as I read about on your website.

There is a well known formula for success in crypto, why throw that knowledge away with an idealist gamble? For a project with real innovation, there's no reason to add extra uncertainty to it.  Wanting to increase the number of people that hold coins is good, but it cannot be at the expense of all of them being underwater on their holdings. This will create a widespread negative sentiment, which is far worse than a positive sentiment in a fewer number of people.

Several people here have made well-reasoned arguments for a cap, and against the idea that an unbounded crowd sale is ""good for the community"". I think most people would appreciate hearing a reasoned rebuttal, addressing the new points.  Otherwise, given the sale hasn't occurred yet, and modifying a line of the contract for a cap should be simple -- the head-in-the-sand response of ""we've already decided"" -- appears to be an emotional response. Indications of emotion-based decision making will not bode well for the project.   Anyone can contribute at the last hours/minutes of Phase 2 (for example), when he has more information about how the contribution campaign went.   That doesn't change the argument, only the time frame. For that argument to be true, only a few people would have the idea to jump in at the last minute, making only a nominal impact on the total amount raised. The problem is that an unbounded raise will lead a significant number the total investors to adopt this ""last minute"" strategy. In this situation the cap could jump by $20M in the last 10 seconds. People hit refresh to find out the value of their investment went down by half. Again, if the concern is truly for the community, then the team would not allow its most vulnerable members -- those with little to no investing experience, and without the ability to have their investments tied up for two years, until the market recovers -- to be placed at risk.",False

In that case our campaign might not be the most attractive model. However the primary objective of the campaign is not to make money fast, but to build something everyone on the world can profit from if they put energy, time and their mind into it. Sound out of the norm and emotional? Well change usually comes from outside the norm and our current economic-value system excluded emotions completely and created a framework of infinite growth on a finite planet. We want to change that. The missing cap should show the reflection of how willingly the world is to build something like this together. How come you are so sure the price will spiral down? There is a lot happening before the mainnet launch and we will continue to constantly grow communication and feedback with the community once the backing campaigns. Honestly it will just get started then, since the æternity open source foundation will emerge out of the incubator phase between the 1st and 2nd backing campaign and from there many more projects will spawn that will keep exposure and interest high. Hence it's not unlikely that the speculative value of the coin will rise. Furthermore I want to state that we are not primarily creating a coin, we want to build software that can help change the world to a sustainable piece of land, everyone can enjoy if they take responsibility for their selfs.

It's encouraging that the team is at least willing to consider and reply to dissenting opinions.  Quote but to build something everyone on the world can profit from if they put energy, time and their mind into it.  It may be useful to be more specific about the ""everyone"" you mention, and what I believe Vlad called ""community"". For the scope of this discussion, allow me to segment that into ""investors"" and ""programmers"".    You mention those that ""profit"" by building something with their energy and time. The word ""profit"" here is ambiguous; what I think you mean is to make a living, and not to profit from the Aeternity token. If so, then I believe who you're referring to here are programmers and founders. In this case, will Aeternity like most other crypto projects not offer faucets and test nets? And even when the programmer's projects go live, will the gas/fees not be adjusted to always be of nominal expense? If so, then I don't see how ""getting AE tokens"" would be relevant to this group, ever. Furthermore, this coin will be available on exchanges long before the vast majority of programmers and founders discover it, let alone build a dapp on it. Correct me if I'm not understanding.  Your comment about ROI makes me think that you don't understand that the investors, not the programmers, are the ones sitting with their finger on the mouse at the dawn of the crowd sale. We are of course looking for a ROI, albeit not necessarily a quick one, because this is our job. We are not necessarily interested in building anything with Aeternity, but we have every reason to hope that others will. Many of us also have the best interest of the crypto ecosystem in mind. Too many people losing money attracts negative attention. We are providing the value of equity for your project, and taking a substantial risk in doing so. If there were no ROI, there would be no investors, and no runway for your work (Not every investor is in for a quick turnaround either). If you agree with that statement, and value the investment part of your community, then it follows that you'd be eager to recognize our interests too. This includes at the very least allowing us to understand what we're paying for our contribution, and reducing the risk we incur, where possible - especially to the new investors, of which there are now many in this space.  For the sake of other forum members, I'm going to ""cap"" my reply here, unless you specifically request more of me.",False

I have to correct myself, I'm not against the concept of ROI, just if one feels that this a primary objective With 'profit', I was referring to the overall enhancement for the planet and it's inhabitants, if we can manage to move from a monopoly to a peer-to-peer economy with true value transfer. Meaning for example, a transparent supply chain management will eliminate speculative and artificial prices for goods, that can be traced back to huge companies pushing away responsibility down the supply chain. This is what we at æternity aim to do, it's a long road on a high mountain and we just started to peel off the egg here, but we try to go one step at a time and take anyone with a similar mindset with us!  After reading on the comments and posts here and putting myself in an investor point of view I do feel your pain. I will let the idea of a cap (that is based on the results of first backing round and the structure and scope of the foundation emerging from the incubator) be taken into consideration and make a case.

First of all, thank you for the reply. We really appreciate your comments and find them quite relevant.  Let me address your points.  We decided to have no volume cap so that anyone willing can participate. We believe that if more people have AE the value of the underlying system will increase. No cap was also Ethereum's approach and that was quite successful.  The name ""Friends, Family and Real Innovators"" might not be the best choice of words, but this is how we imagine the first people supporting us. I believe Yanislav, being quite sentimental at times, tried to express ""closeness"" with the first contribution campaign participants.  We definitely see your ""over-bought"" point. However, organizing a campaign such as this one will always be a balancing act. We are building a public blockchain and we want as many people as possible to use it. This point is further stressed by Yanislav's idea to distribute 1% of AE tokens, created during the backing campaign, to most (technical limits apply) BTC and ETH users by ""attaching"" ownership to public addresses.  Again, thank you for the comments and thank you for the good words in the end. We appreciate both.  Vlad",False

We both desire greater community benefit, including accessibility, and I think there are a few more points to consider:   We believe that if more people have AE the value of the underlying system will increase.  I think the focus is too much on ""our family now"", at the expense of the larger segment ""our eventual family (e.g. two years out)"". The vast majority of people, including weekend crypto enthusiasts and the later stage adopters, will find out about AE well after the crowdsale. If the crowdsale cap is low, them the opening market cap for the coin will be congruent with a very early stage startup. That congruence will be more likely to attract attention (and investment) as it will be seen as an investment that makes sense. The project and price are then more likely to grow as a function of the merits of the project, and demonstrations of what's being produced - items that will justify a higher market cap.  The sustainable returns will create positive community attention and media attention, which will fulfill your goal of getting more people involved.  Conversely, if an unbounded sale raises $50M for example, for an immature product, I think you're likely to see a panic sell as soon as AE tokens are on the market, as people realize they've paid too much, and don't want to wait two to three years for a $50M market cap to make sense. An immediate large drop in your market cap makes for bad news, and will likely further deter investment and raise questions about the team's decision making. Additionally, the people that are losing money in that situation include your earlier adopters. An event like that would taint the project from the start, and impede your growth.   No cap was also Ethereum's approach and that was quite successful.  I don't believe this is an appropriate comparison. The Ethereum crowdsale was 2.5 years ago, when the cumulative market cap for Crypto was around $ 7B. It's now worth 3.5x more, at ~ $25 B. This has attracted many more investors, and as I mentioned earlier, even mainstreem VCs are now on the field. Moreover, the market is extremely bullish now. I think an uncapped crowdsale now is likely to raise more than Ethereum did.  The second point on the Ethereum crowdsale is that a good outcome doesn't necessarily equal a good decision.   The name ""Friends, Family and Real Innovators"" might not be the best choice of words, but this is how we imagine the first people supporting us.  I think it's excellent to be close to your users, and I think this point deserves more consideration: If the team indeed has the best interests of their ""friends, family and innovators"" in mind, I believe an important action would be to minimize the risk of them paying too much for tokens, and potentially losing money if they need to sell tokens in the first year or two, by not capping the sale at a level appropriate to the business needs of the project. To have an uncapped sale is to allow your friends and family to contribute their hard-earned savings, blindly -- they will have no idea of the worst-case price of their tokens at the time of contribution. In other words, an unbounded sale allows the risk of extreme dilution if a new entrant VC decides to flood you with Eth, at the expense of all the backers.  For both the benefit of your project, and the protection of your backers, I encourage you to reconsider putting a cap on the project that is aligned with your business needs, and will protect your backers from an over-bought token.

There are opportunities to get your fair share of tokens of every each project eg. bounty campaigns like the one you take part in right now.

However, it also makes sense to aim for a bigger pie, so the project develops faster and everyone's share becomes bigger in terms of value.",False

The risk of being overbought with subsequent price crash and/or stagnation is high. This poses a threat to the success of the coin by putting at risk the very community that will, in many ways determine the success of the coin.   Further, I almost wonder if it could backfire. Certainly, a limitless crowdsale could dissuade large scale investment from VCs and the like. It's hard to imagine that a VC would invest without having at least some idea of their ownership stake. Obviously, any investment in a crypto crowdsale is risky - I understand that. But having no cap increases uncertainty around ownership stake and the required holding period to receive any return on investment. That does not seem healthy to me.  Would it be possible to at least consider a cap on phase 2 based on the results of phase 1?",False

The stuff about how its difficult to make a sizable investment without knowing how much of a stake you will have is all valid and true, but the really important point for me is that an uncapped ICO makes me think the developers dont know how much money they need : they just want ""everything they can get"" and figure it out later. I would much rather invest in a project with a determined budget, where they have a good idea what they can do with X amount of money, rather than raise it all and figure it out later.  It betrays a lack of business acumen and savvy and makes you look a bit more like you jus want to raise as much as you can get, rather than what you NEED.  The stuff about wanting as many people to take part has some validity, but its equally open to everybody even with a cap, and the token swill be trad-able immediately so people can get involved whenever they want, so I dont think thats a good argument  The arguments of a) it does not look good to potential investors : makes you look simply like money grabbers without a specific plan for doing X with Y raised, and doing Z if W is raised, etc b) It makes it much more difficult to make a large investment in the early rounds because you dont know how much is going to be raised so therefore cant evaluate it properly (as an investor)  are much stronger imo, and should be adhered to.

Quote Combining the viewpoints above gives us the following elements for an “ideal” ICO: Scam protection Technology check Proof of ability to execute Business viability check Efficient use of funds and business-based thresholds for minimum and maximum raise A defined legal framework A transparent ICO process Escrow Controlled release of funds Delayed founder liquidity https://medium.com/iconominet/ico-2-0-what-is-the-ideal-ico-ee9d285a8939  As someone who has contributed to a number of projects in this space, this is my 2c:  I agree with Daniel Zakrisson, as I think most investors would, that it's important to set a cap based on what you actually think you need for your business. The absence of a cap raises questions about the venture's credibility. If you're simply willing to ""take what you can get"" (either too low OR too high), then is shows a lack of due diligence in understanding ""business-based"" resources required to make the project a success.  If you raise too much, you're diluting the value of the project out the gate, and setting the bar unnecessarily high for the project to gain value. The adage heard often in business holds true here: ""under commit and over deliver"". If you raise significantly more than other projects in this space, you will be viewed as having made a very large implicit commitment to the community. The bar will be set very high, which is not a good place to be in the early stages of your development.  In the long run, a low/reasonable raise, followed by exceptional execution, is more likely to earn investor trust; this is likely to cause your project to rise in value more quickly, and be worth more in the long run.  I would think the highest appropriate cap would match the max raised in Ethereum's ICO (~$18M USD). Many investors are going to valuate this project against Ethereum anyway due to the similarities of the project and Yani's relationship with Vitalik. I think a more attractive cap for investors, and a safer raise in terms of justification of resources required, would be $7.5M to $10M.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest_funded_crowdfunding_projects  Another reason I would say a cap is a must now is that (more) VC's (e.g. Blockchain Capital) have very recently begun backing crypto projects. As one of the first projects that I imagine will be both available and attractive to the new VC's, your project is very likely to be over-bought if uncapped, and susceptible to the problems mentioned above.  https://www.wired.com/2017/03/initial-coin-offering-stock-thats-not-stock/  Lastly, I don't understand the point of a ""Friends, Family and Real Innovators"" contribution period, unless there is some way to validate those individuals. If anyone can invest during that period, then it seems to be misnamed, and the question of a cap is as relevant here, as it is to the whole project.

PoS was suggested as a way to secure a blockchain without mining. In PoS, if somebody is able to collect more then the necessary majority of the 'staking keys' (probably <50%) of any point in the past, after the tokens got sold, he/she will be able to create an alternative version of the blockchain, which seems more 'fit'. In comparison to PoW where remining the whole blockchain from the change would be required, with PoS this would not cost much, as it requires just signing. In æternity PoS is additional to PoW and helps with the governance, via revealing information from the crowd.",False

I do think the idea of verified oracles in the blockchain makes sense. However it looks like there is no reward or incentive for users to become oracles.  For example you have to post aeon to be an oracle, and depending on how far out in the future your answer is you have to use more aeon. If you answer the question you simply get back the aeon you posted so no net gain. If you fail to answer the question or if others (the majority I assume) conflict with you on the answer then your aeon is burned.  Even in the case where you did everything right, you are still locking up your aeon for a potentially significant period of time. I guess I'm just trying to figure out what the incentive is for being an oracle as it seems like it is all downside from the oracle's perspective.",False

The first round of contributors gets 1000 AE tokens for 1 ETH which seems fine given the total amount of AE is based on the number of contributions so the ratio here doesn't really matter.  But since the second round gets a similar amount (800 AE tokens for 1 ETH) it is going to be kinda crappy if the value of ETH plummets in that span of time.  I actually wish you had just set the value of each AE token on USD given the current bubble we are in with alts and potentially even bitcoin over the next 60 to 120 days.  Another concern is that the campaign is a long one with no cap, if I contribute a significant amount in the first 24 hours I could be screwed over by the campaign becoming very successful in round 2 and the total % of AE I get could be much smaller than I originally thought it would be.  You mentioned the 800 AE per 1 ETH could be less in this post, can you describe what would cause a lesser evaluation in round 2? Would a drop in ETH's price compared to USD do it or maybe a significantly more popular campaign in the first day than expected (so more funds raised than anticipated in round 1)?

If the award for early birds is too high, then less people will like to have tokens in phase 2. Hard to make it perfect for everybody. We want to make it simple and transparent though and this is why we chose this model.   I actually wish you had just set the value of each AE token on USD given the current bubble we are in with alts and potentially even bitcoin over the next 60 to 120 days. We are not dealing with USD at all. In crypto we have quite often bubbles, too. But is it a bubble, or is it not? The time will never be perfect. People are excited about crypto, thats important!   Another concern is that the campaign is a long one with no cap, if I contribute a significant amount in the first 24 hours I could be screwed over by the campaign becoming very successful in round 2 and the total % of AE I get could be much smaller than I originally thought it would be. I don't believe this is an issue, but instead exactly what everybody should want. To grow the size of the network (people with AE) to as high as possible. With capped tokensales only a few whales profit and the public pays. Somewhere I read today that Melonport had only 150 contributors. This is not good. Let's keep it transparent and simple, with a fair chance for everybody to participate in the construction of the new æternity blockchain.  You mentioned the 800 AE per 1 ETH could be less in this post, can you describe what would cause a lesser evaluation in round 2?

""trustless"" usually is a confusing word. On IT (mostly P2P networks) it's used to point systems and/or platforms where users are safe without having to trust third parties honesty while having your money on their hands. (like a Bank) Here, when talking about state channels, It means parties transact/trade without having to trust a ""third"" or even between each other, while doing it lightning fast.  Taken from the whitepaper. Quote B. State channels ... In essence, the transacting parties instantiate some state on a blockchain, e.g. an Ethereum contract or a Bitcoin multisig. They then simply send signed updates to this state between each other. The key point is that either one of them could use these to update the state on the blockchain, but in most cases, they don’t. This allows for transactions to be conducted as fast as information can be transmitted and processed by the parties, instead of them having to wait until the transaction has been validated—and potentially finalized—by the blockchain’s consensus mechanism.",False

Please try to run it on a Ubuntu, or try to port it to work with other systems, like Windows. We will need the help of the community to succeed, no doubt. Everything so far is done via command line. GUI will come at a later time.  With this testnet you should be able to (auto)create an account, mine and send to other accounts. Please read the readme.md on Github for instructions.  The testnet has also channels, but the channel manager doesn't work yet, so you can't do anything interesting with the channels at the moment, unless you copy paste it, so your counterparty can sign it too.   Expect the first state-channel smart contract using our new channel-manager in the next few days. The governance and naming part and lots of other good stuff will come afterwards.  Most of the implementation so far has been based on an earlier project, by Zack Hess, who is our lead developer. Thus is not newbie stuff, we can assure you! Zack has over 3 years experience with programming blockchains. Yani has been involved with several serious crypto projects already. ... And we just found out that Zack pre-project is exactly 2 years old now, on Github.  Devs will watch this thread to reply to you.

Scalability is achieved by using (trustless) Turing-complete state channels, a major difference to Ethereum. This way the smart contracts also become easier to analyze and more secure.  The interface to real-world data is done via an innovative oracle design, which is based on prediction markets.  State channels increase scalability since all transactions become independent and can thus be processed in parallel. Additionally, this means that contracts never write to shared state, greatly simplifying their testing and verification.  æternity will be powered by the æternity token - AE symbol.  æternity tokens are used as payment for any resources one consumes on the platform, as well as the basis for applications implemented on the platform. The distribution of æternity token [AE] in the genesis block will be determined by a smart contract hosted on Ethereum.  æternity tokens will be managed by accounts which will have an address and balance, implemented alongside a alias (naming) system which will support human-friendly names mapped to an aeternity address.  æternity identities are essentially a triple of (pubkey, hash, name). Pubkey from the account, name from the alias and hash linking to further data, e.g. on IPFS.  Contribution campaign starts April 3rd, 13:05 GMT and will last for 3 days - until April 6th, 13:05 GMT. More details here.   ÆTERNITY BLOCKCHAIN   READ SCIENTIFIC WHITEPAPER    CONSENSUS AND GOVERNANCE   • Hybrid Proof-of-Work Proof-of-Stake blockchain • Consensus achieved by PoW mining   • Algo: 'Cuckoo Cycle' by Tromp: GITHUB WHITEPAPER BLOG   • Minable with even with smart phones achieving highest possible decentralization • Governance via PoS prediction markets   • Prediction markets are proven to very good tools to destill information out of a crowd of people. Better then simple voting!  TRANSACTION SPEED ESTIMATES •  Trustless off-chain transaction speed: infinite and only limited by the speed of light as these transactions are inside state channels   •  On-chain transaction speed: We define following variables for the following calculations:  B = block size in bytes F = blocks till finality R = time till finality in seconds T = transaction size in bytes   The variables that define the protocol are all constantly being updated by the consensus/governance. From their initial default values, we can calculate the initial default rate of transactions per second.  Transactions per second = B  F / (T  R)  B = 1000000 bytes = 1 megabyte per block R / F = 30 seconds per block R = 243600 seconds per day F = 2460*2 blocks per day T = 1000 bytes per transaction  1000000 ∗ 24 ∗ 60 ∗ 2/1000/24 ∗ 3600 = 1000000 / 1000 / 30 = about 32 on-chain transactions per second, which would be fast enough to sign up every human with state channel technology within 8 years.  These variables will be determined by token holders (PoS Governance).  For further details read the æternity blockchain whitepaper: Sec. E(4): Transactions per second at a given memory requirements   STATE CHANNELS   æternity’s blockchain leverages state channels which makes smart contracts faster, more secure and more private. First, two users open up a state channel via depositing some AE tokens into it. They can agree to arbitrary smart contracts. This allows for transactions to be conducted as fast as information can be transmitted and processed by the parties, instead of them having to wait until the transaction has been validated—and potentially finalized— by the blockchain’s consensus mechanism. This æternity blockchain is used to settle the final outcome or to resolve conflicts that arise.  It’s decisions are foreseeable, thereby ruling out malicious activity between parties who try to erode the state channels to which they’ve written and previously agreed to.  The transfer of æon is the only effect channels can have on the blockchain, only those æon that have been deposited into the state channel can be transferred. This makes all channels independent from each other, which has the immediate benefit that any transactions related to channels can be processed in parallel, greatly improving transaction throughput.   SMART CONTRACTS   æternity uses a Turing-complete (new) virtual machine with MAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees) to process smart contracts. Within æternity, smart contracts are pure functions in the form of financial agreements that distribute funds according to predetermined rules. MAST enables that, in case a smart contract needs to be enforced by the blockchain, only the relevant part of the smart contract needs to be published, achieving again higher scalability and confidentiality. Only the involved parties know about the contract Only parties that have an open state channel can create a valid contract Every state change or code update gets signed by both counterparties of the contract It is only submitted to the blockchain if its outcome is disputed, in which case the code is only ever stored as part of the submitted transaction, never in any other state. If this happens, the blockchain distributes the tokens according to the contract and closes the channel.   IMPLEMENTATION   æternity core blockchain code is written in Erlang, which makes it easy to write distributed, fault-tolerant, soft real-time, highly available, non-stop applications. Erlang is the perfect language to write a blockchain from scratch and by using it, we achieve a superior operational stability and performance.  WEB AND MOBILE INTEGRATION  æternity is 'mobile first', which is true because of the convergence of mobile and web technologies and new mining algo which is even efficiently minable on smart phones.  A Javascript library and REST APIs for engaging with the core blockchain will make the integration into existing web/mobile apps or services easier.  ReactJS will be the framework of choice two write reusable modules in, for the UI. These modules can easily be reused on the web, as well as on mobile, and even compile down to native apps on mobile, becoming more snappy.  Also an Ethereum and Bitcoin bridge via Cosmos/Polkadot is planned.   ROADMAP     THE TEAM    Constantly adding team members, check out website and blog for the most recent information.
