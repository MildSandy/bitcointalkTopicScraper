We have visited 2 conferences in London - CryptoFinancing 2017 and Fintechweek on July 13. At these events we were greeted with a warm welcome and understanding. At the same time we started to send emails to various news websites and projects doing ICO listings, in order to tell people about us. Also we tried to contact tokenmarket.net many times, but we didn't get any response at all. (Please pay attention to this point)  Everything was going well until a massive harassment campaign began, targeting us. It started from this post:   https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2008297.msg20304037#msg20304037 ""Hi Just to clarify: the cofounder and CEO of TokenMarket is Ransu Salovaara Thank you""   And simultaneously with it there was made a screenshot of this message and an unknown person published it in the Telegram chat icocountdown, with the comment ""Ziber Scam"". After that just a little time has passed before several people started to attack us on the forum by writing negative reviews, they willing to tear me to pieces for a single inaccurate word. I gave them a link to our presentation - they say it is fake. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDIhEiqCqyQ I gave them a link to our programmers (known since 2014) - they say it is also fake. https://www.microsip.org/ I gave them a link to our github profile where we have published the source code recently (note that the code was under development in private since 2016!) - and they were not  even able to compile the fully working code! And they say again that it is fake! https://github.com/ZiberLTD  So, what is the ""cause"" of claims?  Our website introduces several Ziber Team members: Michael Cordy, as a Co-Founder and CEO Tokenmarket Mark Braun, as a Founder and CEO Michael Kaufman, as a Co-Founder and CTO Jason White, as a Co-Founder Operations and Business.  Michael Cordy has came up with the ""CEO Tokenmarket"" title by himself, it was meant as a ""CEO of Token marketing"" and has nothing to do with the tokenmarket.net. However it became a reason for accusing us of fraud, stating that we have intentionally used the ""Tokenmarket.net"" name. (Kinda dodgy enterprise I'd say, will tell why below)  If Tokenmarket.net did not like this ambiguous title they could just send us the email and we would fix this misunderstanding immediately. Instead of it they started a targeted harassment campaign with the help of professional trolls, haters, hacked and newly registered accounts. However I could not claim that all the haters that were against us are fake - it is very likely that normal users could succumb to the influence of such a manipulator as Tokenmarket.net.   Let's dig deeper - why would Tokenmarket.net attack us? What is the root cause?  And the reason is: https://www.dentcoin.com – the idea is similar to Ziber, but they sell p2p traffic instead of voice calls. The start of their fundraising program accidentally coincided with the Ziber project launch. And they gathered only 21k ETH from the planned 180k. Many people seem to decide to wait and invest their money into a really working product with the real people behind it! So I think that we have ruined their ICO. Because we have presented more versatile product which is already implemented and can be used right away, while they will have to spend time to implement their product. This caused the hatred and the desire of revenge. To drive us out from the market and destroy us. And they chose very dirty ways to do it.   What is the Tokenmarket.net?

I mean FUCKIN WOW! Fuckin wow as in TOTALLY MOTHERFUCKIN WOW!  I was reading the above as a person quasi in Camp Ziber, thinking the whole time during the read that finally Team Ziber is getting in front of the shitstorm brought on my a few, I hanging on to, and nodding in agreement of most every word. That was until you had to literally pick me up from the floor upon reaching the highlighted text above - on the floor due to lack of oxygen goin' to my brain caused by laughing my motherfuckin ass off.  Seriously, I Leroy Fodor honestly thought that the rift between Ziber and I had healed considering the last exchange I had with them via PM three days ago:   The above was a sincere olive branch extended, with since then no further communications between Ziber and I commenced, nor was I here in this thread dissing them unless, that is, me calling out other irregularities is considering dissing their brand. I'm takin' aback that the olive branch has been firmly stuck up my ass.  Talk about sealing one's fate, Ziber did just that by quoting Leroy Fodor as their NEW defense in demonstrating that Ziber is 100% to be trusted. Well, I really got news for you, Sunshine! After I post this comment, I'm using its entire content as proof positive that Ziber is not to be trusted, it acting as the OP on a newly created thread in the ... wait for it ... Scam section of this forum. But to fair, I will also post this comment in my recently created ""unlocked"" thread mirroring Leroy Fodor's locked thread depicting me a scammy ass, whereupon you'll be more than welcome to post accordingly (no memes unless it's I posting such), but please try to present your own facts in depicting me a sammy ass oppose to quoting Leroy Fodor quoting Joshua Zipkin because a wise man once said think for yourself, don't make a decision under anyone's manipulations. Check everything up by yourself!    Dude, my head is still cloudy as oxygen returns to my brain upon reading that your NEW defense that Ziber is not a scam is the sage words of cryptocurrency's number one serial liar, Leroy Fodor. Seriously, dudes? There was nary a speck of evidence you could've gleaned from all the writings found in the known universe to make your brand viable except of those by Leroy Fodor? Dude, you would've came out better ahead if you would've cited John Fitzpatrick or Marshall Long, with it morer betterer if cited both in bringing cred to Ziber.  Even though I didn't steal a dead man's identity (my dad's), his dick was longer than mine, but I'm morer capable of sticking it deeper into the asses of those deserving it in this space, with Ziber being my new bitch. HAHAHA  Bruno Kucinskas  PS: Here's the deal. Simply provide proof that I was/am convicted of raping a 14 year old girl - or raping anybody (girl, boy, goat, etc. of any age) - and theymos has my permission to ban all of my 3,141 user accounts on this forum. This should be a fairly easy task for you, Team Ziber, for you just went on record in declaring such a truism, and there's no fuckin way that a viable entity in this space would espouse such a claim sans sound evidence to back it up, doing their due diligence prior to publishing said claim. If by happenstance - I know, a fuckin stretch - you lied, then please let me know that you're ready to remit to me my standard 35 BTC extortion fee, in this case we'll consider it compensation for damaging my brand if what's requested is not put forth.  To be clear, to show that the Ziber brand is a trusted entity, all they have to do is silence me by following up on one of your REAL claims that I was convicted of rape. It's that simple. Seriously, it's that simple! Show the proof that's readily available from the court that convicted me and Ziber is golden. Hey, to make your task that much morer easierer, so that you don't have to scour all the courts in the US or the world, the court you'll be looking for to glean the docs is in Nashville, TN, circa late 90s. BTW, if during your search you happen upon some article where I beat the shit outta some women, that wasn't me. That dude stole my identity back in the day.    PSS: Looks like Ziber posted their diatribe in two other places falsely claiming that I'm a rapist.

I don't have a dog in the fight, although I've purchased bfl products and have had problems with products that required customer service.  Jody even gave me a tour of the facility back in April-May 2013.  I've never been politically correct, so forgive my ignorance for the following.  For who ever it was to say they did not see mexicans/latinos, etc. working at BFL doesn't hold up.  When I toured there, there were several men and women (some very cute I might add).  Jody said they were college kids.  My personal overall experience with them has been positive.  IMHO, both sides of the finger pointing are lying.  I think Josh stated their policy best one day on their forum.  They only care about their top 20% customers.  So are side deals done for the big fish? Probably. Do they care if your $10,000 or less order is delayed? Nope.  Are they deceptive? Depends on perception.  Illegal? Doubtful.  So let's refill the popcorn and read some more. Don't expect a smoking gun, read what is not being said, and look at it as entertainment.    If you invested 40k plus (3200btc that would now be worth a shit ton) I think you would have a different tune. I've learned that buying coin and holding is the way to go.. You don't have to tell me 2 err i mean 3 times...  So, an account formally belonging to a Gibson posted on my thread pretending to be an ex-employee of BFL, whereupon said post was immediately quoted and commented on by a dude who the FBI faked his death so to imprison Ross of SilkRoad for life, eh?

The binding will end with the end of the ICO (this is done for the convenience of counting tokens.

That's why we refused the Opportunity of the signature.  The bonus distribution was tested on the Bitcoin core and Mist Clients. We hope that this option will suit everyone.  We have too little time to break the working model.  I can recommend you to install Bitcoin core and synchronize, and Send a microtransaction.

It is not a slogan but the real fact! The revolutionary solutions from the brand new revolutionary blockchain company.  During our London’s press-conference on July 7, 2017, we let the world know about Ziber. Our Uber-solution attracted massive interest of mass media, journalists and visitors. Their common opinion - Ziber is like an ICO “unicorn” capable to turn the industry upside down.  You need to know such things about Ziber:  • till July 27 (the start of ICO) you can make the international calls via Ziber for FREE - DOWNLOAD;  • all users of Bitcoin and Ethereum wallets can receive 10% of tokens as a gift from us. You can exchange these tokens into money or use later to make more calls via Ziber;  Ziber tokens will be distributed only between those people who will add their wallet. The distribution proportion will depend on the balance of a wallet. The binding will be closed when the ICO ends. This is done in order to calculate the exact number of shares distributed to each participant who will add the wallet. The Ziber client will ask you to make a micro-payment from the attached wallet. (no need for a private key)  •Ziber allows everyone earning money using just a mobile phone or by connecting to a masternode.
