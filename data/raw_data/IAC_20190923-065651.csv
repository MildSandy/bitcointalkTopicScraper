Through the use of an open-sourced broadcast, injii enables users to interact, donate and engage in decentralized content for the greater good.  What is the injii mission? Our mission is to be an honest and reliable source of real-time content working to support real world causes. The injii platform is an ecosystem of betterment that connects content creators with charitable organizations on a decentralized open broadcast.  injii is a movement, a network for social good. We are global outreach without borders, created for those that want to take a stand for what’s right. It’s a means to provide hope and opportunity for everyone through the creation and broadcast of media content. If you’re working towards a cause, sharing your creativity and artistic nature, or you just want a better tomorrow, injii invites you to build/support, create/share, and participate/inspire. Through injii, the micro-individual can now make macro-world changes in poverty, hunger, health, human rights, and other social impact causes. injii is about everyone coming together in real-time to connect through great content and get involved in great causes.  What is the purpose of the injii Access Coin or IAC? The injii Access Coin (a ERC-223 Standard Token) is the key that opens the door to unique events and experiences for those that want to be there and be involved. The value of the IAC is determined by the community (by the organic interest of the open market to acquire and trade IAC) and will be exchangeable for tickets to injii access events (e.g. concerts, festivals, recording sessions, online shows, etc.), and injii merchandise (artists & entertainer memorabilia, limited edition souvenirs, and digital/analog media content). https://s3.amazonaws.com/injiiforum/3.png Of the funds raised from the injii coin purchase, the largest use allocation will be to fund these charity benefit experiences (injii Access Events). Our goal is to have ongoing events both in the U.S. and worldwide, where admission is granted in exchange for injii Access Coin. The line-up for our events will be determined by the injii community on the injii platform. Users will now be empowered to help decide the nature of the events that are held. Users wanting to participate in injii hosted events (injii Access Events) can earn IAC on the injii platform through smart contracts.  How does injii work? The injii platform is the joint effort of our community: Content Creators, Users, Charities, and Sponsors. The injii community works together to make the injii platform an engaging, rewarding and impactful experience. Our platform showcases original content on a real-time interactive broadcast to help raise awareness & donations for charities. We connect creators with real active and engaged viewers. All performances uploaded to injii are owned by, registered to, and monetized for the content creator. We provide charities the platform to raise donations, in exchange we encourage charities to use these funds directly for their causes. Users that appreciate real-time performances or good causes, have the collaborative opportunity on injii to give micro-donations and raise awareness for charities. https://s3.amazonaws.com/injiiforum/5.png  What problem is injii solving? In 2016, Americans donated a total of 389 billion dollars to public 501(c)(3) charities, up 4.2% from the year before. Yet, 144 billion dollars of these contributions were spent on the cost to raise donations. In other words, $0.37 of every dollar never reached the cause. Through the injii platform, it’s our plan to cut the cost of fundraising to zero. injii is here to solve this fundamental challenge, plain & simple.  As it stands, only a small fraction of up-and-coming content creators get the notoriety they deserve. Even with YouTube, about 96% of all videos don’t ever get more than 10,000 views. There’s a lot of amazing talent out there that goes under the radar because other online platforms have become so flooded with content. And the problem isn’t stopping anytime soon -- roughly 12.96 million hours of content are added every month to YouTube. Artists need a better way to get noticed in real-time and be able to connect with their potential fans.  We know that most people want to make a difference in the world, it just comes down to having a platform to do so. Our goal at injii is making the process simple and seamless.  Content creators should have an easier way to reach a large audience while being able to maintain their content rights and monetize their work. Deserving charities should not have to pay excessive fees to raise donations for their cause. Supporting causes should not be about how much an individual gives, but how much we can all raise together on a global scale. Philanthropy shouldn’t discriminate based on income.  We have a way to do right by our users, our content creators, our charities, and the community.  How does the injii Ecosystem work? https://s3.amazonaws.com/injiiforum/7.png As we are all aware, a pervasive and growing problem on the internet is distinguishing which users are real and which are not. The rise of bots, spammers, impersonators, website scrapers and hacking tools have created a precarious setting for everyday users and a costly one for ad sponsors. Our aim is not only to do social good but to create an environment where users, charities, content creators and sponsors can engage freely and fairly. To ensure that users on our platform are real, we have partnered with Civic to authenticate every single registered user on the injii platform. This quick process takes place when users first sign up on the site. Once verified, all members within the ecosystem can be assured that it’s real people who are participating on injii. https://s3.amazonaws.com/injiiforum/11.png Users earn injii Access Coin by: ● Engaging with Content Creators ● Voting/Rating content creators ● Commenting on content ● Engaging with Causes ● Donating to charities ● Raising awareness for cause ● Engaging with Partners & Sponsors ● Usage of partner services ● Referring to friends/family  Through the technology of AdShares (ADST) and the use of Smart Contracts, the injii platform will enable the allocation of coin for watching ads and uploaded content. Users, who opt-in to watch ads, will have the ability to generate ADST coin for themselves, as well as for the creators of the content they are watching, and the corresponding charity being featured. The integration of AdShares is to incentivize and reward all audiences for their time and engagement with content and advertisements. We understand that content creators deserve the lionshare of compensation, which is why 80% of what is generated is awarded to the content creators, while the remaining 20% allows for further interest on the injii platform for our users and charities. https://s3.amazonaws.com/injiiforum/29.png  Who's on the injii Management Team? https://s3.amazonaws.com/injiiforum/59.png  Justin Paul – Founder/CEO https://twitter.com/JustoNYC https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpaulnyc/  Robert Varghese – President/COO https://www.linkedin.com/in/j-robert-varghese-cmt-b340338/  David Alfonso Castaneda - CTO https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidacastaneda/  Swan Burrus - Senior Marketing Manager https://www.linkedin.com/in/swan-burrus-68371739/  David Menard - Software Engineer https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsmenard/  Sishir Varghese - Company Relations Manager https://www.linkedin.com/in/sishir-varghese-47576b2a/   Who's on the injii Advisory Team? https://s3.amazonaws.com/injiiforum/61.png  Cordell Carter, II https://www.linkedin.com/in/cordellcarter/  Daniel Zen https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielzen/  Thomas Hyun https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-hyun-49621414/  Juan George https://www.linkedin.com/in/juangeorge   Where can I find out more about injii? https://coin.injii.com (injii coin site)  Medium: https://medium.com/@injii (Our intro blog writtten by injii founder) https://medium.com/@injii/injii-access-coin-change-the-world-and-curate-your-playlist-ced991f698df  Twitter: https://twitter.com/injii  Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/injii  Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/injii  Telegram: https://t.me/injiiaccesscoin  Forums: https://steemit.com/@injii https://www.reddit.com/user/injiiaccesscoin  Video/Explainer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygv4q5bbn10  Git Repository: https://github.com/injiiAccessCoin DLT Labs is hosting our Crowdsale Platform, they will provide git in the coming next week.
