This enables buyers to prove their intention to pay to the seller while maintaining their privacy. Meanwhile, it keeps sellers honest by escrowing the title, without which the item would lose value.

I do not understand this question.  ""Most of the unique art and assets are smuggled and bought by some rich guy from somewhere."" - This is not very accurate.  Actually, there are auction houses/museums/collectors, that will benefit to use Codex. And this is who Codex is looking to pursue.   If an item is ""smuggled and bought by some rich guy"", they will likely not use Codex, as the history would expose them. So this is not really a concern for Codex.  In case there is a fire or stolen item, there are what is referred to as ""behavioral incentives"" which will sync the registry with physical items.

Ivan, Private Collector, provides his experience.  ""So, assessing the value of your pieces over time is very important, and I would say, the best advice I was given by one of the persons who restores my painting is 'You need to catalog everything.'  So that's the first part. So that you record everything, you don't lose the provenance history right where you bought it, how much you paid for it, did you have any document that went with it, the catalog of the auction, you know. All these things. But also, so that you can document these things, and when the time comes that you need to sell these things, or somebody else for you —  that it's all documented right.     The second purpose is that collections as a whole have more value than individual lots, taken individually. So there must be some logic to a collection that adds to the value of individual lots.  The third element is that once you catalog things, the, you can get them exhibited. And, getting a lot out that you bought, exhibited, adds to their value, tremendously. Because you increase the documentation about it, you make them more famous, per se, and, and by doing that, you increase the value of your assets.  So that's a very important dimension. By cataloging, you can get advice on how to re-balance your collection, get rid of pieces that, you know, honestly are not that good, or maybe are fake, so you can you can also exchange and communicate and then have external advice. External people tell you well, 'We think this is really good, we think this is really bad,' and reassess.  Watch the full video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQNBpSiOeSk  Want to learn more?

This is analogous to gas in Ethereum. It’s also similar to the 0x Protocol where makers and takers pay fees in ZRX (the 0x token) to relayers to exchange tokens. Operations to read data are completely free, but operations to create, update, and transfer Codex Records have an associated fee depending on the type of modification. For example, adding a lien on a registered item may cost more than a transfer of title operation. Fees will be used to replenish a community pool that is used for rewards. It is not intended that these fees should be burdensome for any one individual. Rather, they will be relevant for stakeholders who use the protocol in volume for commercial use, like app developers and auction houses.",False

Ivan, Private Collector, provides his experience.  ""So, assessing the value of your pieces over time is very important, and I would say, the best advice I was given by one of the persons who restores my painting is 'You need to catalog everything.'  So that's the first part. So that you record everything, you don't lose the provenance history right where you bought it, how much you paid for it, did you have any document that went with it, the catalog of the auction, you know. All these things. But also, so that you can document these things, and when the time comes that you need to sell these things, or somebody else for you —  that it's all documented right.     The second purpose is that collections as a whole have more value than individual lots, taken individually. So there must be some logic to a collection that adds to the value of individual lots.  The third element is that once you catalog things, the, you can get them exhibited. And, getting a lot out that you bought, exhibited, adds to their value, tremendously. Because you increase the documentation about it, you make them more famous, per se, and, and by doing that, you increase the value of your assets.  So that's a very important dimension. By cataloging, you can get advice on how to re-balance your collection, get rid of pieces that, you know, honestly are not that good, or maybe are fake, so you can you can also exchange and communicate and then have external advice. External people tell you well, 'We think this is really good, we think this is really bad,' and reassess.  Watch the full video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQNBpSiOeSk  Want to learn more?

Decentralization is the heart of the crypto movement and we have always endeavored to foster a sense of democracy in our project and build a strong community. That’s why, even though we have raised USD$12 million to date, an amount we believe is sufficient to build the protocol successfully, we opened up the sale to community participation (to the extent allowable by law) — because community engagement and user adoption, especially in the form of token distribution, is our first priority. Thank you to the more than 3,000+ community supporters who believe in our vision and completed the exhaustive KYC process to be able to participate.  Over the first three days of our community sale, the contributions we received were highly concentrated and we have not seen a broad enough pool of purchasers participate in the sale to meet our goals for distribution. Given this, and on the advice of our advisers, we have decided to cancel our token sale and instead proceed with the most democratic option possible — a token airdrop to the community.  The first airdrop will be to the 3,500+ community members who successfully passed our KYC process and provided us with a token wallet address. Those members will each receive an airdrop of 500 CodexCoin tokens (CODX). Purchasers who bought as part of the public sale will each receive a refund of the ETH they contributed along with an additional airdrop of 2,000 CodexCoin.

Meaning every piece of A&C (such as art, wine, jewelry, watches, collectible cars, etc) will be able to be registered in the blockchain. Registering an item in the blockchain will store ownership and provenance information while ensuring the privacy of the collector.  The first two applications built on the Codex Protocol are Biddable and Sellable. Developers are welcomed to build more applications. You will be able to use these applications to bid and sell art and collectibles.  The best way to learn more about blockchain technology is by reading and watching Youtube videos. I recommend that you start by checking this channel out https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop  Here's an example of how Blockchain works https://medium.freecodecamp.org/explain-bitcoin-like-im-five-73b4257ac833  Hope this helps  ",False

For now, all assets in the registered are created manually by collectors but in the future assets flowing through auction will be provisioned automatically at the time of sale. Assets registered in the registry are called Codex Records. Each one is a unique ERC-721 token that can be created, traded, and curated all in a decentralized manner.  By default, metadata about assets registered on the protocol are private, but collectors have full control over the permissions. If the user is managing assets on behalf of a museum or gallery they may want to make everything public and available to others. The user instead could be a collector that wants to consign permissions to an auction house for a piece they are looking to sell.  Over the next few weeks of the beta, we’ll have themed days to get feedback on specific features of the application as we continue to iterate on the functionality.

Even at the initial stage of development, the project was supported by a strong consortium of 5,000 auction houses with extensive experience in this segment. The goal is to become an industry standard.  Codex initially focused on the $ 2 trillion Art & Collectibles asset class, where the need for the registry is greatest, because there is no centralized title registry. For unique assets, the origin (identity, ownership chain and other metadata about the element) are of fundamental importance. Just imagine such a market in one application — at any time, collectors, buyers, as well as auction makers will be able to get all the necessary information about a particular work of art.  The decentralized Codex registry will allow collectors to gain confidence in the authenticity of purchased items. The platform can exist as an industry protocol and will make it possible to create decentralized applications on it. The company itself already adds to it two applications Biddable and Sellable. It should be noted that the well-known companies, as well as the auction houses, have already invested in the project — they were able to see the potential of the platform, which opens new opportunities for connoisseurs of collectibles.

You ask him to share access to the Codex Record. Instantly, you can see that Christie’s auction house created the Codex Record, the artist’s foundation digitally signed it, and the Record hasn’t been copied (because it’s on the blockchain). You can confidently make an offer instantly. Business is also easier. Brokers can sell items more easily, the costs of each sale are lower, loans can be extended more quickly, and more.  This is what makes Codex so much better than the status quo. And this comparison is critical — we believe people adopt new technology when it is 10x better than before. We don’t claim that everything in the Codex is perfect, because that is neither necessary nor possible.
