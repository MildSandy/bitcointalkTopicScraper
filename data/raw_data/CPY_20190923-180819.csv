At Photochain, we understand the need for this, and our approach has always included partners.  To give you a better understanding of our partners and why we work with them, we’ve outlined the key rationale behind each partnership.    At the core of Copytrack is the creation of a global decentralized copyright register for digital content, which authenticates users and links digital intellectual property. This registry will generate a unique ecosystem for rights-holders, thereby providing new e-client marketplaces. With its cutting edge technology and processes, it is well-suited to globally address the key challenges in the industry and will be open to the public.  In an extremely short time frame, Copytrack has grown to become the leading company in the worldwide market of highly automated copyright enforcement. Starting in Berlin and having a presence in New York and Tokyo has allowed Copytrack to directly engage with artists and their networks all over the world.  This mission correlates to Photochain’s goal to create a decentralized copyright chain for the protection of image rights of photography on the Photochain, new generation photography monetization, platform.

We topped up our development team & will double the capacity. Also, our management team visited several strategic partners in Japan.  In the beginning of March, Copytrack Global Copyright Register’s Management and Marketing teams had a long meeting about brand communication. Several branding strategies were discussed and we also received useful advices regarding the launch of Global Copyright Register!  We are currently busy to update our webpage including a blog. The development of the Global Copyright Register is in progress until mid 2018 and will be followed by a Token Swap. We want to emphasise that CPY is an utility token, which means that the value of CPY is expected to increase as soon as it is used at our platform. Please refer to the Roadmap: https://copytrack.io/#section-roadmap  Also, we confirmed that there will be master nodes for CPY tokens and we expect that will start before May.""  So the project definitely is under development, i hope team managers will be back into bitcointalk, as a part of their community and investors are being here.",True

They already have an existing business and want to get everything on the blockchain with a real use of their tokens.  The things that make me unsure right now ist the fact, that you can just whitelist with your name and ETH address. No KYC needed. No serious ICO does that anymore. And why did they advertise with HitBTC, Tdax and a Binance application? Other ICOs say, they aren't allowed to talk about exchanges before token sales end.  Should this be a red flag?

Copytrack is the undisputed market leader in uncovering image theft with headquarters in Berlin and Singapore, and subsidiaries in New York and Tokyo. With our upcoming ICO we set the precedent for a global, transparent and decentralized register for copyrights of digital content.

Minimum: 0.1 ETH. Maximum: 2,500 ETH   Copytrack Vision & Market Overview  Whilst the digital image market is growing exponentially with more than 2 billion images uploaded every day, up to 85% of images online are used without a valid license. Photographers suffer an enormous financial loss and are often unaware that their images are being copied and distributed elsewhere.  On the other end of the spectrum, the image licensing market is controlled by only a few players that keep up to 70% of revenue to themselves. Copytrack is here to change that.  By introducing a distributed database for images, we are moving image copyright registration, licensing and payments to the blockchain. This will reshape how photographers and creators protect, track and monetize their work in the following ways:  1. No more image theft By registering images directly on the blockchain, all their usage and distribution will be registered. Creators are automatically notified whenever an image is being used.  2. Global copyright database The open and global database of rights-holders and their work allows users to easily license and track their creative work.  3. Fair & transparent compensation The CPY token directly connects creators and clients and facilitates transactions via smart contracts. Creatives are in full control of their own pricing and licensing options without any intermediaries, who nowadays take cuts of up to 70%.   Questions? Join us on Telegram: https://t.me/copytrackhq/  About Copytrack  Copytrack is the undisputed market leader in uncovering image theft with headquarters in Berlin and Singapore and subsidiaries in New York and Tokyo. Over the past three years we have helped the photography community to claim image rights in over 50.000 of unsolicited use cases.  With the Copytrack Global Copyright Register, we are taking digital copyright registration to the next level. It is our goal is to provide a solution for the key challenges of digital content copyright as they still exist today:  How to proof digital content authorship globally? How to track illegal use globally? How to license digital content globally?

Here's the statement of our CEO, Marcus Schmitt:  “It’s always been our mission to improve the protection of photographers and rightsholders online. It’s been a great recognition to be supported by over 1600 backers who have invested a total of $ 7.6 million USD in our vision to democratize copyright and prevent image theft for photographers – and this was just the pre-sale.  Unlike Copytrack, KodakOne is still in the preparation stage. We can only state 3 key differences and facts between KodakOne’s planned ICO and Copytrack’s Global Copyright Register so far:  KodakOne is a brand licensing cooperation between Kodak and Wenn Digital Inc., a Delaware company founded in Nov.2017. Copytrack has a proven track record of several years and has developed its technology fully in-house with enforcement services in 140 countries. KodakOne plans to solely register images on the blockchain while Copytrack’s “Global Copyright Register” is an open blockchain for any type of digital content (images, music, video, etc.). KodakOne’s ICO will be a closed sale that’s only accessible to accredited investors, whereas Copytrack keeps its ICO open to all investors of the blockchain and cryptocurrency community  We can’t comment on KodakOne’s technology as neither their system nor their whitepaper are available yet.  At Copytrack we strongly believe that blockchain and cryptocurrencies set the foundation of the internet’s future. It’s exciting to be part of it and help creators protect, track and monetize their work with the Global Copyright Register. Our main sale ICO still runs until February 10”, concludes Schmitt.
