Without exaggeration, Hash Lab developers can be called among the best in Russia, as they are the leading experts in the fields of blockchain and solidity, regularly winning major hackathons. Let's take a look at how BREM MVP works (both for real estate investors and developers). Let's start with the procedure for those who want to buy / invest in real estate, that is, for investors: 1) In order to start using the service, you need to install the browser based Metamask wallet (Google Chrome, Firefox or Opera), and then select the Rinkeby test network and log in 2) Then visit this link http://mvp.brem.top/ . . You get to the registration page, where you need to confirm the signature in your Metamask wallet. Then you go to the main page of the platform, which currently consists of two sections: Personal account and Marketplace. The existing projects for investment are placed in the Marketplace - in this section you can see the names and other parameters, like fees, for each of these projects 3) Next, you need to select a project (for example, a house in Austria or other available projects in any other country, since the project is international), click the ""Deposit ETH"" button and enter the amount of investment in a pop-up window that opens, and then confirm the transaction in Metamask wallet. The transaction and the deposit of tokens to your ether wallet will be displayed on the Ethereum network - ""Etherscan"". After that, you open the Marketplace window and see that the funds have been credited to the account, and as a percentage, the total investment displayed in the project has increased. Separately, it is worth noting that the investor has a refund function called Refund, which works if the project does not collect the required minimum investment threshold, in other words, Soft Cap. We now turn to the procedure for developers and / or contract creators: First of all, the BREM MVP project is a decentralized platform or interface for creating a MINI ICO inside the platform. Any developer can create a smart contract with specified parameters for investments and with the function of releasing tokens attached to the project, and start selling tokens that are a part of the project. Thus, the procedure is: 1As a contract creator, you enter the platform, where you are invited to authorize the ethereum address through Metamask, then go to the main page of the platform (for the time being, it is a common page for both buyers and project developers); 2To create a project, go to 'Marketplace' in the section ""Cabinet""; 3Then you get to the section where the projects you have already created are displayed, and you can add a new project using the ""ADD NEW"" button; 4Thus, you create a new project and enter its parameters, where: Name - enter a name for the project Description - enter the description of the project Thumbnail - attach a photo of the project Ending date - set the end date for project investment solicitation Map location - select the project location on the map Address - register the address of the project Token Name - enter the name of the token you are issuing for the project Soft Cap - set the minimum investment needed for the project, without which the project can not be implemented Rate - set the number of tokens per ETH, which the investor will receive Additional files - add supporting project documentation 5) After all these actions, using the ""Submit"" button, you confirm the creation of the project, and then confirm the transaction in Metamask - in the same way, by clicking on the ""Submit"" button. After the transaction, you can see your project on the Marketplace page. In addition, there is an auditor on the platform who has the right to release or block funds for the developer in accordance with the construction phase. In general, MVP turned out to be very clear and detailed, so with its help you can train yourself to invest in real estate or raise funds for construction right now. The main round of the sale of BREM tokens will start in the fourth quarter of this year - the BREM platform itself should be ready by April next year. ▶ ️ Project site: https://bremtoken.top/ ▶ ️ BREM platform: http://brem.top/ ▶ ️ MVP Project: http://mvp.brem.top/ ▶ ️ WHITEPAPER: https://bremtoken.top/assets/wp.pdf ▶ ️ MVP demo: https://youtu.be/d0ZGWkIY1j0",False

The East Village building contains 12 condos, each with 1700 square feet of space and each now tokenized on the Ethereum blockchain. The real estate property is now represented with a sum of tokens available for purchase on the blockchain. A token represents a portion of the value of the property, allowing people to invest in luxury condos even with a small investment, something which was previously very difficult if not impossible.  Bestselling author Ryan Serhant brokered the deal and favors tokenization as a viable modern financing method. Speaking to Forbes, Serhant said:  “The market in New York is always strong, but it can take some time to sell for the right price in a new construction building. With blockchain tokenization, we can remove the unruly pressure of traditional bank financing, which is much healthier for the project and all of the stakeholders. Tokenization is paving the way for a new forefront in real estate development.” Digital assets firm Propellr partnered with tokenization specialists Fluidity to tokenize the real estate and the firms will continue to collaborate in future. Propellr is a FINRA registered broker-dealer and will use its experience in capital markets to sell securities (both traditional and tokenized) under Reg D rule 506(c). Fluidity, on the other hand, offers tech services to broker-dealers and other financial institutions dealing in tokenized securities. The parent company of AirSwap, Fluidity ensures that Propellr can accept fiat payments in exchange for securities in a way that is legally compliant.  “Going to market with a landmark deal allows us to make a statement — that this technology is now real. With the right partners and an optimized structure, we are bringing a major real world asset online. We are grateful we have the opportunity to lead the blockchain community in this new paradigm,” says Michael Oved, co-founder of Fluidity.  Tokenizing Everything Real estate tokenization has been on the horizon for some time, and the tokenization of the luxury condo complex is a major step in seeing that use case realized. Tokenization can be applied to numerous other asset classes to increase liquidity and provide investment opportunities for smaller investors, potentially revolutionizing the investment industry.  In 2014, Visa CEO Charles Schaff stated the case for asset tokenization. Four years later, there are companies like ArtPro which will allow investors to purchase a sum of tokens representing an investment in classic and modern art pieces, whereas other projects like Inveniam are tokenizing global debt markets for investors to buy into. Binance recently led a $12 million funding round in tokenization startup Republic which aims to identify other tokenization investment opportunities as the list of use cases in asset tokenization continues to grow, providing new investment opportunities to the world through blockchain technology.

The BREM project — blockchain-based real estate, has now moved to the next stage of development. The private sale of tokens and onboarding of large private investors has begun. Sales have also started for investment pools — the first among them was the allocation to Satoshi Pool, which has three years of investment experience in ICO. In addition, a number of well-known foundations have become interested in the project, and negotiations are already underway. A remider to all that the decentralized fund Neuro DAO has already invested in BREM and is supporting the project in developing its crypto community.  As there are many large real estate players among potential investors, the creators of BREM are positively confident about generating sufficient operational funds from the tokens that are currently being sold, and a crowdsale may not be required. Good news: for the first large investors, BREM provides privileged conditions for working with the platform.  All issues with the listing of the project have already been resolved: the BREM token will be placed to trade on several exchanges within a month after the completion of ICO.  In particular, the Hong Kong exchange https://trade.minusexchange.com/ has become the official partner of the project — it will open the BREM token trade in the main cryptocurrency trading pairs.  The International Congress of Real Estate and Investments also opened at the weekend in Munich, where the first official presentation of the platform by BREM (https://youtu.be/so_SJ7r6SxU) team members took place, which is the general partner of the congress, and concluded an agreement on mutual cooperation in the field of blockchain technologies and bringing the platform to the European Real Estate Market.

Here, one can find all specialists and all kinds of real estate service providers, create unique requests and choose from the existing offers. The applicant and resource should not necessarily be in the same city. The payment process for the services could be made via a banking card or electronic wallets (Qiwi, WebMoney, Yandex.Money and other popular payment systems). If you feel concerned about financial aspects of a deal, you could choose “a safe deal”: in that case the funds are transferred though the service and get locked until the order closes. Arbitrage service is also provided, and one could apply for this service if something is not satisfying in the deal.  On the Pro.BREM portal only verified users can be registered. Each specialist is thoroughly vetted and only after that gets an access to the orders. The mail address and a phone number must be verified, also the links to the social networks pages would be required (if they exist, which increases the trust level). In this way the system sorts out the unreliable members. For the same purpose a rating system is used, which allows to define the best specialists and those that provide the best services. Every user would have an access to this information. The users rating is created in a way that there is no chance to cheat. One could increase the rating only by performing a qualified service. The reviews are left only by the deal's participants, so everything is transparent and fair.  There is no need to guess whether the specialist that you hired is good and will the work be finished in time, especially if you do not know anyone in a certain city or a country. With the help of pro.ber.top one could not only find a service provider or a profitable deal, but also save time, because it is a high-tech market aggregator. It is easy to work with BREM, and any question could be addressed to the project managers.  Test-version of the platform BREM 1.0 will be launched on December 25th. From that day the specialists and user registration will be open. Everyone, who would register an account until the end of January will receive 100$ worth of bonus BREM tokens, which could be used for payment of the platform services after the main functionality launch. General technical partner of the project, TDI (Tehnologi Digital Infinity), is planning to launch a basic functional platform in February of 2019. Updates are performed several times a month, constantly improving the system. All best technological practices and services will be integrated in this platform, for a great user experience.

The adoption of this technology will significantly change the real estate market. Transactions can be conducted electronically.  Thanks to the blockchain technology, the risk of being got into any trouble will be significantly reduced, because the whole process of buying and selling real estate will become transparent. Reliable information about the personal data of clients, documents on property and money transfers will be safely stored on the blockchain network. It will be meaningless to enter unreliable data, as they are checked and always visible to all users of the network. In addition, blockchain will provide an opportunity to register the right to property without leaving home. The need for notary services will disappear.  Blockchain technology relatively recently appeared on the property market, where the issue of trust and security of the transaction is acute. New technologies will help clients to be calm and they will not be subjected to pressures from outside. Users of the TheHome.today service, which is starting the ICO on November 23rd, will be able to choose their own property in a quiet environment, avoiding unnecessary stages and lowering financial and time costs. This will also simplify the process of buying and selling real estate and increase the trust factor when the transaction takes place.

You automatically loose more than half of the interest you might gain after the announcement. Unless you are being pressed by your investors i see no real reason why you would not invest more time into a better pitch. But hey, that's just my two cents  The real estate ICO idea is one of what i call a ""Future everyday commodity"" idea. When the blockchain technology develops, at a certain point, such real life transactions for common exchanges will become obsolete and automatically will start using blockchain. Shopping of any kind (with some exceptions here and there) will be done in parallel with real money or fully token based.  My initial thoughts about this - there's either going to be one big FinTech company running local token exchanges or even a whole corporation running it globally. This means that probably the first company to start and be successful with their ICO will have a leading chance in becoming that corporation/company running things.  Blockchains at the present time are producers of flagship companies at their respective industries  Good luck, Bob",False

There are multiple websites where you can look for options but it’s still a lot of hard work. We plan BREM to become your go-to place when looking for real-estate.  No Unified Access  When you are looking for a real-estate in some specific country, it is still an option to go through all local websites and evaluate the market. But what happens when you look for property world wide? It’s an enormous amount of information and a total mess at the same time. We plan BREM to become the single platform with world-wide real estate.  Bureaucratic Obstacles  Real estate is the market where bureaucracy flourishes. I can take up to 18 month to sort out the legal part of office rent for contract for companies. BREM is going to become a vital solution to this problem by utilizing the benefits of blockchain technology.  High Risk Of Fraud  Real-estate deals usually do involve a lot of money so there is nothing worse than encountering a fraud or scam. We offer BREM smart-contracts as an effective solution for any financial situation, no matter what they are: rent, purchase or investment.         Problems of investing in real estate market:   High Entry Level  Investing in a real-estate in a classical way means buying a high-value property and managing it. The real-estate market is also constantly growing so every year you need more and more money to join the big league. However, we created BREM to make it accessible and real invest in real estate even with $1,000 in the pocket.  Time-Consuming Market Analysis  Unless you are extremely qualified and indecently rich, you investment opportunities are limited to the local market. And even if you invest just there, it is still going to require a lot of analysis & research before actually investing.
