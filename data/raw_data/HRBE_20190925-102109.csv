We have however slowed down on partnerships following a fall out with IBM. We presented our innovation to IBM in Nairobi, Kenya, got a partnership invitation email and we were hoping to partner. They kept quiet and never replied to our emails. We were later shocked when the IBM employees and the Land LayBy team met during an information session organised by the Architectural Associaton of Kenya on issues touching on the blockchain technology and real estate. IBM employees denied that a blockchain platform ever existed in Kenya and made sure they manipulated the presentation. Land LayBy Kenya was never given a chance to engage the Architects despite being invited as thought leaders in blockchain innovation.  We have managed to secure strategic partners like the Strathmore College in Kenya http://www.strathmore.edu/news/land-layby-technologies-partners-with-strathmore-university-kenya/  Quote from: CEOKEY on August 07, 2018, 02:07:18 PM Land LayBy Listing is a project to help reduce fraud in the information about real estate. I think, in order to be accurate and up-to-date, does the project need to cooperate with land management agencies?  Our product is cleverly designed to intentionally avoid direct interaction with government officials or the government. One needs to grow and have lived in Africa to understand the ferocity of brides, corruption and land graft. We will build an independent ecosystem that relied on the community.

Correct, Land LayBy Listing, securing land rights through blockchain to facilitate sustainable development sums it all !

Questions: Why do you need so much money? Do you have any financial plan we can look out?  Thanks!  The financials are available but private. One thing you should understand is that we have a ready product and we are selling the solution through the ICO Platform. You will agree , this ICO is quite different from the rest, we don't just have an idea, we have implemented the idea and are selling the solution through ICO. By buying the utility keys, you are in essence buying access to the platform to either list your blocks of land to the blockchain, or access the blockchain data.  Whether we sell all tokens or none during the ICO is immaterial because the Land LayBy Listing project will still go on. We mean, even if we sold ZERO Harambee tokens during the ICO, the LLL will still continue and we will sell our solution through other outlets. The Harambee Tokens reserved for the producers are basically to incentivise the advocates, surveyors, financial institutions to record and post credible data to the blockchain. This LLL is like uber, it can be accessed by anyone in any part of the world, as long as there is a user (land buyer/landowner), producer ( advocate/surveyor) just like uber app required a rider and driver for it to operate in different jurisdictions.  Furthermore the process of mapping communal land and almost 90% of the land in Africa which is unregistered will involve incentivising the advocates, surveyors and many stakeholders. That's a big budget if you consider all the African countries not to mention other continents that are still developing and share the same land issues as Africa.  Many organisations like World Bank, UNEP, WHO will find value in our social impact project and we don't rule out the possibility of extra funding from these institutions.  Quote from: titoooooo on August 05, 2018, 09:21:37 AM The HBRE Tokens can be used to access certain advertising privileges and/or services for producers on the LLL (Finance agents, land sellers, individual projects, SACCOs and other land selling companies).  Quote from: AquaVitae on August 07, 2018, 02:14:14 PM I am really looking forward to what the future holds for this project. Their whitepaper and roadmap are informative and precise. I believe this project has potential to do well.  Thank for believing in us. Quote from: Erik_Smuel on August 07, 2018, 02:49:24 PM Real estate transactions engage multidisciplinary teams whose red tape prolongs the completion of transactions.  Blockchain records will certainly change this, since Blockchain renders land data as realtime information.  Quote from: GoldenAge Coin on August 03, 2018, 05:17:29 PM Is there any restriction period for the HBRE Token?  Yes, there are and here's excerpts from the whitepaper  . . In order to control and manage the ecosystem, all memberships acquired during presale will be subjected to some form of restrictions. Rules for certain memberships purchased at bonus rates will be subject to a special restrictions schedule to support a stable ecosystem. The restriction period commences on the date of distribution, not on the date of purchase. Distribution is scheduled for a month after the ICO/TDE. Participants buying memberships at a bonus rate of 9:1 will have access to 15 per cent of their total purchase after an initial restrictions period of 120 days following distribution. The next 25 percent will be restricted for an additional 180 days and a further 60 percent will be restricted for an additional 120 days. Participants buying memberships at bonus rate of 19:1 will have access to 25 per cent of their total purchase after an initial restriction period of 120 days following distribution. The other 25 per cent will be restricted for an additional 180 days and a further 50 percent will be restricted for an additional 120 days. Participants buying memberships at a bonus rate of 39:1 will have access to 35 per cent of their total purchase after an initial restriction period of 120 days following distribution. The other 65 percent will be restricted  for an additional 150 days. All the tokens reserved for the employees will be restricted as follows: employees and business partners will have access to five percent of their total allocated[11] tokens (other than what they have purchased) after an initial vesting period of 120 days following distribution. Another five percent will be restricted  for an additional 150 days and the next 10 percent will be restricted for a further 120 days. The remaining 80 percent will be restricted for additional 300 days and only accessible provided the employee or the partner worked for the project for a continuous and uninterrupted period of two years excluding the normal annual leave arrangements.

To participate in HRBE token generation event, you are required to have a corresponding ERC20 compliant web or app wallet. Wallet is the space that you use to store your private keys (Unique Addresses). To interact with basic smart contract functions like transfer of tokens, you need the private keys.  NB: You cannot participate on any Ethereum based token sale from a Cryptocurrency Exchange wallet. HRBE token sale is not endorsing any wallets. The following are the most commonly used ERC20 wallets.  I. MyEtherWallet (No Download Needed) II. MetaMask (Available on Firefox and Chrome browsers as an addon and a plugin respectively.) III.Mist (Requires download) IV. Parity(Requires download) V. ImToken (This provides App wallets. Available for iPhone and all phones running Android) VI. Trust VII. Cipher  After you have set up your preferred wallet, you will need to have funds in your wallet. The funds are in form of ETH or BTC. If you don’t have any Ether or Bitcoins, you can exchange normal currency for them at a cryptocurrency exchange. The cryptocurrency exchange will require you to open an account with them, where you will transfer the fiat currency (USD, EUR, AUD, GBP, KSH) in order to get market equivalent of the same either in Bitcoins or Ether. Your BTC or ETH will be sent to an online wallet that will be provided to you by the exchange. It is strongly advisable not to keep amounts in the exchange wallet due to security concerns. Again you cannot participate in the token generation event using cryptocurrency exchange wallet. Send the cryptocurrency to the ERC20 compliant wallet that you created earlier. Now you are fully equipped to participate in the HRBE token sale",False

We are first means we are brand new. Yes there are so many competitors regarding land acquisition issues. If you are telling me about online acquision then we have no competitors right now. Furthermore, The introduction of the fSE (Franchise Sales Executive) business enables our business partners and other stakeholders to conduct and manage their own real estate business while making huge commissions. This is specifically engineered to incentivize the land marketplace to quickly adopt selling of Land through Land Options. This distribution strategy ensures that LLB rapidly expands in a very competitive market to large-scale production of Land Options which will then disrupt and revolutionize the land marketplace. Attaining large scale production of Land Options implies that we can be able to offer land options at significantly lower rates hence attracting more players and ultimately creating our own market. The potential of offering subscription rights to Advocates, Surveyors, Architects, Land Valuers and other professions related to real estate (land sales) presents a great opportunity to seamlessly integrate the business with the Harambee token, consequently creating positive platform networks effects.",False

Tacit land information shared through generations is rarely upheld in cases of dispute and is often lost over time. Consequently, the general public is forced to trust the government to keep the land records intact. In an economy where trust is managed by a centralized authority, efforts to uphold trust are diffused by institutionalized asymmetry of information. We propose a solution through our blockchain platform to create a single Land LayBy Listing (LLL) of immutable and incorruptible land ownership details. Land detail entered on the LLL platform is secured through smart contracts. Access to the platform will be granted through the Harambee Token (HRBE). Our application of blockchain technology to decentralize our land option ledger, mirror the government’s land registry, and initiate the adoption of a decentralized ledger for the African land registry system, will be a strong gain for the economy. It will resurrect dead capital, facilitate economic development, and encourage sustainable investment. It will enhance land ownership rights and formalize land information that has been held in the minds of a chosen few in many communities throughout the continent. It is bound to affect all industries associated with the purchase, sale, and use of land; including the resources beneath, or on the surface.

The platform protects the users against deletion of information and legal documents by government officials, who may or may not act in self-interest.  I am actually a little bit familiar with the process of land acquisition in Kenya, mostly because I'm currently in  the process of .. acquiring some land for my home and possibly a safari lodge. How exactly does the system work? As far as I'm aware, the required documentation involves a number of sources, only some of which are government sources and the rest involve the parties to the title, title transfer agreement, family members, studies (such as environmental impact study) carried out by the developer, architect's documents, inspectors' clearances and so on.  Proofs that everyone have been heard. Sometimes there are contested developments, court documents, ancestral rights and reserves for roads, flooding, expansion of a public facility and so on that need to be addressed.  Can all this data be recorded and hashed in more than diverse format on the blockchain and securely stored in a tamper-proof manner in a location that isn't adversely impacted by anything that might or might not constitute an act of God, war, terrorism, earthquake, volcanic eruption, an unfortunate fire at the minister of finance's office hours prior to mandatory audit and so on?  2. A title to property, an election, or a certificate is just as good as the court that interprets its legitimacy. Can the system provide a paper trail and link the documents in some order of authenticity? even prove that they can be used as evidence just in case that comes up? cos it will, most likely.  3. I like land. But I think everyone likes land too. What if me and my rival, who is well-connected in politics, come up with identical documents proving our ownership to the same plot? assuming the documents are identical, but my rival is cheating - obviously - is there any third party that might be able to examine the documents more closely and even relate them to historical records pertaining that said title?

Quote from: regarcigar on July 25, 2018, 04:09:41 AM in my opinion the token HRBE project has a good concept, and ico sales will start in september although still long, this situation has been in the past by the team thinking, I also believe the team is also able to bring the project HRBE tokens will be successful  We have been planning about this project since 2015, and by end of 2016 we discovered blockchain use case and decided to pursue developing the architecture. We have a pending patent that awaits approval. The project is our only source of pride, we are therefore committed to make it happen. We will succeed.  Quote from: claudiotorch on July 25, 2018, 04:00:16 AM In theory the project is very interesting, but how will you going to deal with the legal and regulatory issues regarding blockchain and tokens in each country?  Thank you for the interest in our project. We have reviewed the Commonwealth law and continue to review the land tenure systems in different jurisdictions. As a rule of thumb, the Commonwealth countries follow almost the same legal principles. Kenya and Ghana have similar laws that govern land ownership. Besides, before we deploy the solution, we will have the solution tailor-made through our white-label solutions to fit a particular jurisdiction.  Quote from: Nggedebus on July 25, 2018, 03:37:27 AM This is a good concept, protecting the authenticity land ownership with the block chain technology. I really hope that it will be the most effective way on managing the ownership data of a land, since there are many un-resposible people making a fake data.  The only way for this to succeed is by recruiting a willing community that will support the cause. We have also used technology to enable this to happen, including the plan to build consensus algorithms that involve dense but pleasant intrinsic gamification principles.  Quote from: adjiadjo on July 25, 2018, 03:18:41 AM I saw you put SumSub logo in your partner section, So all the team already passed KYC/AML for ICO then? What are you going to do with unsold token (if there is any)? 237,500,000 Team Reserve vesting period? The current team is known to us (KYC passed), and are professionals and have been employed for a while. We know their sources of income. The organisation has their details. There is a vesting period for tokens delivered to the team as follows: All tokens reserved for the employees should be vested as follows; Employees and business partners will have access to 5% of their total allocated tokens (other than what they have purchased) after an initial vesting period of 120 days following distribution. Another 5% will be vested for an additional 150 days and the next 10% will be vested for a further 120 days. The remaining 80% will be vested for additional 300 days and only accessible provided the employee or the partner worked for the project for a continuous and uninterrupted period of 2 years excluding the normal annual leave arrangements.

The problem is, in many cases purchase and title records for landed property transactions aren’t readily available and are rarely upheld in cases of dispute. Such attempts to purchase therefore often end in loss of money and falling prey to fraudulent activities of agents and middlemen    What we are doing to solve it        We have designed a blockchain platform Land LayBy Listing (LLL), which provides a history of immutable and incorruptible land ownership details accessible by anyone where land transaction and title deed information can be verified by purchase of landed property from any part of the world.   Powered by the Harambee token (HRBE). Land LayBy will collaborate with independent data validators (approved advocates) to create an independent verification and single source of truth for land ownership. These records will be immutable, available to the public, government, law courts, financial agents and institutions and both land buyers and seller.  The Land LayBy Advantage (HRBE)    The Harambee Token (HRBE)   The Harambee Token (HRBE) is an Ethereum based ERC20 compliant utility cryptocurrency that will be used to access the Land LayBy Blockchain platform.
