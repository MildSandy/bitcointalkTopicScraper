I was holding 48 million COI when they offered the whole project to me for 8btc. I bought them at 4sat and held them for weeks. It's because of my agressive promotion of COI that the Devs added me as an Admin/Moderator of the tg group. The moment they gave me that offer on the phone call, which they sent Jyrupu their PR representative at the time who has run for his reputation now, he asked me on behalf of Sebastian to pay them 8btc if I wanted to be the new owner of the project because they have decided to leave the project. I said ok, where is the platform? He said the platform was a hoax. you can hire a real Developper and make of it a real project. I said I need to hear this from Sebastian if he wants to sell his project, then I need to talk to him directly. Sebastian refused because he was too afraid to share his contact number with me. I sold my 50mil COI before the end of the phone call. And I sold at a loss for the price 3 sat. Losing 0.5btc. I have proofs the Devs pumped and dumped the coin just before they made me this offer. Before this I complained to jirupu about the pump and dump they did and from anger I told him if they don't care about this project why don't they leave and let us manage it. Why are they against listing it in other exchanges while lying to the community that they are working on it? So they thought I'd take the hook. The rest is history.",False

Those situations are always uncomfortable for both parties and it is caused of lack of solutions in this matter.  Here is where the idea came to us - we will create platform for anyone in the business world which will be based on the innovative blockchain system and will provide to users fast, cheap and secure international payments.  I hope you will support our idea and I invite you to participate in this great project that will revolutionise the business online payments.    Coinnec is a blockchain powered anonymous decentralized platform with personalized token based on Ethereum's smart contract ecosystem for transactions with ERC20 standard. Coinnec is an innovative cryptocurrency powered solution for the business that allows service providers and clients to send and receive payments in a collaborative P2P network platform.  The revolutionary Coinnec platform is powered by its namesake Coinnec tokens. These tokens, built around Ethereum smart contract technology is the primary medium of value exchange over the Coinnec business ecosystem. These tokens can be easily stored on the userâ€™s preferred device using a personal desktop wallet, ERC20 compatible web-based wallets like MyEtherWallet or within the Coinnec platform itself.  Coinnec tokens make it easy for the users to purchase services and other content on the platform. Like any other popular cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ether and more), Coinnec tokens will be available for trading against other cryptocurrencies or fiat on some of the leading exchange platforms.     Coinnec adopts a pretty straightforward process for providers and users to sell and buy services and other digital content easily. The provider, willing to rent his time for a specified service on Coinnec uploads the offer file on the platform. Once uploaded, the information will be published in a peer to peer network, which is visible to the users. A user, browsing through the platform, or searching for a particular services can easily discover relevant offers.  Once a decision is made, user will pay XX% for the service selection with Coinnec tokens to run the service providing process and XX% remainder fee once itâ€™s complete to finalise the process. The transaction will be visible on the blockchain, thanks to its transparency. Following the confirmation of respective transaction on Ethereum blockchain, the provider will receive funds into his wallet. The provider will receive remainder 100% of the transaction minus a small fraction, payable to Ethereum network as gas to fuel the transaction.  Coinnec offers providers complete freedom to set the price and provide samples of their work to users. The sample work can be some demonstration images of the offered services.  Coinnec will continue to introduce new ways of work monetization for the benefit of providers. At the same time, end users stand to benefit from fast transactions and lower prices as providers can afford to let go of the commissions and third-party fees which they would have otherwise incurred over conventional distribution channels like banks or other payment brokers.        DECENTRALIZED No central authority, a network of nodes with zero-knowledge keeps you safe from malicious activity and attempts at stealing your information.     SOCIAL Make connections with users and meet new people through social networking, powered by new breakthroughs in blockchain technology using distributed computing.     SECURE The goal of Coinnec is to allow users to involve in a completely secure fashion thanks to strong cryptography, without giving up privacy to a central authority.      Road map:  - The Idea (2017, Q3) - Overflow description - Casting the dev team - Branding and promotion - Website development, social media involvement - Token distribution, crowdfunding - Application interface design presentation - Technical specification of the platform - Project Development - Public beta testing - Final platform delivered to the world (2020, Q2)      COIâ„¢ Token information:   Name: Coinnec Symbol: COI Decimals: 18 Standard: ERC20 (Ethereum based) Contract adress: 0x8a1a9477a710d470575b1da335e524b27e8091ab Explorer: https://etherscan.io/ Total supply: 1 000 000 000 COI Circulating supply: 950 000 000 COI Usage in future app: Yes Wallet: Parity - MyEtherWallet - MetaMask - Mist - Ethereum Wallet and any other wallets that allows adding custom ERC20 tokens (Ethereum based tokens).
