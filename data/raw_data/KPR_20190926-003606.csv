The Australian ICO for our KPR Coin has it's first and best value period open to purchase coins on the 1st of February 2018.  The dates for our ICO periods will be: 1-22 February - 1ETH:3000KPR 1-22 March - 1ETH:2000KPR 1-22 April - 1ETH:1000KPR  After setting 3 ICO periods we have had such a large demand that we expect to sell all of our coins in the first period, so get in fast!  The KPR Coin has been created by KPR Medical Solutions Pty Ltd, a 100% green energy medical cannabis farm, running off our own solar and wind energy.  The green energy will be used in mining for our partnership with Renewable Mining Australia who have been instrumental in the past year while developing a transparent, high performance platform for our coin.  The cofounders are all specialists in their fields:  - Alain d'Ombrille - Chief Executive Officer and Head of Farm Operations https://www.linkedin.com/in/alain-d-ombrille-8b7063145/  - Jason Tabrett CPA MBA - Chief Financial Officer https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasontabrettcpa/  - Matthew Young - Chief Technology Officer and Head KPR Coin Architect https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-young-017468a0/  We also have a number of public relations staff to assist with our media outreach and maintaining positive government connections around the medical cannabis industry.  Our coin will be able to be purchased in the form of an ERC-20 smart contract. We intend to have the coin available on multiple exchanges and have it readily accessible by anyone. These dates will vary dependent on how quickly our coins sell out during the ICO, but will be publicly announced.  Our website, Facebook and Twitter page provide our detailed white paper, with how we will be providing value for purchasing and holding our coins. Portions of company profits will be used to show our faith in our KPR Coin by purchasing our coins back off the market and holding supply which will increase the coins value and reduce the short-term trading fluctuations.

Our coin's specifications are best viewed on our publicly available GitHub page, but if you have any specific technical questions from that our main developer Matthew Young will be more than happy to address those.  https://github.com/KPRToken/KPR-code-for-ICO  To address the other questions:  1. The coin total supply is 100,000,000 KPR Coins. 2. There will be no pre-mining, however the ICO periods do receive the greatest number of KPR Coins in the first ICO period commencing of February 1st. 3. Our roadmap is in our White Paper.  Roadmap: 1. The funding raised from the KPR Coin ICO is used for KPR Coins launch on a number of exchanges, collaborating with our development team working on integration across many platforms to expand it's functionality. The funding is also used the purchase mining equipment to cover short-term cashflow and for the setup of KPR Medical Solutions land, building, wind and solar energy generators to supply 100% of both the farm and mining's power needs. 2. Expansion for the production of the medical cannabis farm and KPR Coin integrations. 3. The exciting thing about our project is the reinvestment of KPR Medical Solutions's profits into KPR Coin and expansion. We have committed that we will make partial payments out of profits to buy KPR Coin off the exchanges at market prices. This is because we believe in the value of our coin as a currency for our business, to prevent the effect of market manipulation over time by any major investors and of course to increase value in the demand of our coin. 4. Our development team will be looking at collaboration with ATMs, credit card facilities, Paypal and other third-party providers. It is difficult to commit to this prior to the ICO in the roadmap due to the requirement for initial funding and which vendors are more cooperative for collaboration, but we have strong plans for our coin!  If you get the chance to look at my LinkedIn profile, you will see that I have a strong ambition for success and we have chosen a team who share the same passions, as well as really wanting to help society obtain the medicines they need. Renewable energy farming and mining and a desire to become an employer of choice through great workplace relations are key values of ours.  Cheers,  Jason Tabrett CPA MBA",False

KPR are using an ERC20 Token for utility and transparency more than security.  The purpose of using a transparent coin transacting in the medical cannabis industry is to be 100% open about the nature of our transactions which are easily able to be traced by the government and general public.  We are a law abiding company and wish to demonstrate that with the transparency of our blockchain.  The ROI in % of our coin will vary dependent on the number of coins sold.  If we sell out our minimum market price will be $0.33 and with lower period 2 and 3 contributions if you do not buy within our first ICO period, we expect the market price to be $0.49 is we sell out in period 2 and $0.99 if we sell out during period 3.  Most ICOs when they hit the market have a large increase and then fall back to the prices quoted above. We have strong varying plans to profit regardless of the capital raised and a portion of the profits goes into expansion with the other portion used to purchase our KPR Coins at market prices.  This will reduce the volatility of our coin on the market but also adding to demand, should increase the coins value by 2-10% p.a. solely from our profit buy backs. As we continue to partner with our strong connections and improve on the implementation of our blockchain across payment fucntions, the organic growth should be quite large.  KPR Coin is NOT a coin whereby the founders are after a short profit and all founders will be holding their coins for the long-term.  Value growth will be strongly administered to benefit everyone owning and those using KPR Coins.",False
