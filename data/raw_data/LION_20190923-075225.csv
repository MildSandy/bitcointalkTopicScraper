We are working hard to launch the full platform. Please see below for our most recent update. We have been a bit absent on Bitcoin Talk over the last few months. We plan to engage more here as we gear up for platform launch.  Most recent announcement: https://blog.coinlion.com/coinlion-progress-announcement-roadmap-update-da5e215b5256  CoinLion Progress Announcement & Roadmap Update CoinLion strongly believes that transparency is crucial in building trust and the CoinLion community. We have been extremely busy over the last few months.  What‚Äôs been done so far: ¬∑ Platform designs for desktop and mobile versions  ¬∑ Backend matching engine  ¬∑ Major trading functions  ¬∑ Charting  ¬∑ Deposits / withdrawals  ¬∑ Submission of money transmitter applications  ¬∑ BSA/AML/KYC policies  ¬∑ Cyber security policies and procedures  ¬∑ Registration with FinCen as MSB  ¬∑ Cyber security insurance  ¬∑ Launch of the MVP Research Portal (Login/Signup)  ¬∑ Hiring of several new team members  What is being worked on: ¬∑ Finishing front-end development  ¬∑ Portfolio management tools  ¬∑ Social components and integration with the research portal  ¬∑ Platform security measures  What‚Äôs next: ¬∑ Deploy Platform  ¬∑ Continued internal testing by the team  ¬∑ Security and penetration testing by third parties  ¬∑ Policies and procedures audits by third parties  ¬∑ Launch platform to the public  Roadmap Update We have added a progress tracker so you can follow along with the development of the platform. Much of the platform has been completed but several essential tasks remain.  CoinLion‚Äôs main priorities are the security of user‚Äôs funds and compliance around all required policies. We have chosen to undergo several redundant third-party security and penetration audits, as well as internal policy and procedure audits. These audits will take additional time to complete and need to be scheduled around the capacity of the third parties we are working with. We had originally hoped to launch an MVP version of the platform in phases. However, after much deliberation we have decided to launch the full platform at one time instead. Before launch we will perform multiple audits and security tests. Performing these audits on the entire platform at one time reduces additional cost and ensures nothing is overlooked. To be a sustainable and secure platform for years to come, this decision is necessary.  We would be doing the community a disservice if the platform were to launch without these security measures in place.  We will be updating the roadmap to reflect this decision, the current progress to date, and the additional time needed to ensure security and compliance. We had originally anticipated a July launch of the MVP with a limited selection of coins with a full platform launch around September. We now anticipate a full platform launch early Q4 2018. We appreciate the continued support and patience as we work hard to deliver a world-class trading platform.",False

I'm invested since the ICO (I was under the first 20 Investors or so in the pre-sale), never sold but bought more.  What many don't get is: Exchanges are complicated stuff, it needs a lot. That's also why it takes some time. Similar to LGO, who also started over a year ago and are starting now. Or NASH... All are different, but they all have great teams and I bought into all of them. What I really like about Coinlion: The combination of Trading, Portfolio-Management and Social Platform. I believe that can be very attracting for many and in best case become a viral-phenomenon.  Another aspect is: Many are impatient but I believe that Coinlion has a very good timing. A full launch 3 months ago would not have gotten the attention it deserves, simply because the general market was too quit.

We have two backup plans in place if regulators make it difficult for us. One is to File under a Regulation A - We would need to move the Token Sale back if that happened - we are not expecting this to happen.  The second plan would be to raise the money through venture capital and accredited investors - we have already raised a substantial amount through private offerings and believe we would be able to raise the full amount we need if we had to take this route.

CoinLion - One Exchange to Rule Them All  DO WE NEED ANOTHER EXCHANGE? You may not know it, but there is a silent war carrying on within the cyptocurrency world. It‚Äôs a war waged over crypto exchange market share, and the battleground is which exchange will be the first to offer the most complete package. A package that satisfies the needs of the consumer as well as the needs of ICO businesses looking to enter the market.  Exchanges are arguably what makes the cryptocurrency world turn. Without them, the market wouldn‚Äôt be able to operate. The Exchange market share is not trivial, as big money is at stake. However, the competition is fierce as there are more exchanges in the market than you can shake a stick at. In sum, you better have a damn good value proposition at this point if you think you deserve a spot at the table.  To compete, new businesses generally embrace the tried and true strategy of ‚Äúone-upping‚Äù your competition. As a result, watching the exchange industry mature is almost like watching Game of Thrones, where exchanges try to find the right combination of capabilities that will win customer hearts and the Iron Throne. The combination might be mean a better marketing budget, interface, or just several items that represent a better overall package. This escalation naturally occurs within industries that are maturing. We know it commonly as ‚Äúprogress.‚Äù This is a good thing because the consumer is the big winner after the dust settles.  I can‚Äôt speak for everyone, but there are exchanges that I love and ones that I can‚Äôt stand to use. Like myself, I bet each person has a threshold where it just isn‚Äôt worth the frustration to use and I‚Äôm sure most people, like myself, looks for the first opportunity to transfer assets out. However, the cryptocurrency market is still maturing, and I think we are now witnessing the second generation of exchanges.  To conclude, I‚Äôll answer the original question and say that I do believe there is room for improvement. If business is war then CoinLion has armed itself with a robust value proposition and waiting to enter the fray.  COINLION VISION CoinLion‚Äôs vision is to create an ecosystem whereby users will be able to manage their digital assets (cryptocurrency) and use a variety of analytic tools to become a better investor/trader. In other words, CoinLion wants to be a one-stop-shop trading platform.  Part of the solution is having the right tools, and the other part is creating a robust ecosystem/community were a person can learn, grow and share ideas.  COINLION VALUE PROPOSITION Every exchange thinks their business model and capabilities are the best. I‚Äôm going to spare you from talking about CoinLion‚Äôs the baseline capabilities that I feel, all exchanges, at the minimum, should offer at a high-level, such as friendly user interface, security, and customer service. Instead, I‚Äôll focus on CoinLion‚Äôs unique offerings (Portfolio Management Tool, Dual Blockchain System, ICO underwriting, and several security features) that will set them apart from the rest of the crowd.  PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT TOOL AND LEVERAGING COMMUNITY WISDOM CoinLion‚Äôs answer to the tool part of the equation is their Portfolio Management Tool (PMT). CoinLion‚Äôs PMT will allow users to create multiple portfolios to manage their digital assets in a simple and efficient manner.  At the same time, CoinLion members will also be able to share their portfolios, strategies, and research with like-minded CoinLion members. That is the other half of the equation, which is to create an ecosystem/community.  CoinLion members will also be able to generate revenue and win bonuses from CoinLion and other members when they allow their portfolio(s) to be publicly tracked and published. In other words, this allows traders to generate LION (CoinLion‚Äôs native token) simply for sharing their portfolios and strategies within the community.  DUAL BLOCKCHAIN SYSTEM (DBS) I‚Äôm not familiar with many blockchains that have adopted this system. Vericoin (VRC) is the only one that I‚Äôm aware of that has adopted the architecture. It is highly likely that CoinLion is the first and only exchange to adopt it.  DBS is designed for speed to track and monitor transactions. Each blockchain serves a specific purpose and when working together it makes it possible to achieve complete integrity, immutability (unchangeable), and transparency.  CoinLion uses one blockchain to store specific data related buy and sell orders to sync with the matching engine. CoinLion‚Äôs second blockchain stores data specific to each transaction. This dual blockchain uses geographically distributed nodes to confirm transactions and preserve the decentralized nature of the blockchain.  ICO UNDERWRITING Offering ICO underwriting isn‚Äôt a new concept. Cobinhood also offers underwriting services. The difference is Cobinhood plans to subsidize user exchange fees with their underwriting revenue, while CoinLion‚Äôs service will list new coins to the platform and LION holders will have access to purchase ICOs at a discounted rate.  While underwriting serves the purpose to offer quality coins on the platform as well as provide added liquidity for new coins, the main purpose is to capture businesses looking for an advantage by getting a head start. It‚Äôs a situation where everyone can win.  SECURITY - CIRCUIT BREAKER/COLD STORAGE/INSURANCE I know I said earlier that 100% security should be a given. However, I feel compelled to write a few distinct platform features that are uncommon with the first generation of exchanges.  Circuit Breaker: CoinLion‚Äôs platform will include a built-in circuit breaker (same as traditional stock exchanges) to protect from flash crashes. The circuit breaker will be available for main currencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). However, the circuit breaker is not designed to prevent integrity of the markets, instead it exists to protect specific currencies from moving 25% in 5 minutes. In the event of a 25% move in a 5 minute period trading will halt for an hour. As currencies mature, more will be added to the policy.  Cold Storage: CoinLion stores 98% of deposits in cold storage. The remaining 2% will be used to facilitate faster processing of withdrawals.  Insurance: Hacking is a high risk. Chinese exchange GBL and Mount GOX lost a combined 395 million worth of BTC. While those examples happened several years ago, the risk persists today.  To quell investor worry, CoinLion will offer full pay out insurance if CoinLion has a (successful) attack on its online storage. As an added insurance for United States residents, FDIC will insure accounts up to $250,000. FDIC involvement is a first that I‚Äôve seen.  THE LION TOKEN CoinLion‚Äôs ERC-20 native token‚Äôs symbol is LION. It will be used to reward and incentivize users to create and share portfolios, strategies and research within the CoinLion ecosystem.  LION HODLers will be able to spend the token for these purposes:  SPENDSIDE EARNSIDE Trade for free (only applies to LION trading)   Publicly share your portfolio to allow others to track it Receive 25% discount to the maker/taker trading cost schedule   Advertise your portfolio Create, track, advertise, and duplicate portfolios   Create and share strategies with other users Access research and analytics   Create and share research for other members or COINLION research and analytics library Access to ICOs launched within the platform   Earn LION for being a top performer or researcher ICO DISTRIBUTION DETAILS CIRCULATION: 250,000,000 at ICO TOTAL CIRCULATION: 500,000,000  ACCEPTED CURRENCY: ETH MIN ACCEPTED: 0.1 ETH  ICO PHASE BONUS EXCHANGE RATE Pre-sale   40%   1 ETH = 3500 Phase 1: Week 1 (18/DEC-7/JAN)   20%   1 ETH = 3000 Phase 1: Week 2   15%   1 ETH = 2865 Phase 1: Week 3   10%   1 ETH = 2700 12 Phase 2: Week 1 (12/FEB-25/FEB)   5%   1 ETH = 2625 Phase 2: Week 2   0%   1 ETH = 2500 **ROADMAP** DECEMBER 11, 2017 ‚Äì LION TOKEN PRE-SALE OPENS DECEMBER 18, 2017 ‚Äì LION TOKE SALE OPENS (PHASE 1) FEBRUARY 12, 2017 ‚Äì LION TOKE SALE OPENS (PHASE 2) FEBRUARY 25, 2018 ‚Äì FINAL PHASE OF TOKEN SALE COINLIONOSES JULY 7, 2018 ‚Äì LION TOKEN OPEN FOR TRADING ON THE CONLION PLATFORM AUGUST 2018 ‚Äì ONGOING DEVELOPMENT & NEW COINS CONTINUALLY ADDED  FINAL THOUGHTS CoinLion‚Äôs vision is certainly ambitious because it‚Äôs a new concept. The addition of their PMT and building a strong community depends on one thing: active users that find value in the CoinLion‚Äôs ecosystem. At this point everything is theory. CoinLion won‚Äôt know if they have a hit until they see user data (registration, attrition, retention, PMT use, etc.). I‚Äôm sure CoinLion is looking for a userbase tipping point level where the PMT tools will increase in value as more members hop aboard. CoinLion may also need to tweak the incentives to join and build a strong user community.  Regardless, I think CoinLion represents the 2nd generation of exchanges where users don‚Äôt just trade, but also interact and share ideas with other like-minded users. It‚Äôs almost a hybrid between an exchange and social media site, but native to the CoinLion platform.  I also noted that this is the second exchange that will offer ICO underwriting services. I think it‚Äôs a great idea. I hope ICOs will start noticing that they can raise more funds through underwriting. As an investor, I want to pick a company that is going through an underwriting process over one that is not.  In addition, I will feel more secure with exchanges that have a strong insurance policy against hacking. While insurance won‚Äôt cover someone targeting me (not the platform), I hope insurance also becomes more of a standard in the industry.  Overall, I‚Äôm excited to use CoinLion‚Äôs platform to see how it matures. This type of exchange is a step in the right direction.",False

Down the road we will also look to create a community voting center to vote on certain features and adds in to the platform.  This idea also aligns with the due diligence process of our ICO underwriting as well as the functionality of the Digital Asset Screener. The CoinLion platform will evolve as we move forward. The success of the token sale will ultimately dictate the deliverables.  Thanks for the questions!",False

This is a good question. We feel we can build many of these features for our min goal. Some of these additional features that we want to add will be achievable along the way. Even if we hit our min goal we have other options to be able to expand. There are institutional eyes watching us and if people will gravitate to the project we will be able to sustain CoinLion long-term. If we hit can even achieve the minimum goal many doors will be opened to continue the project and we will be able to get the funding we need to grow CoinLion to the full vision for the platform.  We also have had numerous conversations about additional features that we haven't included in the white paper and if we hit our full goal we will be able to include them. Features such as integrated debit cards, decentralized dashboard, fully customizable dashboards and more. We have just recently partnered with an incredible development team who will be building out aspects of the platform. We will have a workable demo within two weeks.

We believe trading cryptocurrencies should be a rewarding process. CoinLion empowers digital currency investors to trade and manage portfolios under one powerful platform while providing market research and analytics to enable smart trading. CoinLion users can earn the native token LION for sharing portfolios, research, data and strategies with users.  In a rapidly expanding market with no simple solution, CoinLion users enjoy access to a dedicated customer service team devoted to answering questions and keeping up with evolving regulatory and compliant standards.  Beginnings Throughout history the lion has long been a symbol of stability, power, and trust.  For that reason it has appeared on coins dating back as early as 600BC. Lion Coins are some the world‚Äôs oldest coins and were important in the creation of history‚Äôs first civilizations. Times and technology have changed, but the principles remain the same. CoinLion was founded on the symbolism the lion embodies and aims to be synonymous with a name users can trust.  CoinLion Platform   Portfolio Management Tool (PMT) - view the CoinLion Portfolio Management tool[/b][/u]   The CoinLion PMT is a state-of-the-art portfolio management tool. It allows users to create and manage portfolios in a simple and efficient manner. With the PMT users can buy and sell multiple assets with a single click.  Users can select to purchase a group of assets by amount, quantity, or percentage, and submit the order in one click. Market orders will be executed at the best possible price across the various assets. Users can choose to execute these orders at the market price, or choose to place more advanced orders for each asset. This allows portfolios to be managed easily and efficiently, putting the user in total control of their assets.  CoinLion PMT also allows users to publish portfolios and name their price in LION for allowing other users to track their portfolios. Publishers of portfolios can set a cost in LION for tracking a specific portfolio over a period: monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or yearly. This empowers users by providing a means to generate LION for creating and sharing portfolios. The user also has the option to allow their portfolio to be publicly tracked and published to the portfolio tracker within CoinLion. This allows to users to showcase their skills when it comes to managing digital assets, and in turn generate additional LION by driving traffic to the portfolio. Top performers within the CoinLion Platform will receive LION bonuses from CoinLion.  Wide Variety of Fiat, Crypto & Digital Assets CoinLion will support a wide variety of fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and digital assets. As digital assets and currencies are continually being created, having simple and efficient access to those assets is critical.  Publishing and Promotional Toolset CoinLion‚Äôs portfolio publishing and promotional toolset lets users publish created portfolios and content. Users can create and publish content related to digital assets. Users will have the option to add a price in LION for access to features on their profile. This could include access to portfolios, research, or strategies. Users will leverage their profiles to earn LION for creating and publishing portfolios, research, strategies, and more. The promotional toolset will also allow users to share their portfolios and content across various social media platforms.  ICO Underwriting CoinLion will offer an ICO underwriting service which will list new coins to the platform. LION holders will have access to purchase these ICOs at a discounted rate. CoinLion will use a rigorous due diligence process when evaluating adding a new coin to the platform. This is a six-step process that utilizes a set of criteria to rank potential ICOs. The due diligence process follows a robust qualitative and quantitative analysis to evaluate and select coins for the platform. Elements of the core screening process are customized to each coin. The quantitative factors include market size, projected growth potential, project duration and risk factors. The quantitative factor screen helps to eliminate projects that we feel are unlikely to be successful or deliver value to the purchasers or the platform.  The qualitative factors include factors such as team, industry applications, marketing efforts, and utility. Each factor is analyzed using the six-step process and given a quantitative ranking resulting in an overall score. Only the top ICOs evaluated will be listed on the CoinLion Platform. ICO underwriting serves two purposes. The first is to offer users a wide variety of quality new coins on the platform. The second is to provide added liquidity for new coins.  Blazing Fast Trade Execution, Atomic Swaps, Raiden and Lightning Networks Orders are facilitated using a dedicated order matching engine. This engine matches trading pairs at lightning speeds ensuring users are provided with the best execution possible. CoinLion utilizes new and emerging networks and technologies to provide users with alternatives to the traditional methods of trading and exchanging digital assets. Part of the CoinLion‚Äôs commitment to excellence insures that ongoing new technologies will be added to the platform.  LION Market CoinLion will maintain a market in LION. When trading in the LION market, users will enjoy free trades. This will work to ensure LION liquidity and stability over time.  Cutting Edge Trading Tools The CoinLion Platform contains a suite of state-of-the-art trading and analytics tools. Choose from hundreds of studies to implement into portfolios, including a wide array of charting and technical analysis tools.  Digital Asset Screener CoinLion implements the first-of-its-kind cryptocurrency and digital asset screener. This allows users to screen and rank criteria when selecting assets and portfolios, and easily implement them into their holdings. Criteria will be scaled as more information is known and as more portfolios are created. Initial criteria will include: market cap, price, volume, performance, maturity, and more.  Simple & Powerful User Interface CoinLion provides a world-class user experience when it comes to trading and managing digital assets. User information is displayed clearly. Access to tools and information is readily available. Users have the ability to customize views to their liking. Portfolio views and allocation views are easy to read and understand. The portfolio management tool is easy to use and powerful, giving users a simple and powerful way to create and manage portfolios.  Research, Analytics, & Data CoinLion will be providing a world-class research and analytics library compiled by the research of the users. CoinLion will be purchasing research from users using LION. In addition to free research and analytics, the research library will contain premium content available to access with LION.  Sophisticated Reporting A robust reporting system uses information from the dual blockchain system and platform data to create a variety of reports for users to access. These reports make it easy for users to access the information they need. Reports include, but are not limited to, gain and loss reports, performance reports, transaction reports and more. These reports will aid users in tracking various metrics for purposes such as tax reporting, performance tracking, cost tracking and more.  Algorithmic Trading Support The CoinLion trading Platform is designed to provide a powerful trading experience. We understand that traders also trade through third-party platforms and design their own algorithmic trading bots. Our commitment is to provide the best trading experience possible, and we designed our APIs to allow for high frequency algorithmic trading.  Integrated Banking CoinLion integrates with consumer bank accounts to provide the user with a comprehensive view of their holdings. CoinLion will allow users to aggregate their holdings into one view. This will allow users to evaluate their overall financial position including their crypto holdings.  Technical The CoinLion Platform will be built using the latest technologies, including Go. Each component of the platform will be designed as a scalable micro-service and communicate via APIs. CoinLion uses Docker and other virtualization technologies to allow for quick testing and deployment of updates in a controlled manner to each environment through all phases: development, testing, and production.  CoinLion‚Äôs order book system will be broken into two independent but interconnected blockchains. The matching algorithm can process over a million buy/sell orders and complete transactions within seconds. The order book application will leverage the first blockchain to maintain data integrity and immutability of orders, and the matching system will finalize the orders and complete the transactions to their respective blockchains. The dual blockchain system is designed to keep track of the orders within the platform and be a source of data. In addition to Ethereum, Bitcoin, and LION markets, we will be able to add other cryptocurrencies and markets to the platform as it evolves.  The CoinLion exchange utilizes a hybrid model of both centralized and decentralized technology to deliver the best possible performance. The core code, which is doing the heavy lifting, is written in Go. Smart contracts are written in the Solidity language native to Ethereum. The CoinLion Platform will interact with smart contacts to facilitate tasks related to the Ethereum blockchain.  As CoinLion moves beyond the token sale and launch of the platform, the ongoing research and development will determine feasibility of moving to a decentralized model. Our team has extensively evaluated all the possible methods and technologies in which to build the CoinLion Platform. While the CoinLion team strongly supports a decentralized model, currently a hybrid model provides a better user experience. CoinLion has also researched chain interoperability. As blockchains become more prevalent, interoperability will be addressed. CoinLion will utilize all necessary technologies to give the user the best possible experience.",False
