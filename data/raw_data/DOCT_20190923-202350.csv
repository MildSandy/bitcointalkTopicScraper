What advantage do they give? In whitepaper, this question is poorly described. What means ""time"" on your platform   Great question.  The DOCT tokens will be specifically utilized with the DocTailor platform. Any user of DOCT tokens will have access to use the platform. The term ""DOC time"" refers to that time. The coin of the phrase comes from users having ""time to create documents"".  Each token will enable the users to have a set amount of time to use the platform.  The more amount of tokens paid to use the platform at a given time will enable users to have an increase of time to use the platform.  I hope that this brings more light into the ""Doc Time"" question.  We are happy to answer any more questions that anyone has ",False

In theory, if you simply log in pay a certain amount of tokens that give you an allotted time you do open yourself up to the possibility that at least some duration of your token will be used.

Of course, entering different legal jurisdictions can create issues if due diligence is not properly executed.  To your point about the high volume of legal transactions; we shed light in our whitepaper that many businesses have yet to incorporate smart contracts into their businesses.

Before any contract can be accessed by a third party for use or a new contract can be created for legal use it will be approved and certified by a legal professional to ensure the legality of the contract.

Only the party the initiates the signing of the documentation will really need to have access to the platform.   For example, it is like saying that both parties must talk to the same lawyer in order for a contact to be initiated, which is incorrect.  One party is required to start the process, make the necessary clauses and wording of the contract. The second party would only need to read, approve and sign the contract.
