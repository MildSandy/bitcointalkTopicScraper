As the investment value has dropping to an almost mystic >95% (BTC speaking, USD speaking I think it could be more than 99%), it's possible to ask you for a legit certificate of the amount invested in the ICO? For taxation purposes, it will be a real pity if we cannot declare the patrimonial lost at least.  2- It would be nice for holders to have a litoshi market when unload their bags. I know the... three??  added decimals in HitBTC, but trading in litoshi is better than those scammy added decimals in BTC than then will not allow you to make anything with the received dust.  Thank you very much",False

Our team is diligently working on the development of multiple platforms as well as major upcoming exclusive Slate events. With the launch of these platforms and live events, we will share exciting news with our community on a consistent and ongoing basis.  Slate is not a typical cryptocurrency company, in fact, we are not a crypto company.  We are a visionary entertainment company leveraging blockchain technology to make for a better industry as a whole. We feel that out of all the major industries leveraging blockchain, entertainment can benefit to the highest degree making Slate a major disrupter in the space.  A large percentage of our platforms and technology are proprietary. We are competing with major brands in the industry and need to keep our business initiatives private for the time being.  Unfortunately, our predecessors in the blockchain space did not do anyone any favors. Listings, news and creating FOMO is NOT a way to increase the value of the currency any longer which you’ve seen in the past. The companies that will succeed will be the ones who have built a revenue-generating business with a practical use of the technology. Slate aims to separate itself from other currencies by operating a real business and launching massive awareness campaigns when the time is right.  We have agreements with large exchanges in place which we will be listing SLX coinciding with the release of our platforms.  We appreciate your feedback and look forward to showing our community the true value Slate is quietly creating.  Thank you  Team Slate",False

But in this case, the money supply metrics, mainly in MN's ROI and total inflation, have created a evil situation in which MN's tend to centralisation, has MN's ROI is so high, MN's owners get enough coins for new MN's so fast they become a small group dominating most MN's, with all the problems it can cause, and the dump they cause in price selling part of the income to pay server/maintenance cost made POS less profitable each day, reducing the POS wallet number working in the net and causing more centralisation. The initial idea could have some edge, that's why I invested some amount in the initial round of the ICO, but the solution chosen was... let's say very amateur. And well, sum up this with very few activity in github, social media and no visible develompment yet and you have the savage drop in value of the project. Salute",False

We are not accusing SLATE.io of a scam -  Just to be clear.  We post in this thread so the community can help us to identify certain cases and we can inform those who raised questions about your ICO.

As you should be aware there are many scams in the market, and once valid questions are raised the best is clear them out to distinguish from the fake ICOs.  Also there are many fake Linkedin accounts.

Finally. About time some one busted p the monopolies. Government sure af won't do anything about it.  I know everyone loves Netflix. But Netflix is a disaster. Any time a company has that much power it's bad news. right now their monthly fees are subsidized by new subscribers. It's literally a Ponzi scheme. But look out. Netflix is gonna stick us with the bill when out-of-control costs outrun new income.  What's worse is the wreckage Netflix will leave on the wake of greed. They're slowly destroying filmmakers by slow playing payments.  A friend of mine signed with Netflix and won't get paid in full until four years later! What's wrong with these people!! It's not like they don't have money.  Get this. His show is actually a decent hit. Lots of people are signing up with Netflix just to see it. But the contract is fixed in their favor. Even if his show goes completely viral he'll never see a dime more after they finally pay out four years later. Maybe you're thinking what an idiot. He shouldn't've signed. You gotta realized he's got no power to negotiate. I mean, sure he could try to get signed with Amazon, but it's the same.  The whole entertainment industry is a conglomerate of monopolies. Crypto is the only way to fight back. Picture this. If my buddy partnered with Binge, he'd not only get paid up front for his show, but every time it's watched. If it goes viral, he gets paid. That's capitalism as it should be.  Let's take it further. Imagine my buddy's show appeals to Asian Americans (true btw). And he has access to info about whose watching, when, how much, etc. What if he starts to market to Asia and gets like massive crossover boost? Maybe goes viral in Korea? Could change his career. Make his career.  Slate is a no-brainer. New world order. It's about time for a revolution.",False

It looks like Slate is taking on huge established competition.  For streaming video with Binge, Slate will be competing with powerhouse corporations like Netflix, Hulu, YouTube (Google), Amazon. And taking on some of the other decentralized projects in the space. As far as I know, the other decentralized projects are basically ICO projects that haven't reached maturity.  For ticketing, Slatix  will be competing with established behemoths like Ticketmaster, Fandango, and Stubhub. There are probably other decentralized ticketing projects, too, but I haven't researched those as much.  For ratings and reviews, looks like Slatix is also goin up against major industry forces like Rotten Tomatoes, Metacritic, IMDB (Amazon).  I want to understand more about how exactly Slate uses blockchain to disrupt this like multibillion dollar industry. Even if they completely sell out, will it be enough capital to take the fight to Wall Street giants?  That said, I haven't seen such a strong ANN in a while. So the guys asking what's going to happen if they don't meet their min target kinda make me laugh. This project is super ambitious. If it's for real, the pre-sale price is a great opportunity. I just hope they don't sell out on the first day because they're going to need the funds to make this all happen.  Seriously, if blockchain can actually compete with Netflix, Google, and Amazon, this thing is gonna go off the charts.  Anyhow, I'm definitely into this, but I've gotta read the white paper more closely before I weigh in. I'll update later.",False

Binge is actively acquiring premiere content, while Slatix has adoptions in place with major cinemas, that will soon be announced.  Corporations like Netflix or Ticketmaster are public companies and move like dinosaurs, so moving into the ""blockchain space"" would be a very slow transition, which in turn gives us an upper hand. Binge's rich analytics and transparency is making us an instant leader in the space and will in-return receive the best content in the world has to offer. Film makers, producers and content providers are fed up with the old Hollywood model of the creative accounting.  Binge's blockchain technology offers real time payments to producers and makes it virtually impossible to rip-off content creators. Netflix does not give film makers and producers back-end residuals, therefore Binge will be the first streaming platform to offer a true profit share of streaming revenues based off of timed viewership.
