You can easily check my words by going into their Facebook profile https://fb.me/RusGasOfficial https://clip2net.com/clip/m0/63d89-clip-228kb.png?nocache=1  The same thing in other social media of this company. Everywhere you will see the post on May 22-23 among the last in their profiles.  That was the last day we decided to work with them because they did not pay for 3 weeks.  As I know manager of the company went to London with money because none of the exchanges wanted to list them. While investors were waiting for exchanges.  I dont know the exact situation by now. All i know that these guys did not get 2.2 mln$ and they still owe me money for the work of 3 weeks. They have to pay me 1500$ and they simply ignore me. I tried to write directly to ico@rusgas.io - they answered me once and then also started ignoring me.  If the representatives of this company wont answer me within 24 hours, i will try to do my best so that as many people as possible could know that these guys are SCAMers.",False

Dear community, we will start with the news regarding placement and access to the stock exchanges.  First we went to a small exchange Crex24, which is now actively trading. Turnover increased several times, and now we are in second place in terms of trading volume!  And in the near future we will come out on much more famous and popular sites: BiteBTC.com and Yobit.io. Thanks to this, we expect to increase interest in the project and the number of active traders in tens and hundreds of times!  At the same time, unfortunately, in negotiations with Bittrex and HitBTC, we can not yet come to a sufficiently favorable agreement, so the access to them is being postponed.  We are also happy to announce that now you can find us on such well-known and popular analytical sites as Coinmarketcap.com and coingecko.com. Getting there is not so easy and not every project can boast of it!  https://a.radikal.ru/a29/1808/e0/4ae99a310635.png  ANd this is not the main news, very soon we will surprise you with unexpected and very good messages!  Stay tuned and thanks for supporting RusGas!",False
