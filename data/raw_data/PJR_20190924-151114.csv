The Platform’s name is INCODIUM  Incodium has developed a solution to protect users and investors against the rising threat of cryptocurrency hacks. Incodium is achieving this through an API-based Smart Contract Solution.  The cryptocurrency market’s valuation has crossed the $300 billion mark. As the value of the market grows, there is an urgent need to beef up security measures. Given the rapidly increasing in cryptocurrency exchange hacks, there needs to be a solution to this problem.  Until now, when an exchange gets hacked, the process of identification of theft and compensation to the user take days or even weeks to be processed at times.  Incodium aims to revolutionize the way compensation is provided through a simple, transparent and actionable platform. Their “Smart Compensation Protection” service determines the extent of the loss occurred and the amount of compensation that needs to be provided.  The compensation amount is calculated using these three parameters:  1. 30 times the amount of Incodium coin owned  2. 10,000 USD  3. Actual damage  The amount which will be compensated to the user is the lowest out of the three mentioned parameters.

EtherInc does this by building what is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a blockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, allowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized applications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for ownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. A bare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, and other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be built in under twenty.

We are going to mix existing ideas with existing ecosystems, even step into systems through existing channels and to bring certain possibilities to market attention. The regular item that everybody trades is a buy-sell agreement. It is very easy to understand, every investor can buy stock and assume that what is happening behind the electronic market system, how the trade matching takes place and what are the consequences in the accounts when the deals are finally closed. An ecosystem which is mostly the same as stock market and built only for claims, rights, and receivables, operates on the basis of assignment agreement, has a great opportunity to spread around the world and to gain customers everywhere.   How does the project create value to the ecosystem and differs from competing projects  Ziggurat Tokens represents a decentralized virtual currency represented in specialized Ethereum smart contracts following an ""ERC20"" standard. Ziggurat Tokens enable participants to interact with Ziggurat’s Ecex.Exchange marketplace services, as storage, content, and data are obtained with Ziggurat Tokens as partly a payment mechanism. First partnership access – Ziggurat Tokens ownership will give access to advanced platform’s features. Second, assignors and assignees on Ecex.Exchange trading platform rewarded with a Ziggurats bonus if they make a certain volume.

However, you can already notice that the number of new ICO projects has decreased noticeably due to the fact that bitcoin and ethereum have fallen in price, which are used to buy tokens in the ICO. It became unprofitable for investors to spend their bitcoins and ethereum at such a low price. Before the fall of their rate, they could have bought as many bitcoins or ethereum as many more tokens than at that time. Therefore, the investment attractiveness of the ICO project has so far declined.

Cypherium blockchain separates governance both at the level of procedure and application.   Rentberry Rentberry is a decentralized long-term rental platform that has created a disruption in the rental business since 2015. Rentberry has the power to automate the process steps, from signing contracts to actual payment.  Loci Loci, a technology startup known for its InnVenn do-it-yourself patent research tool, has expanded its platform to include the ability to buy and sell intellectual property through its utilitarian tokens, the LOCIcoins. InnVenn also has the ability to post the creation and disclosure of new IP requests on the Ethereum blockchain: the intention is to simplify and update patent processes.  Protecting an idea with a patent is a complicated, expensive and risky process – but blockchain technology can solve it. The CEO of Loci, John Wise has defined his platform as a quicker and safer alternative for that inventor who wants to make money with his ideas.  # 4 – Trippki Trippki is a decentralized protocol that aims to restore the relationship between hotels and guests. Leveraging blockchain technology, Trippki is able to increase the flexibility and versatility of travel programs. It also offers several methods to earn and spend reward points. According to CEO Ed Cunningham, Trippki offers a new generation procedure for travel rewards, which creates mutual benefits between the guest and the hotel.  # 5 – RightMesh RightMesh is a platform that is ready to change the way the world connects. Blockchain technology allows RightMesh networks to identify nodes with secure Ethereum accounts, and tokenisation wants to grow the network by encouraging users to share device resources such as the Internet, data and storage.  RightMesh is the first truly decentralized network, a platform that is truly peer-to-peer: the power of connectivity is entrusted directly to people’s hands by enabling smartphones and devices that they already own.  # 6 – Experty Experty is a decentralized consulting platform that allows professionals to be paid securely and instantly depending on the time they spend on each call, without third-party intermediation. The consultant sets his own rate per minute and shares the profile of Experty wherever he wants to self-promote himself. The consumer contacts the chosen professional through this profile and the payment is made automatically through the blockchain smart contract.  “Decentralization is the key to what we are doing”,  explains the founder and CEO of Experty Kamil Prezeorski. Instead of creating yet another platform where users can search for experts, it was decided to create one where the same experts share their profile information.  # 7 – NAU NAU exploits the growing use of mobile phones and geo-location data with the aim of creating a closer relationship between customers and retailers, all through digital coupons. The ultimate goal is to overcome the traditional and expensive advertising models by creating an affiliate program for users. It is the perfect implementation of the social / local / mobile approach to connect businesses with their customers, according to founder and CEO Yaroslav Shakula.  “In short, these are digital coupons … imagined in a totally different way”.  # 8 – Coinlancer Coinlancer is a freelance platform based on Ethereum which is based on an intelligent guarantee deposit system. Existing freelance markets have many drawbacks, including transaction costs of up to 15-20% and risks associated with payments and delivery. Coinlancer eliminates these problems, with a peer review system for dispute mediation and a much smaller commission (3%) on each transaction. The freelance economy is booming, says Coinlancer CEO Ian Viner.  “We had to stem some of the challenges that freelancers are facing. In our opinion, blockchain technology is the smartest way to do it “.  # 9 – FansUnite FansUnite is the first blockchain-based sports betting platform designed to solve the real problems faced by today’s bettors. They deal with price, market selection, liquidity and must not face restrictions or security limits.  “As Vitalik Buterin pointed out to ETHWaterloo, 90% of startups fail – ICOs will not be different. Many are trying to solve new and valid problems, but a significant number of them will have to face the transition of conceptual token models to companies with sustainable profitability “,  added the CEO of FansUnite Darius Eghdami.  # 10 – Giftz Giftz offers its users a suitable way for any business to exploit their goods and services to sell as incentives in an exchange. The mechanism is very similar to the way in which airlines sell their miles.
