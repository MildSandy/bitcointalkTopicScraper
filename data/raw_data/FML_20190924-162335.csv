But primarily they are used as transaction tokens. There is a diminishing supply of FML tokens. They are destroyed when used. I’ll give an example.  Say you buy $2000 USDf for $2000 usd fiat or $2000 of BTC. We place the money in a bank to back the USDf.  But you also need to pay transaction fees of $20 dollars. You can pay them in $20 worth of BTC ETH or in FML. It’s the market value of  BTC ETH or FML that is accepted as the transaction payment. Tether does the same but they place the funds not in an independent trust but into their consolidated accounts.  We created these FML tokens to be used to pay transaction fees.  They have a utility and are subject to market supply and demand.  But if their is a diminishing supply and an increasing demand them economics dictates that their price will rise.,True
