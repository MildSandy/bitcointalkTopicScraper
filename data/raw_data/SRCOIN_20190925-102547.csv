Headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, K Rental has 78 stores across the country with over 5000 employees, and is planning to IPO in the Singapore Stock Exchange in 2020.  We are issuing SRCOIN to tap into the $1.1 billion dollar massage chair market using the subscription business model. The goal of this crowdsale is simple. After purchasing the massage chairs with the ICO funding, we will use K Rental’s existing infrastructure to promote subscription plan for these chairs and share the generated profit with the ICO contributors.  Currently, there are five Japanese companies with a monopoly in selling the massage chairs. By entering the massage chair market with subscription business, we will tap into the untapped market.  Our goal is to accelerate the process of raising capital needed for this subscription business plan in order to achieve speed to market. And the participants of the SRCOIN throughout the world can witness the scarcity of SRCOIN through our implementation of buy back & burn policy.   ABOUT K RENTAL  SRCOIN ICO STRUCTURE  1st Pre-ICO Price: 1 ETH = 700,000 SRCoins + 100,000 Bonus SRCoins  2nd Pre-ICO Price: 1 ETH = 700,000 SRCoins + 50,000 Bonus SRCoins  Main ICO Price: 1 ETH = 700,000 SRCoins + No Bonus   ICO Duration:  1st Pre-ICO - Jan 1st ~ 31st 2018 (UTC)  2nd Pre-ICO - Feb 1st ~ 28th 2018 (UTC)  Main ICO - March 1st ~ 31st 2018 (UTC)  Accepted currency: ETH  Total supply: 15 Billion SRCoins  ICO utilization: Contributors 70% / Founding Team 15% / Advisors & Early Contributors 10% /Sales Team 5%   SRCoin  Value Proposition: Value of SRCoin will increase through repeated Buy-back & Burn policies   Key Advantages of Subscription Business?  Higher Margin Funds gathered through SRCOIN will mainly be used to purchase products for high yield subscription business plan. These purchased assets have higher profitability(sales profit higher than 50%) than real estate and more liquidity.  Established Company & Experienced management The funds raised from the crowdsale of SRCOINs will be invested in K Rental, an already established company, and its project for starting the massage chair subscription business. Hence, there is fundamentally no risk of business not proceeding, meaning safety of investment and stability is guaranteed.  Value Enhancement Through our “buyback & burn” policy, we will constantly maintain SRCOIN’s scarcity and create a stimulus for SRCOIN’s price to rise. Also, we plan to use portion of our profit to distribute ETH back to our contributors.    OFFICIAL BOUNTY THREAD   PLEASE VISIT OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE INFO!
