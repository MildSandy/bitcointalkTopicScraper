Diagnosed with leukemia at 2 years old, Ashley Surin underwent extensive chemotherapy and spinal injections that sent her cancer into remission, but at a cost — she’s been having debilitating, semi-regular seizures ever since.  After trying several medicines that only left her with extreme mood swings, memory loss and low vitality, Ashley’s parents approached a doctor who suggested an alternative treatment.  The doctor prescribed medical marijuana patches to be worn on her foot and a cannabis lotion that Ashley could rub on her wrist every day to reduce the frequency of her seizures. In case of a seizure, all she has to do is put a small drop of cannabis oil on her tongue.  Not only has the cannabis treatment significantly reduced the number of seizures Ashley has, it has also proven effective in easing the pain associated with such episodes.  “She can think better, walk better, talk better. Her brain used to be like in a cloud,” said her mother Maureen Surin in an interview with Chicago’s WGN. “And now she can think clearer and she’s more alert. She can interact, and can go back to school and learn and not be in a cloud.”  Medical marijuana, although legal in 29 states, is not permitted for use on school premises. Only three states so far — Colorado, New Jersey and Maine — legally allow students to use their marijuana prescriptions in school (while schools in the state of Washington must decide on their own whether or not to).  “Ashley cannot wait to return to school,” Surins’ lawyer Steven Glink told NPR. “What people seem to misunderstand here is that medical marijuana is a prescription like any other drug. Prohibiting it in school would be the same as prohibiting other medications such as Ritalin, Adderall or Concerta.”  The relief from seizures comes mostly from the compound Cannabidiol (CBD) found in marijuana. CBD was declared by the WHO as a non-schedule drug with no known health risks in a recent report.  “There is increased interest from Member States in the use of cannabis for medical indications including for palliative care,” the study says. “Recent evidence from animal and human studies shows that its use could have some therapeutic value for seizures due to epilepsy and related conditions.”  Ashley’s father, Jim Surin, appreciating the support they received from the state and the school, had this to say: “I hope that we can help the state change the law to not only let our daughter get the medicine she needs, but that other students will be helped as well.”  Believed to be the first of its kind, the case may well set the framework for other schools to follow when dealing with children who have prescriptions for medical marijuana.  Budbo, the blockchain-based supply chain management solution and database, aims to aggregate data about marijuana usage, which can be used by scientists and researchers to study marijuana for its medicinal potential.  https://medium.com/budbo/11-year-old-allowed-to-use-medical-marijuana-at-school-fca731f1b0fd",True

Last week, SpectroCoin generated a net transactional revenue of 327,725.66 EUR. 20% of that was distributed among Bankera token holders. This totaled to 65,545.13 EUR or 80.58860665 ETH (given the current exchange rate of 813.33 euros for 1 ether). The total number of tokens outstanding includes 5,178,043,400 BNK of the pre-ICO and ICO BNK tokens, and 454,832,261 BNK tokens that were distributed by the end of last week as referral commission bonuses, bounties (for translations, promotion, etc.) and as compensation for some of the advisors. The 454,832,261 BNK tokens were issued from the tokens allocated for management and advisors. There were 5,632,875,661 BNK tokens issued in total. Since the net transactional revenue share is only allocated to issued tokens (not the total possible supply in the long-run), each BNK holder has been allocated 0.0000000143068 ETH (0.0000116362 EUR) per Banker.  This revenue share is equal to 0.000623 EUR per 1 BNK of annualized return. This is equal to a 6.23% annualized return given the pre-ICO price of 0.01 EUR, 3.62% annualized return given the initial ICO price of 0.017 EUR, 3.42% given the ICO price of 0.018 EUR and 3.23% given the current ICO price of 0.019 EUR.  It is also worth mentioning that the SpectroCoin community has grown by 27,959 new users during the last week, from 678,321 to 706,280, which led to more transactions and a higher net transactional revenue.  There are still tokens left, so don’t miss out the opportunity and get your own Bankers (BNK) on SpectroCoin!",True

Speaking at International Cannabis Business Conference, Lori Ajax, chief of the state Bureau of Cannabis Control spoke about the problems faced by the inefficient supply chain management in the marijuana industry. This statement coming within a month of the legalization of recreational marijuana. Budbo cannot help but agree with her whole-heartedly.  The Bureau of Cannabis Control has granted about 2,400 temporary licenses for retail sales, delivery, distribution, testing and other parts of the cannabis supply system. The bureau is one of three state agencies licensing marijuana businesses, with the Department of Public Health permitting manufacturers and the Department of Food and Agriculture handling growers.  Lori Ajax said, “The supply chain has not been completely tested,” she said. “At some point, we’re going to see the supply depleted.” One pinch point in the system is distribution. Cannabis products can only be shipped from growers and manufacturers to retailers through licensed distributors. But there are only 129 licensed distributors in the state, not enough to meet demand, Ajax said.  Budbo had sensed this impending bottleneck many months ago. It was with a vision to overcome the problems of supply chain management that Budbo was started as a platform connecting growers to retailers. Over the months, the platform has grown to incorporate other features such as data metrics, sales tracking, and overseeing provision of end-to-end solutions to all stakeholders in the marijuana supply chain, from growers to the retailers.  Budbo wants to streamline this supply chain which is getting increasingly stressed as one state after the other legalizes marijuana consumption and sales. Budbo wished that the points raised by Lori Ajax are paid heed to in a sincere fashion.  https://medium.com/@budbo/chief-of-californias-bureau-of-cannabis-control-we-want-california-to-be-a-leader-e586a106b5a9",True
