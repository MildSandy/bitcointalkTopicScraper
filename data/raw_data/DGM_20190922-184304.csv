News from Digmus   Two weeks’ report (November, 20 — December, 3)  We were getting ready for the Crypto conference in Skolkovo and also organized meetings with people that are essential for the project, so that we didn’t have a chance to draft a report over the penultimate week of November. That is why we are publishing a two weeks’ report. We have something to tell you.  1. We decided to find out how lobbyists — intermediaries between business and authorities — can help Digmus. For this purpose, our CEO Mikhail Nazaruk met with one of them in Rostov-on-Don and with another one in Moscow. Brief summary of the meetings: lobbyists can potentially help implement Digmus in the system of compulsory marking of goods in Russia, however, the project needs to get stronger for that. Task number one for Digmus is to finish the development of the system prototype. It will help present the project to stakeholders, facilitate an ICO and attract investors.    2. On November, 28 Mikhail Nazaruk attended the Crypto Conference in Skolkovo. Why is this event interesting? This is the biggest crypto and ICO conference in Moscow that hosted 1,5 thousand participants. Moreover, it was held in Skolkovo that was positioned a couple of years ago as the Russian Silicone Valley. Mikhail says that the conference helped him understand the current situation in the crypto and ICO markets in Russia (you can read about it in his blog). New contacts of private investors and those who deal with GR were added on the contact list.  3. In the end of the month, we met with representatives of an international oil and gas company at their lubricating oil factory. He agreed that there is a problem of counterfeits, the company has been trying to solve it for many years, however, they still don’t manage to eliminate it. He admitted that an independent organization should protect oils in the country and that a comprehensive solution for all motor oils needs to be implemented. The management still needs to consider the application of Digmus at their factory but this decision is not a fast one.  4. We are developing motivation tools for people who believe in the idea and help us as it is evident that a previously short-term project turns into a long-term one and people need to be motivated to build long-lasting cooperation.  5. Short but rewarding news — the article on the choice of jurisdictions for an ICO was unexpectedly picked up for “Startup” on Medium and more people found out about Digmus also wishing us good luck in our endeavor.  The others reports you can see here: https://medium.com/@Digmus_ICO",False

In the case of any such currency emission, the GEN balance of token owners will be increased in proportion to their share of DGM tokens. The emission will be managed in such a way as to insure a hard price cap for GEN coins. GEN coins will be acquirable either on the exchange from token owners, or through a direct order from Digmus at a cost of $0.05 per GEN. Ordered tokens will be issued once every 2 months. At that time, token owners will receive 30% of the issued coins in proportion to the number of tokens they own, with the right to sell them at any cost they choose.

Negotiations with one of auto chemicals producers expanded beyond Russia. Managers of a German company are about to take a decision on Digmus implementation. We are talking about the protection of Swd-Rheinol oil. In Russia, company representatives work mainly with big automobile repair shops. Innovative protection will help the company be more confident in the retail market and we will be able to develop a system working prototype tailored to a real industrial process.    Main points of negotiations: — The implementation of NFC chips is the best solution for motor oil protected by Digmus. — The chip can be easily placed under the cap. — Protection is only required for oil sold in Russia and the CIS as the chance of buying counterfeit oil in Europe is next to nothing.  2. There is also news on NFC chips. We received the first batch of chips that had been made specifically for Digmus considering our needs. We are planning to start implementing them in demos. The article on how Digmus can protect goods with NFC is available here https://medium.com/@Digmus_ICO/what-is-rfid-and-nfc-e3fbcfa04    3. Last week we also conducted negotiations with the CEO of one of Russian top pharmaceutical companies. The CEO was interested in our solution, however, he was concerned with an increase in drug cost if protection is implemented. Probably, the best way to protect drugs is to place a QR code on them and fully disclose information on a drug after scanning including sales region and the number of code scans.",False

We’ve covered this issue a lot that’s why this report focuses on other things — MVP Digmus and our speech at Blockchain Meetup.  1. One of auto chemicals producers is already reviewing and validating technical specifications for system implementation. So, we’ve started tailoring MVP to a real business process. 2. This Saturday, our CEO Mikhail Nazaruk delivered a speech on Digmus at Blockchain Meetup in Rostov-on-Don.    Since the first summer Meetup, the number of participants has increased. The quality of questions asked has also improved. Certainly, there were standard questions like “Why do you need blockchain?” but in most cases the audience were interested in project details and in how it works — reading of chips, information on a product in a mobile app, etc. Everyone also inquired about details of a pre-ICO as during this Meetup the Digmus team was the only one that had already completed Pre-ICO.  ""After the speech, we received nice feedback from one of the attendees. He said he had worked in counterfeit detection sphere for a long time and if Digmus manages to integrate itself into at least one industry, the company will certainly evolve.""  As we’ve assumed, the format of a meetup and offline conferences is an efficient tool of communication with people who are interested in investing into an ICO but who are used to getting familiar with a project and a team in a way that is more traditional for the venture industry. After the Meetup one of the investors approached Mikhail. A meeting with him is scheduled for this week.
