Get all the information here COTI’s community has been a vital part of all our activities, and the COTI Ambassador Program will be central to having our dedicated community members serve as brand advocates within their social circles. We are thankful for your interest in becoming more involved with the COTI project by driving awareness amongst novice and crypto enthusiasts, developers, business leaders, investors and anyone who likes what they see at COTI. What does it take to become an ambassador? COTI’s ambassadors come from a variety of backgrounds and professions, ranging from technology and mathematics to finance, business and investments. We champion multidisciplinarians and value diversity across our ambassador program. We’re looking to amplify our reach in numerous communities, so having a hybrid group of supporters will enable COTI’s message to reach more and more interested groups around the world. COTI ambassadors are required to demonstrate satisfactory verbal and business skills to effectively manage communities and events. COTI ambassadors share in COTI’s vision and have a strong interest in actively promoting it across their community. Why should I become a COTI ambassador? Becoming a COTI ambassador is a first-class ticket to take part in COTI’s overall vision of encouraging the mass adoption of cryptocurrencies and radically changing the world of payments. You will, of course, have many perks as an ambassador, including first access to company news and events, getting featured on our company blog, receiving remuneration for referrals, gaining recognition for any notable content you create and becoming an indispensable part of COTI. Ambassador tasks COTI ambassadors have a six-month grace period to make sure the program is the right fit for them. This is a minimum window of opportunity for ambassadors to anchor themselves within their communities and establish their influence. The COTI ambassador program includes a number of key areas where involvement is necessary and entails a significant financial contribution staked into the position. *Minimum requirement Ambassadors are required to stake their position for the value of $25,000 USD in COTI coins locked for a total of three years. A discount of 10% is provided on the value of COTI coins. * Worldwide network Ambassadors should actively participate in all of COTI’s social channels and manage local community groups. Ambassadors are also tasked with implementing creative ideas across various social channels, contributing to existing COTI AMAs and hosting AMAs in their local communities. One blog post summarizing the ambassadorship role is also to be written within the grace period. If a COTI social channel is already managed in a specific geography, ambassadors will be required to cooperate with the existing network. * Business network COTI is looking for business leaders to present COTI with new adoption opportunities related to real-world merchants (with a minimum monthly sales volume of $50,000), SMEs, eCommerce, travel, crypto exchanges, education and any other industry requiring credit card processing. All ambassadors will earn 10% from the total net revenue generated in processing fees from each merchant referred to COTI. Earnings will be calculated on a monthly basis for a period of 24 months. * Conventions and meetups Ambassadors are the eyes and ears of major developments in their local area. They are required to host one small-scale local meetup every 3–6 months. Meetup discussions can revolve around COTI’s new technologies, updates, partnership news, and any noteworthy developments. A larger-scale event is to be hosted every 6–12 months (e.g., a local meetup, webinar, speaking event, corporate event, etc.) Ambassadors are also tasked with visiting blockchain or fintech-related conferences at least once during the grace period and representing COTI at such events.",False

Consumers, merchants, mediators and node operators will use COTI tokens for all interactions. COTI tokens will serve as the common denominator of payments, fees, and mediation and incentivize node operators in the COTI network. The ico price will be 1 COTI = $0.10 USD with a total supply of 2,000,000,000 COTI. 30% of tokens are available for purchase with a hard cap of $30,000,000 USD.  Token Distribution is as follows:     30% Token Sale     22% Reserve     15% Team (Vested 2 years)     10% Backers, Partners, Advisors (6 – 24 month lock-up)     13% Incentive Program     10% Liquidity  Team The COTI team consists of over 30 members with experience and expertise in financial services, payments, software engineering and cryptography. A few members of the executive team include: Shahaf Bar-Geffen – CEO     CoFounder & Director – Maple     Co-Founder & Director – Positive Mobile     Co-Founder & CEO – WEB3 David Assaraf – COO     Former Chief Internal Auditor – HSBC Dr. Nir Haloani – CTO     Co-Founder & CTO – Articoolo Research     Former head of research of Real-Time Compression – IBM Yair Lavi – CFO     Former CEO & Finance Director – Plus500 COTI also lists an impressive total of 17 advisors including Dr. Matt McBrady (CIO of BlackRock), Greg Kidd (CEO of globaliD, former CRO of Ripple Labs), and Theofanis Alexoudas, Ph.D. (Senior Advisor for McKinsey & Company, former Firmwide Market Risk for J.P. Morgan).  Verdict Mass adoption is a major key to COTI’s success and by partnering with processing.com, the companyis on track to provide its payment services to individuals and merchants globally, with over 10,000 merchants in the process, ready to accept COTI as a valid form of payment. If implemented successfully, COTI could quickly become a major player in this space.  Risks     Although the idea, whitepaper, and team are impressive, the end product will ultimately decide the success or failure of this project and the alpha net launch (MVP) isn’t scheduled until Q3 2018. -1     There will be major competition such as Visa, MasterCard, PayPal as well as other blockchain players already within the cryptocurrency space. -1     Token metrics such as the hard cap, percentage of tokens available during the token sale, team tokens, etc. are important to ICO investors. Overall, the COTI token metrics receive a thumbs up. However, the $30 million USD hard cap is slightly on the high side in today’s market. -0.5  Growth Potential     ICOs with partnerships tend to do well in the current market. COTI has aggressively focused on and developed strategic partnerships with companies such as Bancor, Processing.com, Stox, Wings, Transact Europe, GlobaliD and WEB3. +3     Not only is COTI providing a means of digital currency for payments, it is also providing a native wallet and a native currency exchange which will make transactions easier and simpler by providing these products/services together. +2.25     Although facing fierce competition with other online payment companies, COTI has tremendous potential if able to attain only a small fraction of this massive and growing industry. +2.75     Fair or not, speculation and hype play a major part in today’s ICO market. COTI has implemented an excellent marketing strategy encouraging community involvement and building hype with currently over 18,000 followers on Twitter and over 40,000 members on Telegram. +2  Disposition Aiming to be the “Visa” of blockchain, the vision and ambitions of COTI are lofty and bold, to say the least. However, if successful, COTI could be another breakout ico of 2018. COTI receives a rating of 7.5/10.  Investment Details     Symbol: COTI     Platform: Ethereum     Price: 1 COTI = $0.10 USD     Hard Cap: $30M USD     Total Supply: 2 Billion COTI     Available for Purchase: 30%     Public Sale: TBA   My opinion: I would refrain from investing in this project. Why? Because I was confused by the fact that only 30% of tokens from 2 billion were allocated for sale, with a price for a token of 10 cents. I think how the token will go to the stock exchange, it will go to the area of 1 cent, or even less.",False

As the community presale was such a success ( $3M raised in 27 hours! ) it only shows that the community is very close to the project.

Such an attack implies that users will not able to get Trust Scores easily and the system might slow down, or even be incapable of processing transactions [12]. To prevent this, COTI will employ standard DDOS prevention mechanisms, such as load balancing for centralised servers. A similar attack could be launched against specialised nodes, such as the DSP Nodes because of their somewhat centralised nature. However, since some of the specialised nodes will eventually be general users, they may not have access to load balancing.

Here are some essential points that can help with the distinction between COTI and other projects. COTI was explicitly designed to be used for payments. It combines aspects of traditional payments with the best of cryptocurrencies technology to provide an instant, secure, low-to-zero cost means of transacting globally. Coti’s addition of a ‘trust layer’ makes it the only digital currency to offer a compelling alternative to existing payments systems – it is the first digital currency to account for mediation, an essential aspect of any successful payments network. With our technology, transactions are settled instantly on Coti’s transparent, 3rd party- validated ledger.  If either party to a transaction is unsatisfied, a dispute will be resolved by Coti’s mediators. Also, Merit-based fee structure ensures individuals with high trust scores pay no fees to transact. Other projects address specific payment needs, from open digital wallet standard (PROMISE), Crypto GW (COSS) with dispute system (UTRUST) to reputation based system (Monetha). Still, none of them takes a holistic approach to solve the fundamental problems in today's payment landscape.  COTI is built from the ground-up to address payments use cases. It takes a sophisticated behavioral approach to address the absolute necessity of having a provision for mediation, adding a trust layer that incentives honest, trustworthy conduct on the part of network participants. This will result in the low abandonment rate on the checkout page, low transaction fees, high approval rates and excellent user experience. Unlike existing market solutions that offer PSP (payment service providers) solutions, COTI solves high-risk merchants core problems. Currently, Merchants and consumers are assigned risk-ratings based on broad classifications rather than the actual risk that they pose to the system. For example, legitimate merchants operating in high-risk industries are classified as high-risk by their industry association, while dishonest merchants operating in low-risk sectors may classify as low-risk by the same forces.  COTI, by introducing behavioral scoring characteristics which honest incentive conduct, creates a relationship of trust between transacting parties – consumer-to-consumer, consumer-to-merchant, acquirer-to-issuer (i.e., the whole payments supply chain). By solving the trust deficit, COTI drives down transaction fees, drives up transaction approval rates and enables the world to unlock its full potential to engage in commerce.",False
