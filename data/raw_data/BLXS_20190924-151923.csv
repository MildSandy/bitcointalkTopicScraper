A message from our CEO:  üîäBlockscart is ready to launch  Hey everyone, I wanted to let you know that our developers have completed the Blockscart marketplace and we will be looking to launch within the next 28 days.  We will not enable to payment gateway until we believe that there are enough vendors on the platform to allow a good flow of trade.  Within the next 7 days, documents will be attached to our website with instructions on how to sell or buy on the marketplace.  To start off payments, we will be initially allowing for payments to be offered in Ethereum. This will allow us to build BLOC on exchanges to create value and then convert it so BLOC becomes the payment method. We will not remove Ethereum until we believe BLOC can sustain on its own and offer vendors a great value to accept.  As a buyer, all you will need to do is connect your desktop to Metamask or an ethereum based Dapp. Brave, Cipher browser or Metamask.  To get the marketplace out there in the timeframe, we will be launching the desktop browser version and then we will complete the mobile browser funtioning and mobile app in due course.  Our goals are to get as many vendors and sellers on board as quickly as possible.  If you have any questions then please ask our team.  If you wish to sell on the Blockscart Marketplace then we will place a google document form with contact details so we can start the boarding process.   Blockscarts aim is to be the world's first and free ecommerce marketplace for buyers and sellers in the cryptocurrency world.  Thank you all for your support.  Tim - CEO Blockscart.",False

We believe we underestimated the price of BLOC. We offered it at a low rate at start to see what benefits it could bring. Originally it was set as a discount token but we changed it to make it a payment token.  Once it is listed on an exchange with value then we can change the marketplace so only BLOC is the payment option.  With 18 decimal places.  We can allow for other tokens or coins to be used at our discretion. As long as they are Ethereum based.  Starting with ETH as payment option then add BLOC when on trading exchange.  ETH can be converted to FIAT quickly so vendors have no issues with it.  All prices are converted from dollar to eth with a live exchange feed. This means prices cannot inflate or deflate based on the market as its set against the Dollar.  If a product is $400 and Eth is worth that then it will be 1 eth. if it changes then the payment gateway will also change to represent the dollar value to ETH.,False

Though e-commerce is really a big industry but most of the customers are not well-versed in crypto yet. So the initial adaptation might be slow but once they experience the efficiency of this system, they will be great customers as well as getting spread this by word of mouth and that's a good marketing already. I'm really curious how the ecommerce business will have different cryptocurrencies as payment methods. We are really entering in the digital world.",False

Not only this but they learn your sales data which they use to sell the products themselves at a lower rate as per bulk buy.  We are fresh, we are different. We offer fee free trade with free payment gateway options (gas only cost).  As long as the products are legal, they can be sold.  We are creating the first stage of e-commerce on the blockchain and again, there are no costs.  Want to set up a business? We can help you do that with zero costs.  OUR COMPETITORS: Open Bazzar, Bitify, Storiqa (when they have a working platform) are more likely to go Silkroad style platforms due to them not having any ability to manage what products can be sold.  We on the other hand have created what is called a Hybrid marketplace that coexists with central and decentral style marketplaces allowing for early infrastructure to develop then to completely integrate everything into the Ethereum network.
