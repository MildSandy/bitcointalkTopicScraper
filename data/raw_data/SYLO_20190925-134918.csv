Data is one - with a decentralised solution you retain ownership of your data. The other is who controls the platform... With a centralised service, one company owns the users, and can do pretty much anything they like to extract value from their users and their information. They can harvest data, they can advertise, they can share their users’ data with other companies... With an open, decentralised service, what the service does is out in the open so all parties have to act fairly",False

We are not aware of any functioning fully decentralised communication system like ours, that is blockchain based and allows messages, voice & video calls, connected apps and multi-currency support. There might be blockchain applications that cover some aspects of that but not in a holistic way like we do. Also, conventional messaging apps are not competitors in our target markets given the cosmic asymmetries when it comes to the privacy and security we offer.  Regarding limitations of the current app, it works on a fremium model, where you get 10 connections free, then you need to move to the paid subscription tier for unlimited contacts. This restriction will be removed when we release the new fully decentralised app later this year  Still not convinced? feel free to reach out to us and we will cover all of your questions https://t.me/sylo_io",False

What differentiates Sylo from other conventional social media application is its decentralised nature. Through decentralised communication, your chats and information are not stored or accessible by any centralised network, the way conventional applications do. Sylo accomplishes this is by using end-to-end encryption and peer-to-peer networks, so that neither your communication is stored or accessed by a third-party (not even Sylo!).

The Sylo Protocol acts as the confidential networking layer for the Sylo App, creating peer-to-peer (P2P) connections and providing an efficient way for users to interact and exchange data confidentially over the network.  The Sylo Protocol is being developed to provide completely decentralised confidential communication as a utility to all connected applications within the Sylo ecosystem. Powered by the blockchain and combined with other decentralised technologies, the Sylo Protocol will act as the networking layer for the Sylo decentralised app (DApp) and third-party connected apps, while also providing charging options for specific communications and services over the network.     The Sylo Protocol will be an autonomous communication network that remunerates resources with SYLOs in exchange for facilitating confidential networking, communication and storage functions. Connected apps will use the communication aspects of the Sylo Protocol as an at-cost utility, with an application fee contributing to platform maintenance.   The Sylo Protocol will also ensure standardised data formats for applications as they interact with users and Sylo Storage. This allows for ‘complete interoperability’; a key component to facilitate functionality and value sharing between connected apps within the Sylo ecosystem.   The Sylo DApp The Sylo DApp is to become the decentralised communication and calling application built on the Sylo Protocol. The Sylo DApp will be the first application built on the blockchain-based Sylo Protocol and will use technology already commercialised in the Sylo App which is currently available from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. Sylo DApp was released in closed alpha in August, and will be released in public beta in Q4 this year.  For users, Sylo will be the hub of their decentralised application ecosystem; a single application from which they can safely communicate with others, interact with businesses, plus find and access further decentralised functionalities provided by other connected apps. Sylo will also be the user’s ‘source of truth’ for all their interactions within any connected app. The Sylo DApp will bring together a user’s contacts, communications and saved data from other connected apps, providing a single place from which to manage their profile information, relationship permissions, and generic settings across all connected apps that they are associated with.  As the key connector for users and connected apps in the Sylo ecosystem, the Sylo DApp will provide the backbone for a new user-first way for parties to converse safely, exchange value and work together for the mutual benefit of all involved. By bringing together familiar interaction components, new token models and easy to use decentralised technologies, the Sylo DApp will seek to empower the user and mainstream a decentralised way for real people and real businesses to interact.    Connected Applications and Sylo What is a connected application? A connected application (app) is a standalone application that utilises the Sylo Protocol for user communication, content storage and/or to share in the mutual benefit of being involved in the Sylo ecosystem.  Connected applications have the advantage of being able to run in two contexts: 1. Completely independently of the Sylo DApp, downloadable as their own app from app stores or; 2. From within the Sylo DApp.                            Sylo Tokens (SYLOs) Specifically, in a blockchain context, SYLOs are required by the Sylo Protocol for: • Connection establishment; • Distributed storage; • Real-time charging of communications; • Profile and address book management.  SYLOs are required within the Sylo DApp to: • Access connected applications; • Use as a means of payment; • Purchase confidentiality-enhancing decentralised services; • Referral fees (from connected applications).  SYLOs are required by connected applications to: • Access the protocol (an application fee); • Pay referral fees; • Access promotional avenues within the Sylo DApp.  Additionally, SYLOs can be configured by users to: • Access content in Sylo storage; • Sell and buy content in Sylo storage.   Nature and terms of SYLOs SYLOs will be pure utility tokens required to access the Sylo Protocol. SYLOs do not represent any ownership right or interest in any entity, nor in any property (including intellectual property) of any person, including of any Sylo entity.

What set us apart is true decentralised communication, your chats and information are not stored or accessible by any centralised network, the way conventional applications do. Sylo accomplishes this is by using end-to-end encryption and peer-to-peer networks, so that neither your communication is stored or accessed by a third-party (not even Sylo!).  Long before blockchain was a hot word the core team was already working on decentralised/secure information handling years ago, also, the source code will be transparent and open to the community so that it can be scrutinized, security and privacy can be proofed.  What took us so long? I invite you to give out app a try and you will understand that we have prioritized development of a working product    Quote from: huu78 on September 23, 2018, 05:57:59 AM how many tokens for airdrop ? will there be a maximum limit for participants.?

You can see famous coins e.g. ONT which conducted AirDrops and still the price sky rocketed a few days after getting listed. Therefore, AirDrop per-se is not indicative of price decline, when your concept, product and technology are strong, and you know what you are doing, a good outcome comes organically.

We are true believers in collaboration and have absolutely no problems with healthy competition in the blockchain space. What we want to make clear though is that we have years of experience and that we are way more than a messenger, Sylo is a decentralised communication network, protocol and ecosystem powered by the SYLO token. Sylo is also an application that brings together crypto-payments, user communication, and a marketplace of DApps which all utilise Sylo for communication and storage.
