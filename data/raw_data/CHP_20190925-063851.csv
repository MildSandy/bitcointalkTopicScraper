No worries, it's not even my project but even if it was that wouldn't bother me, TBH.  However, 500 players honestly is pretty massive when you consider there were around 100 or maybe 200 on a good day just last month. If we have 1000 players in 6 more months since the start of the new community contribution burn programs to vault the price upwards over time, well, that would be pretty great growth in my opinion.  By the way guys... as you can see from the chart (see link or coinmarketcap) the price has struggled lately but that being said, it clearly really wants to make a comeback.... it's just a bit volatile.  https://www.kucoin.com/trade#/trade.pro/CHP-BTC  or  https://www.kucoin.com/trade#/trade.pro/CHP-ETH  or on Hitbtc.com ... Or just download the crypto-Poker client and deposit BTC or ETH which is easier. https://www.coinpoker.com/  Current monthly burn and community contribution count/rate: https://www.coinpoker.com/community-contributions  All this crypto-poker-guy really needs is a bit of support from the community. With a bit of real buyer support it would clearly set some new growth records. It's also obvious that any real buyers would clearly get the assistance of both the regular trading bot and likely the market as a whole, mostly waiting and watching. The point is that the market will get behind a real buyer, I've tested it myself. Get in now, grab up some chips and then for all I care... sell on the recover if you want ... it's better than not having the support needed for a real legit working project. Or of course, better yet... hold CHP even longer like me and assume the regular burns of 6M per month will make your investment worth more money. It certainly should considering players continue to frequent the platform regularly. If the player volume stops then certainly beware, perhaps then I would sell but as long as people are playing then coins are being burned and funds are being allocated to attracting players ... which burns more coins ... which attracts more players... which burns more coins... I think you get the picture. The program has already borne fruit in just a single month to the tune of 50-100%+ growth month over month in player volume and until recently a gigantic increase in the market cap. We are starting to see a recovery now, though so don't wait too long or the price will probably have recovered. Someone has to care about fundamentals around here.  Come join us, players!

All that along with the recently announced regular monthly buybacks and promotional updates via a very small and editable 1% rakeback fee. I am very in favor of the tiny rakeback fee.

Visit https://coinpoker.com/community-contributions to see current monthly burn amount and the amount collected for growing platform/back to players  chp asset is going up due the buyback plan implemented a few months ago (my idea!!) which has seen the platform volume growth grow massively and the user base. With more volume, the amount of CHP burned each month goes up. Over 6.25M coins burned this month (happens today or tomorrow) and 2.1m collected for redistribution to players and for growing the platform and it's user base. I believe they are going to up the community rake rate to 1.5% or 2% vs 1% right now which would increase the monthly burn rates by 50%-100% from the current 6.25-6.5M this month. They burned 4M the previous month and roughly 2M the month before that representing massive month-over-month growth in player volume. There are also a lot more players regularly playing on the site especially during peak hours, every day. Thee market cap is up over 1M since my buy recommendation (after I recommended this buyback plan to CHP management) somewhere on bitcointalk.  If they do raise to 1.5 or 2% they will likely offer a nice rakeback program so that not only the top 50 players on the leaderboard can win rewards for playing cash games. It's hardly noticeable 1% rake even now (it has a max of 2 BB rake/hand for most tables except for very high stakes) and 25% goes back to players with 75% burned. So if they do up it to 2% that would mean over 12.5M burned per month at current rates and the platform only continues to grow.  In 2 years there will hardly be any CHP outstanding (should be under 120M or even less vs over 300M but after the burn today will be roughly 297M outstanding...) assuming players continue to play on the site (visit https://coinpoker.com/community-contributions to see current monthly burn amount and the amount collected for growing platform/back to players,)",False

I began around June 2018 during the ""to the Moon"" gimmick and played into the ""Asian"" whatever gimmick theme... Let me give some back ground of myself as an online poker player; at one time on XBox was the World Series of Poker game; I played mostly Ranked Games and was ranked in the Top 20 list, all the regulars at the top know me... So in other words I have played thousands of digital poker hands... Going back further in my history as an IT person I used to work for an online casino site in 2001 and was sent to Las Vegas to learn the software; later I worked on gaming machines for a small company that serviced the card readers... Anyways I am very familiar with VAG & RNG Algorithms...  Back to CoinPoker; I got into it cause I was looking for a new poker game to play and the one WSOP on FB is much too easy to stack up so I started to play this... At first it was a decent RNG design... However I would read their press releases and whitepapers and if you take the time they talk about that the Algorithm is a standard RNG that LEARNS off of the players habits... If you're a person of the tech community and know of Hold'em Generators (as some are previously discussing to access their hands data) that will give one a very good probability generator used as a side app during game play...  What I noticed is that because the software is designed to ""learn off player habits"" because so many ""all-in'ers"" habits of going all in on pre-flop the system has learned to reward these people holding crappy cards... Because the logic in reality is with real money, you would never go all in on a 2-8 off suit pre-flop so the system based the players actions as ""fact of matter"" rather than the system actually knowing what is dealt... Hence, why they had the ""submit your best hand"" bs thing and have restricted hands played information because I told them I know the game is hacked and rigged; period.  How do I know this for sure..?!  Well as previously mention, I have played thousands of digital hands and have a good understanding of how the backbone of these things work...  So when I was playing one day I swear to everything I have; that I got the same hand 3 times in a row..! Not same #'s different suit kind of stuff, the same exact 2 fucking cards 3 times in a row..! Now anyone who plays cards at all will say that for that to happen the dealer must have set and rigged the deck and/or is clearly dealing off the bottom of the deck to get the card(s) to the desired players...  And not for nothing a lot of times the junk of junk hands wins and the reality is; this poker game is totally hacked and/or rigged... The company opening a ""New Office"" in a NEW COUNTRY from when they began should be a sign of something lurky too... I suspect that the hackers will expose CoinPoker for the rigged fraud they are...  Unless they change the algorithm to not learn from shitty players and to actually create an original algorithm of their own, is the only way for them to legitimize their endeavor...  I would NOT sink a 1/10th of a cent of real cash into this Currency; if you want to play a game that is rigged and that will frustrate the hell out of you trying to legitimately win with a real quality hand, this is NOT the game for you..!",False

I thought I would return to have a laugh at the fraudulent scam token ICO con job Coinpoker. It's been a few months since I posted here and that was when the criminal Tony G stole my funds and froze me out of his poker site with civic. It sure is funny looking at the beating it took in 2 months, I told you guys it will go to 0001 and that's where it's going.   I do want to share my next prediction which is that they'll be announcing a new scam or something basic that is drastically over valued, like a dumb dice game or a new chinese partner, in hopes that other idiots will buy the token so they can continue selling, that is what these con jobs rely on, and then idiots like bb4 and other losing investors and players will go to town and advertise it for them.  The new laugh is that barcelona pic, a table of young boys on laptops with not one piece of infrastructure or anything in sight, and scrap paper as mouse pads. You can see they invested as much in this as they did in the table skins, this looks like a real business, more like a rent a suite for $49/day .  Tony G is still on life long mission to defraud people in the poker world. The only thing players can look forward to now is president Trump banning him from the US, which would hopefully banish him to his home country for life.  I'd love to stick and share all the new info in this un exciting and nearly dead space but judging by the last replies this forum is still all shills and idiots.  Good luck",False

I was delivered the ""2"" at a 400% higher than I should have.  This is why these disgraceful scammers don't have hand history.  I'll admit it was a short sample but there was no denying the 2 came out way more. Every other hand was almost spot on, I think I got the K 10 slight higher but the 2 was so far out that any anti-rig skeptic wouldn't deny it.  I was identified as a good player, which I am, and they handicapped me.  As you all know the 2 is a dead card in poker and you're pretty much playing at a 50% disadvantage.

It has nothing to do with verification, it's a laughable tool that doesn't even make sense. they tried to take KYC and made it KYP, know you're phone, but my point to all this is that it's a scam, has the implementation of civic even changed one thing ? Maybe it knocked out one multi accounter who was not a threat anyway and in the course if doing so they took out all the legit paying user base who will not use scam like civic.

With the sponsorship, CoinPoker will offer players around the world online satellite packages to APT Main and Super High Roller events. As well as other tournaments ... (this is direct copy from google)  Direct quote from APT main site : “Clearly, each APT event is different and we are mindful of local operating guidelines. I can confirm that APT Macau Championships will not be associated with cryptocurrency in any way and I apologize for any confusion in the Market,” said Mann.  They are still up for Korean events , I guess waiting laws confirmation before making the announcement on their web site . Also they are still partner of Japan Poker Cup and their is no Japanese laws against crypto that could cancel this sponsoring .

I can tell you guys no verification has ever stopped a scammer. It has only stopped real users who understand its a joke.  The people who will use these apps are young suckers, they will give up poker in one week or a tiny few will get better and move on to fiat sites.  It is only the rejection of fiat and large operators that makes up the BTC poker space. Whoever pulls out their phone and gives the phone number and identity to a scam ICO like civic is already a loser.  Someone who doesn't understand the privacy and surveillance state we live and how apps work.  If I wanted to cheat this here is what I do.  Step #1 - acquire old phone, most people have 5 phones around the house, if you don't look in the junk bin at your work, still can't get one free, there are 500 phones on craigslist with a broken screen selling for $20 average.    Step #2 if its really old flash it to Android 6.  Step #3 acquire anonymous sim card at 7/11 for $12.99 , activate as Tony G. Verify and complete,  Step # 4 log on to coinpoker and continue scamming  A hacker can even skip steps #1 -3 because cloning your sim or EMI is as easy as one two three, so a real hacker can use one sim and one phone to create endless identities.  Call your friend on the new phone and go multi accounting, card sharing, teaming up etc..  As you can see its a joke, no fake/phony app verification can be done online period.  Finally, who is selling you this fraud, it's another fake ICO !!!  Its only fitting one ICO would partner with another . They both have the same model",False

Not only do they have nl holdem but also a bunch of other stuff, cash flips, stud, omaha, mix stuff, etc.  I'm expecting more people using alt currencies to create their own poker sites using poker mavens.

Agree. App compatibility is now quite a problem.

There is no rake. No idea why the sum of his stack and yours was less after 15 minutes.. But I have been playing cash a few last days, there was no rake. I don't think they are such stupid to cheat people with rake, because it is very easy to check     And lets be real, CHP value is given by the differnce of CHP beeing buyed by those that need CHP to play and those that won at tables and want take profits and sell the ir CHP ...............

I understand you. Some people got disappointed after they could not install the app and log in. That was not the best decision, but more like a forced measure to destroy bots.

You cherry picked a chart starting the day before it hit coinmarketcap from an exchange that doesn't even trade it, look at the coinmarket cap and you'll see it's steady decline down and since the changes it doubled the loss of ETH.  Day one eth was down roughly 5% , CP was down 11% , day two ETH was down, 10-15% , so CHP was down 27% at its peak  Unfortunately you don't sound like much of a player but more or less someone stuck in the ICO .  Usually players don't mislead other players with such bad numbers and call them facts.  Your other post is just as inaccurate, you highlight in BOLD that the SWC site must be old software and thats why its losing, but anyone looking at the file can see Tonybet 2006 is actually older.   You are just so inaccurate with your facts it's not even funny, in this case you have it backwards. SWC is 2012 roughly , This app is 2006.  .   You're also wrong about no competition in this space. It's not that there is no competition it's that there is no space period. No one plays CC poker aside from a few core individuals at micro stakes.  Don't you think if crypto coin poker gained as much as .0001 of the market share the FIAT players wouldn't step in.  If you look closely you and kolbas are the ones making things up, lying, misleading people, bad math, kolbas is even trying to tell people I must be a kid or losing investors, when I told you all already I never invested in an ICO in my life,  I especially wouldn't invest in one when I played in and found zero life.  The fact remains, the team lied in the most serious way. Its tonybet no matter how you try to sell it to people. They knew this space was ABOSOLUTELY DEAD and refused to even spend $1 in new code, doubled confirmed by the fact they couldn't even brand it with a logo or skin.  They put nothing in this app just changed the css sheets and background colors.  When you acknowledge this you have to realize they story is not genuine, this team did find Tony. Tony found the team and held an ICO over re introducing his previous failed project.  There is also nothing new or revolutionary, its byte for byte the same software.  The ICO should have said, its tonybet, a previous failed project with 20 players and we're going to try as crypto.",False

I last logged on Sunday night before being locked out and counted every game,  45 or so hands but at least 5-6 of those were on as many as 3 tables at once.  So 45 hands but roughly 16-20 players MAX..  That's a fact, because these promoters don't even know what a fact is. Looking at imaginary numbers doesn't make facts. If you believe that number as real, think of how bad it looks on them when 1000 players only convert to 16 men playing. As you can see the numbers slowly reveal the lie.  As a second source of support for this,  Look at SWC as of this moment .. 98 online - Tables say 21 active, of those 21 - 18 are empty with the same single player, and the last 2 tables have 3 men each..  So 5 men = 98 online  Unfortunately these guys use fake numbers to lie to the forum, everybody knows that's not people online or playing, that's people who logged online within a very large period. Could be 24 hours for all we know, It's a grossly inaccurate number and can be proven by anyone. This company is just as bad or worse.  Ask wavrachal how many times SWC said 200 online but it was actually 43 in a free roll and 3 at a .01 cash table.  Fact remains, the space is DEAD.

Players are extremely happy with my info and its ICO losers who feel duped and lied to.   I was able to prove it with facts and so can anyone by right clicking the file and seeing that coinpoker is actually the lobby of tonybet. You can't argue this because they forgot to take out the Tonybet name. But do keep lying.

It's also clear what type of person you are, feeding lies and air to the forum and showing loyalty to a sketchy ICO over players.  There is no loss on my part either..  Never lost in poker - I only play micro and I generally win.    Never lost in a ICO or even invested, I don't even know how to but I'm smart and if I wanted I could figure it out in 5 minutes. Never owned more than a few hundred dollars worth of crpyto in my life. Certainly no losses here either.  I'm just pointing out clear and present fraud and destroying the idiot promoters with facts and arguments that can be backed up,,  all your posts can not be backed up, they're just poor guesses where you missed the target.  I'm sorry to inform you that my kids are grown up, so that could no make me a kid either unless I had kids when I was 2 years old.  Any more lies or bad guesses ?     I'd like to see crypto poker succeed as well but I know already from my own experience it hasn't and all sites have shut down or are drastically underperforming.. That's why they needed the ICO, there is no business here at all just a scam to take investors for a ride in a space that is non existent.  As if Tony G didn't know this, he is very familiar with SWC so he can log on anytime and see there is not even one table running sometimes.",False

In 2010-11 he had a skin in the iPoker network called TonyGPoker that apparently enjoyed limited success. TonyBet domain was registered in 2009. The main factor behind TonyBet's failure was exactly the requirement to send in photographed documents before one could even start playing. There were indeed around 20 players and 1-2 running tables at any time on TonyBet. NO ONE WANTED TO SEND IN DOCUMENTS.  Nobody is perfect, and you can expect people to learn from their mistakes. There is nothing wrong with rebranding the TonyBet software and accomodating it to work in the world of cryptocurrency as long as it is high-quality software.  CoinPoker is a whole new venture, and Tony G is not the only one behind the project. The team has a number of talented individuals. Installing an app on a brand-new smartphone is still a more appealing procedure than sending in your passport and utility bill. Again, nobody wanted to play on TonyBet because they required these documents BEFORE the first deposit.  The facts remain: - Most people have been able to get through multiple verifications. - Those who had bankrolls should have cashed out before Monday and used it to buy a new phone. Honest players will afford a new phone. Cheaters will hardly afford multiple phones. - The number of players increased twofold thanks to the rake race.  The race itself is hardly winnable by humans of course, but it does generate traffic.  CHP's current fall is corresponding with the market downturn. It was 0.00012 ETH last week. It follows ETH's pattern.  I wonder who stands behind Ron's activity on this forum. CoinPoker still has no direct competitors.    Amazing, but I don't get paid for this. I just enjoy playing there.",False

It is going to improve on the security measures we’re currently taking, plus, it will also add the peer-to-peer CHP transfers you have all been waiting for!  Let’s start with the security. Starting on Monday, we will require you to verify your identity via Civic, which is a blockchain-based project specializing in secure identity ecosystem. Don’t worry — it’s a one-time procedure, and since it’s a reliable blockchain project, you know you will stay secure.  The procedure is quite straightforward — all you need to do is download the Civic app (you can do that right now at Apple Store and Google Play Store) and then verify your email address and phone number.  On Monday, a QR code will appear when you try logging in to your CoinPoker account. If you already have a verified Civic ID, you will need to simply scan that code and you’ll be logged in! Easy, right? If you want a more thorough walkthrough, click here for an infographic. Here’s the steps you’ll need from Monday:  1) Download the Civic application;  2) Log in to your CoinPoker account to get your QR code;  3) Scan it with your Civic app;  4) Click “Set up your Civic ID”;  5) Enter your email address and your phone number;  6) Verify your email address and your phone number.  Perfect! Your account just got safer. Remember, that will also help us reduce cases of multi-accounting that we all want to be gone in addition to working as a second factor identity authentication.  What about the peer to peer CHP transfers? They will be available from Monday, too. Simply look for the P2P Transfers tab on the CoinPoker application, and you will be able to send up to 300 CHP daily to any player.  Here’s how: open the P2P Transfers tab, enter the nickname of the player that will receive your CHP, select the amount you would like to send, and click “send”. Totally hassle-free! We hope it will help you spread the word about CoinPoker by introducing your friends to it who may be less experienced in crypto than you are.  That’s it for tomorrow’s update! Keep watching your inbox though, because we are going to be releasing another batch of updates very shortly that we think you will really love.",False

The sites also forces you to use a third party app with a phone number and a verification process, This is laughable and far from anonymous.

During the poker bust there was deep hatred for the dollar and scared americans who didn't want to go to jail or have their accounts frozen and even during these times it flopped.

There is an embarrassing 6 people playing on the entire site.  Coinpoker had about 30 when I logged on last night, this appears to be the last 30 people that left seals so the market hasn't grown, just shifted to where more freerolls are, which isn't exactly a working business.   There are hundreds in the freerolls but but these are not real customers and don't convert to profits, just leeches looking for pennies. When the freeroll gets out the cash tables pickup for about 10 minutes until everyone spends the 50 cents and leaves. The site is mostly non english speaking. Lots of latinos, europeans and a small lot of westerners, even indian people are playing here which I rarely ever see online.

Not like the quality of English should matter but from past experience the fake promoters and scams have always been from your region. I'm not sure what you mean by can't perceive reality but I don't think you know either so it's ok.    But, the problem is that CoinPoker reps abandoned their forum's threads for some reason, and people are left to themselves.  True, isn't that a strong statement, it is evident how dumb you are as you call it for ""some reason"" but nothing happens for just some unknown reason. The serious questions from the real players and real investors has them running scared.  They can't answer these because it forces them to reveal a negative but truthful detail about their site so they have a request on their website for BTCtalk posters, basically people like you doing the dirty work. A bounty for lying as I see it.

All 3 choices are bad as I see it.  [/quote]  Not sure why I'm even responding to someone who is a thread distractor, promoter and all around poor debater.  You guys prefer to keep the thread going by talking about foolish things like type of games and the color of the skin while the real issues are the team, the withdrawal and verification process, site integrity, site compatibility etc.. All these topics you're a loser at and I don't even know why wasting time I'm replying to you.  While you're failing at debating, can you tell us one more thing since you are exclusively a CP poster.  How do you explain the fact that they give losers 2000 chips every few hours but they don't give players 0.0000001 once in a lifetime to verify a wallet. Can you also explain how they call it anonymous when its linked pre and post to your Ethereum address, I sure don't see anonymous there. It's even worse since the the withdrawal and even sale of your chips is fed back to the site. The only anonymous part is the the other player doesn't know my real name, everything else including what you with the chips, your holdings, sales, buys etc are out in the open.  when you start to think about it, the locked wallet is more negative then I thought because it locks and tracks your entire history. you can't even dump your wallet once its locked in there.

Who cares what was 5 years ago?     Poker players laughed at anonymous online poker and it failed to get players despite endless freerolls on every site.  The world's online poker is now moving in the direction of anonymity. Even PokerStars is thinking to open anonymous tables and tourneys.       It's clearly the people from this forum and ex seals along with the small miners and promoters who have $2 in ethereum and want to get rich.  It is not about two dollars. People could play just for fun.    Quote from: RonHandy on March 08, 2018, 09:23:03 PM ...young, baseless, crypto promoter, with of course poor English... the fake promoters and scams have always been from your region.  ...it is evident how dumb you are... basically people like you doing the dirty work. A bounty for lying as I see it. If they happen to reply to someone like me, and I quote them and ask them a question about the real issues they have no choice but to lie, tell the truth which is negative or not answer.  Not sure why I'm even responding to someone who is a thread distractor, promoter and all around poor debater. You guys prefer to keep the thread going by talking about foolish things...  This is probably the last time I answer you. I don't really see a point to continue a discussion with someone who is not able to keep a constructive and meaningful dialog. My talk is based on analysis, facts and explanations. Your talk is based on emotions, hate and infantility. All you can do is to accuse everyone around and scream about scam, lie and injustice.  When I ask you for proofs of your words, you ignore it.  You cannot prove that I am a CP's promoter, you cannot prove CP's reps leaved the thread because they have nothing to say. You say about this like it is a fact, but it is only your fantasies. Like all the rest you talk about. It is either your fantasies, or your subjective opinion which has nothing to do with real situation.  And, surely you cannot prove that CP is scam. I don't really know what will happen tomorrow or in a year, maybe the site will be shut down, I don't know the future. But right now you cannot call the working project a scam.  When I prove my words with links, you also ignore it. And, the same time you keep talking about 'real issues'.. which ones? The issue you don't understand how to verify your wallet? LOL. I even offered a bet worth 500 USD if you can proof your words, but you ran away from that offer like a coward. When you have nothing to say, when you ran out of arguments, you start blaming my English (which is not my first language), my region (by the way, what the region?), and insult me for no reason.  You also think everyone owes you something. You reckon that CoinPoker should send money to everyone for verifying wallets. Hah, that's really ridiculous. It is a childish and immature behaviour. Or, behaviour of a hysterical person. So, when you calm down, and grow up, come back, and we will talk.",False

It's up to you. Try to analyse. Download the app and you will see around 700 people playing at rush hour. Some play high stakes cash tables which is great for such a young room. The thing is that CoinPoker might be the only way to play poker for the US, Australia, Spain, France and many other countries who is not allowed to play at PokerStars and other world's top poker sites. So, I think CP could occupy a certain niche. All depends on the CP team: how they will manage and promote the room.  But, the problem is that CoinPoker reps abandoned their forum's threads for some reason, and people are left to themselves.  P.S.

I would exchange myself from my personal bank account before putting my customers through this embarrassment.  ICO holders can use their chips but they are all investors waiting for it to go up.

Let's even assume you ignore the tactics of the team - The crypto coin poker scene is as dead as the netbook.  It's more popular to order a hit or kidnapping with bitcoin then it is to play poker.  All the poker sites have closed, often stealing players funds, those that haven't are on a steady decline.  SWC had 700-1000 players once, when I played there 200. Now as for FEB 2018 only 6 people on the entire site and 35 in a freeroll, which is basically people playing for fun and points only.   6 People folks -- the only reason SWC is open is because its a one person company and the entire site is a tiny app running on a server.   Sad to see investors didn't do research and there is no way to make money now except to sell this coin, which is pegged to a 35 man site as the sole success. Hardly an investment so it will need scams and promotions like no other.  Some people in this thread are also pointing out fraudulent trading of the coin, as is expected from a scammy ICO like this.  I'm not in to that I'm just pointing out the flaws from a poker and business standpoint and there is too many and it would fit with the pattern or fake trading.  Enter team sputnik",False

You just have no a clue what you are talking about. When you explore and understand what is Ethereum wallet, we might possibly get back to the topic.      Your response is a shameful lie and is expected from someone who only signed up to promote the ICO.    This also adds an element of fraud to the coinpoker team, responses like this are not free and open conversation based on facts or beliefs, they are bought and paid for by the ICO scammers. They openly advertise that they will pay you .01 to .05 ETH to go to bitcointalk and start fake positive posts about coinpoker.  Hey, you either confirm your words with the proofs or remain a windbag     If they were really concerned about your wallet they could send their worthless coin and force you to extract .000001 the first time..  Let's see, with my solution about 50,000 players can be verified for $1 .  You can see how they're not thinking but purposely making things difficult so you buy ICO, this doesn't address the freerolls.  Even a winning player who wins a freeroll and want to withdraw it is locked. Pathetic and obvious scam.  Also learn how generally poker rooms work.  Here is the CoinPoker wallet: https://etherscan.io/address/0x84af694c42093690f0081e45dccd99965a75f442#tokentxns - where you can see how hundreds of players successfully verify their wallets, cash-in, and cash-out from the app. Since it works on the blockchain, everyone can see every single transaction. You are the only one I ever met who found the verifying as a trap or some fraud. It is only because you really have no idea what are crypto-currencies and blockchain.  Honestly, you just seem to be a super hater, who lost money in other ICOs and now, speaking emotionally, don't give a damn on facts and proofs and explanations I provide. You are only here to express anger and incriminate everyone and everything on one's bare word. So, I don't really see a point to continue this discussion with a deviant man, sorry.",False

Had they told people they were just starting a poker site using existing coins there would have been low interest and nothing for them. Essentially they got paid to duplicate SWC.

So once again people,I am a full time player for almost ten years and please realise this is one of the most scummy things you can do in poker.Don't get suckered into anything that promises earnings of X $'s per hour.To win at poker long term you must put the hours in of not only play,but equal amount of time off the tables studying the stats of both your opponents and of your own.The best bots in the world cost big money and always end up being detected.Only the scummiest of poker sites (I wont name them,but any reg grinders know who i'm talking about) allow bots to go on because they generate rake.Rake over fair and honest games.Lets see how Coin poker both reacts to someone open selling cheating programs AND how they combat the cheaters when detected.This will set them apart if they deliver on promises!

Please keep in mind that these are starting prices that will change and fluctuate over time.  Today, www.AllCoin.com became the second exchange that we signed with. Being listed on AllCoin will allow everyone who was, for whichever reason, unable to participate in our ICO to buy CHPs freely and enjoy the action in our poker room!  Now that all those interested to buy will be able to do so easily via this exchange, some people may be looking to withdraw their CHP to an ETH wallet. Although this feature is currently unavailable, our expanded developer team is working hard to make sure we’ll be introducing it shortly.  On top of that, we are planning to announce being listed on more exchanges (including bigger ones) within a couple of weeks. It is all still being worked on, but we’re in the final stages of this process, so stay tuned! You can read more about us signing with our first exchange — Bankera — in this article that was published a week earlier.  Working on this project is an amazing experience, and we have all of you to thank for it.

Their justification is that their T&C states that you need to buy into the ICO to win ETH prizes. Their T&C states nothing of the sort, it instead states that ""winnings will be transferred to the winning player’s verified ETH wallet address (see infographic on how to verify your wallet);"" By then going to the infographic, you can find that CHP needs to be sent from your ETH wallet to theirs in order to verify. Since CHP can be sent from wallet to wallet, having CHP to send them does not require buying into the ICO, yet they claim their T&C says that it's a requirement.  Furthermore, I emailed their support multiple times before the ICO ended to find out whether buying into the ICO would be required to receive my ETH. My emails were answered, but both times the specific question of whether ICO participation was required to claim ETH prizes was ignored.    So to summarize, CoinPoker feels it's fair to add rules outside of their T&C to justify not paying out already won prizes, claiming those rules are in their T&C when they are demonstrably not. They also feel it's reasonable to ignore questions about how to become eligible to collect prizes until after it's too late to become eligible. When I told their support I planned on posting about this on 2+2, BTC and Reddit, they said that their community is bigger than these sites and bad publicity wouldn't matter.

If someone builds a platform which uses another well established cryptocurrency, I believe people will prefer to use it over yours. Because the value of your coin is tied to the success of your platform, which adds another layer of risk (in the sense that the user is not only gambling by playing poker, but they're gambling twice by playing poker using a coin that has not yet proven its legitimacy on the market).

Even more confusing is the fact people have invested tens of millions dollars to this. Plus that there is pages of conversation about the subject on multiple sites and almost everybody ignores pretty important fact:  The fact is that Coinpoker chips (CHP) are actually nothing else than play money poker chips! Yes you read correctly. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever why those chips should have any value. They just have made new pokersite based on blockchain, printed 500,000,000 poker chips to play with and claim that those chips should have some value based on demand or something like that. Why would anybody pay anything for tokens that can only be used to play poker in their platform, no-one quarantees any value for chips and those cannot be used for anything else. They are just like any other play money except they have limited supply, that of course shouldn't give them any value, anybody can print any tokens they like everyday. E.g. if pokerstars limited their play money chips to 500,000,000 and opened exchange to buy/sell those, does that give them value? Well it would be exactly like this. Of course it seems that people for some mysterious reason are giving them value buy partipating in their ICO:s and buying those. Sadly for those who have invested, the prize of CHP:s should be zero soon after those chips open to exchange.  And if for some reason those chips held value some time after exchange opened and playing had begun there would be some problematic possibilities. Few examples:  1. What happens when winner(s) of opening tournaments want to cash out.. There are pretty big added value put in those tournaments + normal buyins so winners would get at least millions of those chips. Those big winners/runner ups etc. would likely to want cash out after tournament.. Well what happens when all winners go to exchange at the same time to try to sell those piles of chips (= even multiple % of total supply of coins) to get real money.. There most likely isn't even close enough volume in market to make those sell orders happen at current prize if at all. So you buy CHP:s at 0.3$ or something per unit before tournament and if u happen to win u cant sell those tokens anywhere close that prize.. Only thing you can try is to sell small portions at a time and hope that value of chip doesn't go down. This applies to any other big cashout as well.  2. Since there is 4% rake that eats available tokens at fast rate, Coinpoker has to sell those coins back to circulation in exchange which itself lowers coin prize if inflow/outflow otherwise is balanced.  3. If overall interest for any reason to play at Coinpoker decreases, coin starts to lose value because more selling than buying happens, which even more accelerates people leaving from site ---> value decreases.. ultimately this leads to coins having zero value. Of course even earlier when there is not enough growth potential left there would be massive sell offs at some point by ICO/crypto investors who wasn't interested in poker anyway ---> prize crashes down, people starts to leave ---> and so on..  There are numerous other problematic instances I could mention but there shouldn't be any reason to consider anything like that at all. The coin should have zero value to start with, there are multiple sites and platforms to play with printed tokens, there is no difference in comparison to this.",False

They will have an opening tournament series with huge added prizes. On the scale of several million $$$. This is unheard of in the poker world, both online or offline.  Players need CHP to enter, and the supply is limited, so they will run to exchanges to buy some to be able to participate in these tournaments.  Additionally, it's much easier to deposit and withdraw money than it is with other poker sites. A lot of the poker players already have crypto, so it will be easy for them to shift some investments around, get CHP, play for a while, then withdraw it and move it back into some other crypto.

Do you understand poker at all?  What do you mean, you yourself wrote that first tournament is 3000CHP buyin = 1000$ if CHP is valued ~0.3$. +1000,000$ prizes were estimated only by fact that there is added 16,000,000 CHP in opening tournament.

If they were constantly putting bonus prizes in tournaments in form of cars or ETH then there would be at least one reason for CHP to have at least some value.

About 450% difference, apparently the community has decided to keep the price the same on the rise of Eth. For obvious reasons (read: ""greed"", ""self-protection"")  Be aware that you now buy with almost 4.5x more risk than the people at pre-ico, they will have a lot of reasons to cash out once this hits the exchange. One of them being 4.5* richer then those who invest now. (how is that for a Ponzi)  At 30 cents the company will be valued at 150 million at 500 million tokens time 0.30 cents. So effectively from pre-ico to today the company went from a value of 30 million to 150 million. Not because people valued it at that price, no because the price of Eth went up and the ""community"" decided to keep the price the same. (most ico's adapted their price but not Coinpoker)  Why do stage 1 holders bear 4.5 times the risk of the investment versus the pre-ico holders. If the price has gone up due to the rise of Eth, which I think is the reason, you are now valueing your company 5-6 times higher then the pre-ico purely on the basis of the fact that Eth rised.  That is some interesting economics. Basically all stage 1/ 2 investors bear all the risk of hoping that the pre-ico investors won't cash out when this hits the exchange (they only have 100 million coins (20%)). Now imagine what 20% does when they all sell off. The price will be unsustainable as the company was never valued at that price in the first place.  Normally you would expect to see 30 - max 40% difference between pre-ico and stage1, but not at coinpoker.  Looking at the above, Tony G seems the right man to be connected to CoinPoker and I bet ya he is in the pre-ico.  There is no logic behind this apart from greed.  This is by far the greediest ICO I 've come across and I suggest changing the ruleset, I stand corrected, I do get it wrong every now and again.  I am usually not one for spamming or bad mouthing companies or people like Tony G does, clearly that is his trademark looking at the youtube video's.  I also have not much incentive to write this as I will admit going full in on this ICO, thinking this would be a good deal, but when I noticed the amount of coins I got versus the  amount of money I spent, I straight away new I made a big miscalculation.  Unfortunately and fortunately I have done a lot of investments in Ico's lately and I assumed too quickly that being at stage 1 would still be a good deal, so quickly glanced at the numbers and tried to be in before stage ii hit.  Realistically speaking we might see the company valued on hype 2-3 times more than what it is at best, assuming everything alines perfectly (which it seldom does). But since the first pre-ico investors already had 4-6 times their initial returns there will be very little reason for them to not insta cash out, when you know everyone around you fromt he pre-ico sits on 4-6 times their initial winnings and it will max go up by another 2-3....... cause face it, this company should not be valued at 500 million plus at this early stage.  I'd would love to hear a reaction, maybe I got it all wrong! But from speaking in the chat, there was no real answer to the above apart from the ""community"" has chosen! The pre-ico community would have always chosen for that, nobody says no to it. When did they choose? When the price of Eth already sky-rocketed? That must have been a surprise outcome.  If anything, let this be a warning, I think there are many better ICO opportunities around.  Look at SETH for instance where they straight away decided to adapt the bonuses and amount of tokens based on the rise of ETH. It is common logic. I am not advising SETH but at least they understand what is fair.  Also in my defence, I might have gotten my maths wrong and accidentally invested in this site, but there is no valid reason for the ico price at stage 1 to be 450% more than pre-ico when they also had a 30% bonus???  People that are new in ICO's will not have the prior experience to recognize that this is really not a good deal.",False

Amaya with buying PokerStars turned poker to casino and as they are monopolist, players can nothing do with that. CoinPoker gives some hope for improvement of poker global situation as for now this game is stagnating because of regulations.     Even if the people from pre-ico will sell their CHP's that would make price of CHP decrease, there will be a lot of players who will be happy to buy it for lower price. CoinPoker are promising to return 15% of the coins raised in the ICO coins back to the community with added prize pool for tournaments.

Why wouldn’t I get 3.5x times more tokens when Eth goes up 3.5 times, when in effect the value of the company hasn’t changed. Right now the ico seems to suggest that the token is really worth 0.25 cents whereas what really happened is that you still get the same tokens for 1 ETH. Ie. stage 1 investors that pay with Ethereum effectively are getting the same value from that ether before it rose 3.5 times. Yes your Ether has still the same buying power at coinpoker as in nov 2017 how is that fair? The painful thing is, if this is your first ico it will be very hard to see this, people iwll buy in not kowing that the price is bloated.  For example, I invested in vibe ico at 0.009 cents they have around 270 million chips, they ran the ico in such way that everyone get’s their bonuses depending on the stage they are in. Then at the end of the ico they looked at the evaluation of the company which was 2.4 million $ and they divided that through 270 million tokens. Which makes around 0.009 cents. For 1500$ that bought me 150k tokens.  the pre ico of coinpoker sold 100 mill tokens at 30%. at a price 0.05, which is 5 million$ in the pre ico?. Ie. if they sold all 500 million tokens at 0.05 cents the company would have bene worth 25 million. Now we are looking at an evaluation of 100+  mill? Why? Not because of demand, but because of the rise in Eth. price. I strongly feel People don’t realise this is a really bad deal. if it was still valued at 25 million I would have gotten around 30000 chips for 1500$, now I only get 6000 chips for 1500$?   Now is coinPoker really worth that much more compared to a revolutionary idea that vibe offer. They have hardly any competition in their area of expertise, yet pokersites are very hard to start up as they will face a lot of competition and as it is difficult  to make money from poker. (i have played poker for 10 years as well, played millions of hands online) Y I agree blockchain and lower rake will make a difference but it wil have to prove itself since many have failed.  The token was never really worth 0.25 cents in the first place. You can only evaluate a company fairly once the ico is over, not during an ico. Unless you trade the tokens on an exchange like EOS does.  The software for sure doesn’t look like it should be valued at this price. A lot of red alarm bells imo. I will leave it at that, I admit my maths may be out here and there, but you can’t ignore the fact that without the ico being finished yet the price of the ico is bloated, and gives an unfair advantage to those who were lucky enough in the pre ico. They already had their 30% bonus which they signed up for, not a 400% bonus which they now seem to be getitng compared to stage 1investors.  Hiding this info feels wrong and on any level this doesn’t make sense.  In nay case since there is a high likelyhood for this thing to crash when it hits the exchange(pre-ico people will cash out) you are better off waitng for this thing to hit the exchange and thank me later.",False

Our ICO starts tomorrow (19th of January, 10am GMT, 5am US Eastern Time, 11am Central European Time), and we want you to STAY SAFE while you get tokens. ALWAYS double check your source ALWAYS verify you’ve got the right info  ???IF IN DOUBT – contact us on Facebook at @CoinPokerOfficial; Twitter @CoinPoker_OFF; Telegram @https://t.me/officialcoinpoker; Official chat @ https://chat.coinpoker.com/channel/CoinPoker.   Don’t lose your tokens! Make sure you’re getting them with your ERC-20 compliant wallet only. Don’t use exchanges, because if you do so, we cannot guarantee you’ll get your CHPs.  You can find wallets that we recommend in our FAQ (https://coinpoker.com/#faq) , but you can use any ERC-20 compliant wallet.  This is very important! In order for your transaction to get CHPs to go through quickly, you need to set your gas limit at 200,000 at the lowest. Remember – transfers take time even on blockchains!   We deployed our Smart Contracts yesterday, so our prices are now set in stone (Stage I - 1 ETH = 4,200 CHP, Stage II - 1 ETH=3,500 CHP). You can read more about that on Medium here: http://bit.ly/CTOcontracts in an article from our Chief Technical Officer.  Also, we got reviewed by a crypto youtuber! You can watch the video here: https://youtu.be/OX0Ydyd4g-8?t=7m37s  What happens after we close our ICO? We'll be launching HUGE promotions in which we will give away 15% of the tokens collected during the ICO. We already know the prize pools will be filled with at least 15,000,000 CHPs!!  If you want to get your updates on CoinPoker as soon as they happen, you can follow us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/CoinPokerOfficial/  or Twitter https://twitter.com/coinpoker_off.

I also wrote the book in regard to the evolution this emerging technology is bringing: wealthofchips.wordpress.com  The recent complaints are expected issues of a bootstrapping event.  The cus support is seemingly just inexperienced with poker, perhaps not good with english (I am a native english speaker but my grammar is terrible ;p).  What they (probably) meant to say is 'the reason we have a month or two of freerolls is because we expected many issues and bugs'.  They shouldn't have implied that you don't deserve compensation from the crashed tourney's (ie the higher level staff probably smacked their foreheads when they realized their support staff claimed that).    It is quite standard in the industry to credit some form of icm payout (I think that is the correct term) based on a formula of a likelihood you would have finished if all players were equal. Or in a significant tourney like the tesla one, to restore the state of the tourney from the time of the crash.  Its never ideal because some players are better than others and no one wants to think about ""what could have been"".  But Josem and Isabelle Mercier are a part of this project and they are well aware this is industry standard practice.  Probably the rest of the team isn't aware, and didn't realize it is not a good idea to not inform your customer service agents of this practice.  It is likely the policy will get changed, unless I don't understand something.    But what I mean to emphasize is you cannot suggest its indication of scammy behavior.  It's just a form of undesight as there are probably large pressing issues the customer doesn't see.  They probably realizing they need poker player related customer support rather than some form of 3rd party outsourcing as well (total guess).  Anyways, follow the 2p2 thread, I am in there and so are some very experienced players.  I just don't want this to be a runaway torch carrying mob based on normal bootstrapping problems.  Your complaints are noted, and experienced players are scrutinizing this project...this just needs some patience because every staff member probably has 10 extremely urgent and large tasks on their plate, and they are all probably realizing as a team that they are dropping the ball in the thing that they forget is most important: the players",False

Also, the fact that they keep dodging questions after questions in that thread despite being asked repeatedly is also a red flag.  I think most people in the bitcointalk community only plays poker for fun. They don't know the in and out of the poker industry, what problems we have now, and how CoinPoker actually is going to solve those. They are a bit too optimistic. I just post the thread so that people can at least inform themselves properly before making investment decisions.  Personally, my impression about CoinPoker is: - Very nice client implementation, I was surprised to see a project that started just a while ago has such a good poker client (much better than many long standing clients). Until I know it's just a re-skin of existing software. - They are correct when they say with Ethereum network it's impossible to fully decentralize poker cause the transaction time takes way too long. But maybe they should investigate other platform then? Like Iota? - But if it's that way, then the only thing CoinPoker has better than current poker softwares is the fact that their RNG is decentralized. But RNG was never a problem with major poker clients anyway. We can actually verify RNG better by analyzing statistical data from hand histories. - And CoinPoker has a lot of major short comings compared to other poker softwares, for example the fact that we can't export hand histories to analyze with 3rd party softwares - a crucial way to prevent cheating, detecting collusion and other foul plays.  All in all, I would say that with the way it's heading, CoinPoker has even more security issues than PokerStars or other major poker clients.",False

Operator will provide a seed like a timestamp to secure random number generation. Phrases (seeds) supplied only by players will not guarantee random generation entropy for each hand, as they could be constant (for example: if two players will use their seeds unchanged for a while, RNG will be predictable). It's all about additionally security. As all phrases will be publicly available on blockchain, without operator's seed you could easily find phrases of all players sitting on your table and predict random number generated (=cards).",False

In example, if server uses timestamps as a seed - it can wait some tiny period of time (few milliseconds) and, knowing users seeds, choose favourable timestamp to produce hash. It would be fair if server chooses a seed BEFORE receiving data from clients. But how could you prove that this is how it works if the poker client is not open-source? And there is another way of creating manipulated hash if the client is not open-source that I can think of: clients and servers communicating and cooperating to choose favourable seed.  I'm not conspiracy theorist and I like your project, but I'm concerned about this. If fair game is your selling point than verifying RNG alone is not enough. I don't see how you can prove that selecting seeds is fair.  I would also like to ask a question about value of the token (sorry, I don't have much experience with ICOs): You value your token pre-ICO at 1CHP = 0.05 EUR and during ICO 1 ETH = 4,200 CHP, 1 ETH = 3,850 CHP or 1 ETH = 3,500 CHP. What is expected price of the token when the product will be LIVE? Correct me if I'm wrong, but market could value the token very low, like 1CHP = 0.000000001 EUR. Can we hope that this won't be the case because people will not be willing to sell below 0.05 EUR?",False

We know, it may sound complicated, but actually this is very elegant and pretty simple solution.  Let us take example: Before hand starts: Player-A, uses phrase: ""apple"" Player-B, uses phrase: ""banana"" Operator, used phrase: ""orange+time_stamp"", and in centralized server: ""apple"" + ""banana"" + ""orange+time_stamp"" => combined together and used as a seed for random number generation, and so card is picked up, for instance ""9h"". This is logged and sent to blockchain.  Now you can open this log (where all phrases was used and all numbers generated) and validate RNG (engine and RNG algorithm will be provided as one of the validation tools publicly). You will take ""apple"", ""banana"" and ""orange+time_stamp"", make a hash (a tool and algorithm will be provided publicly as well) and then supply it for RNG to check what output is (in this case you will get same number as in log provided, which will match ""9h"").  So, how operator could compromise this process? - phrases used in RNG could not be changed, users will notice it. - RNG output could not be changed, users will check it's validation. - server could try to guess it's own phrase, in combination of 'apple' + 'banana' + 'x' => hash => RNG => to get output needed (compromised). But here is a problem: 'x' will use mix of random_phrase+time_stamp, and so the roll back process: output_needed (compromised) => RNG => hash => all_phrases (with time predicted) will took decades or may not be possible at all.  We hope it is more clear now.",False

All gameplay actions, including each participants seed information are recorded and uploaded publicly in defined time intervals.

That together with the pain-free transactions thanks to cryptocurrency will solve many of the problems that online poker has been facing. •   Transactions will be immediate + accessible worldwide; •   RnG will be visible for transparency; •   Anonymity will be guaranteed; •   Fair play at the tables will be ensured. + HUGE Grand Opening Events with awesome prizes (15% of tokens distributed during the ICO will be returned during these tournaments). What makes us different from other ICOs? Well, for one, we’ve got our MVP (minimum viable product, in our case – an app) ready to go, and we’ll be launching our MVP with play money before our actual ICO start! Our official website www.coinpoker.com will be available early in November, and once it’s live, you will be able to read our Whitepaper for a very detailed look at our project.
