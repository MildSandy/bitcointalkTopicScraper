I can imagine that there will be a lot of users who don't care to pay for subscriptions on professional trading users (and those will take a opportunity to earn something with it). Also the target group is already familiar with trading crypto so there will be no barriers in buying TKR.  A lot room to grow in my opinion.  Also the devs are very active in communication and developing, already published an app even on iOS. The only competitor in this section I see right now may be in some ways InvestFeed, but for the moment I see them rather like the already existing tradingview.com (https://www.tradingview.com/ideas/cryptocurrency/).

Airdrops are in TKR and not ETH (they'll never be ETH either as that wouldn't make sense).  Can I also remind everyone to please stay vigilant, it's too easy to lose your wallet and funds in an accident. I know this doesn't have to be mentioned, but please do not click on any links from anywhere. Avoid using MEW if you can (a local node is much better and secure and not prone to phishing), don't use a simple wallet access method like a ""Private Key"" only, opt for Keystore (as you need to upload a file AND provide a password), or even better a Ledger Nano S.  If someone injects a fake self-signed certificate and somehow poisons your DNS then you're still going to end up having your funds stolen. We've heard issues with people being targeted by phishing, in the end there's nothing we can do as once the tokens arrive in your account you're entirely responsible for them from that point onwards.  We published a blog on account security about 2 months ago at https://keepingstock.net/icos-and-why-security-and-due-diligence-is-important-in-the-cryptocurrency-world-2227161778fc , I'd suggest people to read it and really re-think if they're doing security the right way.

Its intertesting right? New players to the cryptocurrency market may be reluctant to invest due to the lack proper analysis and knowledge in the field, while some invest a small amount to test the waters. Unfortunately, the increase in value of cryptocurrencies also attributes directly to the amount of fraudulent schemes that are prevalent, as is also the case outside the cryptocurrency world. Most investors often invest blindly based on unwarranted media hype, attractive schemes (using flattery to convince the investor) and false promises among other things.

We've then got mockups then and designed our UI (just like we did with our mobile at the very start), and now we're in the process of laying the foundation of the desktop client before we implement features. You may notice our roadmap is wrong too (as that was based on the mobile app only), we'll get this sorted this week.  The desktop client will work for Windows & Mac and it'll take us a bit of time to get the foundation right before we proceed with implementing the features. Once we release the client I can re-assure you the price of our token will steadily start rising as we get more and more users interested.

The subscription price varies by the token price against ETH, as the value rises you would need to pay less in TKR which gives early investors a bonus, either through a longer subscription or through enjoying a higher trade price on exchanges. Moreover, holding TKR enables the user to receive airdrops (as long as they have 2500 TKR right before the first exchange is live and during the 48 hours of the first exchange being live). The airdropped amount is proportional the amount of TKR you hold at the airdropped time (the timings are not given out due to this reason).

This essentially means that if you’ve traded all your tokens away when the exchange is live then you are no longer eligible for TKR airdropped tokens ever (even if you buy them back at the end of the 48 hours). We will be confirming TKR tokens by address for each block in those 48 hours. Airdrops timings are not announced to prevent trading tokens for the purpose of airdrops. Why should minimum 2500 tkr? while investment value i do not even reached such a value does that mean investors you that has TKR under minimum not be able to participate in obtaining airdrop?,False

The '2500 TKR' value wasn't pulled out of thin air, we looked at the average contribution overall and then halved that even further.  2500 TKR translates to 0.42-0.5 ETH (depending on when you contributed), we don't think this is an unreasonable amount to assume given the data so far. We also have to take into account people dumping their tokens up until the bare minimum, which is why this acts as somewhat of a boundary to prevent all tokens from being dumped (looking at the average contribution).   It was either this rule, or the other rule we had in mind: your contribution amount is the maximum TKR you will get airdropped (this amount can not be changed higher by buying more tokens, but it can decrease by selling your tokens, but buying them back will no longer increase it to prevent dump/buy). However the fundamental flaw with this rule is that it does not promote getting more tokens from an exchange post ICO for a contributor/bounty holder to increase their airdrop and such.",False

An investor should always do their due diligence and understand everything prior to investing on the facts available, it is always a bad idea to invest in something with just assumptions.

You read our mind to some degree here, we were going to make a blog/social media update next week that would incentivise people to hold their tokens. Essentially this would be, as you said, through airdrops (as we'll have a supply still). The way it works is that as long as people hold tokens (on the date of ICO conclusion) they'd be rewarded/airdropped with tokens proportional to the amount that they own (with a minimum limit TKR requirement). We've not determined the frequency of these yet, but we'll be drafting a social media post with more information. Ultimately when our subscription/trading platform goes live we'd be able to set aside tokens for more air drops.  I see your concern regarding token scarcity, we've still got a little over a week to go and we think the pace will pick up more in the last few days. In any case if the total supply is low (it's already 10 million currently~) it will provide each token with more value/room for growth. I don't think it's going to be necessarily too bad, our tokens do support 18 decimals for what it's worth.

The projected amount listed is the upper hard cap, however if you factor in the bonuses that drops down to nearly $3 million.  Moreover, the preponderance of things in the cryptocurrency world are very expensive. Take for example advertisement, we've been quoted ridiculous figures that would easily trump 20-30% of the hard cap just for advertising and marketing alone overall.

Latest Cryptocurrency news, with the option to allow users to post 'promoted' news using a smart contract (which is verified before being published). This allows the news to be targeted to non-subscription (and subscription users if they wish) and increases the share price/dividends for investors.

As far as a desktop client goes, that's already in our roadmap and should be quite straightforward (and a lot easier for us to do as we're experienced in both frontend and backend development).  As far as minimum fund targets go, our current intention is to mature the app as we go along. The hurdles we're facing in the long term are:  A) Server Costs, this will be by far the majority. Currently we transfer almost 2 GB a day of data, this amount is minuscule right now and it's only compromised of a few things. Once we start factoring in a lot of exchanges, additional workers on the backend to compute a lot of various things, access to volatility alerts, buy walls / sell walls alerts, (meaning subscribe to websockets and such to receive live-time orders) it all adds up quickly. We'll also need to bump our servers up to crunch the data, ad-hoc servers for infrequent compute, caching clusters, etc.  Just to give you a number, we're currently processing roughly 12 000 writes an hour and we're expecting this number to rise up easily towards 300-400K entries/writes to our DB once fully matured. That's a lot of time-series data, though we've already anticipated this growth and have adapted from the start to ensure our database queries are as performant as possible (0.2s for very old data and 50-100 ms for recent data~) .  B) Team expansion, while all of the roadmap is quite feasible for us to do it still eats a lot of our raw time each day leaving little for real-life commitments. Expanding the team allows us to alleviate some of the tasks and get experienced workforce in our team.  C) Marketing/Advertising, we really want to promote our app. We're already restrained to some degree but we're planning on advertising in a few days on various platforms (CoinmarketCap, Reddit, FB, Google, press release websites) to promote the ICO. Unfortunately the crypto platforms for advertisement are very costly ranging up to a few $1000 for a day or two. Reddit/FB/Google on the other hand are OK.  D) R&D and Product Development - Currently for the Alpha we haven't touched many external tools, however some of the leading financial tools/charting software and such are under a licence. We'll also need to be spending money on the team in terms of salaries and such. We're already devoting the vast majority of our token sale to the crowdsale, the bounty allocation is the same as the team allocation (5%).  Taking into account all of the above points, if for example our fundraising came to a total of 50 ETH then that would most likely mean that we can't really exercise anything at all and would severely impact the development time, functionality and such. In our minds for it to be successful we'll need 500 ETH at the bare minimum, the rest allows us to scale a lot faster (servers, team, advertisement, exchanges, prediction models, user simulations, etc).  In the end, no matter the outcome, we'll still be developing Trackr as long as it's sustainable. We may need to revisit our strategy if things turn south however in terms of our model.",False
