There exist users that have deposited their cryptocurrency to trade 2. There exist users with fiat credit in their account 3. There is trading activity 4. And most importantly, there must be users.  Bonus if: * There exists an arbitrage opportunity -- more incentive for trading activity  ---  With that understood, when the IEO happens, a few things happen. 1. In order to purchase NMX tokens, users have to register an account, and deposit their ETH into the exchange 2. Users who do not have NMX tokens can deposit fiat, and purchase ETH (forming an arbitrage opportunity)  This forms the bedrock of trading, having users and coins to trade.  ---  After the IEO, NuMoney coffers will be enriched with USD$7.5M, for which it really is an advance on the future earnings (from fees) albeit at a 66% loss, for which we will use these funds to continually arbitrage our exchange.  And we can do that because from our OTC operations, we have ready liquidity providers and organic buy side demand. The hope is that over time, the exchange bootstraps itself. And it should, because NuMoney is launching concurrently in 3 countries at the same time. Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia -- 3 countries in south-east asia with really poor liquidity (maybe except Indonesia because they have bitcoin.co.id)  I hope this answers your query sufficiently.",False
