Enabling Diners to Pay with Crypto.,"Project Name: MenuBuzz Prepaid Token Sale Token Name: MENU Total Prepaid Tokens: 800,000,000 Total Available in Token Sale: 536,000,000 Value: 1 MENU = USD $0.05 (5 cents) Whitepaper: https://bit.ly/2IiKB8K Token Sale: https://bit.ly/2Gk3GuC  The Problem Very few restaurants accept cryptocurrency making Bitcoin/Ethereum less useful in day to day life. MenuBuzz changes that making it easier to pay for your coffee with crypto. The goal is to add value to MenuBuzz, and the crypto community as a whole, by offering a credible solution for something people need in their everyday lives.  Overview Small & quick transactions, like required in restaurants and bars, are not realistic with Bitcoin or Ethereum due to huge price fluctuations, long transaction times, and high fees. The Bitcoin network isn't ideal for these type of  transactions and the prior knowledge required by the business owner limited its reach to technologically advanced users only. MenuBuzz radically changed this by offering businesses a simple interface for their diners to order and pay with crypto which is converted and deposited into the merchants account in dollars.  Now the business owner doesn't have to understand what a blockchain is in order to accept cryptocurrencies. Exceptionally simple, but powerful in its simplicity.  MenuBuzz accomplishes this through their utility token aptly named MENU.  These prepaid MENU Tokens have an intrinsic value (USD 5 cents each) that doesn’t fluctuate (on the MenuBuzz platform), payment times are near instantaneous, and the customer pays no additional fees when making a payment.  MENU Tokens are vouchers redeemable for food & beverages via the MenuBuzz website. Similar to digital gift cards, MENU Tokens are prepaid and can change hands or gifted to anyone else. Customers can redeem their purchases at participating restaurants right away or withdraw their converted crypto funds to their ERC20 compatible private wallet after the token sale.  MenuBuzz Token The MenuBuzz Token is an ERC20 Standard Token on Ethereum blockchain, fully compatible with popular Ethereum wallets which support ERC20 Tokens and smart-contracts that use the ERC20 Standard.  Its purpose is to provide a vehicle for users to purchase food and beverage items in establishments through cryptocurrency.  Why A New Token? When you buy MENU you are purchasing a pre-paid tokens voucher that does not fluctuate in price within on the MenuBuzz platform.  Rates for each MENU token are locked at $0.05 for each token.  MENU tokens can be used to purchase food & beverages immediately after purchase from participating restaurants.  Market fluctuations are well known with crypto on the exchanges.  MB believes the best way to manage that volatility is to create a new token with solid foundations and lock the rate for each MENU token to $.05.  This stability will go hand in hand with being incorporated in a stable region (Ireland), offering utility tokens that hold real world value, backed by a strong team of professionals in technology and hospitality. By managing the MENU transactions off-chain we don't clog down the main network, eliminate transfer fees, and processing is near instantaneous.

Enabling Diners to Pay with Crypto.,"Good question, thanks for asking.  First, a little background.  With cryptocurrencies being so scrutinized by the SEC, we worked hard to insure that we were compliant with regulations and laws as much as we are aware.  Things are moving so fast that it's difficult, regulations around the world are no where near black and white, but we're trying our best.  This is why we locked in the rate at 5 cents and it doesn't fluctuate and people are buying tokens/vouchers redeemable for food  beverages.  It's also why we built the system first instead of using the funds to build it, thus no speculation as to whether or not the application will be built.  This also solidifies the concept and an argument can be made that it is not a security.  We're in this for the long run, so this is important.  Next, we hope that people would participate because they like the idea.  One of the biggest problems with the crypto industry is there are so few restaurants and bars that accept it.  So if you want to see market penetration expand, and have the restaurant around the corner accept crypto, it's really a good idea to support ideas like this one to help make that happen.  Now, to answer your question, depending on when you get in we are offering 20% bonus tokens on your purchase.  So that's already a 20% increase.  Like gift cards/voucher where people can take home with them, or give them away, we do allow purchasers to withdraw funds into their private wallets outside MenuBuzz where they can trade or gift to others.  At this stage it leaves our system so we can no longer guarantee the rate of 5 cents.  But like how gift cards or people resell concert tickets on secondary markets like eBay, outside the control of the original seller, our tokens can also be sold on to others (assuming it is legal to do in your jurisdiction).  As you're asking a good question, I assume you're knowledgable in this area, and realize if you did withdraw your tokens from the MenuBuzz framework then the price someone is willing to buy that token/voucher for might very well go down.  That's why we certainly don't recommend it. However, unlike other tokens, purchasers can always return the tokens to the MenuBuzz platform where they would retain a value of 5 cents each.  It's a different way of thinking, we know, and it's intentional to both minimize any risk for the purchaser and also to ourselves.  We strongly believe this method, where the token price doesn't fluctuate on our system, is the future of the industry as with this concept it truly is a utility token.  Hope that answers your question.",False

Enabling Diners to Pay with Crypto.,"This is a really bad idea with use cases that make no sense whatsover. there are far too many products out or coming out that will translate cryto to fiat on a pos system or chip and pin. I do not see any reason for there to be another, especially one that has an exclusive application such as this. You can see based on the Benchy evaluation there has been little or no effort in engaging the community. I do not believe this to be a good investment and see 0 opportunities for ROI.",False
