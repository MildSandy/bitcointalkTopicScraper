At that time it was about calculation, analysis and structuring of data in libraries and troops. With the growing amount of information, the processes were getting more complex.  The first Big Data revolution at the start of the 19th century gave rise to the era of analog data storage. It became possible to preserve sounds and images on magnetic tapes, aside from transferring to paper.  The 20th century marks a shift from analog to digital media: 1956 ‚Äî IBM introduces the first hard disk drive, weighing about 1 ton. 1982 ‚Äî Sony and Philips release the first digital optical disc. 1989 ‚Äî the term Data Mining is coined.  Today‚Äôs world sees at least a 30% annual growth in information volumes. According to Cisco, in 2019 the annual global traffic will reach two zettabytes.  mytime will record and store Big Data on a decentralized network. Each service will have access to its user data in desensitized format. Businesses will be able to sell this data and use it for promotion campaign targeting.",False

The entire history of user interaction with other platform participants will be recorded in the blockchain, user identity depersonalised. It will be transparent and easily accessible.

While a person gets coins for the time spent on a service, the service accumulates information about this person‚Äôs behaviour and records it in the blockchain.

How are you going to track bots? These are the questions we are frequently asked at meetings and conferences. To make it clear, we have drawn up a disclaimer for you:  *We do not propose any ready-made economic models for businesses. We are developing a tool for businesses to increase the loyalty and LTV already now, and, ultimately - to determine the value of human time across industries. We equip businesses with new rules of the game, that allow competing for customers in the new economic dimension where time plays the lead.  *We are not going to determine the amount of time spent by people and what they were doing. This function remains with a party interested in a person‚Äôs time. Businesses have already learned how to track users‚Äô time ‚Äì there‚Äôre a lot of tools serving this purpose. What we do, is register payments made to compensate for the invested time, and use this information to build a new open economy.  *We won‚Äôt have our own bot tracking system for online services ‚Äî services have learned how to distinguish, with sufficient accuracy, bots from real people among their audience. Instead, we‚Äôre creating a reputation mechanism that will reflect, in encrypted format, how much time and on what services a person spends. Reputation will help businesses find users fitting best their interests, and pay for the time of these particular users.",False

This is not quite true. The user doesn't need to share any data. You just use a service that is integrated with mytime platform and receive cryptocurrency for it. For example, if Netflix integrates with mytime, you will get paid for watching movies and sitcoms. The only data we get is how much time you've spent in a particular service and how much it paid you. And yes, this data is impersonal. No personal data is collected and stored by the mytime platform.
