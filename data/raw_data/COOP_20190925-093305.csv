This buy-back and burn program will increase the price of the token in proportion to the success of the exchange, and will thus give good returns to holders of the token. This results in a distribution roughly equivalent to each user's holdings (percentage-wise). We can implement a dividends system as well if there is demand for it, but in that case we will need to change the percentage allocated to the buyback program.   Quote from: nistra on June 27, 2018, 12:57:40 PM The declared performance is pretty impressive. Is this an estimated performance or something that you already have? How can I check these values? Source code or any kind of demo app could be helpful.  I'm not sure where you're getting your data from, but our estimated performance is currently approx. 120 TPS and we will scale that according to demand (we estimate we will be able to increase that to 1200 TPS by September). It's an estimate because it is a localized test - when we have thousands of users submitting trades at the same time we'll be able to call it an accomplishment. We're currently working on a new trading UI which should increase speeds as well. We plan to release it and begin live trading alongside the ICO in about 2 weeks.

We cooperate with ours. Join the revolution.  75% of trading fees are shared with token holders Zero exchange listing fees for ERC tokens 50% of ICO funds go towards marketing Easy-to-use trading interface  Services  We provide an array of trading services for our customers.    Trading  Utilize our fast and responsive trading UI to exchange new tokens with major coins. We plan to move Ethereum and ERC20 tokens to a decentralized exchange in the future.    Exchange Listings  We provide exchange listing services for your favorite projects and we do not charge listing fees. Interested in listing on COOPEX? Please fill out the form here.    Token Buyback  Once a month, COOPEX will aggregate at least 75% of exchange trading fees and use them to market buy and burn COOP exchange tokens. We won't tell you until afterwards, so don't keep your sells open!    Exchange API  We provide an API for developers to build on top of our exchange (currently under development).   COINS  COOPEX offers trading pairs with many different coins and tokens. We plan to primarily list new ERC20 tokens and pair them with industry-leading coins such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash.    COOP Token  The Cooperative Exchange Token (COOP) is the COOPEX platform token. Every month, 75% of COOPEX trading fees will be collected and used to buy back the COOP token and burn it. The token will be bought on the actual COOPEX market at market price. We will not perform any OTC trades. This token buyback program will increase the price and decrease the supply, incentivizing exchange users to buy and hold the token. The COOPEX project is committed to decentralization. We understand the security concerns associated with running a centralized exchange. We take many steps to ensure exchange security, but sometimes even that isn’t enough. Thus, in the future we plan on decentralizing the Ethereum and ERC20 portion of the exchange, similar to the IDEX smart contract, and the COOP token will be used as a base asset and for gas (fees).   INITIAL COIN OFFERING  COOPEX is launching an ICO for the COOP exchange token. The ICO is currently ongoing on the exchange. If you are interested in participating in the ICO, please log in, deposit some ETH and visit the COOP/ETH market (click on ""Markets""). Throughout the ICO, the COOP market will be in a 'locked' state, meaning you cannot place any buy or sell orders. You can only buy the token for the listed ICO price. Click on the order with the ""Click here"" text below it and then click ""Buy COOP"" at the bottom to purchase your COOP tokens. The ICO will have pairs for BTC, BCH, and ETH, but the pre-ICO is only available for ETH. Currently, withdrawals for COOP are disabled, but will be enabled in the near future.     ICO Details:  The pre-ICO began on June 18, 2018. The pre-ICO will last for ten days or until 1,000,000 tokens are sold, whichever comes first. The price during the pre-ICO will be approximately $0.05/COOP. So 1 COOP = 0.0001 ETH and 1 ETH = 10,000 COOP.  The ICO will begin on July 1, 2018. The ICO will last for one month or until 9,000,000 tokens are sold, whichever comes first. The price during the ICO will be approximately $0.10/COOP. The price in ETH, BTC, and BCH will be determined at the start of the ICO. Any tokens unsold by the end of the ICO will be burnt.    Please note that participation in the ICO and use of the exchange is limited to non-US citizens only.    Expected circulating supply: 10,000,000  Expected total supply: 12,000,000      ROAD MAP     Marketing  We believe that an exchange is only successful insofar as it is able to market and advertise itself. The biggest exchanges are the ones that pay heavily for marketing. The COOPEX team will use 50% of all ICO funds raised for long-term marketing. We are confident that our ICO funding will give us a large enough marketing fund that we will never actually run out of it entirely - and if we do, we plan to use our percentage of trading fees to supplement the marketing budget.

In the meantime, join our telegram: t.me/coopexmarket You're right that 4 weeks is not a long time, but our soft cap is only $500k and we think we can reach that goal in only 4 weeks time. We are giving ourselves a 1 week grace period beyond the August 1st deadline, and if we still do not reach our soft cap, we will simply have to open the exchange with less funding (still doable, we will just have less funds for marketing).   Quote from: markchoo on June 26, 2018, 09:02:57 AM I worry about security problems from hackers. How could you prevent it?   We are already secure with a firewall and several other security measures in place, but rest assured that we take security very seriously and will use ICO funds to have a security firm perform a penetration testing audit and fix any bugs that are found.   Quote from: SABRINASMF77 on June 26, 2018, 10:15:51 AM You know when someone put you money in your exchange. They need to make sure that you have a real office . So I want to know where is your headoffice?  We currently do not have an office unfortunately, but that will change by the end of the ICO as we should be able to afford a small office or coworking space with funding. We are an international team and we do not feel that an office is essential at this point, but we are primarily based in the US.   Quote from: Liamlion4945 on June 26, 2018, 10:31:07 AM I like trade with usdt/altcoin but most of current exchange not have as much. You should have more usdt/altcoin. In my opinion   Hi, I agree with you - having a stablecoin pairing is essential for many altcoins. We will support DAI and TrueUSD pairs for projects that request it! We may support Tether as well but that will be decided farther in the future. We would prefer tether get audited first     Quote from: mohammedhwang on June 26, 2018, 11:48:05 AM What is your key strength if compare with some enormous centralized system?   We are building a hybrid decentralized exchange on the Ethereum network that will work with BTC/BCH as well as ETH. We say 'hybrid' because the Ethereum assets will all be on a secure smart contract while BTC/BCH will not be (because these coins do not support smart contracts). This way, we can appeal to the masses while maintaining security and allowing users to have custody over their funds at the same time. Also, we have a monthly token buyback program that uses 75% of exchange trading fees. We will also have liquidity support for certain markets that meet the requirements!",False
