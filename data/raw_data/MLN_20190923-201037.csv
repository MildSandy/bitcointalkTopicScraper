A lot of these icos are ran by nerds who no business experience seems like it is just more of a hobby and they could possibly just be pocketing the ico money. They can care less about the investors. Investors want returns not people to run test with their money (golem, digix etc). We still don't even know if the ethereum chain actually works. So far I haven't seen one project up and running.

The founder's background implied that she had tried to setup her own hedge funds in the past, but even with a very large lump sum of £30m she had difficulty entering the marketplace because the cost of doing business was too high.  By executing the initial process via smart contracts on the Eth platform, entry conditions can be met at a much lower cost. Also there are a number of other activities that are associated with running a traditional hedge fund that can be very complex - I would guess they would also automate these via smart contracts.  So, I believe that in Melonport investment strategies and fund management falls entirely on the user, whilst the regulatory conditions and business activities are met by the smart contracts. Iconomi, on the other hand, manages the regulatory environment themselves, and simply provides a user-friendly platform on which traders can create their own funds or follow other funds.  At least that is what I have gleaned so far, and I am a bit sketchy on a few of the details. I don't think they are necessarily direct competitors, and each platform has a different use-case. Melonport strikes me as appealing to bigger fish, whereas Iconomi seems to appeal to the average Joe.  I think they don't have a thread here because they're not really born out of the crypto community.",False

I don't even know if melonport and iconomi are competitors. Melonport seems to be trying to a blockchain version of a very well-defined real world business, a prime brokerage. Prime broker is kind of like etrade or TD Ameritrade for hedge funds and trading firms. If you're a hedge fund, you automatically need a suite of services, someone to lend you margin, someone to clear your trades, someone to lend you stock, maybe someone to do your risk management, maybe someone to validate your returns, maybe someone to lend you credibility (Bernie Madoff was his own prime broker, and could never have ran his scam had he had a regular prime broker). Melonport seems to be trying to do this for crypto hedge funds. I think eventually (many years from now) they hope that they can compete with prime brokers directly if clearing equity trades can be done on the blockchain.  Iconomi does not seem to want to be a prime broker. They seem to want to be something like a hybrid of covestor.com and an ETF issuer for the blockchain. There's no reason these business would be competitors. There non-crypto analogs do not compete at all in the normal financial world. It might be more accurate to describe iconomi as a competitor with melonport's cypto-hedge fund clients (maybe). It might even make sense for iconomi to eventually become a client of melonport.",False
