I am looking forward for more active team members of bitmillex also an active updates too.   This i will explain with a two-sided view.  1. Requiring users to update their personal details and verifying same is actually a security feature in itself. One of the reasons behind it, is to ensure that actual account owners have access to funds in wallets.   2. it is a compliance issue. A compliant exchange is a safer exchange to trade and have funds on than an exchange that can be subjected to litigations and regulatory clampdowns that might end up affecting the funds and investments of users.  So, while it is our aim and desire to avoid bottlenecks and rigidity, safety of investors funds is higher on our scale of priorities. We assure you that any form of verification we carry out will be done under best practices and will never lead to compromise of investors personal details",False

Performance will show periods like ""top within the last 3 days"",  The last 7 days, the last one month, the last 6 months...with this data, whoever wants to copy a top trader has enough information to decide who to copy. Follower simply chooses by clicking the follow button and sets parameters to decide what percentage of his (followers account balance) he wishes to invest with the leader. From that time until terminated, every trade executed by leader will duplicate on the account of the follower   Quote from: steampunkz on May 11, 2018, 09:36:41 AM The airdrop campaign for these ICO is already closed too early? Is there any plan again to relaunch this one? And Are there any bounty campaigns to be released for the supporters?  Yes the tokens were all gone in a a total of 76h and 43m! No bounty campagins or further airdrops are planned for the duration of the ico.",False

Why We Are The Most Complete Platform      Roadmap       Updates/News  Check Update #1 - Intro welcome message  Check Update #2 - Airdrop has closed in a record time of 76 hours   ЁЯФ╢ The Bitmillex Auto-Trade Feature Summary ЁЯФ╢  тЬЕThis feature is designed for the following categories of traders; the newbies, the less skilled, the ones who do not have the time to trade and those who seek passive income without active involvement.  тЬЕIt works on the principle of Copy Trading, where there is the copier (or follower) and the leader.  тЬЕOn the exchange will exist a pool called тАЬmy cryptobookтАЭ where any trader who wishes to participate can register and make his trading performance visible to everyone else on the platform. It is a ranking of the top traders on the exchange which can be sorted by period, by number of trades and by amount(BTC and USD) made in profits.  Beside each ranked trader will be a follow button.  тЬЕTraders who wish to follow a trader will review the performances and select which trader they wish to follow by clicking the follow button. The follower will decide how much of his available balance he wishes to commit to the leader and further determine how much of the committed funds should be allocated to each trade.  тЬЕTraders are allowed to set a stop-loss percentage. This means if the cumulative amount committed to a particular leader drops by the set stop-loss percentage, all open trades will be automatically closed.  тЬЕThe leader receives a percentage of the profits made by his followers.  101 REASONS NOT TO MISS BITMILLEX ICO  тЬФя╕П 1# The Bitmillex ICO is for two exchanges. 1 ICO, 2 exchanges. A hybrid approach that will birth a centralized platform and a decentralized one in Q1 2019.  тЬФя╕П 2# Bitmillex is being hosted on the most advanced and secure servers. On this and at full launch, we are partnering with Amazon Web Service and will operate a fail-safe system with alternative, fully dedicated cloud server backup.  тЬФя╕П 3# Bitmillex partners with world #1 hacker powered security platform, Hackerone to conduct a continuous vulnerability checking and fixing program. (This works by having over 100,000 hackers on their network have a continuous go at Bitmillex systems to look for loopholes and areas of weakness. For every weakness found, it is immediately sealed in collaboration with the Bitmillex developers. This will go on until there is no known vulnerability)  тЬФя╕П 4# Bitmillex shall at every instant hold no greater than 2% of total investor funds online,The remaining 98% shall be offline in secure cold wallets. (And the 2% online shall be fully insured against any form of loss)  тЬФя╕П 5# The Bitmillex servers shall be connected to custom built hardware security modules (HSM) to safeguard and manage all digital keys for superior authentication and protection of cryptographic keys. (This is what the big banks use to secure their servers that is why we never hear of them being hacked. Only one or two known cryptocurrency exchanges have this feature)  тЬФя╕П 6# On Bitmillex exchange, users can buy and sell BTC and ETH directly to and from other users in a unique peer to peer arrangement (Like what is done on Paxful)",False

We prefer to describe ourselves as a platform because what we offer goes beyond mere Exchange. These features cannot be effected on a decentralized Exchange. So we centralize. Now, a look down our road map reveals what we have in store to achieve decentralization. In Q1 2019, we will be launching the Bitmillex Decentralex. A fully decentralized exchange that will come with unique features as well! Stay tuned for more news.
