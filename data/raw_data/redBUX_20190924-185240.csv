When I want to deceive someone and then disappear with his money, then I do it with a fraction of the work, they did for this project!  The problem here seems to be that many of the so called ""bounty hunters""- people who did advertising for this project- apperently didn't get paid out the full promised loan- to be exact, only a small fraction of the promised loan. So they feel deceived by this project. Of course, I can fully understand their anger- if I was affected by this, I also would feel angry about the people from this company. I hope for them that they can still get their full ammount of coins they were promised somehow... either this incident happend by a technical error, or they did it on purpose, of course it's bad in both cases!  But this bad incident of course does not mean that the whole project is scam. Someone here posted that he din't hear anything from this company for 2 months. That's not true! Support was online when the ICO ended 1 month ago and they did everthing for the investors that people could get the coins, they bought. I also went in here for a speculation with a small sum and got my coins without bigger problems. If that seemed like scam to me, I wouldn't have invested a single cent! So, don't beleive in any posts claiming that this is ""scam""!!  But, of course, I would also wish, there was better communication between the team and the public. Regular updates on their website or on facebook and other social media e.g. would be fine, also regular mails to the subscribers. Just that everyone knows what's going on at the monemt.

As already announced, we talked to several crypto exchanges to list the token. Negotiations are nearing completion. Since we have an utility token, we have to make sure that the token can be used before going to an exchange. In our ecosystem we are currently creating about 20 thousand acceptance points. These are online shops, video portals and cam girls. The first tests are going very well. According to current planning, we will have completed the test phase and implementation by the end of September. Once this has been done, we have to give all users of these portals and shops the opportunity to purchase redBUX tokens and start the listing at several crypto exchanges. We are looking forward to this day.  and:   vrXcity.com  We are making excellent progress with the basic software and the first interactive erotic world. We also regularly scan new actors and create  digital avatars of them so that we have a good portfolio of actors at the start of vrXcity. There is something for every taste. In September, we will produce an intensive series of scans in the States. The top stars of the American erotic scene will be scanned.  and the last part of the mail:   me.mento 3D GmbH   Our team of developers and 3D designers is constantly growing.

Starting at €0.74/100 redBUX, the price per token will rise until the ICO closes.     Our Vision:  One token radically changes a whole generation's way of enjoying adult entertainment. Imagine, you will be able to interact with lifelike, fully animated, artificially intelligent and naturally moving avatars of erotic stars. You can talk to them, touch them and do anything you want with them. You create the content, every fetish is possible. You are the Boss in the world’s first interactive VR erotic platform for adults.  Based on our blockchain solution which shares the payments between the content and service providers in real-time, redBUX is the cryptocurrency to make the decentralization of adult content possible. In addition vrXcity will become the #1 platform of interactive VR porn, provided from famous porn stars and users like you and me.  Token Design:  redBUX is designed as a standard utility token, based on the ERC-20 standard, and will be used as a guaranteed means of payment in the erotic world of vrXcity as well as by six other big players in the erotic and porn industry. Through technical innovations and the use of blockchain technology, redBUX makes it possible to make payments within the VR world without having to remove the VR glasses or exit the 3D world. The token provides the user with secure and anonymous access to erotic content, and offers real-time commission settlement to the partners of me.mento.  As a closed ecosystem, me.mento will not release any additional tokens after the sum of 20.000.000.000 has been minted. Therefore, the tokens are expected to rise in value as demand for the platform increases.   Token Allocation and Distribution:    Referral Programmes:  During the pre-sale and ITO, me.mento will offer two promotional programmes for redBUX to grow popularity, affiliate and bounty. Target audience includes bloggers, website publishers, mobile marketers, media buyers, e-mail marketers, affiliate networks or social media commentators. me.mento gives these influencers the opportunity to generate passive income for referrals and turn a real profit. Affiliate Programme: influencers will be notified for every recommendation and conversion to the redBUX landing page that comes from their individual tracking link.

Many of the 3rd party sites/points of payment who have already committed are using the token to make it easier for their customers to move to vrXcity, since they plan to use the cutting-edge VR platform to promote their content.",False
