For example in real life as of now, you know that courts will take care of punishing someone for violating a contract according to criminal justice. So to say you have two spheres now which is criminal justice and civil justice. In Pangea it feels more like you only have the civil justice. Does that make sense what I say? Do you know what I mean?  If, theoretically, a contract is only made via a nation on Pangea, could someone be sent to jail for violating a contract based on Pangea? It's not like a person would go voluntarily, someone has to make a ruling for that. Would a judiciary fully acknowledge those contracts? I hope it makes sense what I ask.",False

I do want to point out that most courts can punish someone for a breach of contract which is something that Bitnation citizens will have, so technically speaking the contract would be enforceable.

Pangea awards three non-tradable sub-tokens for 1.) making and successfully completing contracts and arbitrating disputes (keeping your word), 2.) building and populating  nations and offering services citizens rate highly, 3.) developing and updating smart contracts that are highly rated by users. Users can only rate ‘machines ’ - smart contracts and nations - not other users (to prevent popularity contests), while a machine (AI) rates users against set criteria.  PAT is a tradable reward (like air miles) for building up a good reputation (accumulating non-tradable tokens). It can be used on the platform to buy services and exchanged for other digital assets - we have a deal with shapeshift already. You can also use any other crypto to buy services and trade on Pangea, but use of PAT will provide a small discount.   So a jurisdiction is a domain of law. In which any agreements can made and upheld to a set of agreed rules (a legal code). Because ours is a peer-to-peer jurisdiction, those rules are agreed between the parties to each agreement, not by any third party or authority. The Pangea jurisdiction allows these agreements to be made, and provides a native human arbitration system to resolve disputes - and a reputation system for enforcement.  In addition to p2p agreements, users can also create their own voluntary communities- nations- for collective agreements, and to offer governance services. These can use the Pangea jurisdiction to their own set of collective rules.  Since they are voluntary (nobody is forced to join them, and any citizen can leave at any time) these communities must compete for citizens in a free market for governance - and it’s perfectly possible - even likely - that users will join several nations to access different services (e.g. a occupation based nation, say for employment and education - e.g. a wheat farmers nation, or a solidity developers nation, another for their local needs - say a neighborhood or city association for trash  collection, basic income and local services, and a cultural nation for religious or other social services - like a nation of Goths or Buddhists.) so governance becomes like other aspects of life, a matter of choosing what suits you best.",False

It is a very interesting but also challenging concept in the way that it is hard to grasp its potential impact on our real lives. You mention, among others, this example of a wheat farmers nation: that is where I have a hard time to fully understand the consequences of such a nation. If we say that a wheat farmer enters a contract with a baker and both agree on a certain price to be paid for a certain amount of wheat on a specific date via Bitnation (is that a possible example, i.e. a futures contract?), and the baker doesn't pay, then the baker will lose reputation. Does that situation have any consequence outside the ""virtual"" bitnation world? Or am I totally off here with my example?  I do understand what you are essentially building, at least I believe so. I am just asking myself how Bitnation exists in relation to our current world? Can we just be there and make contracts outside or our jurisdictional world? Is that even legal?",False

This reduces or increase your chances of other to carry business transactions with you or not in the future. Aside reputation on Pangea which sounds more virtual, there's also an escrow - you will be able to put digital assets into escrow on a blockchain, (examples are land titles, ownership documents for assets like cars etc, deeds for buildings, wills, crypto-currency etc.), these will only be released on contract completion after arbitration. So in your case scenario if baker doesn't pay the farmer, what ever asset that was held in escrow will not be released until he carries out his part of the contract. There's also contract insurance - you can take out insurance against one party failing to fulfill their part of the bargain.  We all operate in both virtual and non-virtual worlds, and more so. You could have a bank account in New York and never visit a bank there or seen any of your cash dollars, but it will still work well for you when you need it because you can access it online. Goods are ordered daily from  Amazon, but nobody goes an Amazon store (in fact like the bank in New York, they don't exist as places you can walk into and do business), but like the dollars from the bank, the books from Amazon arrive on time. Why should jurisdiction be any different? The fact that it is, suggests its an archaic system ripe for disruption.  I hope this answers your question.",False

How many PAT were sold during pre-sale? I read it was 10% of supply.  1. That would mean the price was around 2.7 mil $ /42b * 10% = 0.000643 $/PAT. Is this the right ballpark figure or am i mistaken?  2. The lowest possible market cap after the public sale would be 4.2b * 0.09 = 378.000.000 $ , correct?  3. At what rate was $/ETH fixed?  4. Let's assume it was fixed at 500$/ETH. Then let's assume ETH falls to 400$/ETH. Does that mean i will receive 500$ worth of PAT, even though I only payed 400$ for the ETH I have sent?

It is opt-in, opt-out, so no-one can be forced to join or to stay in the group. So your primary right is that of the freedom to join and leave the Holon, based on whether it’s values, rules and services are aligned with your needs, or whether it is able to achieve its set goals.  The second feature of Holons which distinct it from legacy governance organisations, is that anyone can form them. So if you can’t find a nation or community to meet your needs, you can create one of your own and ask others to join you. So new governance organizations compete with old ones to meet your needs- creating a competitive market for governance.",False

It enables individuals as well as entire communities to reclaim their sovereignty by creating jurisdictions on the blockchain. We are currently working on the very infrastructure that will enable DApp developers to build governance services and entire nations (DBVNs: Decentralized borderless voluntary nations) on top of our Pangea platform.  Pangea will include ID and reputation services, as well as Ethereum smart contracts to sign agreements, create new laws as well as DBVNs. One critical function of a jurisdiction is dispute resolution. We will provide a market of arbitrators competing for reputation and clients, in stark contrast to existing court services that consume time and money.   What we are trying to accomplish is to enable people all over the world to live independently from the geographic apartheid that is imposed upon us by nation-states. People should enjoy high-quality governance services without being discriminated against based on their place of birth. The value we aim to provide is to enable everyone with a smartphone to opt-out from the system they live in without having to move geographically.

Skeptical about the virtue and value of international interventionism, Bitnation’s Founder Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, begin work in October 2012 on designing and advocating peer-to-peer governance solutions. Her first public talk on decentralized, competitive governance was in TEDx Gothenburg (Sweden), that same month, and days afterwards she signed a book deal to write about the idea that became Bitnation, which she then called The Googlement.  To research the book she spent eighteen months travelling throughout the world, visiting and speaking about self-governing communities, from private cities in Honduras and the Dominican Republic to shanty towns in Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, and on to anarchist and crypto startups in Berlin, the Czech Republic and Switzerland and Libertarian communities in Chile, Guatemala and Sweden.

In which any agreements can made and upheld to a set of agreed rules (a legal code). Because ours is a peer-to-peer jurisdiction, those rules are agreed between the parties to each agreement, not by any third party or authority. The Pangea jurisdiction allows these agreements to be made, and provides a native human arbitration system to resolve disputes - and a reputation system for enforcement.  In addition to p2p agreements, users can also create their own voluntary communities- nations- for collective agreements, and to offer governance services. These can use the Pangea jurisdiction to their own set of collective rules.  Since they are voluntary (nobody is forced to join them, and any citizen can leave at any time) these communities must compete for citizens in a free market for governance - and it’s perfectly possible - even likely - that users will join several nations to access different services (e.g. a occupation based nation, say for employment and education - e.g. a wheat farmers nation, or a solidity developers nation, another for their local needs - say a neighborhood or city association for trash  collection, basic income and local services, and a cultural nation for religious or other social services - like a nation of Goths or Buddhists.) so governance becomes like other aspects of life, a matter of choosing what suits you best.",False

Bitnation, Pangea and PAT FAQ  PAT Token Functionality  The Pangea Arbitration Token (PAT) is an ERC20 compatible in-app token for the Pangea Jurisdiction. The PAT system is proof-of-reputation for Citizens, issued when Citizens create a contract, successfully complete a contract or resolve a dispute attached to a contract. PAT is an algorithmic reputation token; an arbitration currency based on performance, rather than purchasing power, popularity, or attention.  PAT Token Distribution Mechanism  The distribution mechanism for PAT tokens on Pangea is an autonomous agent, Lucy, which will initially launch on Ethereum as a smart contract. This mechanism will be blockchain agnostic and can be ported to any viable smart contract platform. An oracle created by Bitnation will help to facilitate this (semi) autonomous distribution mechanism in a decentralized and secure fashion.  Bitnation’s Pangea Technology  The Pangea Software is a Decentralized Opt-In Jurisdiction where Citizens can conduct peer-to-peer arbitration and create their own Nations. Pangea uses the Panthalassa mesh, which is built using Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) protocols. This enables Pangea to be highly resilient and secure, conferring resistance to emergent threats such as high-performance quantum cryptography. Pangea is blockchain agnostic, but uses the Ethereum blockchain for the time being. In the future, other chains such as Bitcoin, EOS and Tezos can be integrated with Pangea.  Bounties  PAT bounties for translations and software testing are being announced on our Slack channel in the #bounty channel.  XBNX Conversion  Early supporters who hold XBNX will be able to convert them to PAT at the end of the token sale through a token burn process.  Token Sale Event (TSE)  TSE Token Release: 34% of the tokens will be released during the token sale. During the pre- sale we will sell at least 10%. The TSE is hard-capped at US $30 million.
