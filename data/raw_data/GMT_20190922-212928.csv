So a very small but important announcement! Right now we are in a very big load of tasks that do not give us enough free time to post lots of marketing bullshit into this topic =))  So to be very honest - there is a small but very important change to the initial page this topic has.  It is like a patch, let,s say 2.0 instead of Gamity idea version 1, 1,1 and up to 1,9 (you may follow some data on this lookng at uploaded whitepapers to our website www.gamity.io).  What is happening: 1) We are very influenced by the idea of DAICO - so we could make a very small change with our smart contract so that pre GMT tokens are substituted with GMTY tokens. Right now Slava (Hubcoindev) is airdropping those amounts of tokens to the very first investors that believed in our project and invested about 10 ETH. This may look funny, but for us it is extremely important that every single investor receives new GMTY tokens at a 2x value compared to received pre GMT tokens (this was in initial promise for the so-called preICO period)  2) We do not support ICO any more, because we believe in the DAICO concept. This is difficult to say, but after visiting dozens of meetup, following some stongest ICO's and knowing a lot of those people in person - I am really afraid seeing what easy money makes with these people... We really hope that DAICO will change the game as a 2.0 patch to cryptofundraising.  3) We, as believers in this model do not KNOW how exactly to execute all the DAO+ICO principles and would like to find all the suggestions here on bitcointalk - as it was in a galaxy far far away when Ethereum and bitcoin were the only projects =))  4) We hope that there will be no pre-paid advertisements in our topic, for us it is much better to have 1 post per 2 months, but to know that it comes from a real person who thinks good/bad about Gamity. We will NEVER do something like bitcointalk pumping, because the belief is still strong in this holy place!  5) There is no big marketing for Gamity, because it seems like a very red ocean already. There are services for 100 000 $ OMG WHAT THE F...k=(( A year ago it could not be possible. So we do not plan to take part in such activities in 2018 anymore...  6) We will choose wisely where to go/not to go and what meetups to attend with a hope that our choices will be still supported by our community.  7) Please send all your questions/ideas either here, or to our telegram group https://t.me/CryptoStudents (for english speakers) and to https://t.me/Gamity for english and Russian language speakers  Rating systems show us somewhere as an ICO - DO NOT believe in it. ICO does not run anywhere! DAICO will possibly run until summer 2018 - we are not in a hurry  BR Anver Layshev CEO Gamity",False

This is a very small russian factory where we started to use the Gamity concept starting from december 2015. Back then there was no stong will to use blockchain - we only used gamification. Step by step. So this is an existing business that sucessfully implemented all the Gamity ideas of (this was an industrial Startup that Grew up from total zero in 2013 up to 11 team members in 2017 and the best turnover of 1,5 mln $ in less than 3 years!!!), let's say, level 1 and with blockchain Gamity was upgraded to level 2.  And also a very important notice here is that we know that this role-model could be used not only as a separate business solution for factory 2 in China and for factory 3 in Brasil and etc - BUT for all the factories arounf the world!  For this solution we will need a successful 3-5 level DAICO and strong community support. When this will happen - all the factories where processes look similar may be connected into a HUGE Gamity hub with an internal system to involve every worker into processes, give best in the world gamification tools for middle managers, and make top-managers and owners feel a bit relaxed, because they will know that nobody steals from them, nobody lies to them (because reports will be inmutable and impossible to change the real facts, happening/not happening inside the business processes of the factory) and lots of other stuff.  Most importtant part of the answer to this MECONS integration - we know the PAIN that is happening at factories all over the world because we have relevant experience there! And there is really a HUGE room for improvement worldwide my friends =))",False

During preliminary token sale period it will be possible to exchange 1 preGamity token (that could be bought even for 0,1$ during open public smart-contract pre-sale that was available until 2017) to 2 Gamity tokens (GMTY) when we will start token sale in 2018. (50% benefit) For buying, send any Ether to our adress and you will get preGamity tokens on you wallet, which sent transcation within 24 hours. Make sure that you have access to the wallet keys, do not send Ether from exchanges. You can register light wallet on http://myetherwallet.com We also plan step-by-step upgrades, so soon we could possibly add bitcoin and other currencies processing!   There is a global problem: 87% of employees in the world are not involved in the work. The work seems to be too boring and uninteresting for all these people!  The problem of involvement in the whole world usually solved by the ""carrot and stick"" Meanwhile: 58% of people around the world are playing videogames instead of working. 45% of those are females. 30 years - average age of those employees The videogame market in the world is $99,6 bln - so it's almost like two biggest cryptocurrencies together =) We may learn something from that!  http://92.53.104.234/presentation.png  We have a global solution: The implementation of the game in the company's business processes! This is called ""soft gamification"". Later on, depending on the DAICO stats, ""hard gamification"" may appear, when Game is developed before the business processes! We are going to develop Gamity on Ethereum blockchain, based on the DAO contracts and later on develop our own Gamity DAO when we have enough resource and experience! But again, later on, we plan to have closer look at other blockchains, at this moment of time - we also plan to work with Steemit/Golos blockchains to build a community package for our system!    Unlike saleforse and another centralized solutions, we make Gamity on Blockchain. This will solve the problem of trust, and this will allow to scale Gamity for the whole world step by step.  When we connect other factories and plants to a centralized (in the beginning) gamification system, there will always be a person or an authority that will control everything ... Any plant or factory will not want to give control to such an important system for anyone centralized in the nearest future ... Such a company, if desired, will be able to raise prices for services, charge additional commissions, at its discretion, choose factories where the system will be introduced, to delay the payment of bonuses, to block old customers etc. = make life of people harder, not easier...  Blokchain solves these problems (and not only them), removes the human factor from the system, makes it transparent and completely solves the issue of trust. Thanks to this, it will be much easier to introduce Gamity to other factories and companies, so despite borderlines we will be able to scale Gamity and distribute it to the whole planet through factories first! Moreover, due to the decentralization of Gamity, factories, enterprises, logistics and any other interested processes will be able to implement the system independently, without our approval and participation!  So in the end, we want people who work at all the industrial factories worldwide upgrade their level of work with fun, based on blockchain! To delete all the unnecessary middle-hands away from factories as soon as possible, so that our kids could live in a much better world than we did...  Dear Friends! Support of each one of you may give our small project a chance to become global not in decades, but in years! We would appreciate any word of you, good or bad, so please speak to our team here!  As far as main details of the project are in russian at the moment - we add materials and upgrade the basic website step by step everyday starting from September 2017, so please don't judge us too strong =) We do not spend thousands of ETH into marketing, we try making it all by ourselves to save the Gamity spirit =)  Please welcome to our first experience on bitcointalk.

Typically gamifications apply to non-game applications and processes, to encourage people to adopt them, or to influence how they are used. Gamification works by making the technology more appealing, by encouraging users to engage in desired behavior, by demonstrating a path to mastery and autonomy, by helping to solve problems and not become distractions, and by taking advantage of human psychological tendencies' to engage in games . This technique can encourage people to do their usually boring jobs, such as completing surveys, shopping, filling out tax forms, or reading websites This project is very smart choosing this concept, because one of the sites like DevHub, has increased the number of users who complete their online tasks from 10% to 80% after adding gamifikasi elements, this project really has the potential to succeed, hopefully run well and according to plan",False
