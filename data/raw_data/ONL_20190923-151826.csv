Its basic function is to allow flexible Ethereum based coin and token storage solution within web browser itself. No external wallet software is needed when using Metamask.  Metamask has additional beneficial functionalities when it’s used as a wallet, as it offers fully customizable transfers including user selectable gas price and gas limit and view into current exchange rates for tokens right from its own interface. Metamask facilitates all transfer operations, saving time and money for its users.  Besides acting as a convenient browser based wallet, main power of the solution lays in providing a bridge between ethereum blockchain and web services utilizing ERC20 tokens or ETH itself. Metamask plugin allows integration into sites using tokens for internal account settlements allowing fully automated, decentralized and anonymous payments in the internet.

On.Live is a platform which transforms and moves existing applicable stationary or telephone served services to internet by means of live video streaming. It simplifies contact of two parties allowing a possibility of easy mutual account settlements. In On.Live business model, the customer itself sets the cost and timeframe in which he’ll be able to serve his clients. Clients on the other side are free to choose any convenient date or available timeslot from the calendar of service provider. Customers can also ask to implement the service immediately when given service provider is onlive or send instant message asking for immediate video session. If the parties, the provider and customer finally agree upon time and cost of the live streaming session a service contract is set. The contract itself locks the funds of the customer in escrow, which can be released to service provider only after successful fulfilment of the session. This mechanism is necessary to protect clients from fraud. Of course any disputes regarding substantive or technical quality of service are possible to resolve if necessary and system has built in tools just for such case.  With On.Live there is also a function for free or payed live video broadcasting to wider group of recipients. Broadcast modes are suitable as communication channels for advertising services, transmitting commercial events or promotion of services inside and outside of On.Live to individual customers. On.Live platform services are universally flexible allowing to mix and match payed and free content according to marketing plans of entities using the system.   As a platform provider On.Live has unique proposition for virtually any industry which can benefit and profit from live presence in the internet without additional hurdles in designing and maintaining its own software/hardware and accounting infrastructure.

According to the Deloitte 2018 Technology, Media and Telecommunications global report, live broadcasts will contribute $545 billion to the global economy in all of 2018. Live streaming and eSports will contribute an additional $1.5 billion this year. Live broadcasting continues to be vibrant and consumers are demanding more live streaming content than ever before. The public just cannot seem to get enough! While entertainment content is on the rise, and benefits of live interaction with the streamers fuel the amount of time public spends consuming video media, there is also a strong need for more serious content. One that answers specific needs of the consumer and is not focused purely on entertainment. The consultancy market in particular is now strongly dependent on stationary services and old ways of doing business. Although, some of the entities marked their presence in the realm of world wide web, most of webpages only provide basic information about services pushing potential customers to use the telephone or email, for more detailed information and finally setting an appointment in local branch office to settle their case. Such model of operation is clearly inefficient. It wastes time, money, and appears yesteryear in the world of ever developing digital technologies. Resources dedicated to branch offices, telephone conversations and appointments can be allocated elsewhere, greatly improving turnover for consultation businesses and also, what is even more important, increasing satisfaction and saving precious time of the clients. On.Live is created with goal of revolutionizing the ways that consulting market works. The platform is dedicated primarily for advisors and consultants in every imaginable industry. On.Live constitutes a streaming live video bridge between consultants and their clients, offering unparalleled flexibility, all necessary scheduling tools, and settlements of the accounts which is transparent, understandable and easy both for service providers and their clients.

In fact, everyone can use the platform and provide advices, consultations, live courses, language lessons, business meetings transmissions, or payed webinars. The platform is open to everyone. It’s worth noting, that On.Live unlike any other platform does not have any registration fees. Platform only acquires small commission for every payed transmission, being an intermediary, and not interfering in prices of the services or the ways the customers are conducting their business. Live streaming revenue should top $7.5 billion in 2018, a whopping 47% increase over 2017, and is predicted to grow at fast pace for years to follow.

Our servers are connected directly to nodes.  Content delivery network is essential for uninterrupted live stream delivery to final recipients.

It operates worldwide without interrupts since 2013, and is acclaimed as a modern, safe Trading Platform for accessing cryptocurrency exchange markets. 30 million USD of daily turnover on the platform provides strong evidence for high customer regard and secures On.Live’s interest in high volume trading. Among all important factors, our choice of Livecoin, was dictated by its low commissions allowing profitable trade for ONL holders even with low volume transactions. Also low deposit and withdrawal amounts and fees are of no less importance, especially for occasional traders. Livecoin platform currently supports three major FIAT currencies. Besides EUR and USD present on every international platform it also provides RUR which may be convenient for our Russian users. We do care for safety of our contributors.

Livecoin provides high standard of customers’ accounts safety with 2-factor authentication. Our agreement with Livecoin for initial trading consists of two currency pairs. ONL/BTC and ONL/ETH are available just from the start with options for others in the future.

There are quite few things that happened in the past month, we think are worth mentioning:  •   Most importantly, we have finalized an agreement with Livecoin.net. On.Live tokens are tradeable from 30th of May. After tranquil start, trading volume is steadily growing and we also expect rise in exchange rates in the forthcoming month. It’s a good opportunity, for those who missed ICOs to build-up their crypto wallet with ONL. Also ONL token holders can replenish their stockpiles, as current price and market trend on exchange is very promising.  •   On.Live was recognized by CryptoCompare.com. Quotations from Livecoin.net are now also visible on this popular platform. CryptoCompare provides insight view into big chunk of crypto currencies market with rates, comprehensive statistics, reviews and forums. Presence on this platform will surely enhance public recognition of the platform.  •   We have also sign an agreement with media fund, which will invest in ONL, and also provide access to high profile content broadcasters. There is a saying, that content is king. We are sure that On.Live users, and especially early adopters are more than capable in delivering worthwhile services. We also think, that access to studio quality broadcasts will give the platform additional forward momentum and will result in rapid increase in number of regular consumers and offerings by service providers, with clear benefits for everyone. Together with the community we want On.Live to thrive, so we don’t leave anything to chance and do our best to provide strong associates, right before official launch.  •   We work hard, together with our teams, to bring the platform online as fast as possible.

On our Platform the safety of your tokens is paramount. That is why we created “Vault 11” - a high profile escrow solution designed to protect ONL tokens and encrypted using the latest cryptographic technology.  How does it work?  Say you want to have your one-to-one online guitar lesson through the OnLive Platform. You log in, book available time of your class, and make ONL payment. Your tokens do not directly go to your guitar teacher as they are deposited in Vault 11. They are now in escrow which means that they go to the seller only if the service is successfully completed. Otherwise you will get your ONL back. Therefore, Vault 11 ensures everyone gets what they are due at essentially the same time.  Read More https://v11.on.live/",False

Here's the latest from the Team:  Quote We present another fragment of information about functionalities of On.Live in version 0.1. These are absolutely crucial for platform operation in desired and advertised way. All of them are implemented and working well in our tests. Yet we are refining them for excellent final user experience. Today take a look at On.Live calendar, the scheduler of your on-line sessions.  •  Calendar is the “command center” for every On.Live user. Users can schedule individual consultations or buy access for public broadcasts with it. “My calendar” provides a list of all available broadcast subscriptions and list of all services used and bought in the past. It is from calendar where you can change date of your consultations or share the links to public broadcasts with your friends. Also here any user can find a list of lost opportunities and the list of consultation that for some reason did not come to fruition. There is also easy option to go directly to chat from here and to reschedule your planned session sometime in the future.  We surely will keep our future users informed about all changes and new functions being implemented into the system. For more insight, and detailed information please refer to our Whitepaper and previous posts on our social media channels.",False

Most of them, of course, allow such option but such transmissions really only serve the purpose of building viewers base. There are virtually no options besides in-video banners and external sponsorship to monetize such broadcasts. The same situation affects channels presenting content of very narrow specialization. Services currently present on the market does not allow profits without substantial consumer base, and niche subjects by its nature don’t attract many viewers. On.Live solves all problems discouraging people from opening their highly specialized channels. The platform presents an entirely different approach to live video and mass broadcast market. With full tokenization On.Live creates an incentive for everyone to join and provide specialized content which can become profitable with first viewers and from day one.

For this reason, we have introduced a two-fold evaluation and verification system.  •  First are the account refinement and recommendation system. Channel owners have the ability to enter supplementary information about services they provide. Guidelines based on tags describing the channel in details, various methods of reaching the service provider chosen in settings and convenient hours of online availability certainly adds to the perception of the credibility of any given channel operator. Additionally, every user has an ability to rate any given finished session. Rates from individual users are calculated giving overall user satisfaction factor seen under each channel on the platform.  •  Selected verified users can undergo a second verification process. This is applicable and required for those service providers whose occupation requires legal licenses, such as for medical doctors or lawyers.  On.Live puts a lot of attention to service providers’ verification functions. Ease of finding the required advisor supported by verification and evaluation system and safety of our clients is always the top priority for us!

Viewers and media creators seem to have endless possibilities to choose where to watch or publish their videos. But most of the platforms present a similar set of impediments for creators restricting their potential to grow. The same shortcomings have their strong influence on the type of content that is presented live or uploaded to these platforms. Monetization policies discourage newcomers, or what’s worst render some type of content entirely not viable from creator’s economic point of view. Many interesting, knowledgeable people quickly resign maintaining their channels or produce materials rather infrequently. Such state of the matters even further reduces their viewer base and contributes to eventual failure. Read the case study on the problems of contemporary video platforms, and see how On.Live addresses all of them, creating possibilities for content and services simply impossible on any other platform, and allowing it's users to profit every time regardless of their permanent viewers base.

The VLOAD cash voucher enables fast and easy payments for internet users and complies with the highest standards of KYC rules and responsible banking. Thanks to VLOAD, we simplified the ONL purchase process. Everyone can now contribute to On.Live using the most popular payment cards, simple bank transfers (SWIFT), or an alternative payment method (Alipay – SOFORT – iDeal – GiroPay…). All transfers through VLOAD involve provisions depending on the payment method you choose. However, On.Live is obliged to give back this provision in the form of ONL tokens !!! In the end, each contributor using VLOAD will get the same amount of ONLs as using an ETH wallet transfer, but in an easier, faster, safer and more user-friendly way.

For pools we create locks, check it here https://v11.on.live/ We did it to ensure security for all investors and to ensure stable growth on exchange.  Vault 11 – On.Live escrow solution. V11 is used to lock up certain amount of tokens not assigned for Pre-ICO and ICO as well as all funders tokens released on ICOs. The holders of lock-up tokens cannot sell them until precisely defined date. This mechanism is deployed to insure steady rise of ONL at exchanges and to prevent abrupt price changes in case of large pools of tokens put up for sale. For instance, all tokens assigned to founders are issued with at least 60 months lock-up period with the last tranche scheduled to be released in April 2023. Tokens envisaged for marketing, advisors and legal counsel of the platform are also rigidly locked in tranches with release dates stretching up to 2021. Vault 11 solution offers transparent view on all locked-up pools of tokens. Every On.Live user can be sure that none of the tokens locked in vault will be transferred until applicable period is over. To further prevent depreciation of value of tokens in hand of our contributors, not sold ONL’s will never enter the circulation. All unbought tokens will be burned! After token burn total number of tokens available on the market decreases and, as a consequence, the value of each individual token may increase.  Vault 11 adds all important safety, transparency and insight to ONL currency system. On.Live founders are strongly committed to long run success and grow of the platform, and believe that Vault 11 solution greatly adds to present On.Live credibility expressed widely by contributors and the community.

System is configured in a manner that simplifies required set up operations for the broadcasters, transcoders and relay node operators. From the perspective of broadcaster, operations consist only of three basic steps. First, every content creator sets its own price for streams they provide. Then they have to choose his transcoding partner suitable for their target audience from transcoding offers available on the platform. After choosing a transcoding partner and agreeing on its price the stream is presented to recipients in the On.Live streaming marketplace. The final price for the client always consist of service provider price and transcoding fees agreed upon previously. The third and final step is streaming broadcast itself! Note there is always an initial fee for broadcaster, to cover transcoding costs in case of insufficiently large audience joining the transmission. Relay nodes operators may buy transcoded transmission directly from Transcoder or Relay Nodes. Thanks to the scale effect, relay nodes offer this transmission cheaper than the transcoder and still make a profit from the relay service. The most important part is that the broadcaster always receives the content price from every recipient watching his transmission. All the intermediaries are also paid for their services! On.Live platform is totally transparent for business and offers opportunity to make profit the most applicable way that is technically possible. With open markets for broadcast, transcode and relay On.Live creates business possibilities unheard on video platforms until now!

Created primarily to circumvent regular money, they have become a refuge for those seeking anonymity and privacy, but also have proved to be a potent tool for various financial speculators. Despite their popularity, relatively few purchase operations take place by use of virtual currencies. In this regard they value is largely conditioned by the law of supply and demand, constituting capital which is vulnerable to speculations. Majority of investors just trade cryptocurrencies counting on exchange rates differences between their various kinds and between cryptocurrencies and regular FIAT money in the end. This trend became even more prominent, with the introduction of forwarding contracts for Bitcoin on NY stock exchange. ONL’s, despite its roots in blockchain technology, are a little different. Even though you could trade them after the end of the lockup, there is a lot more behind their value than just a claim and empty belief that exchange rates can only go higher. They are a really good way to invest. Internal On.Live transfer system creates a whole new economy. An economy that is tangible in the sense, that there is always needful real service behind every ONL inside the platform. Like in a real economy, ONL value will rise, along with an influx of new broadcast providers, investors, and new consumers. On.Live just creates technical possibilities and space where the users set their own rules on how they want to run their business. The platform is truly democratic in this regard. Don’t miss your opportunity to acquaint yourself with On.Live project. See the values behind it and become a part of it as a content provider or a contributor.

Any creator or service provider can create his own channel and sell live services on 1:1 or 1:8 principles. On.Live also provides options for broadcasting to wide audiences in PPV, PPM, PPD or other similar models. Additionally, broadcasters have access to smart contracts for transcoding and relay services. Within the On.Live platform, contrary to other internet video platforms, broadcasters set their own prices for content they provide. This gives them enormous flexibility in their business model. No longer are they tied to strict rules, concerning, for example, a minimal number of views of content required paid off or rules according to the number of people that “liked” or commented their videos to be profitable. On.Live is in forefront of innovation when it comes to broadcasting live training or advisory sessions. No other platform provides such easy way to broadcast corporate training, meetings or discussion boards. Big companies can use sophisticated, and very expensive telepresence systems to provide access to such sessions for their remote employees. On.Live is much easier, smarter, faster to set up and provides accounting system with instant transfer of funds. If you are in advisory or professional training business On.Live is an ideal means to expand your customers base. By setting Live video feed on our platform you can access customers who couldn’t participate in your courses because of their time restrictions or simply because they are in another city. Virtually any promoter or live event organizer can expand his revenue stream with On.Live.
