Luna  It’s a “sample project”, not a demo. It was made to show people and studios both big and small how they could make a project with a AAA look and feel in Unity (and with a closer to “real life” scale). Even their scene setup and everything is there to show you ways to achieve this. It goes way beyond just showing you how to make a character controller which can shoot and jump, or how to make a networked game. Sample projects that go this in-depth are rare. I can tell there are some complex shader stuff going on too (which is usually beyond the skill of most Indie Devs), and the assets are there handed to you for free (which as far as I can tell, you are free to use in your own Unity projects).  I think this was made to show what can be done with a small team on a budget, a team of 5, I think? and some contractors for art in the final stages (I don’t think they had any 3D artists in their team). I agree a AAA studio wouldn’t use most of the assets, but a lot of starting Indie teams don’t have tech artists and such available to them. I’m sure a lot of them will be glad to use some of the stuff. Anyway, maybe they just didn’t communicate properly with the contractors? I don’t know. I have to hand it to you that I haven’t seen the project first hand yet, but I’ll likely leave it downloading overnight eventually. Though I’m not in a hurry, it’s not the genre or visual style I usually prefer. I’m only really interested in checking the multiplayer implementation    https://medium.com/@alwackz/vibehub-using-unity-3ds-sample-fps-game-as-their-first-game-release-7462974206fa",False

It does not appear to remember what you saved from the previous hub.)  I found the brand-new platform to be somewhat buggy, both in desktop and in VR mode. Hubs seem to take a long time to load (and I have broad bandwidth and a fast gaming computer).  In desktop mode, either I could not move my avatar at all, or I could not get him to stop running. In VR mode, I found that I could move, but I could not turn. Rather a frustrating experience.

The first installment of “Feel the VIBE” will see 16 singers vying to be crowned the champion of the competition. The champion will win a $10,000 U.S.D grand prize and be given their own PPV performance on the VIBEHub platform. The competition will be free to view but you must hold a VIBE balance on the VIBEHub platform to vote.  You must have a minimum VIBE balance of 1 VIBE on the VIBEHub platform and will only be permitted to vote once per match. The community will determine who advances in the competition by voting for their favorite performance and will ultimately crown the winner of “Feel the VIBE.”  The format of the tournament can be easily compared to the NHL and NBA playoff style format. Each round will consist of singers who will perform an original or cover song.  The first installment of “Feel the VIBE” will air on the VIBEHub platform in the summer of 2018.  In addition to the “Feel the VIBE” singing edition, we have began recording holograms of comedians and dancers. In the same tournament style format as the singing competition, we will place 16 comedians and 16 dancers against each other. Singing, comedy and dancing are the first three competitions we are focusing on.  Our team is very excited to be the first platform in history to provide this type of content in the VR/AR space. Holograms and VR/AR technology are the future of entertainment and our team is proud to showcase this technology to the world.  For behind the scenes looks at the competition, follow us on Instagram at vibehub.io and check out our Instagram Stories.",False

This agreement represents the core foundation of our business model. The ability to capture holograms day in and day out is vital to our long term longevity. With this agreement now in place, VIBEHub has the studio and technology to create content that will change industries while enhancing entertainment in every home around the globe.  Our team will be sharing office space with 8i in their beautiful facility located in Venice, California. VIBEHub has access to conference rooms, outdoor working areas, office space for our team and of course one of the few hologram production facilities on the planet. This is a modern state of the art facility covering over 10,000 square feet.  Our team will be operating out of this facility for the next 18 months. After the 18 month tenure has been completed, our team will own the hologram production facility and will then take the production facility to a new office. In the mean time VIBEHub will be working closely with the 8i team. While 8i focuses on the research and development of this technology, VIBEHub will focus on capturing amazing performances that will increase user adoption in this space.  VIBEHub’s goal is to complete one hundred captures throughout 2018. These captures will range from artists, educators, public figures, comedians and many other various forms of talent. Prior to this agreement, utilizing this facility had an average cost of several thousand dollars per minute of capture time. In order to expand and continue to grow, obtaining this hologram production facility at 8i was imperative.  8i is a company that has been actively researching and developing technology for the past four years. With offices in Los Angeles, Seattle and New Zealand they are a company with a global presence. 8i has established themseleves as the leading innovator for utilizing volumetric video technology, having received funding from some of the biggest VC groups in the world.  Our team is extremely thrilled to have the support from the 8i development team and will obtain cutting edge advancements in volumetric video technology provided by the 8i research team.

Truly an epidemic development that could result in a harsh reality check one day.  Here is a general example not particularly related to VibeHUB.  It starts with exchanges. Right after the ICO investors expect a listing on a decent exchange. Listing fees have skyrocketed in the past month as well as volume requirements. Cryptopia, currently suffering from scaling issues, is asking 5 million DOT for exchange listing, which at the current rate costs over $150,000.  Remember we are in a bear market. Bans, regulations and taxes are threatening the very existence of cryptocurrencies and ICOs.  The coin is listed on Cryptopia, but the price starts sinking because a central bank said something. Investors beg for a bigger exchange.  The developers strike a probably expensive deal with Kucoin. Kucoin organizes a promotion every time they list a new coin, so they list only a few coins a month. Investors are getting impatient even though the listing date is out of the developers' hands. Anyway, the coin gets listed on Kucoin and for 4 days the price of the coin goes up, before inevitably sinking back to its original price.  Investors start complaining again, this time for an even bigger exchange: Binance. I am sure you know where this is going. The price shoots up by 1000% the day the coin is listed, but soon the usual bear market ritual is repeated.  Now what? Where to go from here? Investors have become addicted to pumps to fix their positions. But we have ran out of bigger exchanges.  In the meantime, does anyone care about the fundamentals of the project? The future revenue flow? The technical progress of the project? No, because that takes way longer than a short term pump from an exchange listing.  And yet the coin has earned the reputation of being a shitcoin.  Maybe, just maybe, listing coins without a finished product is counterproductive.",False

And why is it like this? Because crypto is mainly just for greed, but a lot of people don't even care about the projects behind of it. People are screaming for big exchanges already during or before the ICO phase. Want to see big partnerships just to see their investment go up right after the token or coin release to 1000x.  Especially listing during a bear market has nearly no effect out of the reasons Rigorous has already stated above. The pump is mainly just some days, after that, everything goes down again because the market is nothing near to stable or bull.  Another problem is that people are used to this short term projects these days and that is what most of crypto was before. ""Big"" goals in 3 months or so. But for crypto to get a real life use someday, for the masses and not just for some nerdy crypto geeks, it needs to be used in some bigger scaled projects. But as soon as a project is there which needs more time people are screaming that it would be unrealistic. The problem is, peoples way of thinking is unrealistic.

But crypto has made everyone impatient. The moment we see our coin staying stable or dropping 5 to 10 percent, in respect to some other coin jumping 30 percent daily, people lose their minds and wonder what is wrong with their coin and why it is not projecting that same growth. i remember when i bought vibe was 0.028 dollar and after a week, the price decreased to 0.02 and the very first thing i did was ask the vibe team as to why the price decreased. The price decrease in percentage terms was huge and i was carrying a big bag of vibe. But the team's straight answer on exchanges and how they wish to change made me peaceful and i saw no harm in keeping my coins for another year. I was rewarded in the end when vibe went to 3 dollars but i didn't even sell then because somehow i have a feeling this will be one of the gamechangers of the industry.

Vibehub hasn´t even released its fantastic tech to the public yet, Jan 20 is the date to watch. The company is still in its infancy in terms of public exposure but has huge potential to grow. This selloff in VIBE is just an annoying sideshow which in no way reflects the potential of this coin. Once the public understands the uses of AR/VR usage on Vibehub will soar as will the value of VIBE. For instance, I´m an opera lover but to attend a live performance at a world-class opera house is hugely expensive (tickets, airfare, hotels, etc). I would pay good money to attend a VR performance at The Met, La Scala, etc. and, I believe, so would many other opera fans. I know this is wishful thinking for now but I´m hoping Vibehub can deliver something like this in the not to distant future, as part of their focus on bringing music events to their platform users. This is just one of hundreds of high-demand uses one can think of for this technology so don´t get shaken out of your coins by this short-sighted sell-off. GLTA.",False

Check out the new icos and everyone is raising 80 - 100 million dollars on a valuation of over 200 million dollars. That is bonkers considering that some companies don't even have a mvp or the main developers or even cfo in some cases. I invest in people and not in companies and vibehub is my one such find which i stumbled across while i was doing a coinmarketcap search of the new coins registered on it  I know for a fact that there are many performers who are trying to go up a notch by involving technology. The concert tickets are going up like anything and to capture that untapped market of people who wish to enjoy a concert but at reasonable prices or who are at places where concerts don't happen often will be the first ones to benefit .,False

We will see vibehub logo in superbowl commercial which will increase awareness to vibe. And with the performance of the one major artist, attention to Vibehub can increase 1000 times and makes people to buy vibe to watch that performance. That can easily lead up to 10$ which will make market capacity 2.7 billion $ which is achievable with the current market hence coins with no properly working products can achieve 1 billion market cap. It is also depends on marketing as well. Addition to that there is a CES 8 days later which will make Vibehub known to the world under the wings of Monster Cable. It will also help them to gain reputation. They are all going to be value for vibe. Q1 will be very significant and will show us if vibe can reach to 10$ or not. My personal thought, it can reach to 5$ at the end of Q2 and 10$ at the end of Q4. God knows for 2019 and later I have full faith in this project because of the dedicated vibehub team. They have always been in an interaction with community, keep them updated all the time about the project and most importantly never ever give the fake news. Unlike most other projects, they won’t make any speculations about the project with fake news and won’t share the informations until they are certain. Also they are executing everything in their road map way before they promise and improving the project and the road map as the time goes. Most other coins offers nothing but promises, but here in vibehub, there is working product and system. In the dotcom bubble it was the same, so many companies with nothing on their hand but getting value over peoples demand. At the end most of them blowed and only few of them with real products in their hands remained and now they are at the top. When the time come for this crazy crypto bubble to explode, only few will survive and Vibehub will be one of them.  Mark my words.",False

I hope this 20 dollar price is for the whole concert and not just a 6 minute performance. I think referral will be a good option. It will involve more people to bring in other people which means more use of vibe coins but the precondition of a advanced VR headset can be worrisome.  I guess VIBE can do some partnership with the vr headset manufacturer and give those headsets at a cheaper rate or make a combo offer like get vibe coins when you buy a oculus or buy these many coins and get this oculus or some lucky draw.,False

Fact of the matter is virtually all alt coins have tanked since end o7 september. I'm talking 20-50% drops.   People are selling their alt coins and buying BTC right now because of the upcoming fork on October 25th.  This is a super new coin but price has been pretty steady compared to most.  Lower price is a good time to buy more IMO as long as its a good project.  Honestly only a 267 mil coins and they are only .04 makes them a great coin to pickup cheap.  .50-1.00 would seem very doable for a coin like this.   ,False

Also, you can see easily smart contract address which token is related. By simple search in etherscan, you can see it is not Viberate. It has different logo, either. People has announced and everybody said not to confuse Vib with Vibe before. Vibe took over 15m $ cap in presale and has now daily 70-80k $ volume. Most of us is waiting and believing project. Increasing of coin value is, i think, related that in presale, chinese and USA citizen was not welcomed because of terms and regulation. Opening a market has provided this rule to leave behind.

Very good project. I have been reading up on VR and it is going mainstream sooner than expected. That's why the this crypto coin is doing so well. They are not just another coin they will be the Virtual Reality Currency of the future. But why VibeHub? Well I strongly believe first movers have a big advantage. I mean bigly! And VibeHub is the first mover in this game. Another factor that I have said several times which is crucial to any investment is that this cryptocurrency actually has a working beta platform already on a popular device most of us know the The Oculus. This by itself can blossom VibeHub to whole new world. A virtual one at that. Another key factor is that they have partnered with LiveTourLab. If you check out their website https://livetourlab.com/ They are really taking VR MOBILE, Mobility is essential for any platform today because we are people on the move and VR and AR has to move with us at the same pace. This is why VibeHub has so much more solidity in their profile  The amount of upward side that VibeHub has is amazing, I could go into dept and draw you out a 5 year projection of where VibeHub would be roughly situated in the markets. ofcourse all based on speculation but with the increasing demand for VR and AR the market is bright. Another thing to remember is that the social aspect of it is that when people try VR they get immersed in a world where they can be,  without actually being there, that social aspect appeals to ""virtually"" everyone.",False

True indeed.  I've been part of taking one technology from 0 to 7.7 billion subscriptions, an amazing privilege. I'm absolutely certain that VR will make the same journey, but much faster.  Roughly 2% of the population start using a new tech *because* it is new, so the first 2% is easy. After that, it comes down to adding so much value to people's lives that it overcomes the resistance of changing deeply rooted behaviours. Improving something 10% isn't enough. It needs to be 10 *times* the value to nudge people over the hill of resistance into a greener valley. I'm pretty sure we all instinctively feel that VR has that as a technology. Hardware wise, headsets are getting cheaper by the day, but the killer-content hasn't been there yet.  I've never much listened to other people, I suppose a good trait when spending a lifetime creating stuff that people don't know they want yet. So I looked with my own eyes at the demos produced by VIBEHub, and I felt that they are exactly the type of value-add that the VR industry needs now to move into mass-market.  That is why I decided to support this project and give the VIBEHub founders access to the LiveTourLAB inner works plus our help and advice at this stage. I did what I can to help because I feel the project's success is important to the VR industry, to the world. I also guessed that if a major music label signs up to do a holoport concert, things might move from 0 to huge fairly fast. So there is a chance that the efforts will be worth it.  Is that sure? As anything new, absolutely not. Launching into new areas, like any new tech, you will definitely not be right every time. A million and one things can and will go wrong. But it is no fun to always stand on the sidelines. The better mindset I think is this:  In Sweden we play soccer. If I were to place the ball in front of the goal, on the national stadium in the world cup finals, with the world's best goalkeeper in the way, and shoot it as hard as I can at the goal, I'd most probably miss or the goalkeeper will grab it. But if I keep putting the ball back, and keep shooting, over and over and over again, hour after hour, sooner or later, the ball will hit the net, to everyone's - including my own - astonishment. In football, I wouldn't get the opportunity to even try. But in my professional life, nothing stops me. Changing the world isn't about luck, it's about shooting that ball so many times at that goal, that eventually, it goes in.  Over the course of your life, you don't need to score in world championship finals so many times. Scoring once or maybe twice will give you a legacy, fame and a story to tell the grandchildren one day. But if you never shoot that ball, if you never try, I can guarantee with no trace of doubt that you will never, ever, hit that goal.   Do your own assessment, then trust yourself and enjoy the ride. That would be the best advice I can give. Wishing us all best of luck.  Anders Larsson, co-founder and lead developer of the open source framework LiveTourLAB",False

Now I'm just playing words there. What I mean is that I think the future VR tech will go in a direction you won't expect.  The majority of the people have low spec computers. The Oculus Rift kit is on sale down to $400 and it's still not low enough to sway the masses, so I'm going to assume a target price of a low-medium phone ~$150.  Either computers have to become a 1000% faster so that current hardware becomes 95% cheaper (eg. $3000 Hololens => $ 150), or the software has to become 1000% faster so it runs on current low spec hardware. The prior is mainly bound to the laws of physics, so we can eliminate that option.  Basically it's going to be at most a $150 phone attached to your head. And it can't rely on a powerful PC either like the Oculus Rift and the Vive, because that would increase the total cost far beyond $150.  So besides 360 VR video which doesn't require a lot of processing power but has the lack of interactivity, future VR is going to have either less fidelity (Facebook Spaces seems to take that route with their cartooney AR) or something clever. Therefore I wonder what the hardware requirements are for VIBEHub.  You can already see this direction is happening with the spiritual successors of the Hololens being cheaper but less powerful.",False

Welcome on board Anders!  You are absolutely right. We cannot imagine how fundamentally the world will change with the introduction of a new technology.  I always think about the woman who died earlier this year as the last human who was born in the 19th century. When she was a kid cars weren‘t common but carriages for locomotion. Today we are talking about self-driving cars. She lived when the Wright brothers successfully flew the first time with an airplane and witnessed how the first men were on the moon. From sending letters it changed to global instant messaging and video chat via the internet.  What I am trying  to say with all of this here. If we look at how much this woman saw the world change in her lifetime it could give us a vague idea what could be possible in the future. Thinking about this makes me always excited about what new new inventions the future might bring. And I am totally convinced VR technology is still in its early stages. Thats why I love this project and I like  the opportunity to be involved from the beginning.,False

My experience from many years within the telecom sector taught me something very important: Fundamentally new technology is the opposite of a zero sum game. It is not about gaining relative grounds on each other.  It is all about collaboration and growing the industry as a whole, and if done well, the industry will grow by a factor thousand or even a million times. I also learned that analysts usually underestimate the magnitude of new technology impact, since we simply cannot imagine how fundamentally the world will change. Anyone who has experienced the impact of mobile telephony, the smartphone, Internet or now the emerging crypto tech knows that is true. It will be true for VR as well. My estimate for the VR sector growth is well beyond the typical analyst +1000% estimate to 2020.  I instantly fell in love with the demos created by the VIBEHub team. I feel that both the the music concert holoport and the high quality social museum is exactly what the VR industry needs to show the world right now.  The LiveTourLAB VR framework on WebVR is very much a here-and-now entry ticket for anyone to create and experience interactive cinematic / recorded VR today. It works to get more people on-board on the VR train and we saw that it can complement VIBEHub's bleeding-edge top-end rendered tech. VIBEHub now has access to our framework, expertise and early feature roadmap.  I also liked both Mathew and Alessio from the first contact. I felt they have done this out of love for VR, music and technology, with a real product, real technology and real contact network in the music industry. Many others just have an idea in a whitepaper. Call me old school but I like results and execution.  When my children grow up, media will be the same as VR. I feel that I have a personal responsibility to do what I can to shape VR into a truly active experience, which fuels our imagination and helps us to be more present in the moment. I think that the VIBEHub team is doing a great service to the VR industry and I genuinely feel that they deserve all our support in moving the VR industry forward, for everyone’s benefit.

I have recently discovered a huge red flag and I would like an answer from the project owners because it is a serious subject. After discovering the LOOQ Vr scam earlier today, it made we want to research Vibehub a little more in-depth. I have always been impressed with Vibehub's development and their demos in their videos, so I was confident in the team. I own an Oculus Rift and use VR personally, so in my research I wanted to find other apps that might possibly be like VibeHub. I discovered one app called Bigscreen Beta which let's users share experiences in environments, and it came out much earlier than Vibehub plus has investors. I downloaded Bigscreen to test it out and I was shocked when I realized that one of Vibehub's environment is exactly a copy of BigScreen's environment with a couple slight changes. I have included a couple of side/side comparisons below so you can see what I mean. I am hoping there is a good answer for this because I wanted Vibehub to be legit. I am big fan of VR and Vibehub is the only VR crypto I am exicted about right now since Spectiv delayed and I couldn't get into the Decentraland token sale.  See the Images below:  You'll see here that Vibehub changes the background from a cityscape to a galaxy thing, but that is basically the only change. Look at the sofa and the wood paneling and the chairs on the deck, it's all identical.  Bigscreen Beta Right Side: https://i.imgur.com/vfnOVfb.jpg  Vibehub Right Side: https://i.imgur.com/1xb1ILz.png  These next two are on the other side of the deck, you can see that they are identical and have the lighting and everything in the same spot. Vibehub only blurred out the windows.  Bigscreen Left Side: https://i.imgur.com/Hr1E01n.jpg  Vibehub Left Side: https://i.imgur.com/sy3DIFO.png  I was pretty shocked when I discovered this tonight. I was just testing VR apps that seemed to be Vibehub competitors and when I saw this I was reminded of the Vibehub video. Take this for what you want, but it definitely scares me. I do think Vibehub has done a lot of work on their interface and such, but if they copied this, I don't know what else could be copied.",False

For the teaching feature, it will be important that there is an open system where ideas can't be easily censored (whether by deleting or by downvote bots). The actions from twitter, youtube, google search, reddit are examples where free-thinking people have been put-off by the companies' thought-police actions.",False

This project is something we are passionate about, most of us are developers and we have been actively developing this platform before thoughts of a token sale. So ultimately the support from the token sale will allow us to grow at a faster rate. Allowing us to build our AR facility, expand our team, and secure the right partnerships...  Your second question about bounty pool, seems to be misunderstanding...that VIBE exchange rate you mention  is not accurate, thats for VIBEX...we are selling VIBEX tokens at exchange of 1ETH =100 VIBEX during token sale(without bonus)...and those will be exchanged for VIBE after token sale...we will know exactly how much after token sale... the VIBEX are like stakes for the pool of 160.2m VIBE...after the token sale we will know how many VIBEX total there are...then we divide 160.2m VIBE by total VIBEX created...and multiply that by participants VIBEX total to get how many vibe they will get.  So for bounty programs we have set aside fixed amount of the actual VIBE coin that you are earning stakes for...we will not know the final price of VIBE until after the token sale...we felt this was a fair way to allow the market demand to set the price for VIBE. I hope that clears it up for you.",False

In this market segment, VibeHub should be aggressive before the other competitor put the hands. Should get some celebrity right after raising some fund, there is no time to hesitate it.

Once you get busier, you need to hire UX specialist right away responding interested potential users. Do not lose any interest from the potential future users.
