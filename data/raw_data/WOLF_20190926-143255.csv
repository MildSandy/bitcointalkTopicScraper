Prices going down and up is specifically what is needed for trading The crypto market is very risky and volatile but it's what makes it profitable at the same time. Currencies pairs of different types both crypto/crypto and crypto/fiat can be successfully analyzed with different algorithms and machine trading approaches similar to those used for forex. It isn't something especially new. For example, there's a well-known forex exchange Alpari with a PAMM service where people can invest. Most of those pamm accounts are controlled by machine trading and we have experience with this.  Now we are recreating the same for the crypto world. It's a lot of work to do, big data collection, complex math models, verification of correlations, etc. But it's accomplishable.  Also with larger computational resources available today, a lot of new things become possible, it's a qualitative leap.",False
