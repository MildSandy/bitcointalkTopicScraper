Bounties stopped on 21.10.2018, on that date the total supply on Etherscan was 2.8 million. 1% of this has been reserved for our different bounty programs.  Giving the fact, that our own bounty campaigns haven’t been effective during the ICO at all, we engaged professional bounty providers. With their professional and supportive help, we increased our conversion rate dramatically. The professional bounty providers have been paid from the available total bounty pool as well.  Additionally, the nature of the project implies, that the amount reserved for bounty is based on sold tokens and can never be on total supply from the smart contract.  Thanks STC",False

Swap from STCDR to STC is already active, please login, finish your KYC, goto menu ""STCDR Drawing Right"" and follow all steps precisely. Depending on your available investment amount, you can use all, parts or even non of your STCDR. The minimum amount is 0.5 eth. Unused STCDR will remain in your wallet, you can hodl them or sell once STCDR is listed on an exchange. If you swap to STC, you can always sell STC at fair value = NAV (Net Asset Value) to the STC smart contract against ETH. This is different than in a ""project doomed ICO"", so actually no exchange listing needed to sell! Check the smart contract STC - function ""requestWithdrawal"" or the button SELL on the account page on the website.  With STC, you have  underlying portfolio of the top 20 coins. In short, if you are a strong believer in the blockchain and its top 20 coins, then why wouldn’t you invest in them with just one coin?   Thanks STC  ",False

In regards to fees: During the airdrop, we made three statements: 1) send gas fee 2) wait till end 3) we can not guarantee delivery if we were not able to verify the data (case 1).  In short, we did send a lot STCDR without gas fee but it seems that some are affected by 3). From a participants perspective it made hardly sense to save 25 cents to avoid verification of data but it looks like some did take that risk.  By investing in STC you can profit from the Crypto market development. if you think that Crypto is the future, the you are good to go. Otherwise, you do not need to swap and hodl STCDR for later use.  Thanks STC  ",False

After listening to your feedback in the past few days, we have decided to enact some changes to the timing of our sale. These changes come for three reasons:  1 ) The amazing growth of our community in the past two weeks 2 ) The technical feedback we received about our investors backend from many of you 3 ) We want to make sure all of the airdrop participants have received their STCDR before the main sale starts  The essence is that we want to ensure that all of our community members get to participate in the token sale under fair conditions and with technical ease. Since not all of our recently joined members have had the chance to take advantage of the private-sale conditions, and the Airdrop is still ongoing for a few more days, we have therefore decided to postpone the main sale for a short period of time.  You can therefore still invest at private sale conditions (1 STC = 0.90 USD) right now! However, please be advised that this will only be the case for a very limited time.  As soon as we have concluded the airdrop, distributed all the STCDR tokens and made sure that all users have a flawless experience in the investment period, we will enter the main sale.  We will advise you about the exact dates in the upcoming days, but we anticipate that it will be no longer than 2–3 weeks. So if you were disappointed to miss out on the private sale conditions, act now!  All the best,  Oliver Prock CEO & Founder SMARTER THAN CRYPTO",False

After listening to your feedback in the past few days, we have decided to enact some changes to the timing of our sale. These changes come for three reasons:  1 ) The amazing growth of our community in the past two weeks 2 ) The technical feedback we received about our investors backend from many of you 3 ) We want to make sure all of the airdrop participants have received their STCDR before the main sale starts  The essence is that we want to ensure that all of our community members get to participate in the token sale under fair conditions and with technical ease. Since not all of our recently joined members have had the chance to take advantage of the private-sale conditions, and the Airdrop is still ongoing for a few more days, we have therefore decided to postpone the main sale for a short period of time.  You can therefore still invest at private sale conditions (1 STC = 0.90 USD) right now! However, please be advised that this will only be the case for a very limited time.  As soon as we have concluded the airdrop, distributed all the STCDR tokens and made sure that all users have a flawless experience in the investment period, we will enter the main sale.  We will advise you about the exact dates in the upcoming days, but we anticipate that it will be no longer than 2–3 weeks. So if you were disappointed to miss out on the private sale conditions, act now!  All the best,  Oliver Prock CEO & Founder SMARTER THAN CRYPTO",False

SMARTER THAN CRYPTO‘s scientifically proven quantitative model is achieving twice the upside of Bitcoin or Ethereum but only having 1/3 of the market‘s downside.  SMARTER THAN CRYPTO cuts out the middleman and is thus able to offer the lowest fees in the industry.  Salus Alpha’s SMARTER THAN BETA strategy has consistently outperformed indexes and their passive index trackers.  SMARTER THAN CRYPTO can offer such low fees because it is independent and automated and can act on with no human intervention required. SMARTER THAN CRYPTO can only be acquired during the token offering process which is a one off, closed cap offering. The tokens provided will represent a participant’s share of the portfolio. 100% of the total amount contributed during the offering will go directly towards buying the underlying cryptocurrencies. SMARTER THAN CRYPTO is an ERC20 token based upon the Ethereum blockchain. Operating on the blockchain allows for global accessibility, 24/7 trading, transparency, public verification of SMARTER THAN CRYPTO’s holdings and no expensive legacy banking fees. The tokens value is linked directly to the underlying cryptocurrency assets of up to 20 top coins by market capitalization held by SMARTER THAN CRYPTO via the innovative price floor mechanism implemented in our smart contract. The smart contract allows participants to cash out for their share of the underlying assets at any time. This means that SMARTER THAN CRYPTO’s value on exchange will be protected - it will be irrational to sell at a price lower than the tokens share of the underlying assets if a higher price is offered via the smart contract. Token holders are free to sell or exchange their tokens at any time and pay no exit fees, broker fees or advice fees.  Thanks!",False

We are an active ETF (Smarter than Beta strategy) and not a passive ETF.  Why is STC better than passive Top 20? The only logical way to mitigate risk in the asset class crypto is to go towards cash. The optimal parameters for the portfolio and rebalancing methodology were carefully determined via a structured data science approach. A cryptocurrency portfolio consisting of the top 20 coins by market capitalization, with weekly rebalancing and a component cap of 20% produces a combination that has broad market exposure and acceptable turnover without allowing a single asset, and thus single source of risk, to dominate.  SMARTERT THAN CRYPTO's strategy is able to avoid market losses due to not forcing full investment but at the same time is able to outperform the market due to efficient portfolio construction. By holding a basket of coins from the index universe determined through portfolio optimization we expect to avoid coins with a return below the mean and therefore underperform and hold a few that over perform, the sum of the returns will provide a better return with less risk than the market/index return.

The minimum weight is 0% and we also do not force full investment. I recommend login to the website where you can see all past holdings and its weightings for different periods. The tokens value is linked directly to the underlying cryptocurrency assets of up to 20 top coins by market capitalization held by SMARTER THAN CRYPTO via the innovative price floor mechanism implemented in our smart contract. The smart contract allows participants to cash out for their share of the underlying assets at any time. This means that SMARTER THAN CRYPTO’s value on exchange will be protected - it will be irrational to sell at a price lower than the tokens share of the underlying assets if a higher price is offered via the smart contract. Token holders are free to sell or exchange their tokens at any time and pay no exit fees, broker fees or advice fees.   You can simulate historic performance with the investment slider on our homepage. If you would have invested $1000 since 31. July 2014 (start of) than you would have received $217,291.26  Thanks!",False

With analogues, you mean competitors in the same segment. There are, but there models are completely different, since they follow an passive approach when selecting the underlying. Salus Alpha's SMARTER THAN BETA based on a model being in production for 14 years on the alpha side has recently been ported to the Beta side and has been applied to all major indices (S&P100, S&P500, Shanghai, Euro Stoxx, DAX, FTSE100, Hang Seng, Nikkei, etc) and now to the CRIX - Crypto Index. The results are consistently showing 40% more return and 40% less risk than the benchmark.  Compared to others, we are also a regulated and licensed investment manager with an operational fund structure. The Crypto Community definitely needs a stable coin to mitigate risk. We started the SMARTER THAN CRYPTO project with the clear vision in mind that as a regulated manager we will be able to mint our own ‘stable coin’ and help the community to escape the Tether trust debacle which is with our regulated fund structure easy to deliver.

SMARTER THAN CRYPTO behaves like an actively managed ETF.  The SMARTER THAN BETA strategy developed by the institutional investment manager Salus Alpha Capital can outperform any index in any asset class by 40% more return and 40% less risk.  When investors sign up on the web page www.smarterthancrypto.com they are allowed to send their contributions in BTC, LTC, ETH. Since SMARTER THAN CRYPTO is a portfolio of coins it means that with each contribution the average entry price of BTC, LTC, ETH is changing. So if the market continues to fall and new contributions come in, the average entry price for BTC, LTC, ETH in the SMARTER THAN CRYPTO portfolio is going down as well. Therefore an investor that invested early is profiting from a falling market due to the contributions of other investors since the average entry price of BTC, LTC, ETH that SMARTER THAN CRYPTO is holding is decreasing.  Example: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xxoVGLFpr97anakwCCWhZw.png  So in above example the investor who bought ETH at 1111.78 USD and contributed 1.258 ETH to SMARTER THAN CRYPTO (STC) token would have lost 229.31 USD per ETH but since there are continuous contributions, his average entry price is actually now 921.34 USD per ETH which is significantly better than his original entry price.  This is the beauty of a crowd sale over a longer period of time which produces a favorable entry price of the coins held in the SMARTER THAN CRYPTO portfolio before the portfolio is actively managed with the SMARTER THAN BETA strategy.  Since investors have different opinions about the market and are hardly right about picking bottoms it does make little sense in timing the contributions to SMARTER THAN CRYPTO token-as-a-portfolio since the dollar cost averaging effect will benefit investors in any case.  You can also read about dollar cost averaging here. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp  Thanks!",False

We were wrong. Massive DDOS-attacks and problems with our Facebook page teached us a lesson.  Due to fairness to our bounty participants and to all our backers, we need to adjust the ICO timeline and add 6 more weeks to the Pre-Sale.

(total return 38269%) since 2014   WEBSITE/BOUNTY/Whitepaper/Twitter/Facebook/Telegram/Reddit    SMARTER THAN CRYPTO (“STC”) is the world’s first cryptocurrency-only Smarter Than Beta tokenized portfolio, that will autonomously maintain a diverse portfolio of up to the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization ACTIVELY MANAGED. SMARTER THAN CRYPTO‘s scientifically proven quantitative model is achieving twice the upside of Bitcoin or Ethereum but only having 1/3 of the market‘s downside.   We make it easy for everyone to trade and invest into the new asset class ""crypto currency""  •   No middle men •   Limited Supply (no unsold tokens) •   Liquidity through Smart Contract •   Token price cannot fall below portfolio value  SMARTER THAN CRYPTO cuts out the middleman and is thus able to offer the lowest fees in the industry.  SMARTER THAN CRYPTO has an annual fee of 0%. SMARTER THAN CRYPTO can offer such low fees because it is independent and automated. Index strategies are a set of rules that an algorithm can act on with no human intervention required.   SMARTER THAN CRYPTO is an ERC20 token based upon the Ethereum blockchain. Operating on the blockchain allows for global accessibility, 24/7 trading, transparency, public verification of SMARTER THAN CRYPTO’s holdings and no expensive legacy banking fees.   The tokens value is linked directly to the underlying cryptocurrency assets of up to 20 top coins by market capitalization held by SMARTER THAN CRYPTO via the innovative price floor mechanism implemented in our smart contract. The smart contract allows participants to cash out for their share of the underlying assets at any time.   This means that SMARTER THAN CRYPTO’s value on exchange will be protected - it will be irrational to sell at a price lower than the tokens share of the underlying assets if a higher price is offered via the smart contract and can therefore not fall below the portfolio value.  Token holders are free to sell or exchange their tokens at any time and pay no exit fees, broker fees or advice fees. No Minimum.  The only opportunity for future participants to buy these tokens post-ICO will be from ICO participants on exchange – no further tokens will be sold or minted.  Security is extremely important and the smart contract code was audited by an independent third party. Expert advisors were consulted, best practices implemented and strong identity verification procedures put in place to prevent Sybil attacks and bad actors from compromising SMARTER THAN CRYPTO. SMARTER THAN CRYPTO’s holdings will be audited and the audit report made public post-ICO.   A full list of advisors is available on the SMARTER THAN CRYPTO website.  STC tokens will be exchange listed. High demand from fiat investors will generate a token price premium.  Token Type: ERC20, Ethereum Blockchain Token Symbol: STC Maximum Supply (Hard Cap): 25,000,000 Available for Purchase: 21,750,000 Price per token: Pre-sale: $0.90 (first 10,000,000 tokens) First 48 hours of ICO: $0.95 48 hours to week 2 of ICO: $1.00 Week 2- till end of ICO: $1.05   Main Sale: ended  Main Sale Period: started 13.10.2018 09:00 UTC and ended 10.11.2018 09:00 UTC  Team tokens will vest over two years via a smart contract 'vault' to align team incentives with ICO participants.  The SMARTER THAN BETA strategy is intellectual property of the fully regulated and licensed investment manager Salus Alpha Capital. The SMARTER THAN BETA portfolio optimization technology is in production since 14 years on hedge fund strategies and will be used for disrupting the ETF market. The SMARTER THAN BETA portfolio optimization technology is able to outperform any index in any asset class by delivering 40% more return with 40% less risk.  Salus Alpha Capital has stored all relevant cryptocurrency data since mid 2013. After approximately six months of trading this deep dataset will be utilized to optimize rebalancing and produce trading strategies for future SMARTER THEN BETA token issuance. SMARTER THAN CRYPTO ICO participants will have priority access to other SMARTER THAN BETA products and the SMARTER THAN CRYPTO token will be convertible.  Instantly owning a diverse cryptocurrency portfolio is now as easy as holding a single token.
