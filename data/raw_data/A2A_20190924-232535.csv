U may invest as much as u can. As for btc can not say for sure Everything is explained when you visit the token sale page. Minimum is 0.1 ETH and yes, you can use BTC via the exchange itself.  Open an account on https://alpha.stex.exchange Enable two-factor authentication Deposit the funds on your account Press [A2A ICO] button in Balances area in the currency row you want to use to pay for the tokens. Enter the desired amount to buy and press [BUY] button. If there are any bonuses available at the moment of the purchase, they will be credited to your additional A2A vesting account on STeX.Exchange. Please note that all bonus tokens are vested in the account for 9 months, and will be transferred to the main A2A account right after the end of the vesting period.

Key A belongs to user (A service may backup the encrypted key, but user loses key when forgets the password). Key B is stored on web server, unencrypted. Key C belongs to technical staff of a service.  Hot storage is a combination of key A and key B  Cold storage is a combination of key B and C  Quote from: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Multisignature#Multisignature_Applications 2-of-3: Decentralized cold storage vault - One of the keys is held in your own home, the second in a bank safe deposit box and copies of the third key are distributed to a close friend, a relative and stored in the office. The home vault is not vulnerable to raiding or burglary because spending the money requires a visit to either the friend, bank or office.

If an asset has its own blockchain, maybe even a proprietary one, it's not that easy to simply ""add"" it to an exchange. STeX or any exchange for that needs to be sure that everything works properly and that there are no issues with said blockchain. You can't afford to add an asset that has faulty code or that has vulnerabilities.  On top of that, there needs to be a risk assessment of the asset itself whether it's even worthy of being added to the exchange. Is the project legit? Will there be enough volume? There are a lot of questions that need to be answered. You need to keep in mind that every added asset potentially dilutes the liquidity pool, even if STeX is (partly) compensated through possible listing fees.  So you see that there are good reasons not to simply add every ICO token/coin.",False

You can deposit and withdraw them directly from the STeX platform. The trades you perform are done through the liquidity pool which in term is represented as assets on other exchanges and on STeX itself. Here is an example I already mentioned before.  Let's make a few assumptions:  you want to trade DCR/BELA your main exchange is Bittrex on Bittrex DCR/BTC is traded but no BELA/BTC on Poloniex DCR/BTC and BELA/BTC are traded but you have no account  Now you've got several options if you want to sell your DCR and get BELA. Right now, the 'easiest' way would be to create a Polo account and either trade your DCR to BTC on Bittrex and then transfer them to Polo and trade BTC/BELA or to transfer your DCR to Polo, trade them there for BTC and then again buy BELA with them. This is a pretty long way to go but in the end, you'd have your DCR/BELA trade.  With STeX, it will be much easier and faster: The STeX platform is connected to other exchanges and trades through its liquidity pool. What it means is that STeX knows the rates of DCR/BTC and BELA/BTC on Polo and the rate of BELA/BTC on Bittrex. The chain would be as follows:  you give DCR to STeX >> DCR in STeX liquidity pool >> STeX liquidity pool trades DCR/BTC on Polo (sell) >> BTC in STeX liquidity pool >> STeX liquidity pool trades BELA/BTC on Polo (buy) >> BELA in STeX liquidity pool >> you get your BELA from STeX  This is way more convenient and not nearly as time-consuming as doing those trade yourself + you don't need to wait for the transfer of your coins from one exchange to the other. But there is more to it. Because STeX knows all rates of the connected exchanges, it also always knows where the best rates are. So, if the rate of DCR/BTC is more favorable on Bittrex than on Polo, STeX would trade DCR/BTC there instead of on Polo and if there is a better chain, the algorithm could use that instead, e.g.:  DCR/DOGE(Bleutrade) >> DOGE/ETH (Poloniex) >> ETH/BTC (Bittrex) >> BTC/BELA (Poloniex)  In this example, you'd also give DCR and get BELA but through the STeX liquidity pool, you made the most favorable trade possible compared to trading DCR/BTC and BTC/BELA directly on Poloniex.  There are so many possible solutions and ways to save fees, profit from different spreads, make arbitrage...  The liquidity pool ensures, that there always is capital for your trade and the STeX algorithm uses the pool to make the best trades/chains.   The STeX liquidity pool is much much more of course. Since it gets larger and larger, it can also have the most important (trading-)coins in store and can make the trade that much faster. It all depends on the management of the liquidity pool, of course.   If there would be a dedicated DCR/BELA market, you'd be absolutely right, the number of orders would be very few and the rates really bad since the order book would be nearly empty because few people would trade this pair. BUT there is no such market and the order books of DCR/BTC and BELA/BTC on other exchanges are much more likely to have more entries in them and so your rate is way better.  That way, you'll be able to trade the most exotic pairs you can imagine without the need for a dedicated trading market while still having the best rates possible + filled order books.",False

On top of the described amount, 10% of the amount of the A2A tokens exchanged during the ICO process are issued for bounty, airdrops, advisors and strategic partners of the STeX project. The minimum amount of 200,000,000 A2A tokens must be exchanged during the ICO. If the desired amount will not be reached during the ICO, the liquidity pool will be topped up with all additionally issued A2A tokens remained to reach this 200,000,000 limit and will be reserved in the liquidity pool for the future distributions in response to the future userbase growth. 5% of the total final supply will be issued to the liquidity pool on STeX Exchange and other exchanges to provide sufficient liquidity for A2A tokens on the market. This distribution of the 5% to the special external liquidity reserve pool is valid only until there are available undistributed tokens at the end of the ICO. So, in case of high demand there would be no tokens distributed to the external liquidity reserve pool because in this case there would be enough tokens in circulation in the system and we do not need such a pool. Considering all the above, the total number of the A2A tokens available for exchange during the ICO is 500,000,000. The maximum total supply in case the ICO will be hard-capped is 600,000,000 A2A tokens.  All bonus tokens are locked for 9 months.",False

I guess it would boost the ""hype level"" of the project It would not be appreciated at all. It is just wasting of tokens. IMHO. Better to allocate that tokens in bounty  I beg to differ. A good exchange (good in terms of functionality, UX and conditions) doesn't need an airdrop. It needs traders and thus it's vital that the trading performance gets listed on sites like coinmarketcap or worldcoinindex. Airdroping the A2A token wouldn't serve this purpose as it wouldn't get traders on the platform. However, you could give potential traders in incentive for registering and reaching a certain trading volume on the exchange, rewarding them with some tokens. Especially in the beginning.   Quote from: ApehaFan777 on June 17, 2018, 11:45:32 AM What is the cost per token? Have u had already the private sale?  The token price for A2A is 0.0002 ETH per 1 A2A token. Currencies are: ETH, BTC, LTC, DASH, TRX, BTG, BCH There was no pre-sale or private sale of A2A tokens afaik.

The discount is based on the amount of the commissions paid to the system and the length of time the token is held in the account.

Sure, the community could vote on implementing a token/coin but I hope that people understand that it's not 'free', so using assets that are already listed on other exchanges has several advantages over adding it only on STeX.  Plus if you take a low volume coin for example (or zero volume as it isn't traded) and you add it to STeX so that people have all those different pairs available, they'll start trading it, ok. But what if it dies or there really is no volume since it's an irrelevant coin, then what? The trades were made through the liquidity pool and since the coins aren't traded the money is tied up and ultimately lost. So it definitely is a business decision whether to add an asset or not. There needs to be a thorough risk-assessment resp. risk/reward-analysis before even letting the community vote on a coin (which in itself comes at a price since someone must do this analysis).   tl;dr: there is a reason why coins aren't added on exchanges and STeX shouldn't add random coins only because it's possible.",False

With it, every coin/token can /theoretically) be traded against every other. That's the Any2Any (A2A) idea behind all of it. That's also the reason why STeX is able to support 10.000 trading pairs. It's a pretty neat idea if you think about it. Here is how it works:  Here's my simple example from before with a few assumptions:  you want to trade DCR/BELA your main exchange is Bittrex on Bittrex DCR/BTC is traded but no BELA/BTC on Poloniex DCR/BTC and BELA/BTC are traded but you have no account  Now you've got several options if you want to sell your DCR and get BELA. Right now, the 'easiest' way would be to create a Polo account and either trade your DCR to BTC on Bittrex and then transfer them to Polo and trade BTC/BELA or to transfer your DCR to Polo, trade them there for BTC and then again buy BELA with them. This is a pretty long way to go but in the end, you'd have your DCR/BELA trade.  With STeX, it will be much easier and faster: The STeX platform is connected to other exchanges and trades through its liquidity pool. What it means is that STeX knows the rates of DCR/BTC and BELA/BTC on Polo and the rate of BELA/BTC on Bittrex. The chain would be as follows:  you give DCR to STeX >> DCR in STeX liquidity pool >> STeX liquidity pool trades DCR/BTC on Polo (sell) >> BTC in STeX liquidity pool >> STeX liquidity pool trades BELA/BTC on Polo (buy) >> BELA in STeX liquidity pool >> you get your BELA from STeX  This is way more convenient and not nearly as time-consuming as doing those trade yourself + you don't need to wait for the transfer of your coins from one exchange to the other. But there is more to it. Because STeX knows all rates of the connected exchanges, it also always knows where the best rates are. So, if the rate of DCR/BTC is more favourable on Bittrex than on Polo, STeX would trade DCR/BTC there instead of on Polo and if there is a better chain, the algorithm could use that instead, e.g.:  DCR/DOGE(Bleutrade) >> DOGE/ETH (Poloniex) >> ETH/BTC (Bittrex) >> BTC/BELA (Poloniex)  In this example, you'd also give DCR and get BELA but through the STeX liquidity pool, you made the most favourable trade possible compared to trading DCR/BTC and BTC/BELA directly on Poloniex. (this would be possible only for the connected exchanges of course)  There are so many possible solutions and ways to save fees, profit from different spreads, make arbitrage...  The liquidity pool ensures, that there always is capital for your trade and the STeX algorithm uses the pool to make the best trades/chains.   The STeX liquidity pool is much much more of course. Since it gets larger and larger, it can also have the most important (trading-)coins in store and can make the trade that much faster. It all depends on the management of the liquidity pool, of course. That way, you'll be able to trade the most exotic pairs you can imagine without the need of a dedicated trading market while still having the best rates possible + filled order books.  I hope this cleared things up a bit, Cheers!",False

I am sure at some point we will see a great hack of one of the hardware wallets. At the same time, properly encrypted system, even hot and connected to the internet, can be unhackable if you do things right. The example is bitcoin system itself. On the exchange we replicate the same level of security.",False
