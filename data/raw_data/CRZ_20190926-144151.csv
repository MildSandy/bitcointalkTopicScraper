Crimzon uses real-time GPS data points run against restrictive algorithms to ensure that users can only match if they overlap in time and space.  When users enter social venues like cafes, bars, clubs, parks, and so forth, Crimzon users are able to detect matches who are at the same location and meet their preferences. This means a much higher probability of actually meeting the person they match.      Similar to Pokemon Go, Crimzon has a Heat Map feature that displays visual densities called HotZones on top of different social venues. If a social venue displays a HotZone on the Heat Map, then its an indication that there is a high level of Crimzon user activity, and a high probability of meeting someone there.  So, you have a map that guides you to find people to interact with, and that pushes people to specific places. What’s most exciting is that the densities change according to the user’s preferences!      This model rewards users when they meet their matches (which our algorithms can detect) and when they go out to “HotZones”.  Written on the Ethereum smart contract, the reward model follows a variable schedule and has two mechanisms that prevent abuse by users. The CRZ rewards are derived from a 20% reserve pool and are recycled through the app when users expend them on premiums and third-party services. This recycling links the revenue Crimzon generates to the intrinsic value of the CRZ token.  Crimzon also uses a verification system that encrypts every match as a “transaction,” creating a longitudinal identity per user that can be used as a safeguard measure against bad actors.  Quick Heat Map breakdown:     On the backend, our algorithms are calculating data points in real time per user per google place ID using both Google Maps and Google Place APIs. When the density of data points meets a certain threshold criteria, the data points are represented visually with different red color saturations correlating with more data points.  So, the Heat Map is basically a visual guide depicting the density of Crimzon users at different social venues in real time as “HotZones”, AND it changes according to your preferences.    The dating vertical is a lucrative market with a global multi-billion dollar valuation. Tinder alone reels in over $800 million annually despite the growing community of fake and inactive users, and a match-to-meet ratio of less than 1%. Crimzon  Crimzon’s model, its blockchain functionality, and its reward system will ripple through the millennial social media and recruit many users between the ages of 18-30.  Total Addressable Market:      We are neuroscience and computer science graduates from the University of Southern California with experience from Facebook, Optum, and the Cleveland Clinic. Check out our team and Linkedin profiles here.  Our model is inspired by an understanding of millennial psychology and behavior and we’re integrating the most powerful reward and verification system using blockchain.    Crimzon was registered in 2016 under JA.HOTSPOT, LLC in Los Angeles, California.  We’ve completed the development and testing of Crimzon app on iOS, and we’re launching the ICO to complete integrating the blockchain reward and verification functionality and to develop the android version.  Crimzon has even filed a patent for its Heat Map technology and application.  Crimzon is expected to launch on August 2018.  Check out our roadmap below!            We’re offering our contributors early access to our iOS and android versions for testing and feedback.  We are giving away CRZ tokens for early support:  5,000 CRZ tokens for 1st 100 telegram followers 2,500 CRZ tokens for next 200 telegram followers 1,250 CRZ tokens for next 300 telegram followers 625 CRZ tokens for next 400 telegram followers  We have a vision: We’re creating a community around Crimzon because we believe that social apps need to be about socializing. So we’re investing in starting Crimzon Cafes in dense metropolitan areas like LA and SF, Toronto, London, Hong Kong, and Dubai.   Explore our project: www.crimzon.io Read our whitepaper.

Actually, we have the prototype already developed on iOS and we've done field testing on the Heat Map functionality, and it's looking great. If all goes according to plan, we're looking at developing the Android version in the month of July and by then should also have completed the integration of the blockchain reward and verification systems.  The images on the white paper (the ones in the phones) are actually screenshots of the app itself.  If you go to our website and send an email to us, we'll have you down to be an early tester and user Also join our Telegram to get early bonuses and to stay up to date.",False

Now I'll only have to convince my girl that this is all only for testing purposes and essentially for ROI Maybe the area where I discuss that with her also turns into a Heat Zone then, but a different one",False
