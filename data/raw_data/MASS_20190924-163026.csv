The SEC wouldn't go after individual investors but the company.  And the SEC believes the long arm of the law is global and borderless if there's any U.S. citizen nexus in any way, shape or form.  Anyway, for MASS to do a legal ICO to U.S. citizens they will have to follow the regulations for Title II (Regulation CF), Title III (Regulation A+) or the older Regulation D.  Title II and Title III require using an online crowdfunding portal to fund raise, but the ICO would be available to anyone in the world.  Regulation D is for accredited investors only (and you can no longer self-affirm as in the past, the issuer has to actively verify).  Regulation CF is relatively cheap and easy to do but is limited to raising $1 million a year.  Regulation A+ has two possibilities, $30 million or $50 million per year, but is relatively expensive on the order of about $100K due to increased compliance requirements.  It is effectively a mini-IPO.  You can do a CF/A+ and D simultaneously and there's certainly no reason this part couldn't theoretically be limited to U.S. citizens only, while the rest of the world is caveat emptor as normal.  Fortunately, StartEngine.com (founded by an Activision co-founder) plans to enable ICO token offerings for funding campaigns in a few weeks.  None of the other portals have that in the works AFAIK.  So that is the only option at this point for MASS if they want to include non-accredited investors.",False

You will have VIP and priority access during the relaunch, more details will be coming soon.  Again, thank you for all of your patience and overwhelming support.

The guidelines released by the SEC have certain unclear implications and references that were outside of the scope of any of our own personal knowledge and required professional counsel.  With that being said, it has been a very grueling period of time in which we've had to use personal funding, vette dozens of lawyers and firms in search of one or several that could tackle the issue at-hand, and continue with development in preparation for the future of MASS.  As promised we are remaining transparent with our investors and supporters so that everyone has an understanding of where we stand now and where we might in the near future.  We have retained Losey PLLC which is comprised of multiple attorneys, each with their own focus in various areas of practice.  The first steps were complete analysis of our goals, offerings and so forth so that they could have a better understanding of how if at all, our project would fall within the realm of a security, commodity, or otherwise.  Following that was yet more analysis to determine what options we had that would best suit all parties involved including but not limited to our investors, any regulatory bodies of interest or concern and the project overall.   Now that both steps have been completed, we are exploring all possibilities thoroughly without any knee-jerk decisions being made in order to maintain the level of clarity and direction that we have upheld since the start in order to secure a long-lasting, legal presence within this space.  Tuesday evening our team will conference in with our attorneys and discuss how we plan on moving forward.  We will make another announcement following that. As of this time, we are still as mentioned already - determining which options are best.

Hes not even particularly good at fudding since he cant even criticise the business model.  Essentially it boils down to  ""waaah waaah waaah, delay, unfair, want refund"" and ""I dont like straight shooter Yak who doesnt suffer fools gladly"". (when offered refund also refuses refund)   Mass is quintessentially  An investment into a limited supply (possible maximum of 61000000) tokens, each representing a share of the majority of ether garnered during the ICO.  2 Months after project inception, people can burn mass to get Eth at 90% of the value of the funds under management which makes every mass token give a greater share of the reward per day.  The assets under management will fluctuate in value with time, but due to unstaked Mass reward being reinvested into buying more masternode coins the amount of masternodes represented will ever increase.  Holders will be protected from extreme price swings by having a wide diversified set of nodes represented within the portfolio.  If a particular coin goes to the moon, Mass will sell some of it, and reward holders with an Eth payout, and potentially buy back in when it normalises in price.  Because Mass can be directly exchanged for Ether with the burn function it doesn't just derive its value from the fact it is a dividend paying coin, but from the fact its directly interchangable with the assets held by Mass  Because unstaked rewards are put back in the pool traders benefit from trading mass (assuming they make profit) and Hodlers benefit from more payouts as more masternodes are added each month.   The model is elegant and simple in its inherent beauty as a money making machine which like a fine wine improves with age.  I look forward to seeing the project unfold and grow over time.",False

What we are doing is waiting for our council to guide us as to the best way to handle the current landscape as well as prepare us best for the shifting landscape of the future.  Basically a security is defined loosely as any common business where there is expectation of profit, nothing to do with dividends etc really, its more about how things are structured. Even just simply using the term ICO at the moment basically starts the 'branding' of it being a security, at least in the spectrum of it.  The goal is to be able to move forward with the guidance of our lawyers while not completely butchering the functionality.  What you will see a lot of people going on about in chats and stuff (or when people ask why a certain token etc isn't on an exchange) is that 'it offers dividends/payouts so it is a security' That simply isn't true, people really don't understand very well what a security is, but people getting payouts doesn't make it one specifically.

Eth could have been seen as security in the beginning, tho this changed due to the adoption, you can shop with ether now and that means it is a currency. This is why SEC dont wreck everyone by going into the past. They focus on the present atleast for now before the regulation of currencies are what they want it to be.

Not all of us can throw away $900 and it matters to those with doubts/concerns as much as it does to supporters with no doubts or concerns.  Marketing should have commenced if this is to be a successful project. It's not easy to gain popularity or momentum. The same questions being asked here are only going to be asked a 1000 times more once the project gains more market exposure.  Twitter, Facebook and this Steemit are all free and strong means of communication and marketing.  The trolling going on between individuals is boring, but analysing points such as Bob and myself have previously made should be of value to everyone invested, including the MASS team.  No one invested without thinking this was going to be a flyer. We all want it to be the success it can be, but there are some fairly big issues to date. Namely that although there has been fair disruption outside of the control of the Mass team, what are we roughly looking at with regards to the funds invested.  Time frames always slip on projects. Even more so given the white hat hacker and SEC issues, but you can still start to communicate plan B, C or the other options under consideration.

Instead of answering intelligently and with class, you all claim whining, fud, and claim old info, such as ""you couldve gotten a refund for a week."" no i dont speak for all investors, but there are plenty, who now getting information since the first refund, COULD entitle them to another refund. These are the facts about mass so far: 1.good idea, pos and masternodecoin staking. 2.ended preico prematurely due to a whitehat hacker saving the day and buying remaining 3k ether thus ""technically"" closing preico, due to the terms of the contract. 3.refunds were then announced to anyone who wanted one ""due to people complaining their money wasnt safe."" there was 5 days to get refund. 4. It was then stated, there would be a community vote of all mass holders as to if they wanted to resume preico. Most were for it as it still didnot seem resuming preico would affect ico resuming by mid to late August. 5. Then, out of nowhere, investors were Told mass had made a decision, Their decision, that they would be seeking legal counsel over the ""surprise"" sec ruling. Delay. That was August 3rd, when the announcement was made official, but well a week after refunds had been furnished for a previous delay. 6. I am typing this on August 19th, 2.5 weeks after they announced their legal issue, and there is still no word on anything. 16 days for these lawyers to figure out sec ruling? Wow. Delay. 7. This is when they just shouldve refunded Everyones money because what if lawyers come back and say mass is a security, or to err on safe side its perceived as a security, what is mass going to do just refund us ppls ether? How? 8.if preico resumes, its looking like end of August. 9. After preico takes a minute to finish, it appears as though actual ico would continue sometime in mid to late September, which means they have now delayed start time by at least a month and a half, if product launches by october. Those are facts. Not whining. Its irresponsible to hold anyones funds for longer than originally stated. People get into icos based on what the developers state. Those who got into dcorp knew their funds wouldnt be released until October, so they planned and invested accordingly. As im sure many of those who invested in mass did so based on the ORGINAL timeframe mass stated. The reason why there is so much written and speculated on these, any, icos being scams is these developers are able to get away with not being fully transparent, which i thought what was this whole blockchain was supposed to foster.",False

I don't think there is any respectable project in crypto that doesn't have proper communications setup for it's community.

It wasn't that hard to say the backend is on schedule.  Your opinion that it's pointless to market now doesn't make sense, but fine. A suggestion I might make is that you could have twitter active embellishing the finer details of the white paper and potentially showing off some wireframes or linking to GitHub (which appears to be fairly empty). If you built a following for the product and some excitement about the ICO, you might find that it doesn't pass most investors by and leave you wondering why no one is queuing at the door to buy on the first day of the ICO. Unikoingold and EOS might be good examples to follow!  Love that it's my fault for not paying attention...I check my emails, the website, this forum, previously twitter and reddit nearly everyday. I visited Telegram a few days ago, but it was full of speculative chatter about investment theories.....I'm not interested in that. I'm interested in details and money. Money that has so far sat in this project doing nothing and looks to be doing nothing until early October at a minimum.  You don't have to make things up to provide updates. That much is fair comment. There is however a large amount of information that no one knows so far so I think it's a bit incorrect to say there is nothing to update on.  What does the web app look like, what coins are currently in the running for purchase, who from the team has been where doing what for the project? What is legal counsel saying? I hear it's just language changes? When will that be confirmed? When will you be closer to confirming product readiness and potential ICO start/end dates? What exchanges have you had contact you about listing MASS?  What is the story with GitHub? It was only setup on the 6th of June and shows the last update 2 days ago. Is it redundant now?

What is the story with GitHub? It was only setup on the 6th of June and shows the last update 2 days ago. Is it redundant now? I notice Neos coin and bittrex get a mention in there. Will we be picking up the app from GitHub?  Why would the GitHub be redundant? That is where the contracts are located as well as any updates to the white paper.

First and foremost we would like to thank everyone for their continued patience while we invest our personal resources in the appropriate places to ensure that MASS has a secure, long-term, and successful presence.  With the recent events taking place (the parity vulnerability; our funds recovered and the release of the newest SEC guidelines) - we've been put in a position and given the opportunity to assess things from a better perspective.  That being said, we've taken every step possible thus far to secure the longevity of this project and will continue to do so.  What we've discovered in the past week or so, is that while many attorneys exist within this space that have educated themselves somewhat on both securities language and are familiar to a degree with the technology it applies to - not everyone is necessarily the right person for the job.  What this means is we need to hold off on any pre-sale continuation until we square these things away, we should have more clarity by the start/mid of next week, but that also brings us into mid August territory. Keep in mind this also has been impacting any efforts of advertising, as well as the audits (some portions of the smart contracts will need to be changed based on legal feedback). This is something that we unfortunately have very little control over.  All we care about is what is best for MASS, which is to have an excellent launch and reach its funding goals, for this we need enough time and the ability to have a specific date. The work on our side of MASS has obviously continued as usual, but now we just need to bring all these pieces together. Don't take this as anything ""bad"", it is just us trying to be transparent about what is going on.  Within the past several days we've been in touch with easily over a dozen firms and attorneys in addition to the counsel we had on board and we're confident with whom we've chosen to analyze our structure, business model, and overall strategy.  Again we should have official updates for everyone mid-week next week and look forward to moving forward with you all.  Again, thank you for your continued support.

However with the recent events and SEC it seems to increasingly make more sense that once the legal aspects have been finalised that MASS just gets it up and rolling with the normal ICO.  Forget the pre-sale, it has been done as best it could with circumstances dictating.  With the ICO, 20%, 10% discounts or not there will be enough takers, I will be contributing again for sure.

We had people requesting refunds 10+ times, we had people requesting refunds multiple different times, we had people requesting refunds to different addresses, we had people asking for refunds to be cancelled, we had people not understanding what manually sent meant.  A long story short, refunds are *STILL* going to be processed manually, any refunds are still permanent, and any addresses that have requested refunds will not be able to participate in the remaining pre-sale if it happens. Emailing saying your refund should take priority will not actually make it a priority, telling us that your family is sick and that you need the refund, or any other story will not change anything. Next order of business is to go through and sift out the non bogus attempts and send them out (again manually). This will be happening probably by the start of August or slightly after.  You will be able to see the status of the payouts by looking at the hardware wallet address: https://etherscan.io/address/0x88dcd9206230c03d828c5619ed899719464888ce  And obviously, your balance if you requested a refund.  We will be having a vote soon as to whether there should be a continuation of the pre-sale, and will be letting everyone know.

More details coming soon.  For the same email but in PDF to verify on the site:  https://mass.cloud/HappyEnding.pdf   On Wednesday, July 19th, 2017, an exploit was found in Parity’s multisig wallets. This exploit allowed anyone to take control over said wallet and perform any regular function, including transferring ether and killing the wallet. The presale contract that was launched had a multisig wallet that was vulnerable: https://etherscan.io/address/0x63c0f17c1f72e1315e3d4f8a89a37d95f1314793#readContract  Due to the nature of the presale contract, it was impossible to change the contract owner or outgoing address where the funds are sent. Once we learned of this exploit, we suspended all advertising and contacted the White Hat Group as well as other key Ethereum experts on our next steps. We were given a contract to be used to buy out the remaining presale and end it all in one fell swoop, sadly, we were not able to secure enough funding to completely buy it out. In the interim, we had a server setup and running performing the following: •  Check if the presale contract is sold out. If it is, takeover the wallet, call endPreSale, and get the funds out of the wallet in one block. •  Check if the presale contract had < 1000 Ethereum left to sell. If it did, we’d call the aforementioned contract to buy it out, end the presale, and recover the funds in one block. •  Check if the current block is within 5 blocks of the presale ended. If it was, it would start sending commands to a contract to start the recovery process without the use of any extra funds.  Due to the exploit, we were unable to publicly announce anything since anyone could have come in and simply killed the multisig wallet, thus locking the funds in the contract forever. Instead, we contacted trusted parties to try and secure funds to try and buy the contract out.  At 10:15pm EST, July 24, 2017, the presale contract was sold out and drained in one block. At first, we assumed the party responsible was not working with our interests in mind and had come to the conclusion that the funds were lost. Several minutes later we received an email from a white hat hacker that submitted proof they had the funds and are willing to return them in full. We are still working with this person to secure the funds, but steps must be taken to ensure that both parties are who they say they are.  Regardless of your opinion of Ethereum, this only proves there are a lot of good people in the community that want to help out in any way they can. More updates to follow as we receive them.  If you have any questions please feel free to contact us here, or on Telegram or Slack, or IRC.  As always, thank you again for your support.",False

So the only way a MASS holder benefits from appreciation in the various coin's price, is through the increase in value in the fund itself, or if they get REALLY lucky and happen to pick payouts in one of the coins that happens to increase by a bazillion %.   While this is certainly not something that would stop me contributing, I think that, if it were possible, being able to choose a longer time horizon, but rewards in multiple currencies would be nice to have as an option.  Something like you can get the top 10 holdings distributed to you pro-rata on a weekly/monthly/quarterly basis.  That way I would have Pivx, Nem, etc in my wallet in the chance it increased significantly, rather than completely held by the fund.  You also mention that MASS can be exchanged for its pro-rata amount of the fund in Eth...Does that mean that the value of the fund at any given time in eth is available for exchange?  So if Pivx increased another 500% when compared to Eth, which makes the whole fund 2x more valuable in eth (unrealized), would my potential cash-out portion have increased a corresponding amount in Eth (double)?  Sorry for the more detailed questions, I just want to make sure I have a handle on it.  Thanks!",False

Keep in mind that the portfolio auto rebalances if something like that were to happen, so if pivx went up 500% it would be rebalanced out into the other coins/masternodes + new coins/masternodes + since it is 500% it would trigger the unicorn event in the contract, in which mass holders get a bonus payout",False

You are far more protected because of the diversification, but the absolute fastest growth would be to get lucky and pick a single coin that does phenomenally well.  MASS seems like it has a much greater long-term upside, and less of a need to get lucky, but picking a coin that goes up 100,000% is still that absolute fastest way...but you may as well be trying to win the lottery!  Also, another question, like I haven't asked enough...  What do you use as an oracle for importing the current XYZ coin/Eth price into the smart contract?

Could you expand more upon how appreciation benefits us? as in drives up the mass token value, or the return per month, or both? Both, as mass that is unstaked (eg people who aren't staking... such as traders) is reinvested back into the pool, that means, those rewards are compounding inside the pool itself, which then purchases more masternodes, other coins, which all are staked, all of which are being paid out to stakers, so what happens is slowly (or perhaps not that slowly, depending on how many unstaked mass there is) the 'staking power' of what a user has, increases because of that. Obviously this makes mass more valuable just from that standpoint, but also from the actual 'value' of each of the coins that is being held (the nav) because of the burn/liquidate function.",False

Assuming full time spent staked in the block for the 28/28 on your formula. it is a pool, so the amount would be dependent on your share of that total stake, let me give you an example: imaginary reward blocks are say 1000 and the payout for the staking portion of that is 100eth there are 4 people total staking for all 1000 blocks and each person has 1000 mass(again all of these numbers for ease of use) the payout run for you would be basically 1000 blocks at 1000 mass which equals 1000000 'stake weight' now since all 4 people have the exact same mass and exact same 'stake weight' in this example the 100eth reward would be 100/4 or 25 eth each. in the same example if 10 people were doing the exact same thing exact same 'stake weight' the rewards would be 100/10 or 10eth each. basically your mass equates to your 'mining power' in the pool, when you stake with it. Obviously the more mass you have in these examples the more 'stake weight' at the end you would have compared to other people, eg if there were 2 people each with 1000 but you (as the 3rd person) had 2000mass, all equal stake time, and the payout was 100eth you would get 50eth they would get 25 eth each (you are double their stake weight at the end, its just a ratio)  Hopefully I didn't just make that more confusing then it is.

I have also explained to you how it works, each block you are either staking or not, each block you stake adds to your staking weight, each block you are not staking adds nothing to your weight, so after 1000 blocks (assuming payout runs were 1000 blocks) you would have blocks-staked * amount-you-are-staking = your final weight for that pay round.  your final weight = your share of pay for that round. your weight and others weight is then broken into percents based on 100% and payouts are distributed accordingly, this is how mining pools do it, its basically the exact same, its set up like this to prevent exploitation.",False

Sent in some Ether and now I'm wondering if I should put in more. Just one comment. Is there any thought to changing the distribution rules so that owners are encouraged to keep the block reward in the pool? For example, for those that do not stake and keep their block reward in the pool, they get a proportionally increase in MASS token percentage for future block reward. The following is from the FAQs:  ""So, why would B not stake his MASS too? The answer is simply that they might want MASS to increase in size as fast as possible, This is more of an altruistic view, which we expect possibly very loyal supporters, or team members will do, anyone who is looking a long way in the future, this is probably the best thing to do. In the end, we want the choice to be our users, so you have the option.""  So instead of an altruistic approach, incentivize by providing higher proportional ownership for keeping the block reward in the pool.",False

There was awhile ago that was abandoned by the creators before it even hit exchanges. We are not related to that project whatsoever.  Also from our FAQ:  Is there an escrow agent for this? If so who is your escrow agent?  The code to the Smartcontracts acts as our escrow agent, no offense to people who are escrow agents, but we would rather trust in the blockchain and emotionless code. The contract handles all of this automatically.  As far as your other question, as the White Paper states, 10% of mass will be given to the MASS Cloud Ltd. and locked for 1 year, also 10% of all Ethereum raised will be given to MASS Cloud Ltd. to be used for operational expenses, infrastructure, and future development. After the first year the 10% share of MASS will unlock, and be used to further ""pay the bills"". All fees accrued in the system are paid for from *OUR* funds (The ETH and then the MASS), MASS Cloud Ltd. does not receive *ANYTHING EXTRA*, we are exactly like all of the other MASS holders when it comes to staking/rewards. What that means is your share of MASS represents 100% of the pool of assets inside MASS as far as staking goes (we just happen to also own some).  Hopefully this helps answer your questions!     Quote from: maxNIMFA on July 17, 2017, 12:22:34 PM In the topic it's written: 12 July 2017, pre-sale. But the topic started 17 July 2017. You've meant that you'll give the info on 12 July about pre-sale or what?  Correct, the pre-sale is already started. We started the pre-sale in order to reward the people who have been around the project since day 1. This meant we started the pre-sale with basically zero advertising and only just word of mouth from people who caught wind of the project and have been following it. We wanted those people to be able to get into the pre-sale without any worry of missing out because of that. Right now is the time we begin our marketing campaigns (bitcointalk ANN, advertising on sites etc), without much advertising the word of mouth has raised nearly 50% of the pre-sale cap in just 5 days.  Hopefully that makes sense.    Quote from: bilibord on July 17, 2017, 12:34:08 PM What does it give?  MASS is an easy way for anyone to gain exposure to a distributed set proof of stake and Masternode coins while giving the option for a daily payout from staking into our smart contract in ETH.  Basically instead of having to follow all of the various PoS and Masternode coins, secure your wallets, set up Masternodes, keep your computers on 24/7, we make it so holders of MASS can stake a proportional share in a distributed pool of them, with the click of a button. Earnings for staking are paid out daily, in ETH to start, once the project goes live shortly after stakers will be able to choose what coins they are paid out in.  Hopefully this clarifies things.   Quote from: algo1024 on July 17, 2017, 01:22:26 PM Wherever Jamshoot is it is a scam.  We hired Jamal to handle the bounties etc, if you have issues with Jamal you should probably take them up with him and not project your illogical views that any project that hires someone to do bounty support is a scam, where we come from that is called 'jumping to conclusions'.

Technically as soon as you buy MASS you are part of the team    Quote from: fanten on July 17, 2017, 01:54:08 PM Why *NON EXCHANGE* wallet?  Because of how Ethereum erc20 Tokens work, if you were to send from an exchange wallet you do not own that address, the exchange owns that address. Which means when MASS Tokens get minted instead of going to you, they would go to the exchange's address, which means a LOT of headaches for you trying to deal with them regarding it. We would rather save you that hassle  Always just use a wallet you are in control of the keys, this is for every ICO that is on Ethereum that has people send directly to a Smartcontract, myetherwallet.com parity mist metamask... From there you control your own keys, its just a simple matter of sending to the contract address and then checking your balance. Once the ICO starts your MASS Tokens will automatically be created and sent to you (this is a simplified version of what actually happens on the blockchain but it works )",False

That is quite important to us. Part of building this project is about the project itself, the other part is about building a community around it, which can then help offer support, new ideas, and also help spread the word too.  We also feel that the ICO bonuses are fair without being too out of control, since the bulk of MASS is sold at a 0% bonus in the ICO, it evens the whole thing out quite well. This also gives people who might be uncomfortable about doing anything until August 1st a way to participate (while not getting quite the same rewards, still getting a reward if getting in early into the ICO). Also remember, that the team does not get all of the ICO proceeds like in most ICOs, we are only taking 10% for expenses/operations/infrastructure/etc, the rest (minus the bounty and prior commitment) goes directly into the pool of assets, that means that 88% of the ICO funds raised go directly to benefiting MASS holders.",False

Staked token holders receive a fair share of rewards paid out by PoS and masternode currencies automatically and continuously. Token holders are also able to burn their entire share of MASS for a fair share of the entire Ethereum pool, minus 10%.  After the presale and ICO phase, MASS Cloud Ltd. receives 10% of the raised Ethereum to fund development and pay for initial operating costs. Bounty programs and commitments made prior to the launch each will each be given 1% of the total Ethereum and MASS. That leaves 88% of the total Ethereum for the investment pool. MASS Cloud Ltd. will also receive 10% of the total MASS sold which will be locked and untradeable for 1 year and its rewards will be used to grow the pool. Rewards from unstaked MASS tokens will be placed back into the pool for additional growth. After launch, there are no additional fees or percentages taken from rewards that are paid out. Only unstaked MASS can be traded or transferred. Block rewards are based on the amount of MASS and time they have been staked since the last block reward. The total number of tokens available for sale is capped at 61 million.  INTRODUCTION Most cryptocurrencies rely on vast amounts of computing power to find a valid solution and submit a proof-of-work claim in order to obtain the reward. Examples of such currencies include Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum (currently), Dogecoin, and Namecoin. As these types of currencies became more popular, the amount of energy needed to run mining hardware increases. The barrier of entry to competing on these currencies is twofold; the costs of hardware and the cost of electricy.  Recently, however, more cryptocurrencies are migrating to, or launching as, proof-of-stake. Traditionally, proof-of-stake pays out block rewards based on a set annual percentage rate (APR) in the parameters defined by the developers of the coin. More recent projects have opted to reward a static amount per block. Since most wallets don’t support offline staking, it is critical that your wallet remain online with stable and reliable server hosting. Currencies using PoS include NXT, peercoin, PIVX and soon Ethereum.  Proof-of-stake currencies and masternodes both reward primarily on the value of the wallet. The wallets help maintain the integrity of the entire currency while masternodes perform more computational-critical roles. Getting a noticeable return on vestments (ROI) in proof-of-stake currencies requires substantial initial investment. That investment is locked into a single currency. Many of these currencies do not support offline staking, so the wallet would be required to have almost continuous uptime for it to remain competitive enough to receive block rewards.  Managing all of these currencies and keeping track of trading, buying, and selling is a daunting task for people that cannot do this full-time. MASS Cloud Ltd. bridges the gap between ease of use and currency fluidity. Our platform performs the trades, buys and sells on select coins, and automatically converts block rewards to Ethereum when paid out.   MINING The type of hardware and cost of operation varies depending upon the cryptocoin. Bitcoin started off on CPU miners, then was overtaken by high-end AMD video cards, and now it is overwhelmingly controlled by specialized ASIC hardware. These ASIC miners can run over a thousand dollars for a single high-powered unit1 and power supply2. This unit offers 13.5 terahash per second and recommends a 1600-watt power supply. Using an online calculator3, we can see our return on investment given the specifications of the miner, power usage, energy cost, and expected growth rate of 10.25% every 2 weeks.    1 https://shop.bitmain.com/productDetail.htm?pid=00020170607035948018mhO6CJXR068E Antminer S9 - $1200 2 https://www.evga.com/products/product.aspx?pn=120-G2-1600-X1 EVGA 1600w PSU - $334 3 http://jblevins.org/btcmpc/  DIFFICULTY AND PROFITABILITY    With one unit and the steady rise of difficulty, you would never pay off the initial investment. This can be extrapolated to any number of these machines; the rate at which the difficulty raises outpaces the profit. Bitcoin would need an ever-increasing rise in demand for the return to come close.  Mining Ethereum is still profitable after several months on a modest investment. This is all going to change in the near future when Ethereum moves to proof-of-stake4. The details of their PoS implementation have not been finalized yet, so the cost of entry is still undetermined.  For example, in order to run and maintain your own Dash masternode (a popular PoS/Masternode cryptocurrency), you must have at least 1000 Dash5 in a wallet at all times. Dash currently trades for around $1506, which means an initial investment of $150,000 is needed to start a masternode on the Dash blockchain. This does not include the cost of hardware, or securing the wallet against attack.  4 https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Proof-of-Stake-FAQ 5 https://www.dash.org/masternodes2/ 6 https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dash/  MASS CLOUD LTD.  MASS Cloud Ltd., a Hong Kong-based company, manages the high cost of entry in proof-of-stake and masternode currencies, difficulties in keeping the wallets filled and online at all times, and managing trades between currencies to prevent over funding a single one. We are a team of career professionals with backgrounds in Fortune 300 companies. We believe in the idea of making cryptocurrency less resource intensive by using proof-of-stake implementation, and are bringing what it offers to the public by reducing the cost of investment and complexity in monitoring multiple currencies over multiple exchanges. Our backgrounds are in software engineering, security, virtualization, cluster computing, high-availability ecommerce front ends and back ends, as well as continuous monitoring, trading, and advising on newly announced currencies and ICOs.  Our goal is to provide a new method of investing fiat currency into a continuously growing cryptocurrency fund that pays out block rewards automatically and fairly across all token holders. We are a company that is taking all of the nuances of investing into different cryptocurrencies, and bringing them together in a simple, coherent and secure platform. Because of our faith in this project, we are locking our share of the MASS tokens for 1 year. Also during that period, we will be unable to trade or transfer the tokens received as part of the ICO7. The rewards from those shares will go back into the pool to help increase the size of the underlying assets held by MASS. This will increase the number of rewards holders receive. This heavily benefits all token holders during this time as it 1) increases rewards while staking, and 2) increases value for the MASS token itself, because the underlying assets are also increasing. By the end of the 1 year locked period, we project that the fund will be in a stable growth that MASS Cloud Ltd.’s employees can begin to receive payouts from their shares.  7 https://github.com/mass-ltd/MASSToken/tree/master/contracts  TRANSPARENCY & TRUST We want to be as transparent and open as possible, while also offering the most security for all token holders. All wallets under the control of the team will be multi-signature wallets to ensure a higher level of security and accountability. Once the ICO ends, the remaining funds (after we receive our 10% share), will be transferred to a new smart contract that will act on behalf of the pool. This contract will perform the following actions: Publish outgoing Ethereum addresses with a waiting period of one week before funds are sent. Publish all staking and masternode wallet addresses along with their transactions to both the blockchain and our website. Publish all exchange wallet addresses along with their transactions to both the blockchain and our website. Transactions above 30% of the entire pool will have a waiting period of one week before being released. Announce and approve a list of new coins to invest in that the MASS token holders voted on. Rebalance currencies to ensure no more than 30% of the pool is invested in a single currency. Currencies that have a 200%+ return when rebalanced will reward all token holders a share of 10% of the return. Prevent Ethereum transactions to unapproved addresses. Keep a public record of all outgoing expenditures so that all transactions can be tracked. Create a kill switch that will liquidate all currencies and convert to Ethereum then release the funds to all token holders.

MASS ICO DISTRIBUTION   The above pie charts describe the distribution of Ethereum and tokens after the ICO. The percentages represent the total quantity of MASS tokens sold. This means that 88% of the funds raised during the presale and the ICO will be used to invest in other digital currencies. 2% of total Ethereum and MASS are split between bounty programs and prior commitments.  MASS TOKENS  MASS tokens are purchased at an exchange rate of 1000 tokens per Ethereum. During pre-sale, purchases are given 30% more tokens until it closes 14 days later or reaches its cap of 10 million tokens. Once the ICO starts, purchases during the first 5 million tokens will receive 20% more and tokens purchased during the next 10 million will receive 10% more, purchases made after the 2nd phase ends will receive no bonus. The tokens are locked during the presale and the ICO and will be released upon the completion of the ICO. There is a cap of 61 million MASS tokens in total. The following flowchart helps visualize the structure of the contract and pooling system:   1. Tokens are purchased by sending Ethereum to the contract. The exchange rate is based on how many tokens have been sold and can be seen in the contract source.8 2. After sending Ethereum, the contract allocates MASS tokens to the sender’s address. 3. Once the ICO ends, token holders can send a message to the contract to stake their tokens. 4. Staked tokens cannot be transferred, traded, or burned. 5. These staked tokens will give holders a fair payout of rewards. 6. Unstaked tokens can be traded, sold or burned, but their shares of the rewards are reinvested into the pool. 7. Burning tokens will give the owner a fair percentage of the total Ethereum value of MASS Cloud Ltd., minus a burn fee to prevent abuse and market manipulation as well as manual oversight.  Once the ICO ends and the funds are released to a wallet controlled by our back end system, they will be invested into multiple supported currencies and masternodes. Regardless of if tokens are staked or not, their Ethereum equivalent will be put to use by the pool. Block rewards are paid out based on the amount of MASS staked for each owner and the amount of time the tokens spent being staked.   The pool receives 10.7% of the reward to not only boost the value of the pool, but to also reinvest these rewards into new coins and masternodes. Tokens that are lost and are not staked will not have a negative impact on the pool, since unstaked tokens receive no reward. Staked tokens will always receive their share of block rewards until they are marked as unstaked.  8 https://github.com/mass-ltd/MASSToken/tree/master/contracts  BONUS STRUCTURE   During presale and the ICO, purchases can receive extra tokens up to a certain limit9. We are setting a cap of 10 million tokens to be sold during the presale. During this time, all purchases will be given 30% more tokens. Once the ICO starts, the bonus structure will change to the following:  Phase 1 of the ICO will offer 20% more tokens on purchases on the first 5 million tokens. This is outside of the tokens sold during the presale. Phase 2 of the ICO will offer 10% more tokens on purchases on the next 10 million tokens. Phase 3 of the ICO will offer no bonus tokens and a flat exchange rate of 1000 tokens per Ethereum is set.  INVESTMENT VOTING  Investment voting is part of our road map, and will be implemented in the near future outside of the original contract. Voting will initially work by allowing token holders the opportunity to vote on supporting new coins. Future improvements will allow token holders to choose where their share of Ethereum is invested. If token holders choose to have their share staked into a single currency, they only get rewards from that currency. Their share of the reward is based on the above formulas, but only to that specific currency and not all investments combined. The rewards could be higher or lower depending on multiple factors, including the number of Ethereum staked, and stability and growth of the coin. This feature will reward token holders that see potential in a supported coin by allowing them to have a greater stake in it.  9 https://github.com/mass-ltd/MASSToken/tree/master/contracts  EXAMPLE POS/MASTERNODE COINS  An example set of potential supported coins and their current market value10, as of June 12, 2017, are:  New coins will be added as time goes on; and when investment voting functionality is implemented, token holders will be a major part of vetting potentially successful coins.  10 https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies 11 http://www.cryptocurrencychart.com  AUTOMATION One of the major benefits of using MASS is our ability to automate a large portion of the process. We have years of experience in automation with tools like ansible on platforms such as Amazon’s AWS. Our back end will automate the process of reward payouts, currency exchanges, auto-balancing of investments, managing masternode instances, and account address verification with blockchain messages. We fully plan on taking suggestions and recommendations from token holders to help improve our platform.   SECURITY One of the most difficult parts of running a successful masternode is securing the server it runs on. MASS is using enterprise-grade service providers that offer DDoS protection, VLANs, and multi-factor authentication (MFA). On top of that is our decades of experience as high-level network and systems administrators. Our plan is to have the masternodes on a private network with dual failover VPNs to a DDoS protected public IP. Should the primary address go down, the VPN will change traffic to a new DDoS protected public IP so there is no downtime.  To manage your tokens, you will be able to register an account at www.mass.cloud and attach your Ethereum address to it. In order to control access to your account through our site, you will have to send a challenge message to the blockchain. Verified addresses will be cryptographically signed in our database with our wallet’s private key. This ensures that no one can gain access to your account. Even in the unlikely event of a hack, the attackers won’t be able to properly sign the new Ethereum address.  Along with a standard username/password, users will be asked to enter in a master passphrase or PIN that will only be used to burn their tokens, or to transfer tokens to another address. The purpose of this is to protect against unauthorized access to your accounts, even by us. This secondary passphrase/PIN will also be signed by our private key for another layer of security.   ROAD MAP Our plans for the immediate future are investor voting and partial staking. We will create and publish new smart contracts that utilize these features, and will rely on the authenticity of the original contract to continue to control the distribution of MASS. We will adopt our framework to integrate with new coins and exchanges as they come online. A full-features road map will be available on our website once the details are locked down, and we begin to work on them.  SUMMARY MASS Tokens are the first of its kind and will be the standard in how people invest in cryptocurrencies. MASS Tokens allow token holders the ability to stake securely in multiple currencies and masternodes simultaneously, while receiving block rewards automatically. Due to their unique situation, MASS Tokens hold twice the value of typical ERC20 tokens. Not only can they be traded on various exchanges around the world, but the tokens themselves lead to a large pool of funds receiving block rewards on a continuous basis, which will drive their value on exchanges even further.

What is the minimum amount of mass coin needed to run one masternode? From our FAQ (http://mass.cloud/faq/):   How much MASS is needed for a master node?  Your MASS represents a pool of many different cryptocurrencies with multiple PoS and Masternode wallets in each, even having 1 MASS entitles you to stake your share of all of them. The more MASS you have the more staking weight you have when you are staking, and therefore more portion of the staking rewards.    3. Who is your escrow?  The Ethereum blockchain, it is programmed into the ICO Smartcontract. We feel that an emotionless program serves as a more trustworthy escrow agent than some human that may or may not be trustworthy. That is the power of 'programmable money'  Please take a look at our FAQ where a lot of questions are answered. It has been constantly growing as more questions have been asked.",False
