Note: When you buy tokens in an ICO or do bounties; never directly use the wallet of your exchange account. They are not ERC20 compatible.  VIABET uses ERC20 standard for its tokens.

This is more of a ""safety net"" that we provide and a commitment to our investors. It's going to come out from our end. Let me explain.  The idea is that the token price stays at OR above the original ICO price (which is locked in as the buy-back price) and then we'll add a % from our total profits for the fiscal quarter. So it's kind of like a dividend but not really.  If the token price sky-rockets on exchanges it will obviously make a lot more sense to sell it there but in the case that the price drops lower (which we don't believe it will that's why we're confident in offering this) we'll buy back 10% of your tokens each quarter. So, in any case, you can sell your tokens at the same or higher price than you originally bought them for if you just hold on to them for the long term.

I'm just a bit slow when confronted with new territory, so please excuse my ignorance.  shortly after entering the world of online gambling, it occurred to me that the concept of a decentralized cryptocurrency made a great deal of sense, especially considering my place of residence. with a VPN and a little bitcoin, many new options were finally within my reach. and this may be anecdotal, but in my experience the casinos that accepted transactions via alt-coins were more trustworthy, as opposed to the fiat based alternatives. I still have much to learn, but based on what I've seen so far, VIABET offers an innovative approach to gambling by incorporating a decentralized platform, making it more akin to investing and has the potential to fill a significant gap in the market.  I watched a 20 minute video about VIABET and skimmed through the WHITEPAPER, but I felt a little overwhelmed with details and had trouble making sense of a couple things.. namely, what is the reason/benefit for implementing a ""double token system""? and what sort of experience or technical knowledge will be required in order to develop custom games? will there be a user friendly template that guides the process?

Apples and oranges, so to speak.  VIABET will be administering the plays within the platform using our own provably fair algorithms. So just because you're playing against a regular player, transparency wise, you're still protected as if you were playing against our own casino. Let me just add that while you have the ability to play against other players you don't necessarily have to. We'll have our own provably fair casino games, that regular players who are not interested in creating games will be able to choose from. That's what we mean by becoming a ""one-stop shop"" platform for players as well as game creators. Blockchain is just one of our features NOT our main selling point.  When I mentioned the 5% share of the overall crypto gambling market I wanted to highlight the fact that we want to expand from that, our goal is to enter the 95% fiat marketplace. Our system is set up in such a way that it overcomes KYC/AML challenges faced by other crypto casino platforms. With that our ultimate goal of becoming one of the largest gaming platforms in the world is not that far from reach. Building fiat gateways and marketing to ""normies"" is the key.  You don't become a billion-dollar company by marketing to the niche cryptocurrency enthusiast market ONLY.",True

It's the future of online gambling. We’re offering a service that has never been offered before. A unique way to create, launch and host your own casino games, as well as peer-to-peer sports betting, is something that’s unheard of in the gambling world. VIABET is not a one-dimensional decentralised gambling platform.  Have you ever been to a casino? They say “the house” always wins right? Well, what if there was an autonomous platform which allowed players to launch their own casino games? Changes everything right? Ever wanted to create your own dice site? No problem! You can do that with our platform. You can even set up your own sports betting book and bet against other players on your favorite sporting events. Essentially, VIABET acts as the technological launching pad that allows regular players as well as gaming companies to create and launch their own casino games.  We aim to become a “one-stop shop” for players, game creators as well as established fiat casinos. In the future, you’ll know VIABET as the 800-pound gorilla in the cryptocurrency gambling space. We’re not stopping there either. The online gambling industry is valued at $50 billion, and it is expected to grow to $56 billion in 2018. Less than 5% of this market is attributed to cryptocurrency gambling. That means 95% of the fiat market is still up for grabs and we’re ready to gobble that market share right up.",True

I agree that there are a lot of scams out there so for the sake of transparency, let me answer. (We're actually working on an interview that should answer all of these questions more thoroughly)  There’s currently me and two other people. We all have a background in software development. We're also working with freelancers/developers from all around the world. My name is no secret. As a team though generally, we prefer to stay out of the spotlight and retain our privacy, I'm not going to deny that. I wouldn't say we're newcomers to the crypto space but we're not widely known either (yet). Me personally, I’ve spent the better part of my adult years as a software developer, professional day trader and poker player. We started working on the project in 2016 and have from then on received venture capital funding. With the rise of provably fair cryptocurrency casinos we came to realize that most of them are not that “provably fair” after all. That’s when me and two of my developer friends started brainstorming ideas for the concept of “cloud betting”. Essentially a system where players could create and launch their own games in an online casino environment. A system where the player had the “house” odds, we started working on that while also developing better ways of integrating provable fairness within a casino platform.  Setting up a legal entity/licensing is going to be one of our main goals moving forward. The funds are going to be held by us and allocated for the purposes you can find in the whitepaper. We've estimated the amount to be raised based on similar projects that have come before us and taking account the expenses that we might face in order to develop the platform to its full potential.  Bitcointalk is just one of the avenues where we're trying to get the word out. I've created an official viabet.io account a while ago but we ran into several problems. One of the things with bitcointalk is that as a newbie, junior or whatever you cannot create and maintain ANN, or bounty threads with pictures, links etc, you cannot wear a signature, and avatar (for advertising)... You're limited to a number of posts you can post, as well as being able to send personal messages. We have to send out dozens of PM's every single day in order to keep up with questions and bounty campaign inquiries. We just couldn't do that with a newbie account, hence we went with an account that had no limitations in place. As far as I'm aware that is not against the rules of this forum but I do understand why that may look weird in a sense. I hope my explanation has cleared that part up.  The cointelegraph thing has to be changed, I agree, it was put there as a design element by one of the web-designers and we never got it replaced (it was supposed to be cryptocoinnews I believe). Thanks for pointing that out btw. As all projects go I think everyone's goal should be to get listed on the best exchanges possible. We're no different. Bittrex, Poloniex is one of our long-term goals. We're obviously not claiming that we have confirmed listings on those. We do have other exchanges that we're talking to and we're going to be listed on at least one or two starting out.  I hope that answers some of your questions. As I said we try to remain as transparent as possible.",True

It allows both sides to profit. The house edge becomes mathematically operative only when games are played many times. Gamblers, gamble. You win some, you lose some. All casinos have built in edge. Even the 0% edge casinos have an ""edge"". Except their edge is the exploitation of human error.  VIABET works in a different manner all together (although you can create games with 0% edge if you wish).  Allow me to quote a section from the VIABET Whitepaper:  Quote IV. Cloud Betting Explained  The VIABET platform enables online players to bet against other online players using cryptocurrencies, where one player acting as the casino is given the house odds. For example, “USER A” is able to open a roulette table, or open a slot machine while other users play against him/her. The player enjoys the same odds and will profit from the slots and table profits as if he/she was the casino. In order to qualify to become ""the casino"" “USER A” has to purchase and stake VIA Tokens, play a certain amount of game rounds as a regular player against the VIABET casino, or against other players who have qualified to become the casino. Each time “USER A” plays a round of any of the VIABET casino games he/she earns Edge Tokens.  After earning a specific amount of tokens “USER A” will qualify to become the casino and will be able to offer and open games himself/herself which will allow other players to play against him/her. The player has access to various game customization options, such as setting the house “edge” % for each individual casino game he/she creates. When a regular player plays against VIABET he/she doesn't have to pay a commission, but when he/she plays against other qualifying players who became “the casino” then he/she or the qualifying player will have to pay VIABET a commission for operating, maintaining and administering the plays within the system.  Players who have qualified to become “the casino” will be prepared to pay these commissions since they will be enjoying and benefiting from improved “house” odds. Playing players will be prepared to pay these commissions since the VIABET casino will offer more Edge Tokens when players play against each other, which means that players who have the desire to become “the casino”, can achieve this goal much quicker by playing against other users.",True
