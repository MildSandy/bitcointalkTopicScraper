Our VNX team was pleased to note that security tokens was one of the most hottest and debated topics at the stage as well as in the corridors.   Now it becomes more obvious that thousands of security tokens are ready to come to the market, provided their liquidity is secured. And the next significant development expected by community will be the launch of exchanges capable of bringing liquidity and capital from existing financial market.   In addition to the explosion of interest to the cryptocurrency space from the tech and VC community, there is an increasing interest from a much wider audience of traditional private and institutional financial investors, who are not yet investing in crypto. Experts see a huge potential for growth in this segment, given that today this market still represents a tiny fraction of the overall financial markets. For example, according to some estimates, in the United States alone there are about 10 million accredited investors, of whom only about 200,000 are active investors. While the total capitalization of crypto-industry today is just a bit under $400bn, it is far from achieving any meaningful scale, when compared to the private capital market, which alone represents $5 trln in assets under management.",False
