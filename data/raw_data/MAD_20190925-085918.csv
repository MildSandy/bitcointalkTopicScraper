To quote from MAD's FAQ in answer:  Quote Why does digital advertising need a new protocol? Today’s programmatic advertising ecosystem is broken. The symptoms of its failure are easy to spot. In 2018 alone, ad fraud will cost the industry $51 million per day totaling $18 billion. By the end of 2016, over 600M devices worldwide were using ad blockers (over half of which were mobile) – representing a 30% increase year over year. Ad blocking may be the strongest indicator yet that not only is the system broken – it’s no longer aligned with the very people with whom it’s intended to communicate: the consumer.  Adding insult to injury, ad taxes and ad fraud are at an all-time high, while trust and transparency are at an all-time low. Advertisers are spending more and more to reach consumers, while publishers are making less and less. Yet as costs rise, advertisers still can’t track the customer’s journey or how their budgets are truly spent. There’s no transparency, fraud is rampant, and brand safety is becoming more and more challenging.  We believe OpenRTB is flawed. Its lack of transparency has resulted in multiple intermediaries exploiting its vulnerability. That is where cryptography and blockchain technology can help! Our goal is to combat the problems with OpenRTB by building a new blockchain protocol that will recreate the ecosystem and lay the foundation upon which the entire industry can innovate and thrive.",False

You are right, and the team is moving here. Here is the latest update:    Hi MAD Community,  We have been working hard to develop solutions for the digital advertising industry and I want to update the community on 5 major developments:  1/ Token Bonus for Holders from our initial public Token Sale. 2/ New Whitepaper! 3/ Development and Product Roll Out. 4/ Industry Traction. 5/ Telegram AMA on May 7  1/ THE MAD BONUS PROGRAM: We want to thank the original token holders who have supported our project with a token bonus!  For those who participated in the December 2017 ICO and still hold their tokens, please fill out this google form for your 10% bonus: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3uKLSEmSpuehoBmv-xTxEcj4xIamDUBpjMfP0ZGyEAygVgQ/viewform.  Once we verify that you are a token holder, etc. we will distribute the bonus to you.  IMPORTANT: The bonus program lasts for 30 days, so if you’re still holding, please fill out the form ASAP!  2/ NEW WHITEPAPER: We have just published our new Whitepaper, which is available on our website: https://madnetwork.com/whitepaper. The new whitepaper is the result of countless hours of research, outreach and validation with key players in the industry.  It outlines how we use cryptography and blockchain concepts to not only impart trust into the ad tech supply chain, but also eliminate fraud, and create a new foundation for advertising in the era of the Internet of Things.  We’re super excited to share it with the community and look forward to hearing your feedback.  3/ THE WATCHGRAPH: Our Watchgraph, a creative new mechanism that imparts trust and governance into the ad tech supply chain, is now patent pending. Full detail about the watchgraph can be found in our whitepaper (https://madnetwork.com/whitepaper).  The Watchgraph applies key tenets of decentralization to ad tech in a truly innovative way.  It’s a revolutionary new concept, and has been incredibly well received by the major agencies, TV manufacturer OEMs, and data companies. The first use case of the token will be implemented through our partner Madhive: By leveraging MAD Networks technology, TV OEMs and supply partners will be able to secure the identity / owner of the household of the TV, as well as the publisher, and commit to data quality. This enables OTT ad sales to be purchased in a completely private manner. We are under an NDA as to the details, but I am happy to share with members of the community as details emerge.  4/ ADLEDGER UPDATES: AdLedger, the nonprofit consortium of which MAD Network is a founding member, continues to grow and lead the industry forward in its mission to build cohesive rules and standards for the application of blockchains and cryptography to media and advertising. Every major advertising agency is on board, and Brave recently announced their membership: https://oracletimes.com/basic-attention-tokens-bat-brave-browser-joins-ibm-founded-adledger/  5/ UPCOMING AMA ON TELEGRAM: MAD Network Chief Scientist, Aaron Brown, and I will host a Telegram AMA on May 7 from 7 to 8PM EST. We’d like to use the AMA as an opportunity to engage directly with our community, respond to questions, share insights, and offer a clear view into the work being done at MAD Network. We look forward to hearing from everyone!  MAD Network’s mission will take real work - especially in this bear economy. We are ready and facing these challenges head-on, helping bring change to an industry that does not always easily accept it. We continue making great strides, institutionalizing new ideas and bringing together the right people to act as agents of change.  We are here to answer your questions and always appreciate feedback from our community. Thank you for your continued support.

If I search for 'Lipitor' (a drug used to treat high cholesterol,) a fast food company can target me. I don’t think that’s something anyone would knowingly consent to.'""",False

If you haven't yet seen it, be sure to check out this article on MediaPost titled Omnicom, MAD Network Test Ad Blockchain Platform!  Omnicom Media Group (OMG) is partnering with the MAD Network, a blockchain and cryptography solutions company, on a blockchain proof-of-concept project.  CryptoRTB claims to be first in the market to leverage a distributed, immutable ledger (blockchain) with additional cryptographic technology to solve the problem of “garbage in, garbage out.” Most current Blockchain projects invite companies to track whether something happened. However, writing fake or bad data to a blockchain doesn’t make it true or trustworthy.  MAD’s platform adds additional cryptography to let actors know if the data is true or false. This added innovation will impart the value to authenticate a campaign’s performance, as well as its targeting data, then leveraging blockchain, will create an immutable record.  Check out the rest of the article here: https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/325383/omnicom-mad-network-test-ad-blockchain-platform.html   MAD Network, a blockchain and cryptography solutions company for the advertising industry, today announced that it is partnering with Omnicom Media Group, the media services division of Omnicom Group, Inc (NYSE: OMC) on a cryptography-based advertising proof-of-concept (POC), dubbed CryptoRTB. The CryptoRTB test activation was initially unveiled on a panel at DMEXCO including MAD Network founder and CEO Adam Helfgott and Omnicom Media Group Chief Research Officer Jonathan Steuer, moderated by Gabe Greenberg, CEO of Gabbcon.  CryptoRTB, which has been designed to provide cost transparency for advertisers, optimize media weight per dollar spent and eliminate waste from the value chain, will be tested by an Omnicom Media Group EMEA client. The activation aims to deliver a better understanding of the full and complete source and costs of all inventory and data in a transparent and fraud free supply chain.

And we’re proud to say we walked away from Cannes with tons of support and many budding partnerships.

Privacy in advertising is new. Re-engineering advertising with privacy-by-design is not something that will happen overnight - but will be the result of thousands of man-hours of coding, research, experimentation, testing and iteration by the team.   We’ve got new technical publications coming out in the next couple weeks which will give you insight into our technical approach and thinking.  But that doesn’t mean there’s no code ready. We’re also planning to open source some of the cryptographic libraries we’ve developed that are critical for privacy. We believe these are a much needed addition to the blockchain community at large. Since privacy is a huge problem to tackle, and we want to encourage as much development with our code as possible, we’re busy vetting it before publication!  Please don’t underestimate how critical the partnerships formed and reinforced at events like Cannes Lions are for success - both in business and for product development! To build great product you need to collaborate with your market - and that’s exactly what we’re doing!  Based on the relationships we’ve forged at events around the world, we have a new partnership in the works with major publishers and the largest blockchain consortium for advertising to begin selling inventory to brands through the MAD Network. Like all good things, it’s not going to all come together overnight - but we hope to have more news towards the end of the summer.  Very, very exciting stuff!  We’ll let the community know in this channel as soon as we publish our new papers and code. Stay tuned - and thank you again for your patience.",False

Instead of customers’ data be held in a centralized data store, MAD allows their data to be stored completely on their own devices. By leveraging their data locally, MAD can pull in the best ads for each individual at the right time, in the right context, delivering the best possible advertising experience. Over the next year the MAD token will be integrated into the Madhive suite of products - aka advertisers will be able to pay for ad buys using Madhive in MAD token!  The Advertisers can stake MAD token to create an insertion order (IO), which is a smart contract that specifies how ads should be executed.  Madhive has tons of brand equity in the advertising and media world, our key markets. So it’s important we transition that equity slowly and intentionally. We are starting to transition MadHive’s brand equity over to MAD Network in a big way at Cannes Lions this year. We’re also in the process of tweaking both brands to visually reflect each other more.  You can visit our website here: https://madnetwork.com/",False

At MAD, we focus our time, energy, and brain power on building a new protocol for the advertising industry... and A TON of progress has been made.  As everyone with an interest in cryptocurrency knows, there are a lot of projects who make extremely bold claims and unrealistic goals simply to boost the price of their token. We don’t do that here. We understand there is frustration in the community regarding MAD Token, but we believe in the long term success of our project. This team has what it takes to revolutionize the advertising industry - but as we’ve said many times, it will not happen overnight. It will take not only hours and hours of coding, but also partnerships with the right industry players to make it work!  We have critical partnerships under our belt already, with more to come. New papers and documentation are coming soon. And we have dozens of conferences booked to spread the word and educate the market about MAD. So for those of you in it to win it, buckle up, the ride has just begun.  As our friend Jarrod Dicker, CEO of The Po.et Project, said yesterday, “ It’s the quietest projects that competitors should be most concerned about. Especially now. Less talking means more listening and more building. The quiet, focused projects of today will be the loudest in terms of usability, utility and user base tomorrow.” We couldn’t agree more.  We love discussing advertising, blockchain, or what tech we plan to implement, because we’re ad tech nerds. We rarely get questions like this from our community and urge you guys to ask about these important things as opposed to the same old questions about topics we can’t legally answer.  Want to help shape the future of ad tech?  Bring the ideas!  We’d love support from the community about the meat of our project!  “Meet the MAD Team: Gabe Greenberg”  Our latest, “Meet the MAD Team” blog features Gabe Greenberg, a member of MAD’s Advisory Board.

Rather, the ad server supports an ecosystem of miners who are incentivized to create faster, more efficient machine learning algorithms to win the block.  MADnet Core is the ad server designed to execute buying and selling of advertising. MADnet Core will be powered by our proof-of-real-work algorithm, which combs through ad requests and campaigns to find fast feasible matches, maximizing throughput simultaneously ensuring campaigns deliver and inventory gets monetized. Feasible matches are defined as pairings of individual ad requests to campaigns that meet all publisher and advertiser rules including real time restrictions such as frequency caps and industry separation.

Blockchain can offer a great deal of value to the ad industry without tokenization, but it is the token that really brings that potential to the next level. Tokens represent an intent to do a deal, and they represent value within the marketplace. By staking tokens into a “smart contract” and codifying the deal, both the buyer and the seller benefit. A token economy could flip the market dynamics for the middle layer, making it more profitable to actually serve the interest of buyers and sellers, which is not always the case today. Commodifying the layers in the middle will shift the fee structure from a percentage media spend to a flat fee pricing system. For the buyer, this results in greater reach for the cost, while publishers actually lower the margin compression which currently plagues the digital advertising ecosystem. The buyer gets to understand exactly how much budget they have left to spend in any given quarter, while the seller gets paid faster.

The MAD Network will be comprised of multiple blockchain layers including a payment rail and a proof-of-real-work blockchain.  The MAD Network is a direct response to the “disappearing ad dollar,” a pervasive industry problem that leaves publishers with less than 40 cents of every advertising dollar spent. The remaining value is absorbed by intermediaries who collect rent by entrenching themselves as the only bridge between advertisers and publishers.  Blockchain technology removes the need for trusted intermediaries by enabling distributed databases that ensure the integrity of their content. By removing trusted intermediaries from the equation, the MAD Network will push more value to the advertisers and publishers — the beginning and end points of the ad tech supply chain.",False
