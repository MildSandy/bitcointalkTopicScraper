So today ONSTELLAR is announcing the Alpha release will happen on Wednesday, April 25, 2018!   That’s next Wednesday, less than 1 week away!   What does Alpha release mean? The Alpha release contains several features of ONSTELLAR platform in a form that anyone can use and help test. This testing, guided by the ONSTELLAR QA team, helps us target and identify bugs. When these bugs are fixed, we make a Beta release available. A Beta release is code-complete and bears a very strong resemblance to the final release. By participating in the Alpha, you can help check that the things that are important to the community are working.  Every bug you find and report doesn't just help you, it helps improve the experience of the entire ONSTELLAR community worldwide.   What will this release do? Our goal in the Alpha release is to showcase the look and feel of the platform and allow you to engage you with other members in a real-time, rich experience. ONSTELLAR members will be able to directly connect with each other with the click of a button.  Make no mistake, our Alpha version will come with many features you have come to expect in leading social media platforms such as profile pages, messaging, channels, groups, events, mobile friendly and many other features.   What is not included are things we’ve all come to distrust in the major platforms:  Invasion of privacy, censorship, feed manipulation, tracking, data mining, social experimentation, advertising made to look like real content, etc.    The ONSTELLAR Special Access Program! This Alpha release is not open to the public at-large. Exclusive access to our members who have registered at onstellar.com, will receive a special invitation email which includes a confirmation code allowing exclusive access to begin using and participating in this very first release of ONSTELLAR.  The next email you receive will include your invitation and confirmation code to  the Alpha, where your unique code provides special “members only” access.   Thanks for your amazing support and we look forward to seeing you on the platform!     Sincerely,   The ONSTELLAR team",False
