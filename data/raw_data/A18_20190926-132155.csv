Advisors Chris Mair: Mair is a founding partner and the key architect at DADI, a decentralized web services platform. He has worked as the head of digital at Diesel for more than four years.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of Apollo18.  Risks     Given the current state of the market, it might take some time to make a profit from any mining operation than one would initially expect. (-1)     Any ICO investor should be extremely cautious of mining ICOs as historically speaking they tend to be scam projects. (-1)  Growth Potential     Mining facilities are located in Altoona, Pennsylvania where the electricity rate is quite cheap. This means that the cost will be lower, and the dividends will be slightly higher. (+3)     The teamâ€™s putting emphasis on efficient mining by following global data centersâ€™ footsteps shows how serious they are. (+1.5)     By using 75% of token sale proceeds, the team is planning to scale up by buying more hardware miners. Once they achieve a critical point of scaling, they will be able to get a much lower rate for electricity, implying lower costs and higher payout for token owners. (+2)  Disposition The introduction of ASIC miners has changed the cryptocurrency market a lot as it has pushed people without these devices outside of the mining game. Even if one can afford to buy an ASIC device, this does not mean that he or she should expect solid returns on investments as it highly depends on the electricity rate for these devices use huge amounts of electricity. For people living in areas where the electricity rate is high, it is extremely hard or perhaps impossible to make a profit. Because of all of these issues, a need for mining ICOs has arisen. By participating in such ICOs, one basically lends his or her money to someone else, so the project owner can use these funds to buy miners and run facilities. Apollo18 is such a project based in Central Pennsylvania where the electric rate is quite cheap. Once the operation commences, they will pay their token owners dividends proportional to the amount of tokens they hold every month. Upon scaling, they should be able to get electricity at a lower rate, implying lower costs and higher payouts. Apollo18 receives a 4.5/10.

Apollo18 is a mining operation based in Central Pennsyvania. A combination of competitive electricity rates and the use of hot/cold aisles makes Apollo18 the most EFFICIENT mining operation in the GALAXY. Apollo18 aims to continue innovating and evolving while securing the blockchain and rewarding investors.  The A18 Token  The Apollo18 Token (A18) is an ERC-20 based token built and issued on the Ethereum blockchain. The token represents a portion of the total hashing power of the mining farm. A18 tokens will be required to receive payouts from the Apollo18 miners. Token holders will be able to easily store and manage tokens using existing infrastructure such as MyEtherWallet and Trust Wallet among others. Pre-sale and Public sale tokens will be released immediately post-ICO. The total cap of Apollo18 was 24mil, however, after restructuring and performing token burns, we expect the cap to be approximately 10,000,000.    Dividends Upon successful scaling and launch of the Apollo18 miners, token holders will begin receiving monthly dividend payments in the form of Ethereum (ETH) tokens. Coins mined by the Apollo18 miners will be converted to Ethereum (ETH) directly. If this is not possible, the mined coins will be converted to Bitcoin (BTC) and then converted to ETH. The resulting ETH will be the earnings distributed to token holders less operational costs. In addition, in order to stimulate growth, 10% of earnings will be reinvested back into the expansion of the Apollo18 Silos resulting in larger payouts and more growth. The remaining Ethereum tokens will be distributed to A18 token holders via the dividend-paying smart contract. The smart contract will distribute this ETH to token holders respective to the amount of Apollo18 tokens the investor is holding.  We have seen other companies in the past promise returns of over 400% or more. This is wrong and misleading. As market volatility is high and mining difficulties are constantly fluctuating, Apollo18 is reluctant to promise any official ROI percentage. Apollo18 will provide all historical data throughout the lifetime of the project for current and prospective investors to review and evaluate their positions.  Currently, during the downtrend, we are seeing an average of 75%-80% ROI.   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Why Apollo18? Vision We believe that infrastructure buildout is imperative in order for blockchain technologies and applications to continue as a viable option.  We believe that additional research and development is needed in order to produce hardware that is efficiently scalable to keep up with the growth of blockchain technologies. The future of cryptocurrency mining needs to be distributed and geared towards the original visions of decentralization. Apollo18â€™s goal is to return the power back to the people by lowering the barrier of entry, innovating more efficient mining methodologies, and ultimately, empowering the community.  Unique Selling Proposition Apollo18 is contributing to the blockchain infrastructure by implementing scalable mining units built on the industry tested data server models. We continue to enhance the server mining hardware through the research and development of dedicated hardware.  Lowest price for energy in the United States. Apollo18 is located in a region of the United State with base residential electric rates between 5-6 cents/KWh. This rate is nearly half the rate of lowest state rate average. Upon scaling, Apollo18 may be eligible for local industrial rates of 1.7 cents/KWh. Industry tested infrastructure. The Apollo18 Silos are configured to reflect, and improve upon, the setups utilized by giants in the tech industry today. These tested configurations provide highly effective models for cooling systems. Efficient. Apollo18 has implemented the most efficient GPU mining infrastructure per square foot. Mining farms we have visited in the past average approximately 8 GPUs per 3 sq. ft. Apollo18â€™s configuration compares at approximately 8 GPUs per 1 sq. ft. Upon scaling, GPU density increases compared to traditional mining farms.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Mission Crew      ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Social Media/Resources Website: https://apollo18.co.in Whitepaper: https://apollo18.co.in/assets/pdf/whitepaper.pdf E-Mail: contact@apollo18.co.in Facebook:  https://facebook.com/apollo18crypto/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/apollo18crypto Discord: https://discord.gg/TvYWynn Telegram: https://t.me/apollo18crypto Reddit: https://reddit.com/r/apollo18 YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0cPmc-ewOlkc14n3FpYJmA",False
