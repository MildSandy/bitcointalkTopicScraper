In case a person sends funds from an un-verified wallet - these funds will be returned immediately to the sender using smart-contract. A more detailed description how this will work is here:  - users download the app; - fills personal data about them such as e-mail and verifies it (this is needed in order to be able to later on contact contributor if there is need for additional information); - takes photo of the ID documents and themselves; - when the authenticity of the person is verified, watch-list checks performed and face-matching done - identity is considered to be verified; - person then links the identity with the wallet address; - when a person transfer then funds from a wallet smart-contract checks if it is linked to a verified identity. If it is not, then funds are returned.

Before launching ICO Pass our team has worked on Latvian Government ID architecture and e-signature solution. At that time the only allowed way for government institution to login and sign electronic documents was using ID card and a special purpose reader. Due to the cumbersome experience only 1% of the Latvian population was using it. Therefore we developed a new web based solution for signing legally binding documents that increased the number of active users significantly. At that time this was the first solution in Europe that allowed to sign electronic documents without ID card. The reason why I am writing is that at our company we know how important is security, however if it gets too cumbersome for users, nobody will use it. That is why at ICO Pass as well we have come up with several ways how to make the user experience great:  - payment for the service can be done through in-app purchase, removing friction what happens when a person has to manually type in credit card data. - input from the person is reduced to minimum - persons takes photo of their identity document and themselves via the phone. Then all the identity verification and checking Sanction lists is happening automatically. If it cannot identify a person by one method it uses another one until there is a high confidence that the person is not involved in illicit activities. - even such a thing as a linking wallet with identity address is made super simple.  And while we try to make everything as automated as possible, we are also able to reduce costs.",False

It is not only important for end-users to have a smooth user experience. It also applies to ICO organizers that are doing KYC. For them what we have done is:  - ICO organizer has a dashboard with the information about their contributors and what is the status with their verification. In case where it is not possible to determine the identity of a person or for some reason person shows up in any of the Sanction lists, ICO organizer can contact the person in order to clear the doubts (during identity verification we also collect contact information of the person); - As the identity is linked to the wallet, we can see that a sum that is transferred to an ICO organizer's comes from an un-verified wallet. In that case the funds are returned automatically to the sender.  These are just few of the things that we tried to make as simple as possible. We truly believe that doing as much automation as possible is the best scenario. It is not only convenient for all parties but can reduce costs for the service. And that is also something what European Securities Authorities are encouraging for user identification.",False

In a Nutshell it works like this: the price starts high and then lowers until all tokens are sold.  This is not a uncommon way to do it. The U.S. Treasury uses a Dutch auction to sell its securities. To help finance the USA’s debt, the US Treasury holds regular auctions to sell Treasury bills (T-bills), notes (T-notes), and bonds (T-bonds), collectively known as Treasuries. Prospective investors submit bids electronically through TreasuryDirect or the Treasury Automated Auction Processing System (TAAPS) which accepts bids up to 30 days in advance of the auction.  Google opted for a Dutch auction to earn a fair price on its public offering. Prospective buyers submitted bids based on the number of desired shares and what they were willing to pay for them. After the auction ended, underwriters sifted through bids to determine the minimum price they would accept and landed on an IPO of $85 per share.  To our mind, the Dutch auction is a straightforward way to establish the true fair market price for an ICOP, ensuring participants are aware of what they are getting in return.  Having looked into smart contracts used in Dutch auctions, we found the type used for Polkadot’s ICO to be the most suitable. It is tried and tested and the result speaks for itself, with a lower level of risk involved for us and potential contributors. As we are going to use smart contract, there is no need to wait for everyone to submit their offer. Bidders can see the price upfront. The sale will start with an initial 15% ETH bonus for the first hour. For example, a 100 ETH purchase in the first hour will cost 115 ETH a day later for the same number of ICOP tokens. For every period where 2 blocks are confirmed without new contributors, the early participation bonus will drop by 1 percentage point. After the 14th drop or 24 hours elapsed (whichever comes first), the early contribution bonus will end. The auction will start with a very high ICOP price and decrease, quickly at first and then more slowly. The initial price will be so high as to make it impossible for anyone to force the sale’s end by buying all the ICOPs immediately.  If bidders feel that the reached price is reasonable and they are ready to commit, they will send ETH to the bidding address, guaranteeing their tokens at the reached price or lower. If done during the bonus period, the smart contract will treat the amount as though it is up to 15% higher than the actual price and allocate ICOPs accordingly.  On each bid the smart contract checks if the total amount bid is enough to buy all ICOPs at the current price. The price will gradually go down from there, and the calculation redone for each bid.  When all ICOPs have sold or the time expires, the auction will end. The ICOP price will be the final price at this point. If all ICOPs were sold or the auction time expires, ICOP price will be calculated by dividing all ETHs transferred with total number of ICOPs available (20 million).

Persons download our app that will be available on February 21st. 2. Then provides details about themselves - name, last name and country of origin, e-mail address. We verify this information using several government and non-government databases. Also we check if the persons are not on any Sanction list or a PEP. Additionally we check if the person is not from countries where Token Sales are not allowed. 3. After that persons take a photo of their ID document. We verify if that it is not a forgery. 4. After that persons are asked to take photo or video of themselves. We do face matching with ID document. 5. After all checks are passed, person transfers a small amount of ETH to identity address displayed in app to link wallet to their identity. ETH sent will be refunded, except gas. 6. When transfer is complete, app offers to link wallet address to identity. This wallet must be used when participating in ICO. Multiple wallet addresses can be linked. 7. After linking person can register for participation in ICO by selecting ICO name from a list or entering address manually. 8. User the is asked for approval to send personal information to selected ICO address. 9. After approval process is complete and app generates encrypted package of personal information, stores it in IPFS. 10. Link to package is sent ICO organiser and encrypted package can only be opened with private key in ICO organiser’s posession.

We will use our adaptive KYC system that analyses different data sources in order to do that with high accuracy. In our experience we have seen three things - people are coming up with fake person identities, they have somehow got personal information about another person and try to impersonate this person or they are forcing a person to use their identity for illegitimate and criminal activities.  The first we are solving by checking if ID documents and passports are not forged. If there are ID documents without safety features, we match personal information about the person with different government and non-government databases.  The second we solve by doing a face matching. We use selfies or videos of a person and match that with ID document.  The third man we solve by looking either at suspicious behaviours in the video or by analysing the audio recording during video session.  And all of that is happening automatically, without need to involve people in the process.",False
