Why we are always sharing GitHub link? Simply cause there is all the information collected in one Smart Contract. We found it more reasonable and convenient, but if it is not clear, then we can share addresses for Etherscan separately. Links Token - 0x7ca936344d234034cf6936472d6bedbe8ae6667f Presale - 0x12a9dd34e8e7412f9e219fd889d23abc02ba0de5 Mainsale - 0x1771e600e72cca46abeab857f301b6bf5a032ca7  Generated tokens amount: logic of our smart contract works the way that tokens are getting generated only when they are bought. When tokens are bought in ETH, then they are generated immediately; when tokens are bought in BTC, LTC or Fiat, tokens will be generated after ICO end. This is the reason why tokens generated amount on website and on Etherscan are different. On the website token amount is total, which are consisting all contributions (ETH, BTC, LTC and fiat).  Our token name is AKAI (AIC). Why we have double name? Our initial ticker for coin is AIC, but when we have been preparing for ICO we found out that there is other company with the same coin ticker. We didn't know will this company go to exchanges or not, therefore we made a back up name as AKAI, cause if they will go with AIC on exchanges (which they definitely have right to do), then we will use AKAI, if no then we definitely will go with AIC.  Smart contract with 200,000,000 tokens is not ours, this contract is generating fake AIC tokens and they are trading on YoBit. We are trying to solve the situation, but unfortunately YoBit is not responding to our requests.",False

I did not expect to get it. I thought that everyone ignored him. Incidentally, this is indicative: in this thread, 90% of the discussions concern the procedural issues of the ICO and only 10% concern the business scheme. I do not know how you feel about this. In my opinion this is not correct. I definitely do not leave this project. I continue to participate in the bounty. I will follow all the news of the project, including this topic. It is very interesting to me. I just will not invest in buying tokens, because for me personally the risks are great. For me this is a very early stage of venture investment. I have faced many times with scientists and engineers, obsessed with their idea, who did not care about the presence or absence of profits. By the way, I do not exclude the purchase of tokens on the stock exchange at a price below the ICO price. So it will be until the project comes to profit. You yourself said ""after 2-5 years"". For me, the crypto currency is not a fetish or value in itself. But I'm not ready to rent a car twice as expensive just because you can pay for it with a crypto currency. You say that I do not want to use the crypto currency. I want to use it but it's not meaningless. Also people who own gold do not run with the desire to rent a room exclusively with payment of gold. Now about what problems lie in your answer. Imagine that independently of you there are several teams obsessed with their ideas. The first team wants to make a platform where customers can buy and sell only for gold. The second team promotes a diamond-based platform. The third team is sure that there is no alternative to the dollar, and therefore builds the platform only on its use. Is it funny? What are their business prospects? Three years later, new computers and networks appear, this leads to the appearance of quantumcurrency and neirocurrency. And there are teams that promote platforms based on them. How are you ready for this? The conclusion is only one: to build a successful business will only be able to do it with low costs and quickly be able to work with all means of payment. Only this will be claimed by the consumer. Your crypto-optimism cloud your view. While you are just moving humanity forward and not building a business.",False

Secondly: sad, that You decided to leave us, but maybe Your path at some point will still bring You to Akaiito.  I personally was already answering to Your questions (if my memory is not so bad yet ), but of course, I will answer on them now as well: 1. Clients for the platform - as I was already saying, Akaiito will be platform for crypto holders. Crypto can not be transferred to fiat (well, can be, but commission cost is enormous), so there is practically no direct connection between real world and crypto. So we want to enable crypto holders to transform their crypto to real products and services. We really do not understand why target group should be more limited? Why we should focus on, lets say, female and male in the age of 20-35 who are interested in sports? Why? Akaiito will include 4 parts, it will be massive platform, where everyone will be able to find for themselves what they are interested in. You are doubting that people will want to spend crypto for products and services? Well, I will not try to try to change Your mind, but if You look a bit further and will see a bigger picture of crypto development, then it is so clear: after 2-5 years, a lot of crypto in digital wallets, a lot of profit made on trading and...? No practical use in real life. All that crypto: You just have it. Well, for us and we believe that for many many people more, it is not good enough. Exchanging crypto for fiat for reasonable commission - won't happen in near future. Exchanging crypto for real life products and services - will happen with Akaiito. 2. It is again the same story as in the first question. If You are not interested in using crypto somehow finally in real life and prefer hold it, trade and look at it in Your wallet - this is Your wish, but there are other people, there are people who feel that it is extremely weird to have something just for having it. 3. We are not saying that it is cheaper or better to use crypto instead of fiat, we are saying, that we want to offer such an option. That is why we don't say that we are competing with fiat platforms. We are offering the tools for using crypto, but not instead of fiat, if You wish so. So in the end I would say, that all Your questions are connected to Your opinion and inner wish: not to use crypto. And it is totally fine, it is Your opinion and actually it can change over time as well. Akaiito team has different vision. We realised, that we do not want to just have crypto and just gain short term profit by trading, what is the outcome for the real life? Just having it? Not agree, not good enough, want to change it! And there are more people thinking like we and there will be more and more with every year. It is the new wave, which will hit soon and we will be there for it. Crypto is transforming, it needs to spread and get real life connection to be able to develop to new financial system. If not, we will be stucked with the same level where we are now for ages. Thank You again for Your opinion! I think we just see some fundamental things differently, so it is not about the real questions or answers, we just have different visions of the big picture and future of crypto world.",False

While I believe that I will not invest and will limit myself to participation in the bounty. Because until now I do not see answers to important questions: 1. Who will be the client of the platform in the near future (buyers and sellers)? I have a strong opinion that a hundred crypto-optimists are doing a project for thousands of crypto-enthusiasts. Who will buy goods / services for crypto currency at an obviously growing rate of it? Most likely this same purchase will be made for Fiat. Imagine that from September to December 2017 (four months) no one buys anything on the platform. But many sellers. And in January-February 2018 no one sells anything, but many would like to buy. The volatility of the crypto currency market will remain its main feature for a long time. Who from the participants of this topic is ready to buy / sell on a regular basis on the platform. One time, many enthusiasts will try, but who will be on a regular basis? 2. What is the convenience of the buyer? the site said ""The idea of AKAIITO is to be a platform that is as user-friendly as possible."" It looks like it's just a declaration. Why take a car for rent for a crypto currency, if you can fill it only for Fiat. If the platform operated with crypto currency and Fiat and at the time of purchase would choose the best option, then this convenience. 3. What is the advantage of the platform? why buy and sell here is more profitable (cheaper, faster, better)? Fate money will not disappear for a long time. Everyone will face a choice to buy / sell for crypt or fiat. It is unlikely that there will be a completely new class of sellers working only with crypt and providing unprecedented competitiveness of goods / services. Due to what? Why rent a car for bitkoyn cheaper than a dollar?  I did not write this novel in order to offend anyone. I myself am a crypto optimist, but apparently more restrained than the developers. I want answers to these questions in order to make a decision and invest to the end of the ICO. I do not want to write in the Wiki: ""AKAIITO made the first attempt to switch to complex use of real-world crypto in real life, and they got a lot of experience in solving many related problems that are still used by market leaders."" However, the company itself did not survive the transition period "" I would not want the absolute enthusiasm and confidence in the future of blocking technologies to leave the essence of the business idea in the background.

For example: one Akaiito user will sell to another Akaiito user, one Akaiito user will rent a car from another Akaiito user and etc. All the relations on the platform will be user to user. 2. Online Map: on that part of Akaiito will be shown map (depending on choice of country and city of Your location) all the places, where it is possible to pay with cryptocurrency. Payment system in those places is already up to them, we will just guide You where payments with crypto are accepted.

Usually the problem is, that there are more sellers, than buyers and buyers are starting to drop the prices to attract more buyers. In AIC token case we believe, that there will be situation of the ""want to have, need to have"", so to speak. All the transactions on Akaiito will be functioning with AIC token, so basically users will want to have it, to be a part of the community, what will create ""need moment"". Plus, we have a lot of plans for the future development, what will definitely strengthen the currency. Regarding bancor integration: Yes, we are looking into it as well, cause it can simplify interaction between user and smart contract on platform. Thank You! ",False

What come to AIC token liquidity and how we can avoid it: As You know, liquidity is happening when there is imbalance of buyers and sellers and this can create dramatic swings in price of currency on the market. Usually the problem is, that there are more sellers, than buyers and buyers are starting to drop the prices to attract more buyers. In AIC token case we believe, that there will be situation of the ""want to have, need to have"", so to speak. All the transactions on Akaiito will be functioning with AIC token, so basically users will want to have it, to be a part of the community, what will create ""need moment"". Plus, we have a lot of plans for the future development, what will definitely strengthen the currency.   Thank You! Best regards, Akaiito",False
