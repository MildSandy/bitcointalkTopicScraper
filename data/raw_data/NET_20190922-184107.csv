There are many more stuff compromised to enable the ""magic"" of browser blockchain. For instance, 90%+ of miners are using the nano/pico consensus which means they can get trickered if an attacker is making a fork with K (where k is the security constant of the last k blocks verified). If an attacker is making a 50%+1 attack of the network for K blocks, all pico/nano miners which are most, will get compromised also. I don't remember exactly the value of K, but I remember it was 120 blocks (like 2 hours). Making 50%+1 for 2 hours and you own the ENTIRE network unless they do a hard fork to reject the new Account Tree with new balances. Look. Nimiq nazi, we are not that stupid at all.

Just goes to show how amazing the Nimiq community is and how quickly it grows.  It may be slow going to get people interested, but once they start to see what Nimiq can do and talk with the community they usually stay for good.  I hope we'll see more merchants that aren't as dev/tech heavy notice Nimiq so they can see how easy Nimiq is to use!  Quote from: Nimiq on June 20, 2019, 06:55:39 PM Quote from: Scamiq on June 20, 2019, 06:24:08 PM I will add that Nimiq team is not capable of generating its own partnerships. All Nimiq's existing partnerships were formed by outside parties coming to them. In that way Nimiq is like a freeloader that accepts free shit from other people, but is incapable of providing enough value to initiate partnerships it desires itself. To be clear, this means that all existing exchanges which Nimiq is on was a result of the exchange coming to Nimiq, but if Nimiq initiates the contact with an exchange e.g. Bittrex, the exchange is not interested since Nimiq is not bringing much value to the table itself. I hope I make myself clear.  Everything you say is not true and can be debated easily   - What about Bidali? Contacted by us. - What about Changelly? Contacted by us. - What about ChangeHero? Contacted by us. - What about KuCoin? If you think they reached us to list NIM... then that's a compliment and an honor. But to be honest we contacted them. - And TrustWallet? Contacted by NIMIQ COMMUNITY   I love how proud the Nimiq Team is of the community and that they are exactly right:  Both the team and community are making constant efforts to bring Nimiq to the masses, whether it's reaching out to influencers/potential users, creating use cases, contacting exchanges, accepting NIM in their store, etc...",False

This is how Nimiq Identicons look:    There is a reason why they are so cheerful and different between each other. You can try them out here.  Each Nimiq Identicon has five different elements, bottoms, faces, sides, tops body, and background color. Each element has a distinctive color. In total, identicons are made up of a combination of:  21 bottoms 21 faces 21 sides 21 tops 8 colors for parts 9 body colors 10 background colors  That means there are 10 * 9 * 8 * 21⁴ = 140,026,320 different identicons that can be generated, so Nimiq is capable of generating more than 100 million highly differentiated and instantly recognizable identicons. This protect users against malware and clipboard hijacking.  If a Nimiq user is subject to a clipboard hijacking attack and the malware replaces the Nimiq address on the clipboard with an account address controlled by the attacker, then the user will paste this fraudulent address into the send field and the receiving addresses identicon will be shown instantly. If you are sending NIM to a friend and you see an identicon different from their usual one, then you instantly know that someone has launched a clipboard hijacking attack against you.  Nimiq is not the only blockchain with itenticons. This how Ethereum's identicons look:    Not so nice and easy to identify.

Identicons are a way to visualize addresses and provide an extra layer of protection to users. The address is derived using BIP44 which is a standard among cryptocurrencies. You are clearly trying to confuse address derivation with identicon generation.  According to you, this is the vulnerability.  1- Hacker has to guess who I am going to send NIM to. Nimiq Identicon Protection   2- Hacker tries to find an identicon that looks the same as the recipient he had to guess before. And hopes that's the one recipient I actually use. Nimiq Identicon Protection   3- Hacker infects my device with clipboard hijacking. All cryptocurrencies are vulnerable 4- Hacker executes clipboard hijacking and hopes I don't check the address. All cryptocurrencies are vulnerable   When compared to other cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin or Ethereum), Nimiq provide steps from 1 and 2 as an extra layer of protection without adding complexity to the user. After that Nimiq is just like another cryptocurrency.  So your point is either:  - Nimiq provides more security to users than other cryptocurrencies   - You have a feud against all cryptocurrencies   - You have a feud with Nimiq and are just making up BS to confuse users  ",False

Thanks for the addition dear friend.  Nano Nodes Nano Nodes are the preferred node type for Browser Clients, since they require less data to be downloaded (~ 2MB) in order to establish consensus.  Similar to light nodes, they determine the current state of the blockchain using NIPoPoW, but then only download block headers and the minimal amount of information related to its own accounts. Once the correct state has been worked out, i.e. consensus established, account balances can be cryptographically proven to this type of node.  Pico Nodes Similar to the Nano Node, the Pico Node uses the Accounts Tree and account proofs. But instead of syncing block headers using NiPoPoW, it will first test if all its peers are on the same head hash (or a neighboring hash) and, if that is the case, it will accept that head as the correct one. This is also referred to as an optimistic approach. Only if it receives incompatible head hashes will it fall back on the nano consensus.  The pico consensus is the latest development and is expected to replace the nano consensus as new default as soon as it’s fully established.",False

When, nimiq foundation will get bankrupt (so far they burned over 8 million dollar from their initial 12 million dollar ICO), they will most likely write a medium post saying: ""we are sorry, nobody is buying the nimiq coin. So, we have to press the killswitch suspending the nimiq network as we became bankrupt"". Remember, they stated that the burning rate of the nimiq was over 250,000 A MONTH.

Simple answer. Cuz nimiq is a scam as well. They do everything to be in control manipulating the price buying coins from the market. Listing themselves on big exchanges, means that they will have to manipulate the price on other exchanges as well, increasing their burning rate dramatically as they would have to deploy trading bots and  buy more coins from more exchanges as well.

Tell me please I checked at coinmarketcap nimiq rank is 459 Hope team make some announcement to move price go up again. The only thing so we can get a movement for the price is, pump and dump group. But, its likely impossible due to the people telling scam and scam everywhere.  Not even the P&D people are buying this coin. Do you know who are the only people buying this shitcoin? The nimiq foundation itself. It is buying its own tokens from the exchanges to manipulate the price and keep the price afloat. I am just curious of how many funds do they still have. I bet they have less than 3 million dollar right now.",False

Thus the action that diluted the shares was not Nimiqs investment. You also claim that WEG Bank inflated its shares which is not true either. WEG Bank increased their equity from 6.5M EUR to 8.58M EUR on Dec 21, 2018. The decision to do so (according to record in german company register) happened on their general assembly on Nov 13, 2018. As far as we know from Nimiq, they first met WEG Bank CEO during their hackathon end of November, thus the increase in equity was planned before Nimiq and WEG Bank CEO met first. Also I doubt that Nimiq was owning the shares early January as they didn't mention anything related during their AmA when they gave details on their assets. In the blog post on Jan 24 they also did not mention the shares, but wrote that ""Nimiq holds approximately $9.1 million in total assets from original ETH contributions (diversified and held in crypto, fiat, and the campus property)"", which implies they didn't own any company shares at that point (or these shares were on top of the $9.1M, which is unlikely IMO). My best guess is that they developed Nimiq OASIS and only acquired the shares afterwards, maybe even as a compensation for developing the OASIS protocol (they never wrote they bought, they only wrote acquired).  Long story short: You are trying to connect two things that are completely unrelated. The WEG Bank increased their equity to serve more customers on Nov 12, 2018, diluting the shares of TokenPay. Nimiq bought shares of WEG Bank at some point after Jan 24, 2019.  You have a record of provably invalid claims and lies using your multiple fake accounts. You never contributed anything of value to this thread.   Quote from: Scamiq on May 20, 2019, 08:51:44 AM WEG bank still? I thought it's Agora bank soon.

Font of page title does not match other UI elements. 2. Does not display lock symbol on https URL. 3. IP address country flag shows china, but GitHub does not host in china. 4. Scrollbar is scrolled all up, but we are missing the top bar and search bar of the GitHub website which would be visible when scrolled all up. 5. Similar to 4: The GitHub page would ensure a proper padding on the left if scrolled all left. 6. We cannot see the window title (why?) but you can see that it is way longer than the tab title (which is what would be displayed in the window title). 7. The font in the URL bar is way smaller than the one in the search bar. I guess you reduced size so that the full URL matches in the URL bar, but normal browsers won't do that.  tl;dr: You screenshot is provably a fake. You claimed it's not even when directly confronted with it, so you are lying. Same as you did when you claimed you don't use multiple alt accounts even after I gathered proof that you do.",False

Name any other crypto currency organization which goes so far to publish financial details. I don't know any, no matter how large or small they are. So why should Nimiq Foundation improve here when they already take a prime spot? I guess your expectation are a bit off to ask them for more transparency, given that they already are more transparent than most other in our field.   2. Clarifications on questions like Cannabis Usage / Addiction What exactly is your question? Who in the team has which medication schedule? In most countries in the world, discrimination based on medical conditions is illegal and details on medical conditions are private data protected by law. Are you asking them to do something illegal?   3. Why did they hide the Robin Linus cannabis addiction lying the entire community? Show me when they lied about addiction. Also I think drug addiction of employees or any person in general should never be made public if the person agrees to get proper treatment (which apparently happened in this case).   4. Why top 3 Developers who are paid with over 100,000 USD per year didn't work in the last 3 months. Developer salaries are not public information, so you actually can't know them. Also the details what they are working on are not public information, so you also can't say they are not working....   5. Price manipulation and trading bots.

The timing of pursuing such decisions is also determined by project development. If Nimiq were to simply add more exchanges without increasing the penetration of NIM then this could spread the total volume over more platforms which is not advantageous to stakeholders.

There is no Trading Bot being used. As we answered in our AMA: ""We did provide funds for market making on HitBTC in an initial test phase through a partner."" This was when Nimiq was listed in HitBTC, September last year. Don't see how this is relevant more than half a year later. 2. That is not true, Nimiq has not bought any NIM to fund projects recently. So far only one project has received the funding they requested. That project is GetNIM, they were funded for 1 Million NIM. All information from Community Funding Board is published publicly in Nimiq's Blog. 3. That is also not true, the project doesn't buy a monthly fixed amount of NIM. We did confirm that Team Nimiq received part of their salaries in NIM which is something that you would expect from a cryptocurrency project. 4. No, that value is made up. Yes, Nimiq recently announced the project has acquired 9.9% WEG Bank. There was no mention of the amount in the announcent. However we did confirm Nimiq did not payed in NIM. Why acquire part of a crypto project would acquire stake in a Bank?: As a result of this partnership and acquisition, Nimiq OASIS will be able to leverage the SEPA Instant banking network through WEG Bank. This means that the combination of Nimiq OASIS, Agora.Trade and WEG Bank could enable customers at any of the 2,000+ banks in the SEPA Instant network to exchange value between crypto and fiat systems. The SEPA Instant network currently connects the majority of EU countries including Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. 5. No, this is not true. This value is just another assumption without any real information.  This user, as always, is just making stuff up to try to damage the reputation of Nimiq because of a second agenda. This user even went to the point of creating another thread to spread lies about WEG Bank. He got an answer from the CEO of WEG Bank. Curious to see his answer:  Quote from: WEG Bank AG on April 04, 2019, 04:16:30 PM Dear ""nimiqshitcoin"",  please allow me to introduce myself.

Under normal circumstances, I would not even credit your outburst of negativity with an answer. However, you have brought such amusement to my day that I only feel it fitting to return the favour. I hereby cordially invite you to visit us in our head quarters in Ottobrunn, which is just to the south of Munich. We will fly you to Munich from wherever you might be, grant you a one night stay in a luxury hotel and give you the opportunity to ask any questions you may have in a one hour time slot with me personally. We can gladly go through the accounts of the bank or any other documentation you would like to see. You will be meeting the team, have lunch with us and then be flown back to where you want.  Of course, speaking of having lunch: There is no such thing as a free lunch as we all know. In return for our generous invitation, you will consent to us filming your entire visit and to uploade it on youtube. You will also need to provide adequate proof, that you are in fact ""nimiqshitcoin"".  I am very much looking forward to your reply.  Sincerely  Matthias von Hauff    Anyone interested in answers can join Nimiq Telegram group and discuss with Real Users. Team Nimiq is transparent and community driven as any real user from the community can confirm. It is easy for users to see through the  lies and assumptions of these FUDERS.

Also in the very first line ""Betreff"" uses antialiasing but ""RE: INFO"" doesn't. Oh and the subject in the bold subject line is ""RE:INFO"" and in the first line is ""RE: INFO"" (with additional space). All-in-all a pretty bad fake screenshot, maybe put some more energy in it next time you want to prove your FUD with a fake screenshot....  Great job dissecting the fake screen shot. I'm sure he'll do a better job next time! These guys are not just casual Fudders but actually dedicated by investing time and effort into it.    I do feel bad for you guys. Earlier when you guys complained about it in Reputation as them being fudders, I disagreed, but now I'm completely on your side. You're being hounded by some exceptionally vocal and idiotic trolls. The only thing you can do is report the posts with HUGE RED FONT for trolling, unfortunately.  I reported one just now as trolling is against the official forum rules. If it gets deleted, then I would say its a good tactic for dealing with them in the future. If enough of their posts get deleted for trolling, you can bet they'll also be banned.

That means apps based on Nimiq can run directly in the browser of the user, locally, without the need of a server-side application.

Team Nimiq has answered here their non-factual claims. Also held a live Reddit AMA session recently where all questions were answered. There is also a blog post with a  summary of the AMA.  Nimiq welcome all newcomers, invite them to ask questions, and would like to apologize for these users behavior and any inconvenience they might cause.",False

From what I see on bitcointalk nimiq found its only partnership two companies with really shady history and background.  1. Agora trade which is solely focused is to do an ICO. They don't have anything else in mind, just pushing their agenda with ICO and raise funds from other people scamming them investing into another worthless crypto project.  2. WEG Bank - which is a god damn shady bank with no products, no service and of course no customers. Just remember that WEG Bank partnered up with TokenPay another well known ICO scam which got over 20 million in funding promising things that they have never delivered. They just uploaded a fork of POSv3 with nothing else. The explorer is not showing any anonymous transaction, etc. They also promise something that doesn't exist.  The shit is going nuts now. Don't forget Robin Linus which clearly started that nimiq was turned into a scam by his colleagues. This behavior makes me believe that they are just milking the ico for their own profits.",False

So in Albatros it's actually not 51%, but 34%, because the security assumption is that at most one third (of selected block producers) is Byzantine. Haven't heard that, can you provide a proof that 51% is 34%? There is no 51% attack, that's just a stupid saying from PoW chains. What usually is meant by 51% attack is double-spend attack or selfish mining attacks. For those attacks, attackers on PoW chains need about 51% of mining power (well, you can do with less than 51%, but then you need luck). As far as I understood, PBFT needs 67% for double-spend, no? And selfish mining is not an issue in Albatross as there is no mining at all. From what I understood, the thing you can do with 34% in PBFT is to halt the protocol. This attack will cause your 34% stake to become worth nothing and can be resolved by all other stakers through a collaborative fork. So the effect is limited and you don't earn anything from it (= no incentive to perform), definitely not comparable to a 51% attack on PoW chains.    stupid marvin suckpuppet  Quote  SoerenLast Wednesday at 11:58 AM In Albatros it's actually not 51%, but 34%, because the security assumption is that at most one third (of selected block producers) is Byzantine.   abatros is vulnerable to 33% to get hacked for good.

Are you buying ETH at that price or is it just a made up number that has no meaning at all?   1 NIM ICO PRICE = 0.000057 ETH = $0,015428571  Lie. 0.000057 ETH = $0.00785 Proof: https://imgur.com/Csa0RBb   If I had invested $100,000 into NET (NIMIQ ICO), now my tokens after the swap are worth $3,000 from $100K.  Thanks for confirming that you actually didn't invest $100k, which you said before. Another lie debunked. There was no way to invest $100k into NET, as the only currency supported during the ICO was ETH. So it doesn't really make sense to argue what the price is relative to USD. You also don't compare the price of NIM to Tesla shares or Transylvanian housing prices.  Even if your previous numbers were correct and we decide to compare the value of Nimiq to USD, your $3k calculation is still wrong: $100k with 1 NIM @ $0.01542 (*) = ~6.5M NIM $7k with 1 NIM @ $0.001130 = ~6.5M NIM (*) your number, and wrong as pointed out above Thus, even with your made up numbers, you would only be -93%. The correct number without invalid math and made up numbers is -85%, as described above. Also, I only did the calculation to proof your claim invalid and even with your new numbers, you prove your own claim of being -99% with Nimiq invalid. So you successfully debunked your own lie.

So in Albatros it's actually not 51%, but 34%, because the security assumption is that at most one third (of selected block producers) is Byzantine. Haven't heard that, can you provide a proof that 51% is 34%? There is no 51% attack, that's just a stupid saying from PoW chains. What usually is meant by 51% attack is double-spend attack or selfish mining attacks. For those attacks, attackers on PoW chains need about 51% of mining power (well, you can do with less than 51%, but then you need luck). As far as I understood, PBFT needs 67% for double-spend, no? And selfish mining is not an issue in Albatross as there is no mining at all. From what I understood, the thing you can do with 34% in PBFT is to halt the protocol. This attack will cause your 34% stake to become worth nothing and can be resolved by all other stakers through a collaborative fork. So the effect is limited and you don't earn anything from it (= no incentive to perform), definitely not comparable to a 51% attack on PoW chains.

Deutsche Bank AG (Germanys largest bank) lost 735,000,000 euro in 2017.  Either Deutsche Bank is even more a scam bank than WEG Bank or the profit number doesn't matter at all and your proof is worth nothing. I guess it's the second option.... Also, WEG Bank increased their assets from ~30,000,000 euro in 2016 to ~50,000,000 euro in 2017 according to the very same page you used to proof their losses. For me that is +20,000,000 euro of ""profit"" in 2017. I guess you intentionally left out this little detail (as usual) to make a point, even though you know better.  And again, this is still off-topic. Why don't you put the WEG Bank posts in your WEG Bank thread?

I was just pointing out that his reasoning is flawed and that what he said is an indicator for demand not for artificial price increase.  I can add another item to the list of their duties (beside the 40M NIM they apparently assigned to the independent community funding board): Their salaries. According to this blog post, 16% of their monthly payments are paid in NIM, that's about 30k USD worth of NIM every month. The foundation currently owns 20k USD worth of NIM through the vesting, so they obviously have other sources of NIM.  As long as we don't see the relevant transactions on the Nimiq blockchain, we won't find out what the source of funds is. I still think it is not relevant at all, if they have duties in NIM, there is no problem if they buy NIM to pay them, as it is totally underpriced right now. If they now get rid of all the foundation/team owned NIM within a few months, that would be stupid (and a good reason to criticize them), not the other way round.  My guess is the price increase is more due to ""insider trading"" (where insider is everyone active in the community)....

If their employees/partners accept NIM as a means of payment, how is that a bad thing? That's exactly what NIM is intended for. Ideally at some point of the future, it's not only 16% paid in NIM, but 100%. But 16% already shows that they are willing to receive their salary in NIM (which is basically the same as investing into NIM), so they actually believe in their own project, which is again a sign that it is not a scam. Nobody would knowingly invest into a scam and they would be the one to know if it was a scam....  Oh, did you notice how they already do this for months? No? Then this is a sign that the latest price jumps are not at all related to the team buying NIM, because they were able to hide it before (probably do OTC trades, as this is how you do large amounts).  You and the ""other"" FUDers trying to find something negative (""price manipulation"") in a thing that is actually positive (""team buying NIM to fulfill their demand"") is wimpy.   You raised your point that Nimiq will probably be bankrupt within a few months and the value of NIM will go to zero similarly fast. So why don't you come back in a few months to tell us how you knew it in advance and what a genius you are. Or (which is way more likely) don't come back as you realize how wrong you were and that this project is actually perfectly legit and even positive for their investors at some point....  Analyzing your possible situations: 1. You believe in the project and think it is going to raise in value. You should continue HODL your NIM or even accumulate more at the current low price. You should not spread FUD as this would hurt your own investment. 2. You don't believe in the project anymore and think the value is going further down. You should have sold your bag already would no longer be invested into NIM (so can't claim to be highly invested without lying to deceive other investors). You might waste your time into FUDing, but that wouldn't give you anything valuable, so it's unlikely you'll do it every day for a month already. 3. You are invested into another project and think that hurting Nimiq by spreading FUD will increase the value of the your investment. You can't claim to be highly invested into NIM without lying to deceive other investors. 4. You are a paid shill of another project that wants to hurt Nimiq by spreading FUD. You might be invested into NIM, but your shill payment must be higher than your investments value to make it valuable for you to shill against your investment, so you can't claim to be highly invested into NIM without lying to deceive other investors. 5. You are just insane and have a lot of time to waste on the internet. You might be highly invested into NIM and still spread FUD. 6. You are just insane and after losing money by buying at ATH and selling at ATL, you now also want to lose your time spreading FUD (because time is money, so you can even lose more money on NIM). You can't claim to be highly invested into NIM without lying to deceive other investors. 7. You are Robin and are insane because you smoke too much. You just want to destroy the project at any cost and after you realized you are not going to be able to get the money from the team, you do so by spreading FUD.  It's easy to see that the first case does not apply to you and the other FUDers, as you are spreading FUD. In cases 2, 3, 4 and 6, you'd be a liar (as you claimed to be highly invested into NIM), in case 5 and 6 (and 7) you'd be insane. Which case matches yours?

Luckily I found two screenshots on the internet confirming this. This is the site that you see when accessing the website outside the US. This is the site you see when accessing the website from within the US or Puerto Rico. Additionally, you can see in the terms that it was forbidding to participate for US people. tl;dr: There was no way around the US restriction without using a VPN and intentional lying before participation.

Here are some facts regarding the claims:  - ""the project is an ICO scam"": very subjective, but if you check the original roadmap and plans by the team (at time of ICO), you will see they actually managed to realize many of it. Only the marketing efforts seem to be not very fruitful, resulting in low price (way below ICO price and actually below value of foundation holdings). To me a scam is someone that (intentionally) does something else with the money than what it was intended for, which IMO is not the case here.  - ""burning all that money to look legit for SEC"": The team is not US based and US investors were excluded from ICO, so why should they care about SEC at all?  - ""no progress for the last months"": The team is about to finish the Rust implementation, providing major performance benefits. The development effort is easily visible on https://github.com/nimiq/core-rs/commits/master. Additionally the team already teased some cooperation with a financial institution. I guess we'll here some more details or a full announcement on this soon....  - ""fight in the team. robin linus is a cannabis drug addict"": Robin Linus is no longer a team member (maybe because he became drug addict, I don't know), so this doesn't really matter. There might have been a fight before he left the team, but they tried to handle this internal as much as possible, which is the right thing IMO....  - ""digging not profitable"": According to some GPU miners, it's one of the most profitable coins out there right now.

I can counter the new list items as well: Quote from: nimiqshitcoin on February 13, 2019, 09:16:13 AM 12. They started to pay the community to stay ( moderators + developers ) 13. They acquired a 1.1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica from ICO Money 14. Multiple members of scamiq team have acquired multiple properties in Costa Rica,  Germany and other countries. 15. ICO period was done using for-profit company with no KYC for American citizens 16. ICO investors lost all their money.  12. Last time they reported on this (during the January AmA), they said that moderators (on reddit, discord and telegram) are not paid, can you proof that this actually changed? Also you might be referring to the Community Fund, which is helping community projects by granting them some NIM from the Foundation holdings. This is exactly what I expect them to do with the Foundation NIM, how is that not a good thing? 13. The 1.1 million dollar villa claim has already been debunked over a month ago and you are well aware of it. See this post by the team with the relevant details. 14. This is a claim that has no proof attached. Can you provide one? Also it doesn't really matter what team members do privately. And there is no information on that topic in their transparency report and the financial insights published just a month ago also do not contain any indicator in that direction.... 15. There was no KYC for american citizens. In fact there was no KYC during the ICO at all. But there also was a ban of american citizens (in the terms, using IP banning and specifically asking the user just that additional question). KYC was then performed later on. 16. Investors got all the NIM they initially bought. They might have sold them though. The price was 5x ICO price a year ago, so investors could have easily made good profit with their investment. Also the price is likely to raise again given the things the team already announced....  Your new ""facts"" are even further away from actual facts than last time.

As outlined in the transparency report, this investment was intended as and has proven itself to be a diversified store of value for Nimiq’s assets (bought with BTC when price was around approx. 9k USD), while also providing grounds for potential expansion. Nimiq added three platforms with large tents and two bathrooms, and one larger “rancho” as additional multiuse and workspace for team members.  Find this land development study (made and signed by an external environmental advisor from Costa Rica) with reference to the real extent of the property.  The team is very clear that their primary purpose to buy the land is diversification, with the option to build a campus in the future (this implies they did not build a campus yet). They wrote that they only built three platforms for tents and a multiuse rancho. They even shared a photo of one of those platforms with tent. The exact location does not matter, but if you are good in using Google Maps, you should be able to find it through the aerial photos that are part of the land development study they published.

Usually you publish memes under the john.btc name....  Interesting how your memes basically have the message: The team should do more marketing to pump the price. They should stop caring about tech and only about how much investors (that failed to sell when it was 5x) earn.... It's like the complete opposite of spirit of Bitcoin. Bitcoin was worth nothing for a few years and still it is now the leading cryptocurrency. Maybe Nimiq can do the same? But most ICO investors only care about profit, not about tech.

Even if we just add another $700k of additional costs (and I don't think this makes any sense at all), they would end up at $6M, not $5M. - If you add another 4 month to end of December, you'd need to deduct less than $1M (not $2M as you just did), so by end of December they would be at about $5M, not $3M. - Richy, Philipp, and Marvin earn less than $200k a year (we don't know exact numbers though). By end of December, their total income thus will be less than $500k (2.5 years of Nimiq existence), thus half of what you just proposed.

They have banned hudrends of people on: discord, telegram, reddit and deleted youtube messages. Nimiq is one of the most censored project. People have been banned and many posted complains on Reddit and Bitcointalk that they have been banned requesting access before. Wasn't @coinfanatic banned on telegram months ago ?  https://i.imgur.com/dTVlDvT.png  From Reddit.  Quote I was personally accused of being a Robin sockpuppet by a telegram mod, for coming into the channel to support him after I read his reddit post. Before being banned I was never given the chance to prove that I wasn't Robin, which would have been trivial--I could have responded with an audio recording of my voice, which would have made it pretty darn obvious I wasn't him--I'm Australian. (Although I completly lost my cool and told one of the mods to fuck themselves as a result of the accusation which may have been the main reason I was banned).  I participated in the ICO, and expressed my concern for the uselessness of the browser miner after launch when it became clear it was a boondoggle. Like many infrequent users of telegram, I deleted my account. I have always had a foot in the webdollar camp as well as the nimiq camp and am critical of both (and so was also accused of being a webdollar shill). Also my account creation was before any of this Robin drama kicked off [but I suppose you'd say that Robin was creating sockpuppets in preparation for the drama].  All this demonstrates is the community is paranoid enough to be so sure that Robin sockpuppeting as to accuse a random users of being him. I never made any personal attacks on Philip or Elion. I demanded to know how much Richy was being paid, and he refused to answer. I can't even remember which mod I told to ""fuck you"" after the accusation.  All of this says a lot about the honesty with which the team are going to answer any of these AMA questions, of which Robin was the catalyst.   Quote 1 month ago Hi u/btrs_88,  I feel sorry that you had a bad experience in our community. The telegram mods have a hard time with a lot of people only joining to watch and deepen the drama. Especially from the BitcoinTalk community, a lot of FUDers joined the community channels. However, please note that the Telegram moderators are not part of the Nimiq Team and only tried to protect the team and the community. Calling them bad words certainly doesn't help in such situations. I guess you can ask mods to unban your account in a friendly way, soon. Most of the drama will probably be over after the AmA, so mods can get back to the usual approach.  This situation is extraordinary for all of us, so please pardon those that didn't handle it perfectly. There, unfortunately, are no instructions how to handle such things.  They ban the shit out of people. Probably their moderators and the team banned hudrends of people who asked legit questions about their structure and organisation. Even now we don't have an official statement describing the Nimiq Foundation members. Who is President? Is Robin Linus the President (of course, but they don't want to disclose this)  The project is a bad joke and a scam. Sweep all their dirt under the carpet.  They always lie. Now they tell us: ""we never banned people"". Screw you. I have been personally banned on Telegram and Reddit! Many other ICO investors had been banned as well on Telegram by Richy, you and other moderators. JUST BE FRANK AND ADMIT THE TRUTH",False

It doesn't make any sense. The only sense you make, is that there is no involvement of Robin in this project for 10-11 months.  Why would you lie? Simple. The founder exited the project, the project will become bankrupt next year with all the ICO money, and you Richy are hired to keep the community afloat a few more months.  Simple facts:  - Robin is still part of the project. - Robin has been focusing only on research for the last 6 months. Other members of the team met with him recently to analyze his research approach. - Somebody in Nimiq Telegram asked why he is not part of meetups. I shared a video of THE FIRST meetup and explained that he also didn't participate in this meetup even though he was in the next room coding. - There are 3 founders, a Team of developers and an entire community behind Nimiq. - This is all true.

YES OR NO. *) Who administrate the charity and foundation funds. The team nimiq or WHO?  2) you ask for yes or no when it's not a yes/no question 6/7) It's not premined but vested, i.e. most of the funds can not be transferred yet and are locked on the blockchain (for up to 10 years according to their vesting schedule). *) The funds are controlled by the two foundations board (ImpactX Foundation for charity purposed and Nimiq Foundation for Nimiq purposes). I guess those foundations are properly registered non-profits in Switzerland, so there is proper oversight through authorities.   1. How much cash do they still have ? Did they buy a 1.1 million dollar in Costa Rica YES OR NO. 2. The team PREMINED 7.5% of the entire work. PREMINED = funds that were not POW mined. They PREMINED it with a simple line of code. That is what premine means. I have never heard of ImpactX Foundation. Is there a link to their website? If not why does the team avoid to tell us the foundation details like registration number, city, address, etc... The first vesting of premined funds for charity and InpactX were already received. Why did they not send the funds to ImpactX and Charity ?? DO they keep for themselves  Regarding my argument that ROBIN LINUS has left the project either to drug abuse or to exit scam. Robin last activity was slightly before launching the project. After launching the main net he never posted anything..... he just disappeared from Planet Earth . Here is a proof, his medium activity  https://i.imgur.com/cJf4tlB.png  https://medium.com/@RobinLinus  His account did not have any kind of activity from  April 11. About 7 months ago.

I just asked you for information, how is that a lie?  You linked three posts from Jan 4. None of them claimed to have any insider information, although you claimed that they do. You also claimed that the Team expressed that this must be a joke, but your linked posts do not contain any comments from the Team at all. So your quotes hardly proof your claim.  According to Robins public post on Jan 8, where he announced to have been cannabis addicted in the past, he also was ""sober for almost half a year now"" (Proof), so at the time of the posts you linked (Jan 4) he was already sober, so even if there was a team comment that he is not drug addicted, that would have been true at that time.  Moreover, the team announced Robin will work on research on or around beginning of September (Proof). At this time (4 month before his post) Robin was also already sober according his announcement. Additionally, Robin shared a prototypical implementation of his current research dated back to Aug 5 (Proof), so chances are good he was already sober at that date. This also supports his claim of being sober for almost half a year (it would have been about 5 months then).  Also read this post from the Team regarding some of your accusations. It also contains detailed information to debunk the ""1.1 million dollar villa"" claim.",False

GitHub contributions are communication and commits. I never said otherwise. You failed to proof that bitcoin devs have significantly more commits. This concludes that the significantly higher number of contributions consist mainly of communication. Learn to apply basic logic.

Quote from: Scamiq on February 10, 2019, 05:52:10 PM Ok fine it's a failed project. Now can we please have some accountability from the team!!!!!! In my opinion there are four possible situations an ICO project might be in: (1) The project failed. They are unable to produce what they intend to due to lack of funding. All the team can do is publicly announce and excuse for their failure. (2) The project failed. The team did not produce anything or only very few of what was announced during the ICO and stopped further development. (3) The project is in progress. The team is producing what is intended to be produced by the ICO investors. (4) The project is succesful. The team produced all the things the ICO investors wanted them to produce. There is no reason for refunds as the investors got what they paid for.  It's now up to you to decide which of the four best describes the current situation. (1) is not the case given the financial insights the team provided in their latest blog post (2) is invalid given they are still actively developing and also developed a fully functional blockchain completely from scratch and launched a mainnet, which is kind of the main thing they proposed to do with the ICO funds. So only (3) and (4) are possible options. Decide which one you prefer.

Many of the items were already done, others are still pending. Then compare with how many funds are left to find out if the funds are enough to tackle the other points. The only thing you always bring it down to is the price. Low price or loss in token value is not the definition of scam.   Also they promised us a fiat p2p exchange for 2019 in the original roadmap, but they just dropped it.

So, for the sake of the argument, let's restrict his commits only to bitcoin core  JUST ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO TRICK INVESTORS!  Of course I count all of Wladimir's contributions to bitcoin which include repositories like ElementsProject/lightning, vidbina/bitcoin.env, bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org, bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org, laanwj/rust-bitcoin-rpc, laanwj/rust-clightning-rpc... because all of them are relevant contributions.    You can see that Marvin had 85+31=116 commits to the core repos, Philipp was doing 175+58=233 commits, Pascal 151+149=300 commits. So all of them had more core commits then Wladimir and both Philipp and Pascal had more than Marco.  That's so pathetic.

This talking about commits makes no sense, but still I am pretty sure your 10% number does not stand any thoughtful analysis.  bitcoin-core/bitcoincore.org and bitcoin-dot-org/bitcoin.org are static websites. No development involved, it's more like marketing and communication. In fact it even includes the blog. Just because Nimiq don't have their website and blog in a GitHub repository, doesn't mean it's not something they put work into. Also the communication hardly says anything about a ""blockchain core developer"", because developers are there to develop not to communicate.  I am happy to include Wladimirs commits to the other development repositories you mentioned as long as we also include Nimiq team commits outside the core: - bitcoin/bitcoin: Wladimir +65 - nimiq-network/core: Philipp +175, Pascal +151, Marvin +65 - nimiq/core-rs: Pascal +149, Philipp +61, Marvin +31 - ElementsProject/lightning: Wladimir +4 - vidbina/bitcoin.env: Wladimir +1 - laanwj/rust-bitcoin-rpc: Wladimir +0 (not sure why you brought this up at all) - laanwj/rust-clightning-rpc: Wladimir +60 - nimiq/accounts: Pascal +10, Marvin +3 - nimiq/keyguard-next: Philipp +11, Pascal +4, Marvin +3 - nimiq/vue-components: Marvin +8 TOTAL: Pascal 314, Philipp 247, Wladimir 130, Marvin 110  Summarized: Wladimir has about 20% more commits than Marvin, but doesn't beat Pascal and Philipp. So maybe the Team should consider firing Marvin.... But still your 10% number is totally off, it's more like 80%....  Even if we add Wladimirs commits to the websites, that only is an additional of 6 commits on bitcoincore.org and 8 commits on bitcoin.org. Adding those will change the number to maybe 75%, still far away from 10%.... And again I managed to prove your point invalid.

Based on their monthly burn rate ($200k/month) we can estimate that the average of their 20 team member receives at most $10k/month (unlikely, because they also have other expenses then salaries). $10k/month at 40h/week is about $55/h or $120k/year - including benefits (because benefits are part of the burn rate). It makes no sense to use the maximum team member salary and use this for every team member. According to this article, the average blockchain dev salary is more than $150k/year. So the average dev at Nimiq earns less than the average overall blockchain dev. If all these numbers are true (and I have no reason to assume the opposite beside you claiming so), this means that there is no reason to complain about salaries, as they are in no way extraordinary.  Your link to proof they do not work applies filters, removing those filters will improve the image a lot. Also you don't know what happens behind the scenes.

In the AmA a month ago, they announced about $200k/month. They confirmed this number in a recent blog post: around $200k-$210k/month   Their website shows only 19 team members: https://nimiq.com/team.

Marvin is counting 20 to make up his story... Seems you are right this time and I miscounted the team members, although 19 vs 20 is not a huge difference anyway. Also I count a total of 10 developers on their team page, not 4. So you are saying that the other team members get about nothing? Do you have any proof for that? According to the recent blog post, compensation for team members ranges from $20 to $90 per hour. This range narrows to $50-$90 for the development team. Of course we don't know what exactly Marvin gets, but it seems to be between $50/hour and $90/hour. The team repeatedly said they don't want to publish per-person salaries, so we need to stick with what we got, but saying that Marvin gets more than $90/hour is definitely a lie from your side if any of the numbers provided by the team is true. We can also try to ask Marvin if he is on the upper or lower end of the $50 to $90 spectrum, if that is so important for you, he is always very open for chats on Discord. I can send him a message if you want, or you do it yourself?   120 contributions in the last year in ""Nimiq Network"" https://github.com/mar-v-in?org=nimiq-network&year_list=1 48 contributions in the last year in ""Nimiq"" https://github.com/mar-v-in?org=nimiq&year_list=1  Marvin's workload is only 10% of a real blockchain developer (such as a bitcoin dev): 1,412 contributions in the last year https://github.com/laanwj?org=bitcoin&year_list=1  Your reference to Wladimir makes no sense, as you don't only count his commits as a bitcoin core dev, but also all kind of other commits.  So, for the sake of the argument, let's restrict his commits only to bitcoin core, by looking at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/graphs/contributors?from=2018-02-10&to=2019-02-09&type=c You can see that Wladimir actually had 65 commits to bitcoin core within the last year, Marco had the most with 222 commits. Now doing the same for Nimiq. They have two core implementations (in JS and Rust) in separate repositories, see the commit counts at https://github.com/nimiq-network/core/graphs/contributors?from=2018-02-10&to=2019-02-09&type=c and https://github.com/nimiq/core-rs/graphs/contributors?from=2018-02-10&to=2019-02-09&type=c You can see that Marvin had 85+31=116 commits to the core repos, Philipp was doing 175+58=233 commits, Pascal 151+149=300 commits. So all of them had more core commits then Wladimir and both Philipp and Pascal had more than Marco.  However, I won't say that the team or any of its developers did more or less than any bitcoin dev. This is because it is hard to rate the value of commits and the amount of work required to produce them.

Many of your points a provably wrong - I was mostly active in Discord, not Telegram, so that is why you see little activity from me on Telegram. I only go to Telegram if people in Discord write about it. - My bitcointalk account is from December, ""Robin drama"" started in January. I indeed created my Reddit account lately to publish the survey there, but that was also before the ""Robin drama"". - My total number of posts is 56, not hundreds. You and the other sockpuppets indeed went in the hundreds in total. - I am not defendng team excessive salaries because I don't think they are excessive. The team stated that the highest salary (probably Robin or Philipp) is around $90/h with the average at $60/h. In my experience, that is not absurdly high in the IT field in general and according to studies found in the internet actually low for crypto currency industry. - The survey was not fake, in fact some of the respondents faked data (a few claimed to be from Telegram or Discord but in fact came from BitcoinTalk), but there is nothing to do against that. I can also share the insight that people that came from BitcoinTalk on average had a way worse opinion than people coming from any other source. You have no way to proof that the survey is fake, I can provide as much as you'd like to proof the survey is real. So if you can say why you think the survey is fake (beside that you don't like its result), please go ahead so that I can debunk your claim. - I think my knowledge of code is not very high. I know the details from a technical perspective, but I am neither JS nor Rust dev (I go with C/C++ instead) so I haven't looked to much in the code.  Funny thing is: You repeatedly asked for refund from the team, but refused to give any proof of being eligible for refund to me. If you'd think I am a team member, you should be willing to give me a proof - so my best guess is that you don't even think yourself what you are writing here.

Robin announced that he was a drug addict more than half a year ago, but is sober since then. Your accusations only started in January (because you opened the account only then) so basically after or around when he made it public and way after he was already sober. Also it wasn't you to prove it, it was Robin himself announcing it (and to be precise, there is still no proof at all, just his announcement, that he apparently deleted by now). 2. There is no proof of any pending internal struggles over money. The team announced they were willing to give Robin money under certain conditions for independent research and he was not willing to fulfill this conditions. 3. According to latest report in AmA, the burn rate is around $200k/month right now. Even a $250k/month burn rate would not cause financial trouble due to their announced holdings of more than $8 Mio. 4. Team confirmed to run low volume market making bot, no fake volume bot. 5. No price manipulation was ever proven. In fact, ""attempts"" of proofs done by some FUDers on bitcointalk were easy to debunk and did not prove anything. 6. GPU mining is available. There are no details as to when first GPU miners existed. Nimiq Team never claimed that there are no GPU miners or that they are unlikely or hard to create. Still FUDers on bitcointalk did nothing that contributed to a proof on this topic 7. According to swiss company register, the foundation board consists of multiple non team members and not all team members are in the foundation board. Removing from the team is independent of removing from foundation board. 8. Just recently the partnership with agora trade and presumably a third party in the financial sector was announced to create the first-of-its-kind, non-custodial fiat exchange. See https://twitter.com/agora_trade/status/1090502044165775360 9. Subjective, thus impossible to proof. 10/11. Even though some community projects were closed, others were started at the same time. Most of the community members that created projects they closed now, are still part of the community (ex. Blub, creator Beeppool, now closed, was still actively contributing in the Nimiq Discord these days and provided help with setting up a community seed node. He also still hosts one of the community seed nodes, actively contributing to the network).  TL;DR: Most of the ""facts"" are just lies, and none of them was proven by FUDers on bitcointalk, but actually only debunked or explained in detail by the team.

Short summary: Nimiq is aiming to provide easy and user-friendly crypto-payments with real decentralization, focusing on web payments (PayPal-like checkout) right now. This is accomplished by light clients that run directly in any browser (no installation or plugin required), but still are a fully decentralized client - no trusted third party involved as in other web wallets like Coinbase (custodial) or MyEtherWallet (non-custodial), browsers are directly connected to the peer-to-peer network.

No. Disappointed? Maybe. Unhappy? Also possible.  However, many ico investors sold with +100% and more when the price was high: In January 2018, more than 15 Mio USD worth of NET were traded on public exchanges (excluding OTC). At that point, one NIM was worth between 0.03 and 0.07 USD (which is 3x to 7x ico price). Also as long as you don't sell, you don't have any losses realized, so you can still hope for earnings. If you hope for earnings, you won't try to hurt the project by publicly attacking it on BitcoinTalk. And if you sold, you no longer are invested (and did not invest for the long run) and it is your fault that you sold at the wrong time.

I think in general, it showed that Nimiq can indeed process the number of transactions they announced. At peaks, blocks had about 720 transactions (you can verify with a block explorer of your choice, for example look at block #428497). With an average block time of 1 minute, this means the network is able to process up to 12 transactions per second with the current configuration. This is in fact way more than what Bitcoin can do without segwit and the team already announced that they will look into both: increasing the block size and further optimizing the storage requirements (using tech like SegWit).

You apparently knew his name, so you knew he was an active user of Nimiq before. The fact that he only has one post on this specific forum does not matter if you know that he was active on other platforms. You just try to discredit him, but actually know that what you say is very unlikely at least because your reasoning is nonsense. - You write ""We believe"", although no other account, and especially none of the other ~5 FUDer account posted yet and obviously never claimed that glenn_hodl is a sockpuppet account before, because there was no reason to (first post, as just pointed out by you). The only way for you to know the believe of the other ~5 FUDer accounts is that you coordinate through another channel *or* all FUDer accounts are owned by the same person.  Also I just wanted to point out again that neither you, nor any of the other ~5 FUDer accounts ever made any attempt to proof you were/are highly invested into Nimiq and had losses. Some of the accounts claimed they are going to sell their massive stack in short time without any substantial price movement thereafter, which makes it very unlikely that the claim is actually true. Until you provide any proof that you participated in the ICO or do own larger amounts of NIM (or NET) today, I suspect you are actually lying about your losses. So from now on, everytime you say you are writing here because of your massive losses due to your investment in Nimiq, I will point out again that you are a liar and a sockpuppet account of WebDollar (I have no proof for the latter, but you also have no proof for 90% of your claims, so I think it is totally fine for this forum if I am wrong with some of the things I write).",False

The numbers presented to the public are consistent and they still should have more than 9 Mio. USD worth of assets (even though assets lost value due to bear market). If they had just left the investors funds (60k ETH), they would have less than 9 Mio USD now, so I don't think we can complain about how they used the funds (they most likely could have done better, but that's not the point). Also it seems that they run as a non-profit foundation in Switzerland (""Nimiq Stiftung"", registered in Zug), so any kind of money wasting would probably cause punishment through Swiss authorities.  I think the team should definitely improve on communication, transparency and marketing. The former two mostly to reduce the FUD, marketing to boost the price.

It's easy to find their ETH address because of the nature of ETH. - If you check their token sale contract, you can read from the contract and find the 'ethFundDeposit' address '0xefa351d189c367d109859afdf6f3d17eeb0825a5', which is a multi-signature wallet - At the time of the transparency report (end of july 2018) '0xefa351d189c367d109859afdf6f3d17eeb0825a5' had a balance slightly above 10k ETH. This is near the claimed amount of 9.5k ETH mentioned in the transparency report. - On Aug 27, '0xefa351d189c367d109859afdf6f3d17eeb0825a5' transferred 5.4k ETH to another multi-signature wallet at '0x847c590d780913b394290295a26ea172e12ffbf1', through transaction '0xa1a227497c108f6e8784c7c080789a9d6c45d29cfa4166c10058baab5c683250'. There was a discussion around this transfer at that time and the team confirmed it to be an internal transaction (and not as rumored, a payment for Binance) - At the time of the AmA (Jan 11) '0xefa351d189c367d109859afdf6f3d17eeb0825a5' had a balance of 1k ETH and '0x847c590d780913b394290295a26ea172e12ffbf1' had a balance of 5.4k ETH, so a total of 6.4k ETH. This is also near the claimed amount of 6.5k ETH mentioned during the AmA.  I already did these checks when I first saw their claims and I bet others did as well. Everyone can verify all my findings easily through etherscan. Of course the fact that they were not lying about their ETH funds doesn't say anything about BTC/Fiat/RealEstate part of their funds, but at least proofs parts of the transparency report and AmA statement to be valid.  As mentioned before, I think the team should definitely improve on communication, transparency and marketing. It shouldn't be necessary for me to get these numbers and addresses from the blockchain. But, on the other hand, most other ICOs don't even do such transparency reports, so this is definitely better than many others...",False

This was already mentioned in the AmA that they have 6500 ETH (1 Mio USD at that time). They also have 680 BTC (2.7 Mio USD) and 5.1 Mio. USD in Fiat. I don't think they are required to pay devs in ETH, they can also pay in BTC, USD or NIM, so they don't need to buy ETH to pay devs... In fact, given the low amount of transactions on the ETH wallet, I bet they don't normally pay team members with ETH. Also it was probably a very good idea to not have many ETH anymore, the price of ETH is now half of what it was during the ICO, so they saved a lot of money by selling their ETH to BTC and USD.

They also have only 6,400 ETH available and not 6,500 ETH available as they have been lying in the AMA to make the number a little bit bigger than in reality. So, I can bet many of the numbers were increased.  They can always have more accounts than the one I found. I would expect them to transfer smaller funds from the multi-signature wallet to a single-signature wallet, so they can have easier access (UX for most multi-signature wallets just sucks).  Also I just rechecked my numbers, and they actually have more than 6500 ETH (my 6400 ETH was rounded down, so it was my fault, not theirs): 1,073.38518119 ETH (@ 0xEFa351D189c367D109859AFdF6f3D17EEb0825a5) + 5,457.0405 ETH (@ 0x847C590d780913B394290295A26EA172e12fFbF1) = 6530,42568119 ETH. Again this is a lower bound, they could easily have more than that. So it looks like they were actually not rounding up, but rounding down. Maybe they wanted to trick us into thinking they have less than they actually have.  The AmA was done on Jan 11, so you shouldn't take the whole 200k USD monthly burn rate, because this is only half a month ago, but only deduct something like 100k USD.  Also you are now taking today prices for BTC and ETH, so to be correct you should also evaluate the ICO funds accordingly: 60,000 ETH (which was what they got in the ICO) is 6,955,082.24 USD today. They still have 6500 ETH left, so they only invested 53,500 ETH, which is 6,202,149.78 USD today. From 6,202,149.78 USD they were able to diversify into 1.1 Mio. USD worth of real estate (not a villa, they said its empty land in the AmA), 5.1 Mio. USD in cash and 2,415,400.80 USD worth of BTC (680 BTC at current price). If we consider only the Cash and BTC as movable funds, they still managed to earn 1.3 Mio. USD (made 7.5 Mio. USD from 6.2 Mio. USD) beside buying the empty land and all compensations and payments. So if you take it that way, they actually performed very well and had a net positive first 1.5 years, to be precise it is +21%. (I am not really serious about this now, just saying that your calculation also doesn't make a lot of sense). Given that they already delivered way more than half of what they proposed during the ICO, even -50% would have been fine to me.  But I still don't know why they actually should lie at us around this numbers? Could you explain what they earn from putting wrong numbers out (which probably is illegal given they are a Swiss non-profit foundation)? I don't think these saying have any influence on the price of NIM and I also think they are not very interested in increasing the price of NIM (at least until now they did no marketing in that direction).  I totally understand that some investors (by the way, you are still pending to proof you actually are one) are upset about the price. I might be too if I hadn't earned more than I lost through clever trading (or luck) of NET and NIM. But fortunately for me, I am still net positive with my Nimiq investment and as such am not blinded for the progress they are doing (for example in scalability research or UX improvements). If the NIM price wasn't that low, nobody would even care about their financial details as we do right now...",False

Assuming this is true, it would also only cost ~1.5M USD to buy all NIM. So even if they did that, they would still have more than 7M USD left, which is far from running out of money. And, if they buy all NIM, nobody else would own any NIM, so the only stakeholders would be them, so they can do whatever they want and don't have to listen to you at all.

Sushipool will get closed soon due to expensive infrastructure costs and unscalability of nimiq mining.  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:19 PM my questions are if it is profitable to start a mining pool because i have seen other pools closing down their pools  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:20 PM Not profitable atm We can set you a pool if you have the servers ready for a fee  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:20 PM thank you so much i would like to try it by myself i saw there is some tutorial  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:22 PM Ok sure You need Linux experience tho  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:22 PM i work on mac so it is quite the same 1) SkyPool and secondly the unprofitability of the pools the thing is that i don't want to go much into nim because of the factors  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:25 PM Then this is not the business for you  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:25 PM ah ok  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:25 PM You just answer your question, it’s hard  as you mentioned  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:26 PM i gotcha and if I go into opening a pool for nim how much money should I invest into it? like how much money did you invest into sushi pool  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:40 PM I can’t discuss that information, but what I can say is that our fee is 500K NIM Server cost could be under $100 depending on the scale  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:43 PM it is quite expensive i was thinking it is quite easy being in javascript but, it looks the opposite being quite expensive and hard to create and mantain  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:44 PM Yep, but still give it a try  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:45 PM another question, any idea if NIMIQ will be able to cover my expenses at least for the first few months running a new pool  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:46 PM Don't think so, might have to look at it as an investment  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:46 PM yeah, but I don't think running a pool is necessary an investment, it benefit the project to make it more decentralized  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:47 PM true but no pool will burn cash forever, this is why they are shutting down  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:48 PM i guess skypool is profitabile though. Isn't it?  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:48 PM who really knows they (SkyPool) ask for funding so they might not be  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:49 PM oh really i can't imagine why they don't fund pools it looks as a bad idea to run a pool on nim  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:50 PM It's a terrible idea atm, maybe it will improve later  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:51 PM yea it is terrible i guess you spend at least a couple of thousands of dollars per month to cover all the expenses  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:52 PM but again if you wan't us to get your pool online you can let me know  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:52 PM good to know  conversation online at https://textuploader.com/1am7f",False

You just shot in your own foot: According to the nimiq token sale terms, US citizens were not allowed to participate in the token sale or activate their NET to NIM. This means that either you broke the terms (which means you can't really complain about anything, because you can't expect anything else than losses when breaking the law) or you only bought NIM after mainnet launch, which means that you probably lost way less than 90%, because NIM ATH was around 0.006 USD and most of the time the price was actually below 0.003 USD.

It makes literally no sense to ask other investors to sell their NIM before doing an exit scam, because this would just reduce the amount you can get from the exit scam. Learn basics of economics first.  But to some degree you are right: I am preparing a very special kind of exit scam: My goal is that the FUDers exit the project.

They started to develop the tech 2 years with few millions dollars investment and us in just 6 month without any investment. They released the blockchain with few weeks before us. 7. We want to add anonymity 8. WebDollar has tokens now but doesn't has something user friendly for allowing usage of tokens. 9. They premined 5% for ICO investors and 5% for the team and we premined 9.9% whicl will be use for growing the project. 10. Our miner is designed for easy integration into any website for allowing content creators to monetize their work and reward their communities. 11. We didn't had any marketing until now and we already have thousands of miners and community members on all social networks 12. We did allocate coins from genesis which will be used in our unique build in bounty program which is registering you automatically. 13. Our code is totally different from their code. Maybe they have security issues and we want to ensure everything is working well. So to copy is not an option We already started to develop them in this way and now we have to deliver only like that. The hard part is not argon2d but the communication protocol and digital signatures and making the pool creation very easy. Their users for creating a pool had to install it via terminal and to send the connection information to developers for being listed on the website.  And the most important think our team and community is not employed, not paid to get involved. They get involved because they trust us and our vision.",False

Everything they tell is bullshit and contain completely false information. Wasn't Robin Linus (the pothead founder and cannabis abuser) kicked from the project leaving with 1/3 of the funds?

If that would be the case, Bitcoin and Ethereum would be dead now as well. What we see - to the contrary - is that Bitcoin and Ethereum are more alive than ever; solely a price decline is hardly the signal for a dead crypto project, especially in a bear market.  If you think Nimiq missed the bus of the big Crypto Hype of 2017, I can imagine so. The mainnet release was after the blow off top and little was done to market the project which (from my point of view) deserves a top 100 CMC spot. But did you sell your NET in December 2017?

How do you know what many of ""us"" (whoever that is) think? Or is it maybe that ""us"" is just the accounts of nimiqshitcoin, john.btc, coinfanatic, sasha.new, andrewjaxx and Scamiq?

Talking about SEC without a lot of background knowledge, you are not even an US citizen so SEC wouldn't even apply, SEC actually doesn't apply to Nimiq at all, because their token sale was not reachable from US (not possible to participate due to IP bans) and also asked users to confirm they don't have any US citizenship or greencard before being able to contribute in token sale.   When I contributed to the ICO, my IP was not banned. Also, many Americans got into the ICO pre-sale because of this. It is literally impossible to ban all IPs from the United States, and I can confirm the fact that my IP was not banned during the token sale. Moreover, people could have contributed to the token sale being in the States as there was no KYC procedure at the time of the token sale. I am not a native american, but I do have American citizenship.    And now you added a reference to Germany, even though everybody knows the project is half-costa-rican, half-german. If I would do a wild guess, these 6 accounts actually belong to just 2 or 3 people from the WebDollar community (bad english, apparently knowledge of romanian language). Maybe consider the possibility your Romanian tech is not superior to other technology and in fact it was proven by some of the Nimiq devs that your WebDollar devs actually stole code from Nimiq. Also did you notice how WebDollar is not on any exchange yet? Maybe Nimiq is actually superior to WebDollar, because right now NIM market cap is something like 2M USD, but WebDollar market cap is just 0. But I can give you one thing: your WebDollars definitely never lost any value.   Dude, probably you smoked to much pot. All the founders are Germans (Robin Linus, Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky, Pascal Berrang, Marvin Wissfeld (you) Elion Chin), the rest of the team are just regular employees. So the team is not half-costa-rican, they are just a bunch of people hired for day-to-day operations including Richy and Jeff - the great coder. I don't give a fuck about WebDollar because I have never invested in their project or in their ICO. I am just mad that I have invested heavily into this project and the project was hijacked by you, Philipp and Pascal and turned into a scam for buyers. You are just smoking pot in Costa Rica and doing shitty activities while calling yourself the great blockchain project in the Galaxy.

Here is proof there was only 1 commit in the last 4 weeks https://github.com/nimiq/core-rs/graphs/contributors How stupid do you think we are?  I really think you are rather stupid. Please learn how to read GitHub before making any accusations. - Nimiq has more than just one repository, you are only looking at one of them - Contribution graphs only display commits to master, not feature branches that are still in development. - Any commits only pushed to the team internal (non-public) git will not be shown on GitHub at all. - If developers decide to manager their work locally, and/or squash commits, the number of commits will be very low but the resulting code is still worth the same as if it was 10 commits per day.  I have spotted 2 lies.  Lie no 1. They did not push any code in private repositories for Rust. By default, GitHub is showing as activities including the private commits in private repositories regarding Rust. Lie no 2. I also checked the branches on the rust implementation. There are 3 branches with 5 commits in total. There is only one commit made by Pascal to the Rust implementation on a separate branch in the last 4 weeks.  https://i.imgur.com/zOcz8Np.png   So, coinfantastic please, you should rephrase your statement to be politically correct: ""Here is proof there were only 2 commits in the last 4 weeks """,False

We cannot bother the team to answer all your questions over and over again. They have better things to do than handle you 2-3 people with 6 accounts that just put a lot of effort in spamming this BitcoinTalk thread. Also, you are again contradicting yourself: Either you believe that I am a member of Team Nimiq (even though I obviously am not), then you should be happy with a statement by me if you want a statement from the Team. Or you believe that I am not a member of Team Nimiq, then you shouldn't state that some other person suspects me because it adds no value to the discussion.   When I contributed to the ICO, my IP was not banned. Also, many Americans got into the ICO pre-sale because of this. It is literally impossible to ban all IPs from the United States, and I can confirm the fact that my IP was not banned during the token sale. Moreover, people could have contributed to the token sale being in the States as there was no KYC procedure at the time of the token sale. I am not a native american, but I do have American citizenship.  It is perfectly possible to ban or allow all IP addresses from a country, in fact that's what many websites do. Also you did not even proof you are a ICO contributor, neither proof you are a us citizen. Everybody can claim such things. Nonetheless, when I contributed to the ICO, it clearly asked me if I was a US citizen or not and it also had me confirm the terms (at https://nimiq.com/terms/) that start with ""IF YOU ARE A CITIZEN, RESIDENT, OR GREEN CARD HOLDER OF THE UNITED STATES OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SALE, YOU CANNOT TAKE PART IN THE CROWDSALE"". Also, if you are a US citizen, you would not have been able to activate your NIM because that process had a KYC, so you must have sold your NET already, which means you cannot be (as claimed) a NIM holder right now, which implies you have no rights for refunds.   Dude, probably you smoked to much pot. All the founders are Germans (Robin Linus, Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky, Pascal Berrang, Marvin Wissfeld (you) Elion Chin), the rest of the team are just regular employees.  OK, seems like you have some insider information here. In all the VLOGs and their team page (https://nimiq.com/en/#team) they claim, only Robin, Philipp and Elion are ""Nimiq Creator"" (which to me sounds very much like founder). Also I read that Robin wants a third of the funds which aligns with the narrative of 3 founders. But as you seem to be an insider, you probably know better than me.   I have spotted 2 lies.  Lie no 1. They did not push any code in private repositories for Rust. By default, GitHub is showing as activities including the private commits in private repositories regarding Rust. Lie no 2. I also checked the branches on the rust implementation. There are 3 branches with 5 commits in total. There is only one commit made by Pascal to the Rust implementation on a separate branch in the last 4 weeks.    Oh wow, so much stupidity here. I pointed out 4 things that you didn't consider and you claim that two of these these things are ""lies"", although you show that you actually did not consider before (so basically agree). Also GitHub can obviously only shows activity for things that happen in private commits *on GitHub* which is not what I stated (so you are saying I am lying by changing what I actually said). And finally you attach a screenshot to proof there was only activity on one branch in the last 4 week, when the screenshot actually says ""Updated 21 days ago"" and ""Updated 23 days ago"" for two branches that you did not include in your calculation, so even your proof is proving you wrong. Summary: both of the lies you spotted are in first place not even lies and in second actually do not proof me wrong in any way, I see it more as a confirmation that I was right...  Quote from: nimiqshitcoin on January 17, 2019, 02:05:22 AM Secondly, most of us want a full 1:1 full refund from the team nimiq for every ICO investor.  Most investors don't want full refund at ICO price, the community survey results are very clear: https://imgur.com/8Cu54XA So it makes no sense to request a refund for every ICO investor. You of course can request a refund for you personally, but you did not provide any proof that you actually are an ICO investor. No proof, no refund, that's so easy.",False

How do you know what many of ""us"" (whoever that is) think? Or is it maybe that ""us"" is just the accounts of nimiqshitcoin, john.btc, coinfanatic, sasha.new, andrewjaxx and Scamiq? Because you seem to be very coordinated, often replying each other within minutes to support each other, always online at pretty much the same time, all of you only used their account to FUD against Nimiq, all of you claim to be highly invested into NIM but never provided any proof even if you could get money for it through my refund.  Talking about SEC without a lot of background knowledge, you are not even an US citizen so SEC wouldn't even apply, SEC actually doesn't apply to Nimiq at all, because their token sale was not reachable from US (not possible to participate due to IP bans) and also asked users to confirm they don't have any US citizenship or greencard before being able to contribute in token sale.  And now you added a reference to Germany, even though everybody knows the project is half-costa-rican, half-german. If I would do a wild guess, these 6 accounts actually belong to just 2 or 3 people from the WebDollar community (bad english, apparently knowledge of romanian language). Maybe consider the possibility your Romanian tech is not superior to other technology and in fact it was proven by some of the Nimiq devs that your WebDollar devs actually stole code from Nimiq. Also did you notice how WebDollar is not on any exchange yet? Maybe Nimiq is actually superior to WebDollar, because right now NIM market cap is something like 2M USD, but WebDollar market cap is just 0. But I can give you one thing: your WebDollars definitely never lost any value.  Quote from: coinfanatic on January 17, 2019, 01:21:42 AM Nothing but piles of lies!

Average salary is way less. Proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/Nimiq/comments/aeld86/team_nimiq_ama/edtfe5p/   2. Fake Trading Bot confirmed during AMA No, AmA confirmed reasonable market making bot with low volume and actual earnings (so no fake trading). Proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/Nimiq/comments/aeld86/team_nimiq_ama/edtcr9k/   3. Robin Drug Abuse of Cannabis. I really believe it is not cannabis but Cocaine. I really believe in unicorns, but that doesn't make them real either.   4. 1.1 million dollar investment is in Costa Rica and the SkyLoft resort villa 1.1 million real estate investment confirmed to be a large empty land and was a good investment compared to BTC or ETH. Proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/Nimiq/comments/aeld86/team_nimiq_ama/edtcjht/   5. Robin scam-exit the project willing to get a large chunk of money. From an insider, we know that the fight over the money it is still on-going. Robin Linus wants 1/3 of the funds and he won't stop fighting for it. I am just utterly disappointed to see that he stopped communicating with us as he is negotiating his terms with Philipp. 6. The project was hijacked from Robin and turned into an unprofitable scam in order to launder the ico money. So is Robin now exit-scamming or did he turn the project into a scam and now exits it. You need to decide. It's no longer an exit-scam if it's already a scam without exit, so it cannot be both.   7. Most of the community left the project. Moreover, developers started to leave the project. Neil from nimbet left the project two days ago. Neil was tricked into statement by third party and still is part of the community but now acts under different name because he's so ashamed.   8. Sushi pool and most probably SkyPool are both unprofitable and they will shut down their pools soon. I guess they are both pretty profitable, no other indicators found. Proof needed.   9. ICO investors lost -99% of the money. It's only between -95% and -90%, depending on if you calculate losses in USD, BTC or ETH.   10. The fact that Robin was not officially removed from the foundation board. In the medium article, they claimed they removed Robin from the foundation, while they can not do this. Team clarified in AmA that they can remove Robin by a vote of the council's remaining members. Proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/Nimiq/comments/aeld86/team_nimiq_ama/edtxjcf/   The only fact which was not proven by now is the imminent bankruptcy of the project. Our insider information reveals that the team's finances are worst than they declare with less than 7 million dollars available. Your last insider information was even less, so how it comes they have more now? And will it be the same number they announced in their AmA (total of 9.9 Mio USD, diversified into BTC/ETH/Fiat/Real estate) tomorrow?

For me it looks like a dead project and some impersonators are trying to convince others that we are wrong and that it is our fault we lost -99% of the money investing into scamiq.

He declared his intent to no longer work with the project and isolated himself. However, he does not control the project’s funds and he is not able to move funds on his own. All funds remain under the control of the foundation's board which disapproves of his actions. Proof: The wallets that hold Nimiq funds are public. There are no transactions that reflect any unauthorized movements of funds.  Why do you make such unsubstantiated statements? This is equivalent to slander.  False Claim: “The team launders money by buying real estate, you can see in the video that it’s just 250 m, they are building a new mansion for themselves.” Truth: Nimiq acquired 39'062 m2 of Costa Rican soil near the spaces currently used for work and stay. As outlined in the transparency report, this investment was intended as and has proven itself to be a diversified store of value for Nimiq’s assets (bought with BTC when price was around approx. 9k USD), while also providing grounds for potential expansion. Nimiq added three platforms with large tents and two bathrooms, and one larger “rancho” as additional multiuse and workspace for team members. Proof: Find this land development study (made and signed by an external environmental advisor from Costa Rica) with reference to the real extent of the property.  Don’t just assume things from what you see in a video without inquiring about more details. If in doubt, please ask and we will provide proper answers.  False Claim: “Team Nimiq does not support Community Projects.” Truth: Nimiq established a Community Funding Board that aims to give necessary funds to community members to develop projects that contribute to the Nimiq Ecosystem. Neil, a community developer, was hired by one of the pools to improve the existing pool server implementation. In a personal discussion, that Neil asked to keep in private, he complains about a lack of interest in funding his work without sending a formal proposal beforehand. We contacted Neil to encourage him to send his proposal in order to get funded in the regular way that was outlined previously in a Blog Post.

Ruslangburg was eventually banned and all his messages deleted immediately. He asked about the 1.1 million dollar investment in Costa Rica by nimiq. Then he uncovered three unknown facts to most of us and asked questions.  0. SkyLoft Resort owns the Villa we saw and see in the most of the nimiq vlogs.  http://www.skyloftcostarica.com/#content  1. Nimiq ""headquarter"" is at the moment hosted technically according to ""Team Nimiq"" shitty transparency reports hosted by paying rent to SkyLoft Costa Rica (according to AMA). They only mentioned that they spent over 1.1 million dollar into buying new land for building a Nimiq campus which is composed of ""tents and toilets"". 2. According to SkyLoft website http://www.skyloftcostarica.com/       according to the website https://i.imgur.com/mydIjhn.png  3. So, it means Nimiq is a tenant at SkyLoft Resort occupying the entire space 4. They justified that they invested 1.1 million from the ICO into buying land in Costa Rica from somebody that is not a team member. 5. According to this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VetRzl_qtaQ Robin is on-site on the land explaining the Nerd Campus to be built with tents and toilets and a supervision container. It is obvious that the tents and the land is annexed to the SkyLoft villa owned by Elion Chin.  Minute 1:12 https://i.imgur.com/O8wHToc.jpg It is clearly in the video that Robin is presenting the new NIMIQ CAMPUS inside the SkyLoft campus annexed to SKYLOFT Mansion. It is also obvious that they were planning to do a construction undergoing namely to build a new mansion because a building foundation is not necessary for tents + toilets + supervision container.  Moreover at 1:30 we can see the entire surface of the Costa Rican new land investment worth 1.1 million dollars to be less than 250 square meters which are usually probably 1 thousand dollars  https://i.imgur.com/w6ddIWP.jpg  Where is the 1.1 million dollar LAND they claimed they bought in  Costa Rica to extend the Campus?  6. Moreover, a team member posted on Reddit using the nickname ""bombardi"" a photo with one of the tents they built https://i.ibb.co/yXdcJMc/baller-mansion.jpg and claimed that there are 3 of these tents built for the Nimiq Campus.   So it means the 250 square meters and 3 of these tents cost them 1.1 million dollars.

After Neil from nimbet.cc posted that he is totally unprofitable and expresses his willingness to shut down his operations with nimiq and just close the development with nimiq, today we got a short whistleblow from LTD the CEO of sushipool (2nd largest pool of nimiq) confirming 3 things  1. Mining is unprofitable. So, stay the fuck out of mining this scam, unless you want to lose money 2. Sushipool and probably SkyPool are unprofitable. 3. Sushipool will get closed soon due to expensive infrastructure costs and unscalability of nimiq mining.  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:19 PM my questions are if it is profitable to start a mining pool because i have seen other pools closing down their pools  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:20 PM Not profitable atm We can set you a pool if you have the servers ready for a fee  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:20 PM thank you so much i would like to try it by myself i saw there is some tutorial  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:22 PM Ok sure You need Linux experience tho  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:22 PM i work on mac so it is quite the same 1) SkyPool and secondly the unprofitability of the pools the thing is that i don't want to go much into nim because of the factors  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:25 PM Then this is not the business for you  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:25 PM ah ok  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:25 PM You just answer your question, it’s hard  as you mentioned  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:26 PM i gotcha and if I go into opening a pool for nim how much money should I invest into it? like how much money did you invest into sushi pool  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:40 PM I can’t discuss that information, but what I can say is that our fee is 500K NIM Server cost could be under $100 depending on the scale  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:43 PM it is quite expensive i was thinking it is quite easy being in javascript but, it looks the opposite being quite expensive and hard to create and mantain  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:44 PM Yep, but still give it a try  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:45 PM another question, any idea if NIMIQ will be able to cover my expenses at least for the first few months running a new pool  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:46 PM Don't think so, might have to look at it as an investment  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:46 PM yeah, but I don't think running a pool is necessary an investment, it benefit the project to make it more decentralized  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:47 PM true but no pool will burn cash forever, this is why they are shutting down  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:48 PM i guess skypool is profitabile though. Isn't it?  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:48 PM who really knows they (SkyPool) ask for funding so they might not be  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:49 PM oh really i can't imagine why they don't fund pools it looks as a bad idea to run a pool on nim  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:50 PM It's a terrible idea atm, maybe it will improve later  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:51 PM yea it is terrible i guess you spend at least a couple of thousands of dollars per month to cover all the expenses  LTD | SushiPool.comYesterday at 11:52 PM but again if you wan't us to get your pool online you can let me know  arthur.samuelYesterday at 11:52 PM good to know  conversation online at https://textuploader.com/1am7f",False

I can't believe into a guy that he started to uncover the real truth and suddenly he disappeared into the abyss. I also want an ICO refund at least at the half of the initial ICO price.

They are not interested to do anything else except burn the ICO investors to buy houses. They spent 1.1 million dollars to buy Elion Chin's shit villa in Costa Rica and in the worktime all of them get high smoking pot. I am very confident that Richy, Philipp Elion and maybe others are smoking pot in that house and thinking: ""What should we buy today with  stupid investors  money from ICO""  The project is f**king dead but they still burn ICO money investors.  Investors lost almost everything -99% there is no Unique Selling Point of the project, just another minable coin and miners are dumping the coins to every buyer who gets in the project.",False

Nimiq refused to help with this and so far have approved NO funding of any sort, other than what serve's them as a team Please keep this private, just thought you should know they also in turmoil at the moment because the founded brought to the public's attention that Nimiq cannot scale and is liable to the same short comings as BTC's horrendous transaction times Oh which, I am in agreeance with, but it spoils the 'Nimiq' party and all the money they're spending  moneroBoyToday at 1:55 AM hi thank you so much for information i am terrible to hear that nimiq is such a shitcoin and that they keep all the money for themselves I was also really interested to help them to integrate anonymous options like coinjoin or other kind of private transactions i am really disappointed to see that they are not interested to fund community projects  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 1:59 AM well the team are just a bunch of educated people who managed to get a hefty ICO investment, which to their own founders admittance, has lead to become careless with the meaning of what money is hence how they've burned over $4M already and Nimiq is still no closer to being what it intended to be No business sense people  moneroBoyToday at 2:00 AM i understand that they got a lot of money from ICO investors  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:00 AM and from the code I've seen and the approach of the pool server, not particulary good coders eitther yes and all are virtually down 95%  moneroBoyToday at 2:01 AM i saw that the ICO investors lost a lot of money what other projects did you build until now  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:01 AM its a joke and given the work I had to put into sorting their pool fuckup out and they consider it not even needed, they have lost all my respect  moneroBoyToday at 2:02 AM ah, deeply sorry  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:02 AM i've spoken to many of them and most are straight up politicians some are quite ignorant  moneroBoyToday at 2:02 AM what do you have in mind to value your work  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:02 AM Pascal is ok, but he's only 1 of many not sure I follow?  moneroBoyToday at 2:03 AM i feel so sorry, you worked so much  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:03 AM oh it ain't your problem  moneroBoyToday at 2:03 AM and they don't even care about their developers  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:03 AM I feel more sorry for those who stumped up a lot of cash  moneroBoyToday at 2:03 AM probably they are just interested to wash all the money for themselves keep it all for themselves  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:04 AM and given that crypto has been in the dumps for last 6 months, any other business would of trimmed the fat, cut expenses not them, lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:04 AM yeah, why did you not public that they are treating you so bad ?

Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:11 AM yes he said they been spending money like water and that the current implementation was doomed to fail, due to being another BTC in the making he said he needs money to make a new Nimiq, they shit their pants and it all went tit's up i mean, Nimiq is currently worth shit anyways, but if they did as he asked, it would be game over plus they'd have to relinquish 'said' funds  moneroBoyToday at 2:13 AM this is exactly what i have understood  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:13 AM like killing the 'golden goose'  moneroBoyToday at 2:13 AM that he was working on his new blockchain called TreeCoin  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:13 AM well any serial blockchain is doomed to fail, cannot scale he know's this maybe never realised it at first but i could see it a mile off, when you get past the 'nimiq is a simple browser blockchain'  moneroBoyToday at 2:14 AM nimiq was designed to be a joker blockchain  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:15 AM yes, but still a serial blockchain, which the same limitations that makes BTC horrible for instant payment protocol well I haven't been in it that long, but I ain't impressed with what I've seen so far, nor how the 'team' operate  moneroBoyToday at 2:15 AM interesting do you have any idea if they pay community managers/shillers to ban and shill their stuff  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:18 AM don't know but i know if the recent AMA they lied about not removing reddit posts  moneroBoyToday at 2:18 AM for me it looks they pay a lot of community managers to ban people and manage the discussions  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:18 AM in the discord rooms  moneroBoyToday at 2:19 AM also robin linus talked about thing  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:19 AM well at the moment, nimiq has had some bad press  moneroBoyToday at 2:19 AM of them having fake accounts  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:19 AM yes he's the only honest one among them  moneroBoyToday at 2:19 AM indeed i also believe he is the only honest person among them I am just glad that they can not remove him and he will fight for the project Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:20 AM and they tried to use the AMA to get people on side so they can carry on their party what a load of bollox  moneroBoyToday at 2:21 AM yes they are transforming the entire project into a party to get the funds and after 1 year or son to write in a medium ""Sorry guys, we need to close the party""  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:21 AM i've seen the private dev chat room and their after party shit long as they can continue till sll the money has gone, they don't care then they'll move onto the next project  moneroBoyToday at 2:22 AM this is exactly like what most people believe also Robin  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:22 AM and come out smelling of roses no doubt its the way of the world  moneroBoyToday at 2:23 AM told the same thing that the are just feasting a big party with the ICO investors poor and dumb investors who trusted these ppl  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:24 AM ICO investors? i doubt that, they've all but shit on their money lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:24 AM no , with the ICO investors' money sorry for my mistake Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:25 AM ah yea, well there's still plenty in the kitty for them, lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:25 AM do you have any idea if sushi LTD or sander gets paid or other devs?

Meaning no browser (indexed db) is it integrated with a database  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:46 AM they made a custom JS db  moneroBoyToday at 2:46 AM like other blockchain  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:46 AM works in browser and server JungleDB  moneroBoyToday at 2:46 AM for browser they use IndexedDB  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:46 AM nope, Jungle  moneroBoyToday at 2:47 AM ok, i knew about it. I was curious the node.js of the JungleDB implementation probably files using files to store the data  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:47 AM the type of 'node' dictate's the amount of data it uses  moneroBoyToday at 2:47 AM yea i know  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:47 AM browser's were mean't to be light or nano something like that  moneroBoyToday at 2:47 AM Bitcoin used BerkleyDB from Oracle if I remember correctly  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:48 AM ah ok oh that'll be top's then lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:48 AM yea, exactly you can do a lot queries :smile: however, I am very disappointed to see that they don't give a fuck about community and developers it is just Richy who is a politician on the community  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:49 AM well they would like to appear they do  moneroBoyToday at 2:49 AM and the other people who are banning everybody else  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:49 AM i don't know, not sure whose been banned  moneroBoyToday at 2:50 AM they ban instantly anybody who is putting a question asking a question about their direction  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:50 AM ah  moneroBoyToday at 2:50 AM they even banned Robin Linus on telegram, discord and Reddit  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:50 AM lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:50 AM that's why we no longer see any message from Robin Linus  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:51 AM anyone who's damaging to the glorious 'cash cow' Nimiq brand  moneroBoyToday at 2:51 AM exactly. Nimiq was transformed into a scam cash cow for the team  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:51 AM gotta protect your livelyhood  moneroBoyToday at 2:51 AM but they don't want to tell us that they ban the users in a instant. And ask themselves why nobody is joining how could anybody join when they ban everybody  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:52 AM well those who aren't into debt via ICO can thank their lucky stars and most won't even know what NIM is moneroBoyToday at 2:52 AM did you invest also in NET or NIM?  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:52 AM nope  moneroBoyToday at 2:52 AM good to hear this i invested a few thousands into NET and I lost all my hope  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:53 AM wow i think in its hay day, was worth a decent amount before my time though  moneroBoyToday at 2:54 AM i invested in November actually so i lost all my hopes into NET Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:54 AM In Nov?  moneroBoyToday at 2:54 AM 2017  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:54 AM NET had gone by then i thought oh ok  moneroBoyToday at 2:55 AM i was just curious to implement something like coinjoin or even something more complex lik snarks but it looks for me now that this project is dead already and too late for a revival  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:55 AM well it's gonna struggle whilst all crypto is in shite, especially when it doesn't solve the problem BTC has  moneroBoyToday at 2:56 AM yeah, scalability would be an awesome unique selling point for nimiq  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:56 AM but to be honest, the whole global economy is inflated  moneroBoyToday at 2:56 AM especially if they start marketing otherwise they will have major issues  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:56 AM and liable to be taking it up the arse in the near future i think lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:57 AM their seed nodes were offline many times a couple of months ago so their ""scalability"" is so fucked up  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:57 AM oh, that's not good well the hard part was done, when they secured ICO money  moneroBoyToday at 2:57 AM they believe if they pay expensive servers Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:58 AM that's quite an achievement lol  moneroBoyToday at 2:58 AM they won't have issue with the network  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:58 AM no such thing  moneroBoyToday at 2:58 AM yeah, but immagine the poor ICO investors who lost a lot of money  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:58 AM you have design resilience into the core  moneroBoyToday at 2:58 AM i also lost more than money than them investing in nov'17 Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:58 AM yup, doesn't bare thinking about  moneroBoyToday at 2:58 AM their project is so centralized centralized nodes centralized code centralized community directions  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 2:59 AM so, you came into the room to pick up some work and put them back on track?  moneroBoyToday at 2:59 AM centralized updates i was interested to get on their payroll to do something  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:00 AM you could be their 'knight in shining armour'  moneroBoyToday at 3:00 AM for it Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:00 AM yes, that would be nice  moneroBoyToday at 3:00 AM no, need after you told me all the mess  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:00 AM i could use some of that too lol my skills are quite specialised and this sort of work is few and far between the pool server was a good job, nice to design and implement  moneroBoyToday at 3:01 AM they have salaries of over $20,000 per month and they don't give a buck to developers or community members you also developed nimbet.cc isn't it?  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:01 AM they don't need any help yea, i come from a indices betting background, so fancied knocking something up also to showcase my skills and it was quite interesting too be even better if it made money, lol but no one knows about NIM and its currently a mutual betting platform, so needs numerous players to work right  moneroBoyToday at 3:03 AM nim became a dead project, most people just want some price increase to exit the project this is why everybody is just asking marketing  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:03 AM well at the price they are mining / buying.... should it do a BTC, they'll be able to retire lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:03 AM for them to get a 10x and exit the project and never look back  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:04 AM yes, but you cannot market a 'turd' can ya but i'm sure some marketting cannot hurt even if it x10, would be cool and give something back to the investors  moneroBoyToday at 3:04 AM i will tell you why if they do a marketing, it is a pump some people will buy but immediately will be a huge dump to exit the project  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:05 AM yup  moneroBoyToday at 3:05 AM so it the price will drop immediately get got stuck i also believe they buy a lot of NIMs for instance one example Although the premined 7.5% of nims for themselves at the moment they shouldn't have nims avialable cuz they didn't access the vested account but in the Community Project Funding they give 40 millions NIMs from where the heck do they have 40 millions per project while they didn't access the premined coins  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:06 AM i don't know money corrupts people lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:06 AM simple, they buy coins from the market that's why the price never goes down than 18 sats  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:06 AM well they can now, its worth shit lol yea  moneroBoyToday at 3:07 AM it is a dead end of nim and its investors too bad for the ICO investors who lost everything the thing is that they could do a ICO refund they still have 7 millions for the refund  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:08 AM well they'll say that's the risk, x % all off startups fail etc.  moneroBoyToday at 3:08 AM exactly they will post a medium article ""Sorry guys, we have to shut down our operations""  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:08 AM happens all the time, business funds miss-managed, company ends up being worth shit money is never lost, its just moved  moneroBoyToday at 3:08 AM this one is not miss-managed it is turned into a scam it is a difference  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:09 AM yea i'm sure you're right throw your opinions around in the nimiq chat and see how long you last lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:10 AM yeah, i will get an instant ban  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:11 AM would that matter? lol i'd just be happy to do my coding and make a difference, and not be living on the 'bread line' that'd do me lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:13 AM i feel you while they eat sushi and surf every fucking dinner  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:13 AM haha, what a life ehh  moneroBoyToday at 3:14 AM the problem is that they eat sushi scamming ICO investors and developers in the same time like you Neil, LTD, sander and everybody else all other devs and community mods  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:15 AM yea well you gotta look after your own and your interests survival of the fittest hat's off to em but I / we can still be 'fooking' annoyed, lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:17 AM yeah i get you like the guy with beepool he worked so hard and he closed his pool  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:17 AM yea he's nice guy  moneroBoyToday at 3:18 AM it looks you need to be from their hometown to be nice  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:18 AM haha  moneroBoyToday at 3:19 AM if you are not from their hometown you will get screwed by them  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:20 AM maybe, i don't know   moneroBoyToday at 3:24 AM it looks really bad  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:25 AM could be better  moneroBoyToday at 3:25 AM or worst  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:25 AM yea, NIM could go to 0 defo room to go down, lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:26 AM i really believe it can get closed just like the closed NET  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:27 AM well NET still had worth before it was retired I think 1 NET = 100 NIM perhaps? not sure not that NIM was worth much, lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:27 AM yeah it make sense indeed NET was worth something NIM can go literally down to 0  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:28 AM yes, it keeps going lower and lower when I started into NIM, the block reward was around $13 now its $3 some of that is due to BTC / ETH but some due to NIM itself  moneroBoyToday at 3:30 AM it looks really bad just imagine, by end of the year it may worth just $0,3 a block reward  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:31 AM Richy is active in the telegram room why not give him some of your thoughts lol  moneroBoyToday at 3:31 AM i will  Neil | nimbet.ccToday at 3:31 AM at least its some entertainment  moneroBoyToday at 3:32 AM would like to be become an anonymous whisleblower ?

So probably this is the real scenario. The scamers ( the rest of the team nimiq ) got threatened by the Robin ( he is still the head of the foundation and nobody can fire him) that he will unveil the stuff they do in Costa Rica. Did you know that they registered over 5 organisations some companies and other non-profit organizations? So in order to make Robin stop uncovering the truth, they decided to give 1/3 of the funds to the crackhead, Robin Linus. Probably they have like 5 million dollars in funding at maximum. With 1/3 of the funds moved to crackhead Robin, team nimiq will have only 3 millions, so the bankruptcy now will be 100% guaranteed before the end of September when they will shut down the network. At least we will see Philipp in jail and arrested by Christmas. This is the real story about their finances and while they always just forget to explain their real finances.",False

And now they argue this happened so the agreement was terminated (that's why they now say that Robin is no longer a member of the team). Robin probably argues that he did not hurt the project, he just woke everyone up, so he is under the assumption that the agreement is still in place.

First you want to proof their bot was to buy at 2 million usd market cap, but to show that you gave us a chart showing the price of NIM in BTC. As BTC is far from stable to USD, the 2 million USD line should be a curve, not a straight line. Even if this was the correct chart, your line would be crossed by the price in october for a week, which is not the behavior you'd expect from a bot.  Also the factual market cap does not represent you claim. The market cap in early december was touching 1.7 million (according to CMC), so is far less than 2 million. It also stayed below 2 million for several days in early december, which again is not typical bot behavior.  Maybe it's just that around that price, people that trust NIM think the price is too low and will accumulate more?",False

In over 2 years, they only made a report without proofs (there is no proof in that document that they owned that amount of btc and eth as in the report).

They showed us a document that they removed Robin from the project, but this is impossible (another lie) because Robin Linus is the president of the foundation and they simply can't fire Robin from that position. 9. After the document, they just forgot to mention that they commited 1/3 (YES, ONE THIRD) of the ENTIRE ICO MONEY to Robin Linus after they kicked him out from the project. 10. Robin accused them to have really generous salaries and asked them to reduce their salaries down to $80k/month, taking in consideration that the members get paid in nims but also from the ICO money 11.

The foundation in Switzerland and the KYC was done after the ITO was completed done. So by this, they have done a illegality in the United States according to the laws in the States. They had do done KYC before selling the ITO, not after selling the ITO. Regarding the chance, i mentioned 50% done. There are some costs involved in the process to sue them. I know there had been done some success by SEC and convicted people. Here are some examples of successful ICO refunds:   Paragon ( https://www.chepicap.com/en/news/5310/sec-demands-ico-refunds-what-will-this-mean-for-crypto-.html ) https://www.geekwire.com/2018/sec-orders-cryptocurrency-companies-return-money-ico-investors-ground-breaking-settlement/  Quote A pair of cryptocurrency companies have been ordered to offer money back to investors who participated in their initial coin offerings, which should have been registered with federal regulators, marking the latest move in the government’s bid to regulate the often unpredictable and trendy financial market.  The two companies — Paragon Coin and CarrierEQ — came to settlements with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and will each have to pay fines of $250,000. In addition to returning funds to investors, the two companies will have to file financial statements and other documents that give prospective investors a window into the health of the business, a first for an ICO case.  “We have made it clear that companies that issue securities through ICOs are required to comply with existing statutes and rules governing the registration of securities,” Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division said in a statement. “These cases tell those who are considering taking similar actions that we continue to be on the lookout for violations of the federal securities laws with respect to digital assets.”  Paragon, which raised $12 million in a August 2017 ICO, uses blockchain, the de-centralized record keeping technology that is mostly tied to cryptocurrencies, to manage supply chain tracking for the marijuana industry. CarrierEQ, which is also known as Airfox and provides financial services in emerging markets, raised $15 million in an October 2017 ICO.  The SEC orders don’t accuse the firms of fraud, and the companies didn’t admit to or deny the findings in the settlement. The SEC found that the companies’ tokens, the virtual currency used to support the ICOs, should have been registered as securities, or investments that will make returns for investors should the companies be successful.  Blockvest LLC ( https://medium.com/@listoficomarketing/ico-sued-by-sec-for-false-claims-a5774d914f4b )  Centra ICO and Floyd Mayweather  ( https://cryptoslate.com/floyd-mayweather-and-dj-khaled-sued-for-involvement-in-centra-ico-scam/ )  So everything is possible.

Everything that was posted on bitcointalk was absolutely right! I can not believe what my eyes see!!! My mind is just blowing at the moment. Every single sentence written by these people on bitcointalk was totally right. These people Ricardo Barquero (Richy), Philipp von Styp-Rekowsky, Elion Chin, Marvin Wissfeld, Pascal Berrang, Atua Mo’e, Tammo Mamedi, Chris Mo’e, Curd Becker, Sören Schwert, Daniel Mohr, Sui-Ju Chuang (穗如), Sven Buschbeck, Julian Bauer, Jeffrey Esquivel, Sebastian Dietel, Robin Linus, Maximilian Harz, Mauricio Lara, Philipp Tschabold, Arthur Gervais, Amy Zhang  and others are stealing ICO investors money. I will explain how they steal ICO money above.  Robin the Founder of the project who got kicked out from the project, today he posted concerns that confirms all the above statements from the other bitcointalk members that the Nimiq Team is liying and they are stealing money from the ICO investors.  Robin confirmed the following on a post on Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/Nimiq/comments/ado73k/future_of_nimiq/ :  1. The team (especially Richy and other community paid shillers) was lying for over 8 months that Robin was doing a secret cutting-edge research while he lost weight due to drugs abuse. 2. The team always lying that Robin had a drug abuse addiction. 3. They WASH ICO MONEY explaining it in transparency report. Remember the 1.1 million dollar mansion in Costa Rica? Half a million dollar in travels? Right these are washed money that goes directly to their pocket. Probably Elion is the master of this washing process. 4. They use FAKE TRADING BOT for FAKE VOLUME. The Volume is 100% FAKE and they never recognized, but isntead lied that the trading volue is 100% legit. 5. The project will become bankrupt by end of this year. It means that the Nimiq Network will get permanetly shutdown due to high expensive costs and nobody in the project is interested in the project without receiving high bonuses from the team in terms of hundrends of thousands of dollars. 6. The project is dead. 7. The ICO was not done legally according to the US laws in Jully. User yuluxugi32132 explained it correctly in his report on Bitcointalk and I am planning to do Court Actions to retrieve my ETH back from the ICO. It is a total SCAM ICO and the team should be legally responsable by administrating this ICO.  How they steal the money? Simply... they keep the project alive for several months in order to get generous salaries, bonuses and to wash ICO money through expensive travel, food expensive and artificial monthly burning rate. This is the reason why they invested 1.1 million dollars to buy a mansion in Costa Rica, but they never explained this. They always refused to explain to the community members about the ImpactX foundation 2.5% premine (if the foundation exists, who owns it, who administrates it, who received money). This is the reason for a couple of members they spent almost half a million dollar for two international fights between Germany to Costa Rica last year. They are washing legit ICO money to their pocket  A PERSON HAD TO COMMIT SUICIDE IN ORDER FOR THE PROJECT TO REVEAL PARTS OF THE TRUTH. HOW MUCH STUFF WE WILL DISCOVER WE WILL FIND OUT SOON.       Man, I hope you went to heave if you commit the horrendous act to suicide. You shouldn't have done this horrible act by losing money investing into these mother fuckers. I am praying for you that our Lord will forgive you for doing this, and instead to punish the responsible ones.",False

I was right! Nimiq is a dead project and finally the project founder confirmed that NIM will die. It is just a matter of time when this will gonna happen. Richy and the other team members took over the ICO money and over the project from Robin. They just burn its money to make it bankrupt and to keep they remaining funds for themselves. Robin just posted on telegram after 8 months that they still have an ""internal fight"" with other team mebers over the project money and direction. Pretty much the team is clueless about where it should go. Moreover, Richy and he is fellows shillers were always lying that Robin was busy doing research, while the founder of the project was just kicked out from the project Every time I asked something, Richy and other content moderators (paid shillers) they were always lying about the project current funds and that Robin was his doing ""secret research"". We JUST WANT THE TRUTH otherwise the project will gonna die and the ICO investors most probably will ask for a REFUND. Because they founded a legal foundation, the ICO investors can ask in court for a refund of their eth do to the fact that the project was failing and that always richy and other fellows were lying to us.   Robin:      They should better answer to the following questions in their report until Sunday  1. How much money do they still have? 2. Did they buy a 1.1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica? 3. Burning Rate per month ? 4. What is the cost of the infrastructure per month to keep the network alive? 5. When they estimate a bankruptcy? 6. Do they have trading bot for fake volumes? 7. Was Robin Linus kicked out from the project due to the fact that Richy and other members took over the project from him? 8. Is the ImpactX Foundation registered at all? Does it Exist? 9. Who manages ImpactX Foundation premined funds? Richy or who? 10. Why did they not give the ImpactX Foundat premined funds to the charity as they described in the medium white paper. 11. Who manages Nimiq Foundation premined funds ? Richy or who? 12. Why they lie to us ? Like ""oh robin is doing this top-neat research stuff that we will show it to you soon"" 13.

The project is so censored that they introduced a special bot on their Reddit page that bans every newbie on the reddit page. They lost most of the ICO money and they shout to everybody on their telegram channel that everybody is a fudder. The project didn't receive any traction and it is so fucked up. The project is starting to look more like a bitconnect scam. Maybe nimiq was designed to be a bitconnect clone... but with a better story.

Is Bitcoin dead as well?   2. They bought a 1.1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica. Read the fucking transparency report. It shows clearly that now they have a 1.1 million dollar villa describe as an asset. I don't think they bought the villa before the ICO.  They did neither mention they bought a villa, not that they did anything in Costa Rica. All they wrote is that they diversified into real estate.   3. They spent over 5 million dollar in the first year. Probably in 2019 they will spend another 5 million dollars for the software development (RUST, design, etc...) and market study. By the end of the next year, the project will simply be bankrupt and close exactly like Beepool without any warning.  The project can not close. That's by nature in a decentralized network. The team is no longer necessary to run the network or blockchain.   4. Their burning rate per month is higher than 250,000 usd because now it includes extra costs of traveling, more people in the team (they hired a bunch of newbies), marketing boat, etc. Probably for the moment, the burning rate per month is about $350,000.  Might be true, might be false. Still doesn't change a lot.   5. Beepool and Philpool both closed this week due to lack of keeping the joke alive for too much. The project just became worthless and it is just keeping alive. Like internet bubble, there will be a day when we will read a medium post: ""Unfortunately, due to the high cost of the project, we need to shutdown the nimiq network. But still the source will be available on GitHub""   6. Robin lost a lot of weight ( ~ 50kg ) and you can see this by comparing the last videos from April with the really videos. Also there is a huge change in the mindset of Robin and the way he is looking in the camera. Most of the people from the nimiq community believes that Robin lost weight due to the fact that Robin used to consume coke and eventually he became an crack addict. In Central America coke is definitely way cheaper than in other places. This is the simple reason why at the moment Robin (the main guy) is not present in  the videos and he lost a lot of weight  Can you please stop that ""Robin (the main guy)"" thing? The team repeatedly said that they are organized democratically and there is not a single main guy.   7. Somebody proved that the volume of NIM is totally fake. They either run a trading bot by themselves losing money or they paid an exchange to report fake volume to Coin Market Cap  Here is the finding of a user who posted the proof of the volume bot on reddit   https://www.reddit.com/r/Nimiq/comments/9wdkie/nimiq_fake_volume_trading_bot_was_detected_on/  Somebody made accusations. There is no proof and part of his statements were shown to be wrong in the replies.   8. Why they pay shillers at all? The team said in many times that they will never use the shitcoin shillers to shill  Who decides what is a valid advertising strategy with evangelists and what is paying shitcoin shillers? Not you.   9. The active community is less than 30 people. Do you want me to count the active users in the last 30 days? Everybody else left the project for good. Including Robin the main guy  Yes, please count them and list all of them by name here so I can verify your countings. Thanks.   10. The killswitch are the seed nodes. If there wasn't any killswitch why in the world they have seed nodes and they keep them online. Moreover, a few months ago when they used to have problems with the seed nodes many of the users complied on discord that they couldn't use the safe wallet. By the way, the seed nodes cost more than $20,000 per month for the team to maintain it. Why it costs so much? Simply, the project is not salable and it will never be salable. Nimiq just transformed itself into an internet bubble that will pop this year, 2019  You can easily add seed nodes, just as any other altcoin, through the configuration file. You only need a single node to be available to continue operating the network. They provide the seed nodes as an additional service. Where did you get the hosting costs of the seed nodes from? The transparency report has a category for ""Digital Operations, Equipment"", which totals to $239k, which is less than $20k per month, but also includes software licenses, hardware costs and so on.",False

To the best of my knowledge there was no official announcement claiming they bought a villa in costa rica, so everybody saying this is spreading FUD. In general diversifying into more than just currencies is a wise idea, as a financial crisis could easily diminish the value of fiat holdings. If you want to know how exactly this real estate investment works, what are the expected yearly dividends or increase in value or similar details, ask them in a polite fashion here or on Discord or on Telegram. I can't tell you these details, but I also am not an expert in real estate investments, so I just trust them to do something that makes sense (and I guess they are probably getting third-party advice as well before doing a 1 Mio investment).  Best trick to get proper answers is to ask proper questions - don't shout/caps at anyone, don't spread FUD - and you will notice how people start being friendly as well and you don't need to fear being banned.

With their current holdings (according to numbers and projection from transparency report) they could buy give back all the ETH raised and still own some millions   2. They raised 12 million dollars, while the project market cap is only 2 million dollars, but instead they bought a 1.2 million dollar villa in Costa Rica. I didn't know that a villa in Costa Rica is more expensive than a villa in Las Vegas.  - The market cap below book value is an interesting thing and happens in stock markets as well. The general advice by most stock traders is to buy in these cases - but of course stocks work differently than crypto currencies. - I have not read any message that they bought a villa in Costa Rica. Last thing I heard is that the place they're working from (and seen in the videos) is rented. Can you point me to the source of that information?   3. In one year for launching the project, they spent nearly 5 million dollars without doing any marketing. Pretty much they wash ICO money, steady, but surely. Doing marketing will burn all the money.  In the transparency report they claimed to still have about 12 Mio. USD in assets, which is about the same value of their ICO. This is a sign for a good and healthy diversification strategy.   4. They spent so much money on developers, while the developers best app is Nimipet a fucking joker game with 100 users daily.  I think the developer funds are needed to develop the platform, blockchain, technology... Nimiq is not a dapps platform, so it makes no sense to look into dapp success on the platform.   5. At the moment, the burning rate according to their previous report before starting the marketing is 250,000 dollars per month.  I don't know if the 250k figure already contains marketing expenses. Proper marketing is nothing that you turn on and get within an hour or days, it's something that takes months. So it could well be that marketing expenses were already included. In fact their transparency report states that 22% of their expenses were into marketing and community building.   6. A mining pool was closed due to financial troubles aka Philpool. Another mining pool is set to be closed tonight.  It needs a proper financial plan to run a mining pool. That is the same for other currencies. Try to start a bitcoin mining pool and tell me how much you earned vs. how much you paid after one year...   7. Robin (main guy) and founder of the project left the project about 7 months ago. 8. They keep lying that Robin is doing a secret top notch research, while he left the project.  You are claiming this over and over again although it was already stated to be false. If you can't provide any inside info nobody else has that proves your claim, shut it up.   9. The community is full of bots to make us believe that the community telegram is growing. 10. They use a trading bot to create fake volumes and set the market cap at fixed 2 million dollar. 11. Nimiq REAL VOLUME is less than ~ 10,000 dollars, the rest of it is FAKE VOLUME generated by trading bots.  Nice claims, can you prove them? Also, what would be wrong if it is true that they buy back to hold the 2 milling dollar market cap? This gives safety to investors as they won't loose everything if they can always sell at a fixed price.   12. They paid shillers like Shay, the guy from Twitter to shill the shit out of nimiq.  First you complain about them not doing marketing and then you complain about them doing marketing. Also, you lack proof here again...   13. Except 30 people, the rest of the community left the project definitely with huge loses.  I am pretty sure I've seen more than 30 people in the community. I've seen more active users on Discord and the blockchain shows more than 6000 active accounts with a balance of more than 1000 NIM.   14. CPU mining only, while people started mining using GPU rigs for months!!!  Where does it say CPU mining only? I think they were outright honest that at some point there will be GPU miners or even ASICs. They just chose their algorithm in a way that makes them not 10 times more efficient. In fact, numbers from GPU miners suggest that their Hashrate/Watt is similar to good CPUs.   15. With their current stats they will become bankrupt. It will be exactly an ""internet bubble"" company and all nims will go to dust! They just need to press the killswitch  Technically, there is no killswitch. Most of the nodes running in the network are not hosted by the Nimiq Team. The fact that, due to their browser technology, every browser becomes a node in the network, results in it being pretty much impossible to turn off all nodes, because it is so incredibly easy and lightweight to start one.",False

ICO price was 1 ETH for 175 NET. ICO price was $1.30USD per 100NIM, it means ICO price for 1 NIM = 0,013 USD. Now the price of NIM is 0.000806. Do the math yourself. It is 16x times smaller than the ICO price. If you had invested 100, now your investment is worth 16 dollars. What a great deal!  2. They bought a 1.1 million dollar villa in Costa Rica. Read the fucking transparency report. It shows clearly that now they have a 1.1 million dollar villa describe as an asset. I don't think they bought the villa before the ICO.  https://i.imgur.com/O9NMPQ4.png  3. They spent over 5 million dollar in the first year. Probably in 2019 they will spend another 5 million dollars for the software development (RUST, design, etc...) and market study. By the end of the next year, the project will simply be bankrupt and close exactly like Beepool without any warning.  4. Their burning rate per month is higher than 250,000 usd because now it includes extra costs of traveling, more people in the team (they hired a bunch of newbies), marketing boat, etc. Probably for the moment, the burning rate per month is about $350,000.  5. Beepool and Philpool both closed this week due to lack of keeping the joke alive for too much. The project just became worthless and it is just keeping alive. Like internet bubble, there will be a day when we will read a medium post: ""Unfortunately, due to the high cost of the project, we need to shutdown the nimiq network. But still the source will be available on GitHub""  6. Robin lost a lot of weight ( ~ 50kg ) and you can see this by comparing the last videos from April with the really videos. Also there is a huge change in the mindset of Robin and the way he is looking in the camera. Most of the people from the nimiq community believes that Robin lost weight due to the fact that Robin used to consume coke and eventually he became an crack addict. In Central America coke is definitely way cheaper than in other places. This is the simple reason why at the moment Robin (the main guy) is not present in  the videos and he lost a lot of weight  7. Somebody proved that the volume of NIM is totally fake. They either run a trading bot by themselves losing money or they paid an exchange to report fake volume to Coin Market Cap  Here is the finding of a user who posted the proof of the volume bot on reddit https://i.redd.it/symin6g57wx11.png  https://www.reddit.com/r/Nimiq/comments/9wdkie/nimiq_fake_volume_trading_bot_was_detected_on/  8. Why they pay shillers at all? The team said in many times that they will never use the shitcoin shillers to shill  9. The active community is less than 30 people. Do you want me to count the active users in the last 30 days? Everybody else left the project for good. Including Robin the main guy  10. The killswitch are the seed nodes. If there wasn't any killswitch why in the world they have seed nodes and they keep them online. Moreover, a few months ago when they used to have problems with the seed nodes many of the users complied on discord that they couldn't use the safe wallet. By the way, the seed nodes cost more than $20,000 per month for the team to maintain it. Why it costs so much? Simply, the project is not salable and it will never be salable.

Why he doesn't post anything on facebook, on twitter, on GitHub ( absolutely no commits) NOTHING.    There is a transparency report at https://medium.com/nimiq-network/transparency-report-74d4d89933fe - as you used the term and numbers from it, I guess you already know about that. I don't think it is necessary for them to publish a report every week, the last one is not even 4 months old. Using the numbers there and considering the changes in BTC and ETH prices as well as their monthly burn rate, I estimate they should at least own about 8 Mio. USD worth of assets - even with a way higher burn rate, that will still be enough for more than a year and they will also get their additional NIM released every 6 months, so nothing to fear about right now.  Totally false. The numbers in the document are at end of July ( ~ 20/08/2017). Now it is almost end of 2018. So there had been over 4 months. I am just asking for a new report about their financial statement due to the fact, we believe the project will become bankrupt next year by 2 reasons. The fall of the crypto market (and their assets as well) and the high burning rate ~ 250-300k usd per month.",False

Even if we consider all their crypto assets of end of July worthless (they definitely are not) and assume they won't be able to get rid of their real estate, then they still have 5 Mio USD in Fiat. 5 Mio / 250k/month = 20 months of funds beginning in July, so even with these strong assumptions and assuming no other incomes (they receive NIM through the network) the money will be enough until at least Feb 2020 - and I bet they will find a way to reduce costs should it become necessary.",False

Dedicated servers will always mine more efficiently than, let's say your mobile or laptop. So you can still mine and earn some NIM (just like with a faucet) but if you are serious about mining you should consider installing a native nimiq node for your OS, is not that hard either .",False

Quote from: Cryptotenuse on July 18, 2018, 10:25:44 AM There are rumours that the Nimiq team may be behind a hack + 51% attack against Webdollar, seen as a competitor in browser mining. Of course these are only rumors, but these things are now debated in the webdollar thread. I fully agree with Wekkel. I find this team really honest and can't imagine them ruining their image. However, we can't prove anything, whether it's true or false. I just had a look to the Webdollar website and Bitcointalk announcement thread. Well, I'm not sure I would trust them. The community manager is almost agressive when people criticize their project (I mean, by pointing out real problems), the website is not smooth at all... So in one word: the opposite of Nimiq. Only good point, they didn't do an ICO, that's a good thing for them, but if they just copied the code from Nimiq... I didn't verified this, though. I don't think we should give credit to this project, and I don't think the Nimiq team would risk their reputation to ruin a project that is not going to work anyway.",False

I didn't check for you, but there are several ways to know it.  If it doesn't have AVX2, then use the latest release (1.1.3). If not, I guess you should use the v 1.0.0 (fast or extreme) but I'm really sure.  To verify if it's working properly, the compat version 1.0.0 makes around 2x more than the browser official miner. So with the last version, it should be more. Running Linux, the version 1.0.0 makes around 3/4x the browser hashrate, and the last version (still on Linux) makes 4/5x the browser's hashrate.

Are you trying to FUD?.  NIM is not Ethereum based, there are no Smart Contracts in the Nimiq Blockchain. Nimiq Exchange Token (ERC20 Token used to Activate NIM) is based in Ethereum. when you use your NET to activate NIM you send the NET to an Ethereum Burn Addresse. We took a snapshot of the Ethereum Network a few Days ago (cut-off date) and all people that had to activate NIM used NET will receive their funds immediately the moment we Launch. NIM that were not activated will have to be activated by us and will remain in our control until the NET Holders use NET to activate them (they have up to 6 months to do so).",False

Our KYC provider is currently used by businesses like Coinbase and Bittrex, where the data of the users is also very sensitive. We are paranoid about security too and we are trying everything in our hands to keep the information of users safe.   i know you try to make me mad by calling me uninformed but you see me throwing around facts and carefull selected questions you cant seem to able awnser.  thats exactly what we need now, people with opinions. thats the only way stuff gets regulated the right way.  but i know using a 3rd party provider saves you so much work and money that there is no way in these times that you could do this yourself. or could you? and maybe save the data securely encrypted inside of your chain. but why bother, its just the legal status of nimiq, lets hand this over to a 3rd party. noone can blame us if we loose the data.  And again, this is plain, unaltered, out-of-the-box FUD  . You are saying we are giving information to a third party so we avoid responsibility in case of data loss? No, we most definitively are not.  As I stated before, using a third party KYC provider is the safe and responsible thing to do. It is madness to think a Blockchain Startup would dedicate time and effort building a one-time-only KYC infrastructure!. We would not be able to focus on what we do: Native Payment Protocol to the Web. It is, from all points of view, the wisest decision to use a provider who actually dedicates to the complex business of ID verification and anti-money laundering filtering. It is super delicate too, and these guys have been doing it for years with sensitive information like passports verification for flights and crypto platforms. If you analyze it objectively I think the decision makes a lot of sense.

We want to be the leading payment protocol for the Web, this is a totally different field than Ethereum, these are different times than the time when Ethereum launched, and more importantly, we are a whole different project. In the future we might need to partner with E-commerce sites, Web Platforms, International Community, and... who know what new technologies will emerge in the future.

Nimiq Foundation (you) sells the ERC-20 token for promise of future NIM Coins on Nimiq Network (browser based blockchain, no cryptocurrency). Nimiq Foundation (you) create the Nimiq Network. Nimiq Foundation (you) set the parameter to issue NIM Coins to miners. Nimiq Foundation (you) are the first to mine...  now there are two ways to look at the next step: 1. you BUY BACK OUR ERC-20 Token for your NIM coin at a fixxed rate, actually, your are my customer and i dont want kyc from you. 2. we call it exchange, i change my NET Token on Ethereum for NIM on Nimiq.

Nimiq Network continues to create NIM Coin, issued to miners (anonymous users of the nimiq network)  now i dont know your numbers, lets say 20% of all users are KYC victims (very high risk of getting identity stolen). 80% anon users at mainnet.  whatever happens on the nimiq network is ultimately nimiq foundations creation. each NIM created by the automated process of creating nim for work on the network is issued by the NIMIQ foundation.  now if you say you can only exchange NIM for NET if we provide KYC ultimately means that in future you, HAVE TO get KYC from EACH and EVERY user of the NIMIQ Network because each address holds a share of the networks wealth. it can only be used if people provide kyc. simple as that. imagen you are the new visa, visa work without documents? no.  but if you say ""we buy back your NET for our NIM"" then KYC is no issue. dont forget, there is no law and we have to work on creating laws for crypto/blockchain/ico that work. kyc in this case is only a ""lets go the save route"" for current laws that dont apply to the situation, which may destroy your reputation.  one of the biggest issue is that you want a 3rd party to controll the kyc data. your security doesnt matter here. kyc data will be stolen or sold at one point in time.

Nimiq is an open source payment protocol and our main goal is for it to be the native payment protocol of the web and we do trust our legal team is aligned with the same vision. If you want to enter into a debate based on your opinions about KYC and wikipedia links you are very welcome to do so, but it just has nothing to do with our project.   Quote from: Nimiq on February 16, 2018, 07:37:16 AM Quote from: polylogic on February 16, 2018, 01:52:42 AM now there are two ways to look at the next step: 1. you BUY BACK OUR ERC-20 Token for your NIM coin at a fixxed rate, actually, your are my customer and i dont want kyc from you.  I don't understand why you think this is some kind of vendor/customer relationship.  what kind of relationship is this then?  Nimiq is an open source project and users who participated in our Crowdsale are supporters of the project. We do care a lot about our community and also have in our main interest the success of the project.  you maybe dont know it yet or you cant accept it, but google kyc, you will see.. once you go that route you cannot go back. im just trying to help.    if someone from the us invested in NET it should be his/her problem, not the problem on Nimiq. he/she is supposed to know that he/she is not allowed to invest in oversea projects. you cant be responsible for their action and for this dont have to put any borders on your crowdsale.  But we did.... I really feel like you are very much uninformed  First paragraph in 'NET (Token) Creation and Crowdsale Terms'... in bold with a bigger font size than the rest of the document  'IF YOU ARE A CITIZEN, RESIDENT, OR GREEN CARD HOLDER OF THE UNITED STATES OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SALE, YOU CANNOT TAKE PART IN THE CROWDSALE, SO PLEASE DO NOT CONTRIBUTE IN THE CROWDSALE.'  We publicly commented from the beginning: US CITIZENS ARE NOT ALLOWED.  We blocked all IPs coming from the US to our website.  We included a paragraph about personal information:  'We may determine, for regulatory compliance purposes, that it is necessary to obtain certain information about you in order to comply with applicable laws or regulations in connection with accepting contributions to create and allocate NET to you or transfer NET to NIM. You agree to provide us such information promptly upon request.'  If you have any other questions please let me know, but I think you are mainly against KYC itself. We are not fans either but again, it is something we are required to do for the sake of the project. Thanks for your support ",False

The server itself usually runs multiple Virtual Machines in order for the cloud provider to cover hardware costs. This results in a share of CPU and memory in virtual machines even if you (as the customer) don't see that. So performance could be slower than having your own server for example.

They are advertising to a bunch of people who watch vlogs, they don't know what bitcoin is or any alt coins,  Nimiq is trying to compete with DASH which has a very similar strategy but Nimiq's is far less influential due to it being marketed by vloggers with 1.  Not a ton of subscribers, 2.  The videos do not inspire confidence in your average Joe on why they need to get involved, 3. You are not expanding who is talking about Nimiq.  Nimiq is a sleeping giant right now, it has potential to be the next DASH but they really need to start investing their money in other outlets to get the word out.  They are literally advertising their coin to the same people + a few new people every video.  Look for new channels to get the word out, you have until December to get more people on board and after that you have nothing to get more people except the people who adopted it before.  The success of Nimiq rides on the adoption of it and the more people you get hyped pre-launch the more solidified longevity of the project.  Don't get me wrong Atua makes decent videos on the project but you really need to spread the word through other ways.  Don't preach to the choir, preach to the sinners.  A great example of a ""successful"" advertising campaign that really used word of mouth to their advantage is dogecoin.  Although the coin failed due to lack of vision and improvements, everyone backed it because everyone was talking about it.  It had such huge potential to harness this and move the coin to being a legitimate currency and it was thrown away.  You guys have the concept and the vision, you just need the backing of thousands/millions and the only way you are going to get there is if you spread the word.  Sorry for the wall of text but I hope this helps Nimiq pivot in a positive direction.  Regards, A friendly Nimiq investor",False

Nimiq aims to do with the whole Cryptocurrency space what GoogleDocs is doing to Microsoft Office and other Office Suites. Nimiq is disruptive, we think out of the box so it is difficult to compare us with any existing project  Our approach is quite different from Dash, we aim for simplicity and mass adoption by using the following features:  - Nimiq is written in Javscript which enables it to be fully Browser based. You can run a full node in your Browser. - You don't need to install any software or application to start using Nimiq. Just visit a Webpage - All transactions in the Nimiq Network are truly instant and low-fee. Not just using Masternodes (which arguably brings centralization to a decentralized network). We use an approach based in Lightning Network to achieve this features. - Nimiq's Blockchain is the smallest more compact (which makes it more secure) Blockchain, this enables browsers to download sync information and achieve true consensus in seconds. - Nimiq Blockchain is the easiest Cryptocurrency to develop with. Proof of that  are the community applications already built using Nimiq. Like: Nimiq Chrome Extension, Nimiq Faucet, Nimiq Blockchain Explorer, among others. Its as easy as this.",False

Our Browser-based approach aims to lower barriers of entry for users, developers and merchants.  Users: Browser-based means that it runs completely in your Browser without any installation required (check Betanet). The first time you open a Nimiq Wallet with your browser, it will create and store a wallet securely in your Browser. Yyou can export/import your keys. The only way of erasing them is by removing the offline data of your Browser. It also make possible features like Cashlinks: Transfer Nimiq within a simple URL that you can send in WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, etc. The users who opens the link will be redirected to his very Browser Wallet and NIM will be added to his Balance.    Developers: The code for the Nimiq Blockchain is public and completely written in Javascript. This way most developers are empowered to build applications using Nimiq. Nimiq will validate the security of community applications but we encourage community memmbers to contribute. Some examples of community applications: Nimiq Faucet, Nimiq Block Explorer, Nimiq Chrome Extension.  Merchants: We plan to create an entire Ecosystem of applications that will make it easy for any Merchant to accept Nimiq. One of the core applications of the Nimiq Ecosystem is the Peer-To-Peer Exchange which aims to serve as a frictionless platform to easily get in and out of Nimiq. Check our Blog for more.",False

You basically just need your browser , connect it to Nimiq blockchain then it will start mining. Coins mined in the Betanet have no value as they will release their product by Q4 of this year.

Feel free to ask questions- here’s the rundown:  We participate in a lot of ICOs. We also typically sell half of what we buy to exchanges. Given that on-going experience, we decided to experiment with what I believe is the ideal use-case for Ethereum smart contracts: Selling locked tokens on a futures/IOUs basis. We’ll also be posting some instant exchange/token sales in the future.  The idea is that we’ll be providing a safer alternative to HitBTC’s IOU service in a manner that doesn’t require fees, an account, or worry about whether or not they’ll actually come through with their IOU. The smart contracts I’ve deployed ensure that the buyer’s ETH is ONLY released to me/the seller AFTER it can confirm that the contract’s token balance is adequate enough to fulfill all purchased IOUs. There’s also a time-based mechanism in place that allows buyers to withdraw their ETH in the event the tokens don’t get delivered on time.  Our initial test with 50,000+ PAY (TenX) was a huge success and sold out quickly. We followed up listing MetalPay (MTL).  Both sales went without any issues.  We put together a site listing our active sales and information on how the smart contracts work. The code has been audited, but if anyone has any concerns about it or finds any issues, please contact me ASAP.  I’d also love to hear any feedback about my intention to give people the opportunity to lock in their positions on tokens they were not able to secure during ICOs, before they hit the exchanges.

We believe no cryptocurrency has actually solved the problem of mass adoption, you don't see people paying with Bitcoin their coffee at starbucks or buying groceries with them. We aim to remove this problem by solving the technical issues that inhibits mass adoption and reducing the technical barriers of cryptocurrencies to merchants, users and developers.  Since our launch our community of developers have been growing and 2 applications have already been built: Block Explorer and Faucet  (not by us, by the community using our source code ).  We are not developing a Browser Miner, we are developing the Bitcoin-On-Steroids that Humanity deserves to actually make Cryptocurrencies usable to the entire world. You can see we are on the right track because of all the interest support we already have from developers. They understand our huge potential.",False

Browsers are one of the more secure, better tested and more used applications by users. We are not creating a Browser, we are using the momentum Browsers have with all kind of users (techy or not) to be able to mine, send, receive Nimiq transactions without any installation. We are also using messaging applications like Whatsapp, Telegram, WeChat and Slack to enable CashLinks: Links that when accessed by users will create a new wallet in your browser (if there is no wallet yet) and credit the Nimiq to that account.  The potential is huge, no other Blockchain is actually native to the Internet. The web is a common factor that almost every Developer already masters. Developers of all kind are learning why coding applications using our Blockchain is easiest than ever and requires no additional software or installation other than the user's own browser.",False

We are going to use a memory-bound hashing algorithm which has memory latency as its main variable for hasing power. This would mean that each browser stands a chance and leads to a more decentralized Network. But even though we expect browser will stand a chance while mining Nimiq in the Mainnet we also anticipate for miners to build dedicated miners. Mining difficulty is determined by the amount of miners in the network so it would be adjusted accordingly.  Nimiq Browser Miner is just a demo of what the Nimiq Blockchain technology can do.  Nimiq aims for mass adoption by lowering the technical barriers for users, merchants and developers. Nimiq is coded in JavaScript so learning to code with Nimiq is easy.

From the perspective of a ""mom""  1. why so high a price in the sale?   You guys are expecting a ~$17 price per NIM?   -$300 ETH value gets 175 NET ($1.714/NET)   -Then on exchange/conversion would have 17.5 NIM ($17.14/NIM)  $17.14 NIM seems crazy when (under your beta) I can get 5 NIMs in under a day to start.  Even assuming the reward rate drops very quickly, I think I could make this up with way less than $17 in energy costs per NIM early on.  You guys have a fantastic idea that I'd be happy to support in a sale, but the value terms are not making sense to me.  2.  Your whitepaper says 5 NIMIQ block reward to start.  Is that correct? (vs beta's 50 NIMIQ reward)  3.   What was the decision process in following BTC's 21m supply (particularly if the block time is 10x)?    Related, what do you guys envision for the token's use case? (store of value only, daily usage, micro transactions?)  If it's not for micro-transactions I'm in the more is better supply camp for a couple of reasons - *More supply = lower price per token.  From a trading perspective, people find something inherently attractive in a low token price because a whole token is easily affordable.   Moms don't want to brag they own .4333 of a NIM.  Moms want to say, hey I bought a NIM! *Moms and Dads hate math!   If you want a coin to be used in daily life, then you force moms to do more thinking if NIM price is high (i.e. a $3 coffee is $0.15 if NIMIQ is $20, but $0.0015 if it's $2000).  Sadly, this is a problem for people - no one wants to get a calculator out for every purchase to make sure the decimals are right. *Larger numbers of tokens generated in each block.  Moms see big results! (even with no value difference!) *Since you are 10X faster block halving than Bitcoin, you may get very quickly to a point where the mining results are very very slow.  If your goal is to get a big distributed miner base, do you think people would give up?  Moms don't like to wait!)  4. Suggestion - is it possible to have a progress icon showing how close you are to getting the reward?   Moms are  impatient - they may give up if they don't see anything happening after a few hours ...",False

This is probably best explained in the medium post concerning our longer term roadmap: https://medium.com/nimiq-network/intended-use-of-funds-part-3-roadmap-1c966cdc0ec2   - Which projects will use this product? This is partly explained by the long term roadmap. But the main point is that we envision a complete ecosystem to grow around Nimiq. And there comes another advantage of nimiq: Since it is written in JavaScript, one of the most prominent programming languages, everyone can participate! I already saw a link to the blockchain explorer here, a project that was created independently by an interested community member. Furthermore, we aim at keeping our code as clean and understandable as possible, so that some understanding of JavaScript and our public API suffices to build great web-apps around Nimiq.   - Are there partnerships with companys? Yes, as we outlined in one of our medium posts, we plan to partner with VISA payment services to create a VISA-to-Nimiq exchange. But we are also looking into many more potential partnerships.   - Is there any real use case except to send nimiq from one wallet to another? Just to mention one: One of our goals is also to facilitate over-the-counter payments via Nimiq. As the ecosystem around Nimiq grows, of course, there will be plenty of other use cases. This is also something where we happily accept input of our community! We are also implementing light clients, allowing a much faster synchronisation. So, there is no need for intermediaries anymore and the blockchain truly lives in your browser.   can anyone on the betanet send me a few Nimiq? I'll try sending it back afterwards, would like to see how it works This question brings me to another great example of the projects that can be built around Nimiq. Another community member already implemented a faucet, available here: https://faucet.nimiq.io   What's will happen with test NIMIQ which will mined now? Burned ? Yes, as the disclaimer states, test Nimiq can be reset at any time and will be reset before the mainnet launch. But there is a bonus program: If you collected 1000 Nimiq, you can receive a Nimiq T-Shirt! Details about that will be made available soon!",False

Could you also explain how you decide to make 1 nim cost around 15$ for the ICO ?  Also when you say on reddit ""but we think we already ""hyped"" enough to do our token sale and for the moment that's rather important to make sure we don't run out of money"" it may seems like you are making this ICO in a rushy way.

We currently use SHA256 in the Betanet and are still doing some tests with different memory-bound PoW algorithms regarding efficiency and support.  On memory-bound hashes, the mining speed is bound by the memory latency. GDDR5 memory on latest graphic cards does not have a relevant latency benefit (if at all) compared to DDR3/DDR4 which is used by the CPU. We'll have to try it out, but our target is to be solely memory-latency-bound because this will reduce power consumption of miners (basically putting your CPU into waiting for memory most of the time).

To be safe from scams and fraud, ONLY trust information or links you find by first going to https://nimiq.com as SINGLE AND SECURE POINT OF ENTRY (manually enter https://nimiq.com in the address bar of your browser window).  Our official communication will always and only ask you to first go to https://nimiq.com and describe where to go from there to perform a certain action    Nimiq The Browser-based Blockchain      GitHub | Blog | Discord | Telegram | Twitter | YouTube | Reddit | Webpage    Overview    As the first blockchain built as native to the web platform, Nimiq lowers that barriers to entry for blockchain technology and makes it significantly more accessible for the mainstream.   Current available cryptocurrencies are complicated to use and counterintuitive for the average person. Further decentralization is difficult if access to blockchain technology is limited to technically skilled people.     Nimiq is designed to be used by everybody   Nimiq is the only blockchain created and designed specifically for mainstream adoption.  Features of conventional blockchain that inhibit mass adoption:  Blockchain data around 100 GB, which means synchronization time could take up to an entire day Software installation is absolutely necessary At least 10 minutes for transactions and high cost in micro payments    Nimiq is designed with simplicity and mainstream adoption in mind:  Nimiq dramatically reduces the amount of download data required to sync by using NIPOPOWs and the mini blockchain scheme: Nano clients synchronize in seconds with any device that supports a recent Browser. Nimiq is written in JavaScript, which is the native language of the world wide web, so no additional software installation is required.     Nimiq Ecosystem   The Nimiq Protocol enables an easy-to-use ecosystem running directly in your browser without the need of installing additional software--in line with our vision of widespread accessibility and adoption.   Miner   The Nimiq Miner can be used by anyone with a modern browser. Browser mining pools provide a steady reward for devices with low hashpower. Installation packages are provided for Windows and Linux.  Safe   The Nimiq Safe is accessible by the web, including support for Ledger Hardware Wallets (in approval process).   Account Avatar   Account avatars (Identicons) help the user visually distinguish one account from another. Each account is identified by an IBAN-like account number that has the ability of detecting misspellings. Both features are designed to protect users from typos and scams.     Specifications  Block time: 1 minute (inspired by the results of ""On the Security and Performance of Proof of Work Blockchains""). Total supply: 21 billion tokens divisible by 10⁵ resulting in 21e14 satoshis, identical to Bitcoin. Block reward: Starting from 4405 NIM and decreasing in a curved fashion—inspired by Monero and Cryptonote—until 4000 satoshi have reached. The Remaining NIM will be rewarded in a linear fashion until the total supply. Max Block size: 140 kB Difficulty adjustment: Each Block.    Nimiq Non-Profit  As established and promised by the creators, there are two accounts vesting over 10 years with 2% and 2.5% respectively of total final amount of NIM:   Nimiq Foundation supporting the long-term financing of the Nimiq project:  Contract Number: NQ09 VF5Y 1PKV MRM4 5LE1 55KV P6R2 GXYJ XYQF  Contract Account Balance: 525'000'000 NIM   Nimiq Charity supporting projects of high social and ecological impact:  Contract Number: NQ19 YG54 46TX EHGQ D2R2 V8XA JX84 UFG0 S0MC  Contract Account Balance: 420'000'000 NIM",False
