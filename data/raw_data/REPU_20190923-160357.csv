Especially if they are angry. Let's say 20 hotel customers had a bad experience. 15 of them rate the hotel 0 stars, while from the other 980 customers who thought it was OK only 5 bother rating 3 to 5 stars.  The other problem is the opposite. If you have thousands of ratings the most extreme ratings disappear in the statistics. But those extreme ratings contain the most important information. Let's say most bank customers don't really read the small print of a loan they got, they're happy enough they got it at all and rate the bank 4/5. Only 3 customers notice misleading terms in the documents and rate the bank 0 stars, but are completely averaged away by the happy customers ratings.",False

AI first and then followed by manual filtration. The quality of this platform will depend on these things.  Quote We have several stages of reviews verification: - At first, we are using an AI machine moderation, that analyses more then 50 parameters, such as tone analyzer, IP, geolocation, reviews frequency etc. - Some of the reviews automatically declined by the system, some of them will get manual filtration. - Second important part - is user rating in the system - it consists of overall score, age of account, number of ratings given for others. If user has low rating or if its newbie in the system, the more filters are provided to his/her rating. - Third part is that we are limiting the number of rating, which can post one account per day/week/month. It depends of user rating.  During pre-alpha-testing all of these factors showed 95% of fraud detection. But this is only pre-alpha and we are still working with the algorithms Smiley",False

This is something i hope they already kept into acxount because there will be all sort of manipulations otherwise  I already asked a similar question. It is something they will need to have a solution for. The more important such a reputation is, the more ways people will try to find to abuse or manipulate the system.  We have several stages of reviews verification: - At first, we are using an AI machine moderation, that analyses more then 50 parameters, such as tone analyzer, IP, geolocation, reviews frequency etc. - Some of the reviews automatically declined by the system, some of them will get manual filtration. - Second important part - is user rating in the system - it consists of overall score, age of account, number of ratings given for others. If user has low rating or if its newbie in the system, the more filters are provided to his/her rating. - Third part is that we are limiting the number of rating, which can post one account per day/week/month. It depends of user rating.  During pre-alpha-testing all of these factors showed 95% of fraud detection. But this is only pre-alpha and we are still working with the algorithms Smiley  95% is a lot considering that they wer pre alpha tests, what is your approach to get to near 100% ? It's possible to reach the 99% mark? I'm surprise that the results are already that high, the algorithms is very developed. When the finish it should de close to 100%.  To tell the truth - we cannot guarantee 100% protection, like no one does. But we’ll do your best to reach about 99%. Speaking about deleting reviews from blockchain - we won’t delete them, their will be disabled in users profile and marked as fraud.",False

RepuCoin is a cryptocurrency, which is awarded to users who provide ratings within the system.  So, as companies will constantly require tokens to pay for platform services, as well as to pay users for their ratings - it is most convenient for them to accept this token, in order to pay for their services and / or goods. Thus, companies simply need to accept payment from users in tokens or provide a discount for any product / service, in return for REPU tokens.  On the one hand, this will allow users to spend tokens that they earned for providing ratings in the real world, without exchanging them for fiat money or other cryptocurrencies, and on the other hand for companies - without constantly depositing fiat money. The benefit for the platform is the growth of the exchange rate, in proportion to the growth in the number of companies, which accept tokens for their services / goods. The basis for the price increase of REPU tokens will be a growth in the number of users, as well as an increase in the number of companies that will use the platform to manage their company’s reputation. The more users will use the platform in everyday",False
