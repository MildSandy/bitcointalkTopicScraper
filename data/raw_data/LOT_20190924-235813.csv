That's really strange. Is there still a discrepancy? Because if so, it may be due to where MetaMask is looking for your LOT balance. The LOT smart-contract itself is the sole source of truth re LOT holdings. As such, whatever the balance the smart-contract says you have, is the balance you have.     However, this page still shows your balance being lower by 400 LOT. It's almost certainly due to a discrepancy on etherscan's side, since every token transaction made with a non-ERC20 token show's this warning:   Which occurs because the LOT isn't an ERC20 token at all. The tokens are still transferred correctly, only a different event is fired in the LOT's ERC223's case.    Edit:  Upon visiting etherscan.io/address/0xc8c6618e0fFdb0feDb49385A3dC26845A2179865 - ie, your account's page, looking at the token's tab showed 68050 LOT. Then at the bottom, on clicking ""Read Contract"", and pasting your address into the ""Balances"" form, in order to query the actual contract, the contract returned 68450 LOT. And suddenly the value at the top also updated to read 68450 too!  This page is still showing the wrong balance however. So it's definitely something strange going on via etherscan. Metamask clearly looks at this page too if it's displaying the incorrect, lower amount (which makes sense, not having to poll the chain...), and so was displaying the wrong balance in this instance. Not terribly user-friendly!  So, the take home message is that whatever the LOT smart-contract itself says is gospel, so don't worry, you have your tokens. W/r/t Metamask and the token page showing the wrong balance, we'll keep digging and see what we can find out...",False

With regards to provability, ours comes from the fact that the entire of the raffle functionality takes place on chain. This, in addition to the transactions also being etched in to the chain where our fairness comes from. Not only can you see how our random numbers are generated (by lightning no less!) but also how they are stored, how a users numbers are compared to the winning numbers, and how in the event of a win the prizes are calculated using the actual odds which are baked into the smart-contract. You can literally read the code that's running on chain and see what it's doing. We are hiding nothing.  Better still, because of the recursion in the smart-contract, you can see that none of the above requires any any human involvement at all. All the other blockchain lotteries out there obfuscate these processes, and or require a person (and so a centralized, single source of failure) to make happen. We do not. It's all laid out there, in the contract, for anyone to go and look at.

The current contract re-write that the update hinted at earlier is now in a far more functional programming style (which strictness lends itself to blockchain security). And so because much of the contract has now been converted to ""pure"" or ""view"" functions they are much simpler to unit test directly in Solidity itself (or in Go when automating).

Looking at the contract we can see your transaction that errored, and the successful one a few minutes later - and we have figured out what happened!  It seems it was an unlucky coincidence! At around the time you made your first transaction yesterday, the ticket price was raised to reflect the now lower price of Ethereum in dollars. And during the time you were making your entry (those six minutes you mentioned above!) was when the ticket price went up. So your transaction was for only 0.002ETH and the ticket price had become 0.003ETH meaning the transaction was reverted!   Quote from: sjyi on April 03, 2018, 04:23:39 AM The ticket price was deducted from my wallet.     Looking at the contract & you account, you can see that the price for this failed transaction was not taken from your account.   The transaction still exists and still shows up in your wallet as an outgoing one, but because it failed (and hence the red exclamation mark !), the ETH was never moved, so don't worry! You did however lose just under $0.01 in gas fees. So because of that, and because of a) Your good feedback and b) Your patience, we sent you 0.003ETH to cover your ticket price!   Thank you for playing Etheraffle and buying tickets - good luck!
