Without the tokens, the revenue of TeleX AI would be in BTC, ETH and other cryptocurrencies in which the users pay a fee. We abstracted our revenue and tokenized it, thus it made us available to accept ‘pre-orders.’ With cryptocurrencies involved, our example is complex. As a clearer example, think of a carpenter who wants to open her shop to make and sell wooden boxes but who lacks the capital to attain the means of production. She then takes pre-orders; in other words, she sells the boxes before she makes them. To do this, in exchange for the money she receives, she gives the creditors a token with which they can redeem boxes later. The tokens, in this case, is just like in-store currencies or casino chips. Our case is no different than that; we will provide services and accept TLX as payment, and we are selling TLX before they are actually usable – thus, a presale.  How TLX differs from in-store currencies is that in-store currencies are just one way of payment, whereas TLX will be the only way of payment. How TLX differs from casino chips is that the issuer of casino chips has practically an unlimited supply of chips, so it is not expected for casino chips to rise in price, whereas the total supply of TLX is limited, so it may have a floating price, thereby opening the gates for speculative operations.  Click for the full interview: https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/interview-with-can-soysal-telex-ai-451953  Apart from this, I believe TeleX AI will be a friend in many people's contact list whether or not they use the bot for trading or as a wallet. Maybe they will just want to see how it works; or maybe they'll use it to track coin prices. And the fact that the bot is able to send direct messages to many crypto-related people's Telegram, Facebook and WeChat accounts can be monetized in various ways.",False

Some of the funds will be stored in exchanges such as Bitfinex, and the highest possible account security measures will be taken. The entry points to the servers which hold the keys to withdraw funds from the pooled wallets will be severely restricted to eliminate any possible attack vector; those servers will communicate with a number of allowed IPs and no one else (site-to-site IPSec VPN with level 5 encryption).
