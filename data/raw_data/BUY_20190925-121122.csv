Quote Thank you for your insightful post. Let us try and address the points raised.  1. On venture funding - yes we are pursuing that angle and you are right, we too believe institutional funding is important for our project. BitCoinTalk is simply being the vehicle to introduce this project to the crypto community at large, and one of several avenues to increase awareness of our platform.  2. In terms of acquisition costs and business model - the team behind this business has built 33 successful e-Commerce businesses with 9 digit exits multiple times so we don't come from a place of ignorance or shortsightedness, rather experience and a long term vision and plan. Many businesses use methods to entice customers to try their service e.g. NetFlix - 1st month free, etc. So, our enticement is the same vein. We have other benefits built into the system to help customer retention beyond the acquisition phase for long term engagement.  3. In terms of grammar, we welcome your critique and if there are areas where it could be improved, kindly contact our team and we are more than happy to address it. However, do note that your very first sentence in your critique has a grammatical error, ""ICOs"", not ""ICO's"" - the latter is a possessive. So, prior to criticizing others kindly check your own grammar. Like i said, we are open to input and will refine the paper if need be.  Thank you again for your feedback.",False
