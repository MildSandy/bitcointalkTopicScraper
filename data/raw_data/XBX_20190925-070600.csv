The 7-day celebration includes an individual depositing competition, individual trading competition, team competition, and invitation competition.

On EZBITEX launch we will initiate BURN for XBX and the total supply will be decreasing from 300,000,000 XBX based on our daily 24 Hour Trading Volume & Transaction Volume.  You may find our average tx volume and total circulating supply on: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xbx-token?utm_content=bitex-global&utm_medium=search_coin&utm_source=coingecko  This means if our token price is 0.03 at the market average and our daily trading volume is $1,000,000 then we will calculate as following 1,000,000 *0.55% = 5500$  Then we will burn 5500$ worth of XBX to support the XBX network growth and this means yes there will be fewer tokens of 183,333 XBX from the Total Supply.  If the token price goes up to $0.5 this means that we will then burn 11,000 XBX from the total supply of XBX.  This XBX is burned from the fees we take from the market for trading or usage of our platform.  We believe the demand for XBX and supply of XBX will support the price growth and this will help XBX to be known by many institutional and private investors.  We have a very big announcement for all in April and we believe that this will make Bitex a game changer in the CRYPTO SPACE.

This is scam. First, almost no one who passed the KYC never get tokens for participating in Bitex&TrustUnion bounty campaign. They had 2 different KYC and I passed both, and then sent the google form. In the telegram, they write first wait for announcements, and then that the tokens have already been sent. There to those people who passed the KYC and did not receive tokens, they offer to participate in further bounty/airdrops. Those who know Bitex have seen that they manage a huge amount of bounties and airdrops. Also, I think in other bounty campaigns they have same problems with payments to bounty hunters. Secondly, red trust does not just happen. Red trust = scam. The third and last. You can go to Coinmarketcap and see that the token is currently trading ~50 times less than the ICO price.",False

Point 1: You only judge this project is a scam just because you don't get a reward from the bounty. The problem is whether you participate in this bounty just to sell all the tokens that you will get without supporting this project at all? It is very bad quality of today's bounty hunter. I continued to monitor this project from the first time it was made and they made an announcement regarding their second KYC to the telegram group, even they have provided a long enough period for the hunter to fulfill that requirement.  Point 2: Do you know the reason why the account has redtrust? Please see the details here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3444351.msg36249601#msg36249601 By looking at the statement I hope you can think clearly about what happened.  Point 3: Do you only see the price of their tokens to assess a project? LOL, then what about the price of tokens with a ponzi scheme? Their tokens in weeks or even days can go up to 10 or even 100 times. And can you guarantee that the project like that is real? NOT AT ALL. Dude, good projects are assessed based on how active they are in developing the project, including establishing partnerships with many partners. And here I have seen Bitex have collaborated with OKEx Group, and various countries in Asia. The entire team behind the project is also very transparent, and even they often update their CEO activities in the telegram group.  Conclusion: How dare you say that, even in assessing projects I need careful consideration. Not only because I have not received a reward from the bounty. I am sure there are reasons behind it, because you do not fulfill all the requirements or violate their rules. You should take care of your mouth first before giving scathing criticism to people who want to seriously build a project.",False

This is what i have come to understand and if you have been participating in Bounties since late 2017 as you claim then you should be able to understand the difference between a scam project and not. I really wonder what you stand to gain by spoiling the reputation of this project... You come here without proof and write scam. You think the best way to get your reward is by writing scam here? No you still have a lot to learn in terms of being a bounty hunter... This doesn't make sense.

This gap can only increase when the economy moves to the use of cryptocurrencies. Mobile connectivity will continue to grow and Asia will continue to drive a large part of that growth as global economic power shifts from mature markets to the emerging economies in that region. Low access to banking services coupled with high penetration of mobile devices serves this unmet demand for alternatives to traditional banks. All pointers therefore indicate that Asia and the Middle East are the regions most likely to need and welcome a robust crypto-based financial system, and where Bitex’s local impact will best be demonstrated. Bitex will demonstrate the local impact it will have in each country where it is licensed, by offering a relevant localized financial service bundle, and redefining how financial services for this new cryptocurrency-based digital economy can be delivered.",False

The governance committee will be lead by the CEO of Bitex Global and the license holders of the Bitex and EZBitex platform. Funds raised during the ICO will be governed jointly by the shareholders of the local, licensed companies in each of the countries where Bitex will operate as described in this White Paper as well as those of future partners when they join Bitex. Three or more audit companies will be used to audit the funds usage to ensure an efficient and transparent usage of the ICO funds. 9% of the total amount of tokens issued will be given to the founders and team members involved in developing the Bitex project. The amount given to the founders and team members will be placed in a smart contract written to ensure that the funds cannot be withdrawn for 1 year starting 1st July 2018. After 1 year, 1⅔ % of the original vested amount will be distributed each month over a period of 5 years to the founders and team members. 3% of the total amount of tokens issued will be reserved for rewarding advisors whose continuous efforts have helped shape this project. 1.5% of the total amount of tokens issued will be used for marketing and advertising the Bitex cryptobank. Youtubers and influencers on Twitter and other social media as well as individual influencers who use word-of-mouth to advocate Bitex, the EZBitex platform and this ICO will receive a reward from the XBX Referral Program. Potential investors who register for the ICO will automatically be provided with a referral code. If this referral code is used by another investor during registration, both the referrer and the person who uses the referral code will be granted a bonus of 2% (in XBX tokens) of their purchased amounts. 1.5% of the total amount of tokens issued will be used to reward participants through a bounty program that will be announced on https://bitcointalk.org/ forum.",False
