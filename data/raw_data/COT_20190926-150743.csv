Parwej Ahamad: Ahamad is a lead developer at UnitedHealth Group and was a senior software engineer at InterGlobe Technologies.  Advisors Eric Zeng: Zeng has worked for J.P. Morgan New York, Goldman Sachs New York, and Harman International. Elad Peled: Peled is the co-founder at Senno, a blockchain-based decision-making network.  Verdict Below is a breakdown of the risks and growth potential of CoTrader.  Risks     Competition with projects with similar goals and structures. (-2)     Only ETH and ERC-20 tokens can be included in funds for now. (-1)     Fund managers have the chance to mask their trading strategies and presumably orders, which might be a concern of transparency for fund investors. (-1)  Growth Potential     The main-net is already live, which is a rare sight nowadays for ICOs. (+5)     A low hard-cap of $3,000,000 for 65% of all tokens, combined with the fact that 30% of tokens will be locked for the next four years. Token metrics are exceptionally good, which can yield great returns on investment. (+4.5)  Disposition The cryptocurrency market is a volatile one with extreme price swings all the time which yield great profits or losses depending on the investor’s market expertise. Even in a bear market, those price swings are a way to make profits which inexperienced traders are usually unable to catch. But now thanks to CoTrader, an inexperienced investor can “lend” his or her funds to a seasoned trader in return of a small percentage of the profits made and enjoy the ride. The investor does not have to spend his or her precious time to obtain the necessary skills and knowledge and follow the market. Fund managers which gain access to investor funds by Ethereum smart contracts are more than willing to do so. Still, CoTrader is not the only kid on the block as there are already many projects with similar goals and structures, meaning competition is definitely out there. Yet, the presence of the main-net even before the ICO has started is definitely something we do not see very often these days and definitely a huge pro for the project. Furthermore, anyone considering investing can go check the demo for him or herself and make a decision, not based on a white-paper or some video, but an actual product. The team is aiming to raise merely $3,000,000, which is a really low amount compared to other ongoing ICO projects. The low hard cap could draw in investors that see more potential for price appreciation relative to projects with higher hard caps/market capitalizations. CoTrader receives a 6.5/10.
