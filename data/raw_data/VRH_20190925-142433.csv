It is quite unfortunate that you have been threatening us for quite some time right now with no action. If you wish to proceed with taking action, please do so. We are ready to take you heads-on, as you would like us to bypass laws and regulations, and do an exception just for you, in order to receive your tokens.  Although we appreciate your hard work, it would be very unfair for us to make an exception to someone who decided to ask about whether he can complete the KYC several months after the end of the KYC allotted period.  When dealing with professional and well-reputable companies, you should NEVER ask them to treat you special or feel entitled for a treatment different than everyone else. When there is a deadline, you MUST adhere to it, otherwise, it would be your loss.  The fact that you were late not days, not weeks, but months after the end of the deadline is just unacceptable.  Now, to state facts correctly, and avoid misleading the community, here is a timeline of events:  1- The Bounty was kicked-off on July 22, 2018  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4722261.0  2- Following legal request, we advised the community 2 weeks later that KYC/AML is a requirement. We had it in BOLD on top of the page and wrote an article about why we were doing this.  https://www.virtualrehab.co/why-kyc-bounty-participants/  3- We gave everyone a deadline of December 14th 2018 to complete all KYC/AML - so you had 5 MONTHS AND 8 DAYS to complete KYC/AML  4- Those who completed it by the deadline were eligible for the award. Those who didn't missed the award and they accepted it since they knew they had plenty of time.  5- YOU decided to come after the Virtual Rehab team begging us to allow you to do KYC/AML on May 21st 2019 (ALMOST 6 MONTHS AFTER END OF DEADLINE) This is unacceptable.  6- NOW you are coming back begging again for us to allow you to do KYC/AML and the answer is NO. No exceptions for you, when others have complied  Our Telegram chat history clearly shows the numerous times we have been asking all bounty participants to complete KYC. We have also announced this numerously on Twitter, Medium, Google+, Website, Facebook, LinkedIn, yet all of these forums went all unnoticed. Where have you been?  You also state that we did not provide you with any reasons. Well since you have gone public with this, below are our exchanges with you:  ============================================================================================  MAY 21st 2019  Hello Tumis,  The KYC was introduced a couple of weeks later from the commencement of the campaign since we received many fake translations and many fake participants.  We verified the time you were assigned the task and that came after the announcement of the KYC, so you should have been aware. Plus you had many months to complete. Unfortunately, you are 6 months late to complain about this.  Below are the articles we issued on Medium with respect to this topic. The process was very clear and very transparent. It would be unfair for us to make any exceptions when many people followed the rules and submitted everything on-time.  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/why-kyc-bounty-participants-3a591862d97c (August 12, 2018)  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/virtual-rehab-kyc-aml-guide-c21b297c3f53 (October 3, 2018)  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/attention-to-all-bounty-hunters-kyc-process-deadline-c60fd0dc8395 (November 19, 2018)  May 22, 2019  Hello tumis,  We understand your frustration and indeed, it is quite unfortunate to have many scams out there. Unfortunately, that's part of dealing with companies with no measurable results and only an idea or a vision.  It seems that you might not know who Virtual Rehab is?  Some of our notable successes include the following:  - Evidence-based solution with proven efficacy results approved by physicians, psychologists, and therapists - 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across various metrics - Described by US Digital Government Head as a “capability that is very very promising for public services” - Only VR/AI company included in the US Department of Justice, Institute of Corrections Environmental Scan report - Partnership agreements in-place across the North America, Europe, Middle East, and APAC regions - Only company to represent Canada as part of the Canadian Delegation to Arab Health - Selected as one of Canada’s most promising high-growth life sciences companies - Featured by Microsoft’s leadership team at the Microsoft Inspire Innovation Session - Nominated by The Wall Street Journal for the WSJ D.LIVE Startup Showcase - Ranked by Spanish media as the first option for training correctional officers and rehabilitation of offenders using virtual reality - Founder awarded with the ""Expert"" status by the United Nations Global Sustainable Consumption & Production (SCP) Programme with focus on Sustainable Lifestyle and Education - Selected as one of the top innovative companies in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and will be included within the Montreal Innovation Ecosystem publication - Ranked 1st in “Top 10 To Watch” by England’s 21Cryptos Magazine – the leading Cryptocurrency and Blockchain magazine, with monthly content from dozens of the industry's experts, public figures, and traders - Featured by the media across 28 countries worldwide  Therefore, calling us a scam would not go a long way.  Feel free to do as you deem appropriate. We will be ready for any action with another counter-action to ensure that government authorities or any party to that concern has clear background and evidence about all interactions.  KYC is a LEGAL requirement and failing to do so is your decision not ours. Yes, we have introduced it a couple of weeks later and yes, we advised everyone who is not happy with this decision to immediately stop working.  You are 6 months late from our last communication and no, we will not make any exception for you, since it would not be fair to others who 100% were compliant with our requirements.  Thank you.  May 23, 2019  Tumis,  This is our final communication on this topic (we can no longer deal with your hostility when you know you are wrong) and you are free to pursue whatever action you wish to make. We are prepared as we have given this enough attention and we simply cannot accommodate your lack of attention to detail and wanting us to do you a favor when others met the rules and you failed to do so, since you were not existent for many months and now you are remembering about this. We would be a scam if we accommodated your request and failed many other participants who worked hard and followed all the proper instructions. Those who didn't, unfortunately, will not be compensated.  Please do proper research before you speak none sense due to personal frustration. Virtual Rehab has been out there for a couple of years already. We have already helped many people and our work, global awards. and recognition speak for themselves. You may wish to do more research so as not to fall privy to scams out there. In addition, we advise you to follow instructions and follow regularly on tasks and rules which have been shared for many months.  Below are the articles included once again for all of our communication:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/why-kyc-bounty-participants-3a591862d97c (August 12, 2018)  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/virtual-rehab-kyc-aml-guide-c21b297c3f53 (October 3, 2018)  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/attention-to-all-bounty-hunters-kyc-process-deadline-c60fd0dc8395 (November 19, 2018)  We wish you the best of luck.  May 24, 2019  Tumis,  Happy to answer your questions and will end it there as your questions clearly demonstrate that you have not done your homework well.  1) Jean-Francois Tremblay - Virtual Rehab  2) The bounty campaign was listed on July 22nd. KYC was enforced on August 12. 3 weeks later. Details are below:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/why-kyc-bounty-participants-3a591862d97c  3) KYC participants had until December 14th to complete their submission. 5 MONTHS NOT 3 weeks.   And if you are anywhere in the world, ESPECIALLY the US, you will understand that it is ILLEGAL not to do KYC.  Sorry you feel it's unfair. and sorry you had to go through this. We wish you best of luck whichever way you decide to proceed. Thank you for your messages.  ===================================================================================================  We leave the judgment now to the public. We hate to do this. However, if you decide to solicit our reputation, we will have no other choice but to expose our communication. This will be brought to the appropriate authorities as well (when and if needed)  Your threats are unacceptable and we are more than happy to pursue any legal action you may raise and moreover, we will add to that solicitation of reputation.  Unfortunately, it seems that you feel entitled for a special treatment, which we shall not adhere to nor accept.  We are thankful for your efforts and are sorry that you did not follow the rules like everyone else who did.  We wish you the best of luck !",False

The solution is not for treatment by a virtual doctor - far from that actually.  Virtual Rehab's evidence-based solution leverages the advancements in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies for psychological rehabilitation of vulnerable populations (pain management, prevention of substance use disorders, enhancement of autistic individuals’ communication skills, and rehabilitation of repeat offenders). Established back in 2017, Virtual Rehab was first to commercialize the use of VR and AI for addiction and correctional rehabilitation. Virtual Rehab is regarded as an undisputed market leader within the sector in which it operates. The team has received global awards and recognition from the US and the Canadian governments, the United Nations, The Wall Street Journal, Microsoft, and others.  Virtual Rehab is a market leader for psychological rehabilitation of vulnerable populations. We have been operating in the B2B space (hospitals, rehab centers, correctional facilities) for the last 2 years and we are now looking to enter into the B2C space.  When dealing with the most vulnerable populations out there, privacy and security of information/data shared, become extremely important. Unfortunately, as of today, this information is publicly available and could be accessed through online databases which expose the identities of these vulnerable populations. As a result, this prevents these populations from re-integrating back into society and becoming an effective part of it as well.  Fortunately, this level of privacy/data protection can all be made possible when integrating blockchain technology as part of the Virtual Rehab solution. We will not gather the first name or the last name of these vulnerable populations — they will be associated with a wallet address. The only information which will be gathered are the age, gender, race, biometrics (heart rate, blood pressure, biodermal activity), and eye-tracking. This will ensure complete HIPAA compliance and anonymity of these vulnerable populations information/data.  Moreover, Virtual Rehab is solving an even bigger problem which is data sharing among medical institutions, correctional departments, researchers, and patients worldwide. As of today, this data cannot be accessed due to privacy and patient protection laws. However, with our Virtual Rehab solution, everyone will have access to this information, which is completely anonymous and would allow for a database of input data and metrics to be accessed, which can further enhance existing research in the area of mental health through the global collaboration of researchers and medical professionals from around the world. Patients will also be able to access this data and find some synergies or relations with their existing symptoms and attempt to apply some best practices accordingly.  In addition, The VRH utility token has four use cases:  - Allows users to order and download programs from Virtual Rehab Online Portal - Allows users to request additional analysis (using Virtual Rehab unique expert system, which uses Artificial Intelligence) of executed programs - Incentivizes users with $VRH tokens reward for seeking help and counselling from medical doctors, psychologists, and therapists (Proof of Therapy) - Allows users to pay for services received at the Virtual Rehab Therapy Center (VRTC)  Hope this clarifies. Happy to answer any other questions you may have.  Regards",False

Great question. Thank you for asking.  To help put things in perspective, we are already providing those services on an average rate that is 60%-80% cheaper than the current pricing provided through traditional therapy. This is particularly when dealing with Business-to-Business (B2B) institutions (i.e. hospitals, rehab centers, correctional facilities, etc.)  Once we roll-out our Business-to-Consumer (B2C) offering, we are even more confident that we will provide these services at an even more economical rate than what is being offered through the traditional ways, which are, to your point quite costly, and cannot be afforded by the average person.  In addition, through our Virtual Rehab Therapy Centers (VRTC), we will provide an additional 20% discount on top of our sale price, should the patient decide to pay using the $VRH token.  Thank you once again for the question and for raising this very important point.  Regards",False

Part of the challenge which Virtual Rehab has is ensuring that individuals around the world understand that mental health and psychological issues are not something to be ashamed of. The stigma that comes along with it needs to be combated very well.  We will obviously market this through our normal social media, website, Telegram, and so forth. However, we appreciate that this will definitely not be enough to reach the masses.  Therefore, our marketing will follow the traditional paths as well. In other words, we will advertise on TV, Radio, Newspapers, Conferences, and other forms of traditional marketing.  Moreover, upon the launch of our Virtual Rehab Therapy Center (VRTC), we believe that this will be the strongest marketing we shall have in every single region where the VRTC shall operate.  We have a lot of work to do in the B2C marketing arena and we will surely focus immensely on this along with our media partners.  Hope this helps.  Regards",False

Having said that, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. In addition, given the number of scams out there, people are unfortunately becoming less and less trusting of the companies out there, so we can appreciate that.  However, what we can't appreciate is not doing any DD and categorizing companies all in the same bucket. Very simple research would demonstrate that Virtual Rehab is in a category all by itself, especially within this industry. In addition, why would we dilute our fund raise and potential investments to be received. That would only mean less cash to do all the heavy lifting and all the plans which we have in-place.  We were the first to introduce our solution in the addiction and the correction space back in 2017 and here we are doing it again by bringing blockchain to add a further level of security and privacy to patients so as to allow them to re-integrate back into society and become and effective part of it. Moreover, we are solving the issue of medical data record sharing across the world by anonymizing all the data and making it available for further research in the mental health area.  If the below list of awards don't speak for themselves, we aren't sure what does:  - Evidence-based solution with proven efficacy results approved by physicians, psychologists, and therapists - 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across various metrics - Described by US Digital Government Head as a “capability that is very very promising for public services” - Only VR/AI company included in the US Department of Justice, Institute of Corrections Environmental Scan report - Partnership agreements in-place across the North America, Europe, Middle East, and APAC regions - Only company to represent Canada as part of the Canadian Delegation to Arab Health - Selected as one of Canada’s most promising high-growth life sciences companies - Featured by Microsoft’s leadership team at the Microsoft Inspire Innovation Session - Nominated by The Wall Street Journal for the WSJ D.LIVE Startup Showcase - Ranked by Spanish media as the first option for training correctional officers and rehabilitation of offenders using virtual reality - Founder awarded with the ""Expert"" status by the United Nations Global Sustainable Consumption & Production (SCP) Programme with focus on Sustainable Lifestyle and Education - Selected as one of the top innovative companies in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and will be included within the Montreal Innovation Ecosystem publication - Ranked 1st in “Top 10 To Watch” by England’s 21Cryptos Magazine – the leading Cryptocurrency and Blockchain magazine, with monthly content from dozens of the industry's experts, public figures, and traders - Featured by the media across 28 countries worldwide  Having said that, part of business is to welcome all feedback and comments with open arms and we shall continue to do so.  As for any proof or confirmation required outside of the smart contract or the blockchain, we are always happy to provide accordingly. We have always been extremely transparent and will continue to do so.  Thanks again for the continued support.  Regards",False

Please see URL below:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/why-does-virtual-rehab-need-a-blockchain-1df016b37612  In a nutshell, the blockchain will first allow Virtual Rehab to enter into the consumer market.  Furthermore, when dealing with the most vulnerable populations out there, privacy and security of information/data shared, become extremely important. Unfortunately, as of today, this information is publicly available and could be accessed through online databases which expose the identities of these vulnerable populations. As a result, this prevents these populations from re-integrating back into society and becoming an effective part of it as well.  Fortunately, this level of privacy/data protection can all be made possible when integrating blockchain technology as part of the Virtual Rehab solution. We will not gather the first name or the last name of these vulnerable populations — they will be associated with a wallet address. The only information which will be gathered are the age, gender, race, biometrics (heart rate, blood pressure, biodermal activity), and eye-tracking. This will ensure complete HIPAA compliance and anonymity of these vulnerable populations information/data.  Moreover, Virtual Rehab is solving an even bigger problem which is data sharing among medical institutions, correctional departments, researchers, and patients worldwide. As of today, this data cannot be accessed due to privacy and patient protection laws. However, with our Virtual Rehab solution, everyone will have access to this information, which is completely anonymous and would allow for a database of input data and metrics to be accessed, which can further enhance existing research in the area of mental health through the global collaboration of researchers and medical professionals from around the world. Patients will also be able to access this data and find some synergies or relations with their existing symptoms and attempt to apply some best practices accordingly.  Hope this explains things better. Sorry for the long response.  Regards",False

I thought you were going to help me since I already bought the tokens. (already paid the price for the service) Am I going to heal myself by watching the price chart Now? That sounds great tbh. I don't have any problems with that If the token goes up up up up and fckn UP forever and heals the whole world.    Read further and further, many technical stuff I am not interested in... btw, I am only interested in what this coin is about. Don't care about the rehabilitation stuff. We already got professionals for that.  Anyway kept reading and reading still wondering what this token is about aaaand I finally reached the last part...  Quote VRH TOKEN  The Virtual Rehab Token (VRH) has been created as a centralized currency to be used within the Virtual Rehab network. Users will be able to purchase and sell VRH tokens in exchanges.  BAM. Wohoo.    So I was right.  If you have such a great idea about rehabilitating people... Why don't you just open a rehabilitation center (or a website since you are talking about virtual reality stuff) and sell your services for Bitcoins?  CONCLUSION  Sorry but your project is a piece of shit and a SCAM.    I made this review because VirtualRehab kindly asked for it me via PM. I hope he enjoys it.  ",False

Much appreciated.  Hopefully, the explanation below will put things further in perspective as your questions are quite valid.  So, what is the utility of the VRH token?  In a nutshell, the VRH token is an ERC20 utility token that empowers users to purchase services and to be rewarded for seeking help through Virtual Rehab’s online portal.  What does that actually mean?  The VRH utility token has four use cases:  - Allows users to order and download programs from Virtual Rehab Online Portal - Allows users to request additional analysis (using Virtual Rehab unique expert system, which uses Artificial Intelligence) of executed programs - Incentivizes users with VRH tokens reward for seeking help and counselling from medical doctors, psychologists, and therapists (Proof of Therapy) - Allows users to pay for services received at the Virtual Rehab Therapy Center (VRTC)  Delving a bit more on ""Proof of Therapy""?  Users can either trade the VRH tokens on exchanges or they can use the VRH tokens to purchase more services from the Virtual Rehab Online Portal.  Now you may wonder, what if they just use the tokens to make money?  That is definitely a possibility. However, just like anything in life, we sometimes tend to do things which we are forced to do in the beginning, and then we get used to them afterwards.  This is no different. In fact, it is medically proven that the more and more someone gets in the habit of doing something, they become used to it after a while.  Therefore, in this case, by allowing (or forcing, depending on how you see it) the user to visit the medical doctor, psychologist, or therapist every now and then, the user will improve their mental health and psychological mindset, and will benefit from these sessions indirectly.   One of our keen investors is a therapist for soccer players and you know what he shared with us? He loved the ""Proof of Therapy"" since he shared with us that the best incentive that you can get a soccer player to lose a couple of pounds so that they remain in shape was to reward them with cash in order to stay in shape.  That's exactly what we are doing here. We are telling the patients to go out there and make use of our evidence-based programs (which has already proven its efficacy in the B2B world), AND seek help and counseling from medical professionals. Once they do that, and provide anonymous proofs that they have done so, they will be rewarded with VRH tokens, which they can re-use within the Virtual Rehab network to get more programs and more rehabilitation treatment.  We wrote an extensive and one of our most popular articles about Why Virtual Rehab Needs a Blockchain on Medium:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/why-does-virtual-rehab-need-a-blockchain-1df016b37612   If you delve further in the issue we have mindrust and the background of the problem, you will see where VRH comes in handy and blockchain in general.  When dealing with the most vulnerable populations out there, privacy and security of information/data shared, become extremely important. Unfortunately, as of today, this information is publicly available and could be accessed through online databases which expose the identities of these vulnerable populations. As a result, this prevents these populations from re-integrating back into society and becoming an effective part of it as well.  Fortunately, this level of privacy/data protection can all be made possible when integrating blockchain technology as part of the Virtual Rehab solution. We will not gather the first name or the last name of these vulnerable populations — they will be associated with a wallet address. The only information which will be gathered are the age, gender, race, biometrics (heart rate, blood pressure, biodermal activity), and eye-tracking. This will ensure complete HIPAA compliance and anonymity of these vulnerable populations information/data.  Moreover, Virtual Rehab is solving an even bigger problem which is data sharing among medical institutions, correctional departments, researchers, and patients worldwide. As of today, this data cannot be accessed due to privacy and patient protection laws. However, with our Virtual Rehab solution, everyone will have access to this information, which is completely anonymous and would allow for a database of input data and metrics to be accessed, which can further enhance existing research in the area of mental health through the global collaboration of researchers and medical professionals from around the world. Patients will also be able to access this data and find some synergies or relations with their existing symptoms and attempt to apply some best practices accordingly.   Moreover, since our inception back in 2017, we have led this transformation and are regarded as a market leader in what we do.  Some of our notable successes include the following:  - Evidence-based solution with proven efficacy results approved by physicians, psychologists, and therapists - 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across various metrics - Described by US Digital Government Head as a “capability that is very very promising for public services” - Only VR/AI company included in the US Department of Justice, Institute of Corrections Environmental Scan report - Partnership agreements in-place across the North America, Europe, Middle East, and APAC regions - Only company to represent Canada as part of the Canadian Delegation to Arab Health - Selected as one of Canada’s most promising high-growth life sciences companies (Dose of the Valley, CA) - Featured by Microsoft’s leadership team at the Microsoft Inspire Innovation Session - Nominated by The Wall Street Journal for the WSJ D.LIVE Startup Showcase (Laguna Beach, CA) - Ranked by Spanish media as the first option for training correctional officers and rehabilitation of offenders using virtual reality - Founder awarded with the “Expert” status by the United Nations Global Sustainable Consumption & Production (SCP) Programme with focus on Sustainable Lifestyle and Education - Selected as one of the top innovative companies in Montreal, Quebec, Canada and will be included within the Montreal Innovation Ecosystem publication - Featured by the media across 28 countries   Hopefully, this puts things further in perspective.  Thank you once again for posing these excellent questions and for helping us clarify further.  Regards",False

One last point about opening the therapy centers and making patients pay with bitcoins.  You are spot on. That is one of the use cases.  We will open Virtual Rehab Therapy Centers (VRTC) which will combine both the latest and greatest technology along with traditional therapy. The FDA has released a report (end of 2017) which proves that combining technology (in the form of apps) along with medication can result in a decreased rate of relapse (46.2%) compared to the traditional (16.7%). Our centers will be the very first to combine the best of both worlds worldwide.  The patient will, however, have the option to pay in VRH. Should they decide to pay in any other currency they will have to pay a premium. This will help further promote the utility of our tokens.  Why pay with VRH?  Due to the reasons shared in the previous responses.  Have a wonderful rest of your day.  Regards",False

Please find below some of the researches which have been conducted which prove the efficacy of the virtual reality solution. There are way more than these and kindly refer to our white paper for an extensive list in the references section.  - Among 244 children (2–16 yrs. old) receiving vaccination, using VR resulted in 45% to 74% decrease in pain - Burn patients reported a 35% to 50% decrease in perceived pain when using VR with standard pharmacologic treatment - Researchers at Duke University are showing that when recovering people develop strategies to avoid relapse in a virtual world, they are able to take those strategies and use them in real-world situations - VR significantly reduced the amount of opioid medication administered during painful wound care procedures - VR can be used as a treatment tool for enhancing behavior modification goals to support healthy eating habits by reinforcing these goals in life–like situations  In fact, what people tend to forget is that virtual reality was first used back in 1994 by Kaiser Permanente to treat acrophobics (people who are afraid of heights) and the results were over 90% successful. Moreover, it was also used to treat returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and that was also over 75% successful. We are also seeing implementations for autism, lazy eye treatment, phobias, anxiety disorders, and other specialties as well.  Moreover, our results showed that 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across 62 different metrics within the following categories:  1- Problem Recognition & Acceptance 2- Openness to Change 3- Locus of Control 4- Decision-Making Influences 5- Emotional Intelligence & Regulation 6- Motivation & Resilience  Hope this clarifies.

Virtual Rehab has been established since 2017. Our focus has been on the Business-to-Business (B2B) market since the get-go. We are now looking to expand into the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) market.  Virtual Rehab's evidence-based solution leverages the advancements in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies for psychological rehabilitation of vulnerable populations (pain management, prevention of substance use disorders, enhancement of autistic individuals’ communication skills, and rehabilitation of repeat offenders).  Virtual Rehab is addressing a very serious problem. Below are some of the key statistics:  - 1 in 4 people will be affected by mental or neurological disorder at some point in their lives - Around 450 million suffer today — placing mental disorders among leading causes of ill-health and disability - More than 20% of adults (aged 60+) suffer from mental or neurological disorder (that is more than 400 million by 2050) - Alcohol and Substance Use account for 5.4% of world’s total percentage of disease - Globally, 39 deaths per 100 000 population are attributable to Alcohol and illicit Drug use - Drug & Alcohol relapse statistics may reach up to 90% following a period of recovery - In the U.S. alone, 116 million adults struggle with chronic pain at a cost of $635 billion in lost productivity and treatment - In 2012, healthcare providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for painkillers. Note that 100 people die every day due to opioid drug overdoses - Close to 800 000 commit suicide annually - 300 million are affected by depression - 1 in 160 children has an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) - In the U.S. alone, 66% of released offenders recidivize within 3 years and 77% within 5 years - Lack of focus on mental health & psychological well-being  Hope this helps.

If you have any issues with these rules, kindly feel free to raise to Bitcointalk directly.  We are not here to entertain nor are we here to just post random comments. We are here on a mission and we have enough valuable supporters.  Should you believe that what we are sharing is irrelevant, then we invite you to leave this forum. Our global awards, recognition by the US, Canadian, United Nations authorities (along with others), as well as being covered by the media by over 28 countries worldwide speaks for itself (loud and clear).

However, in any case, and as rightly stated by rwahidy, we are here on a social mission to push further all the successes which we have realized over the past couple of years. Virtual Rehab is focused more on introducing positive change to society and helping the most vulnerable populations out there - something which we have extremely well over the past couple of years and will continue to do so for years to come.  We invite you to learn more about our work and maybe, you will find more value in what we do. Having said that, we respect your views, and thank you for taking the time to drop by and comment.

In our current operations, which is Business-to-Business (B2B), patients must visit a rehab center, a hospital, or a correctional facility, which have acquired our services in order to get access to the Virtual Rehab solution.  In the future model, by end of 2019, we will make our solution available to end-users from the comfort of wherever they are.  In both cases, we strongly recommend the use of our solution along with any consultation or medication which have been prescribed by psychologists, therapists, or medical doctors to maximize the efficacy of our solution.  As per the FDA, the combination of both traditional therapy with the latest and greatest technology (including VR and AI) results in higher success rates versus the traditional ones.  Hope this helps address your question. Thank you once again for dropping us a note.",False

There are four different use cases for the $VRH token. Please find these below:  - Allows users to order and download programs from Virtual Rehab Online Portal - Allows users to request additional analysis (using Virtual Rehab unique expert system, which uses Artificial Intelligence) of executed programs - Incentivizes users with $VRH tokens reward for seeking help and counselling from medical doctors, psychologists, and therapists (Proof of Therapy) - Allows users to pay for services received at the Virtual Rehab Therapy Center (VRTC)  Hence, there are clearly very good reasons why a user or a patient would want to hold a $VRH token. However, happy to answer any questions around that following your review of these use cases.  Our Private Sale will commence in the first week of October. We will make an official announcement once it officially begins.  All bonuses are locked for 3 months for private and non-private investors as well.  Thanks again for your questions and for your support.  Regards",False

A good place to start is with our white paper. Kindly take the time to read through it and you will better understand our work. We are happy to respond to any areas of ambiguity following your review.  Please find below a summary of our work:  Virtual Rehab's evidence-based solution leverages the advancements in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies for pain management, prevention of substance use disorders, and rehabilitation of repeat offenders. Our all-encompassing solution currently serves the B2B market (Rehab Centers, Hospitals, Correctional Departments, etc.). In addition, post-ICO, using blockchain technology, we will also be able to reach out to these vulnerable populations directly (B2C market), to offer help and to offer incentives through the use of Virtual Rehab's ERC20 $VRH utility token.  Virtual Reality - A virtual simulation of the real world using cognitive behavior and exposure therapy to trigger and to cope with temptations.  Artificial Intelligence - A unique expert system to identify areas of risk, to make treatment recommendations, and to predict post-therapy behavior  Now with respect to why blockchain?  We have actually written an extensive article on this subject - and since we did, we have gained even more traction and have become a top writer on Medium as folks can even more relate to what we are venturing on. Kindly see below the link to the Medium article:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/why-does-virtual-rehab-need-a-blockchain-1df016b37612  In a nutshell:  - Blockchain will allow us to enter into another market sector (B2C) - As of today, vulnerable population lack the privacy and the protection of all data and all information pertaining to them - which unfortunately, prevents them from progressing forward in life (getting another chance) or even re-integrating back into society. With blockchain, we will be able to ensure the complete protection and the complete privacy of these vulnerable populations (as we do not gather any personal data) and in a decentralized manner.  Our $VRH utility token has 4 clear use cases:  1- It will allow users to order and download programs straight from our Virtual Rehab Online Portal 2- It will allow users to request further analysis of the executed programs through our Virtual Rehab Online Portal. These programs will then be run through our unique expert system, which leverages Artificial Intelligence, in order to identify areas of risk, make treatment recommendation (along with any prescribed medication), and predict the future behavior of the user post therapy session 3- We are also introducing something that we are extremely excited about, which is “Proof of Therapy”. Yes. That is correct. If the user actually proves to us that he or she has sought help and counseling from a medical doctor, psychologist, or therapist in order to improve their mental health and psychological well-being, then we will reward him or her with $VRH tokens, which the user can claim straight from our Virtual Rehab Online Portal. The user can then trade these $VRH tokens on exchanges for $$ or use these tokens to purchase additional services from our the portal. 4- Users will be allowed to pay with $VRH for the rehabilitation services offered by the Virtual Rehab Therapy Center (which would include both traditional medical therapy along with VR, AI, and blockchain technologies). We are positive that you would appreciate the cost associated with the creation of several Virtual Rehab Therapy Centers.  We also suggest that you read the below Medium article which explains in more detail our business model:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/understanding-the-virtual-rehab-business-model-381b3831bcf0  Kindly also find below some of our notable successes since our inception:  - Evidence-based solution with proven efficacy results approved by physicians, psychologists, and therapists - 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across various metrics - Described by US Digital Government Head as a “capability that is very very promising for public services” - Only VR/AI company included in the US Department of Justice, Institute of Corrections Environmental Scan report - Partnership agreements in-place across the North America, Europe, Middle East, and APAC regions - Only company to represent Canada as part of the Canadian Delegation to Arab Health - Selected as one of Canada’s most promising high-growth life sciences companies (Dose of the Valley, CA) - Featured by Microsoft’s leadership team at the Microsoft Inspire Innovation Session - Nominated by The Wall Street Journal for the WSJ D.LIVE Startup Showcase (Laguna Beach, CA) - Ranked by Spanish media as the first option for training correctional officers and rehabilitation of offenders using virtual reality - Featured by the media across 28 countries worldwide  Thank you once again for your question and we hope that you will take the time to read through the white paper and come back with any questions you may have.

These programs will then be run through our unique expert system, which leverages Artificial Intelligence, in order to identify areas of risk, make treatment recommendation (along with any prescribed medication), and predict the future behavior of the user post therapy session 3- We are also introducing something that we are extremely excited about, which is “Proof of Therapy”. Yes. That is correct. If the user actually proves to us that he or she has sought help and counseling from a medical doctor, psychologist, or therapist in order to improve their mental health and psychological well-being, then we will reward him or her with $VRH tokens, which the user can claim straight from our Virtual Rehab Online Portal. The user can then trade these $VRH tokens on exchanges for $$ or use these tokens to purchase additional services from our the portal. 4- Users will be allowed to pay with $VRH for the rehabilitation services offered by the Virtual Rehab Therapy Center (which would include both traditional medical therapy along with VR, AI, and blockchain technologies). We are positive that you would appreciate the cost associated with the creation of several Virtual Rehab Therapy Centers.  We also suggest that you read the below Medium article which explains in more detail our business model:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/understanding-the-virtual-rehab-business-model-381b3831bcf0  Moreover, our track record demonstrates that we are one of the very few ICOs that already has traction, global awards, and recognition - hence, our reputation and global brand would prevent us from doing anything that is close to being a money grab.  Kindly find below some of our notable successes:  - Evidence-based solution with proven efficacy results approved by physicians, psychologists, and therapists - 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across various metrics - Described by US Digital Government Head as a “capability that is very very promising for public services” - Only VR/AI company included in the US Department of Justice, Institute of Corrections Environmental Scan report - Partnership agreements in-place across the North America, Europe, Middle East, and APAC regions - Only company to represent Canada as part of the Canadian Delegation to Arab Health - Selected as one of Canada’s most promising high-growth life sciences companies (Dose of the Valley, CA) - Featured by Microsoft’s leadership team at the Microsoft Inspire Innovation Session - Nominated by The Wall Street Journal for the WSJ D.LIVE Startup Showcase (Laguna Beach, CA) - Ranked by Spanish media as the first option for training correctional officers and rehabilitation of offenders using virtual reality - Featured by the media across 28 countries worldwide  We hope that this answers your question and alleviates your concerns.

In addition, post-ICO, using blockchain technology, we will also be able to reach out to these vulnerable populations directly (B2C market), to offer help and to offer incentives through the use of Virtual Rehab's ERC20 $VRH utility token.  Now with respect to the great question you asked - why blockchain?  We have actually written an extensive article on this subject - and since we did, we have gained even more traction and have become a top writer on Medium as folks can even more relate to what we are venturing on. Kindly see below the link to the Medium article:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/why-does-virtual-rehab-need-a-blockchain-1df016b37612  In a nutshell:  - Blockchain will allow us to enter into another market sector (B2C) - As of today, vulnerable population lack the privacy and the protection of all data and all information pertaining to them - which unfortunately, prevents them from progressing forward in life (getting another chance) or even re-integrating back into society. With blockchain, we will be able to ensure the complete protection and the complete privacy of these vulnerable populations (as we do not gather any personal data) and in a decentralized manner.  Our $VRH utility token has 3 clear use cases:  1- It will allow users to order and download programs straight from our Virtual Rehab Online Portal 2- It will allow users to request further analysis of the executed programs through our Virtual Rehab Online Portal. These programs will then be run through our unique expert system, which leverages Artificial Intelligence, in order to identify areas of risk, make treatment recommendation (along with any prescribed medication), and predict the future behavior of the user post therapy session 3- Last, but definitely not least, and something that we are extremely excited about is “Proof of Therapy”. Yes. That is correct. If the user actually proves to us that he or she has sought help and counseling from a medical doctor, psychologist, or therapist in order to improve their mental health and psychological well-being, then we will reward him or her with $VRH tokens, which the user can claim straight from our Virtual Rehab Online Portal. The user can then trade these $VRH tokens on exchanges for $$ or use these tokens to purchase additional services from our the portal.  We also suggest that you read the below Medium article which explains in more detail our business model:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/understanding-the-virtual-rehab-business-model-381b3831bcf0  Thank you once again for your great questions and for your support.

Our product is readily available and out in the market as well. However, the current offering is now only to Business-2-Business (B2B) clients (Rehab Centers, Hospitals, and Correctional Departments). Hence, the Virtual Reality, Virtual Rehab Online Portal, and the Artificial Intelligence (to a large extent) have been developed. However, further enhancements and expansion of our features will be introduced post the ICO along with the work on blockchain integration as well as the opening of our Virtual Rehab Therapy Center end of 2019.  Please see below a video that has a collection of samples of several of our products:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNrFvZiDg_U  Other samples are provided using the link below:  https://www.virtualrehab.co/video-gallery/  In terms of pricing to end-users, these numbers are still being finalized at the moment. However, we would not expect it to surpass $100 per session (and it would be of course, cheaper when using $VRH tokens versus fiat, as a form of payment). As soon as we finalize the pricing, we will ensure that it is communicated openly. Having said that, given the market dynamics and current pricing, we are very positive that our offering will be extremely competitive.  Finally, your comments about the website are spot on. We are currently undergoing a makeover and a brand new website is set for release by end of September. We will move away from the corporate structure and make it more appealing. We hope that you will like it.  Thank you very much for your important questions. Kindly do not hesitate to let us know should you have any further questions.  Regards",False

Would love to know which parameters and unknowns that you are referring to and we would be very happy to clear them up.

To add, we always like to say that anyone and everyone out there is a competitor in order to push ourselves to excel even further. However, in the domain we are specialized in, we actually have extremely few competitors (if any) who deal with addiction AND corrections - let alone adding to that artificial intelligence and blockchain. Having said that, that does not mean that there are no competitors who can surface in the near future.  We have already identified our top competitors and reasons why Virtual Rehab has a superior product versus others (aside from, as I mentioned earlier, having the first mover advantage and being designated as the clear leader in this market).

We appreciate it.  Indeed. There are always going to be challenges - that's part of any business.  Having said that, the results that we have established thus far have proven great efficacy results thus far - which are further backed by the researches conducted by leading universities around the world.  Our results showed that 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across various metrics within the following categories:  1- Problem Recognition & Acceptance 2- Openness to Change 3- Locus of Control 4- Decision-Making Influences 5- Emotional Intelligence & Regulation 6- Motivation & Resilience  Of course, there are still 13% that is the gap which you are rightly referencing. However, that's a great improvement compared to the traditional results, which demonstrate a relapse of up to 90% post attending therapy. Another reason why Virtual Rehab has been categorized as a market leader in prevention of substance use addiction and rehabilitation of repeat offenders.  Thank you once again for your contribution. We wish you a great week ahead.  Regards",False

Virtual Rehab's evidence-based solution leverages the advancements in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technologies for pain management, prevention of substance use disorders, and rehabilitation of repeat offenders. Our all-encompassing solution currently serves the B2B market (Rehab Centers, Hospitals, Correctional Departments, etc.). In addition, post-ICO, using blockchain technology, we will also be able to reach out to these vulnerable populations directly (B2C market), to offer help and to offer incentives through the use of Virtual Rehab's ERC20 $VRH utility token.  Now with respect to the great question you asked - why blockchain?  We have actually written an extensive article on this subject - and since we did, we have gained even more traction and have become a top writer on Medium as folks can even more relate to what we are venturing on. Kindly see below the link to the Medium article:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/why-does-virtual-rehab-need-a-blockchain-1df016b37612  In a nutshell:  - Blockchain will allow us to enter into another market sector (B2C) - As of today, vulnerable population lack the privacy and the protection of all data and all information pertaining to them - which unfortunately, prevents them from progressing forward in life (getting another chance) or even re-integrating back into society. With blockchain, we will be able to ensure the complete protection and the complete privacy of these vulnerable populations (as we do not gather any personal data) and in a decentralized manner.  Our $VRH utility token has 3 clear use cases:  1- It will allow users to order and download programs straight from our Virtual Rehab Online Portal 2- It will allow users to request further analysis of the executed programs through our Virtual Rehab Online Portal. These programs will then be run through our unique expert system, which leverages Artificial Intelligence, in order to identify areas of risk, make treatment recommendation (along with any prescribed medication), and predict the future behavior of the user post therapy session 3- Last, but definitely not least, and something that we are extremely excited about is “Proof of Therapy”. Yes. That is correct. If the user actually proves to us that he or she has sought help and counseling from a medical doctor, psychologist, or therapist in order to improve their mental health and psychological well-being, then we will reward him or her with $VRH tokens, which the user can claim straight from our Virtual Rehab Online Portal. The user can then trade these $VRH tokens on exchanges for $$ or use these tokens to purchase additional services from our the portal.  We also suggest that you read the below Medium article which explains in more detail our business model:  https://medium.com/@VirtualRehab/understanding-the-virtual-rehab-business-model-381b3831bcf0  Thank you once again for your great questions and for your support.

Every person in life deserves a second chance. Substance use addicts along with offenders are no exception to this rule. In fact, they are the ones that are in most dire need for help, support, and development to become improved citizens upon their release from rehab centers, hospitals, and prisons. This can only be realized through correctional and rehabilitation programs that will prepare them to lead their future lives in a positive manner in order to avoid the possibility of repeated offenses and substance use addiction.  There are approximately 255 million suffering from substance abuse and roughly $100 billion are being spent on addiction treatment worldwide. In addition, according to the International Centre for Prison Studies, the global prison population is currently set at 10.5 million. Prison budgets are also currently set at roughly $35.2 billion dollars worldwide. These numbers are huge and both costly to the governments, tax payers, and society as a whole.  At Virtual Rehab, our innovative and powerful solution is intended to rehabilitate rather than just punish. The scope of our solution includes psychological and correctional rehabilitation. Virtual Rehab’s services extend to hospitals, rehab centers, correctional officers, inmates, along with other verticals. Furthermore, using blockchain technology, we can now reach out to those vulnerable populations directly, to offer help and reward, by empowering them with the use of Virtual Rehab's ERC-20 VRH Token within our network.

We strongly believe and it has been medically proven that the more you do something the more you get accustomed to it after a while.

Every person in life deserves a second chance. Substance use addicts along with offenders are no exception to this rule. In fact, they are the ones that are in most dire need for help, support, and development to become improved citizens upon their release from rehab centers, hospitals, and prisons. This can only be realized through correctional and rehabilitation programs that will prepare them to lead their future lives in a positive manner in order to avoid the possibility of repeated offenses and substance use addiction.  There are approximately 255 million suffering from substance abuse and roughly $100 billion are being spent on addiction treatment worldwide. In addition, according to the International Centre for Prison Studies, the global prison population is currently set at 10.5 million. Prison budgets are also currently set at roughly $35.2 billion dollars worldwide. These numbers are huge and both costly to the governments, tax payers, and society as a whole.  At Virtual Rehab, our innovative and powerful solution is intended to rehabilitate rather than just punish. The scope of our solution includes psychological and correctional rehabilitation. Virtual Rehab’s services extend to hospitals, rehab centers, correctional officers, inmates, along with other verticals. Furthermore, using blockchain technology, we can now reach out to those vulnerable populations directly, to offer help and reward, by empowering them with the use of Virtual Rehab's ERC-20 VRH Token within our network.  Virtual Rehab believes that putting a kid in the corner does not teach them how to be a better person but rather teaches them not to get caught. Therefore, we are in it for the social good and to help address the needs of the most vulnerable populations out there.",False

At launch, we will offer both Fiat and $VRH tokens. However, there is a caveat here. Should the user decide to pay using Fiat, it will be a more expensive option versus paying with $VRH tokens. In other words, for example, if a program is priced at $100 in Fiat, it will be priced at 800 $VRH ($80).

As we move forward, and $VRH becomes better adopted among our users, the Fiat option will no longer be made available.

Unfortunately, we had to enforce the KYC requirement due to the fact that we have witnessed the participation of many bots and fake profiles (including repeating comments), which could have a negative impact on the bounty campaign. The purpose of the bounty campaign is to educate folks about the work that Virtual Rehab has conducted thus far, our achievements, our global awards, and recognition received thus far; along with what we plan to embark on accordingly. It is not meant to mislead investors using tweets that we do not approve of (shilling, exaggeration, etc.). The note around this was communicated a couple of days ago. Please see below:  https://twitter.com/ViRehab/status/1026867332600213505  The bounty campaign is still in its infancy and should anyone decide to withdraw, then that is completely understandable.  Regarding our raise, we are beyond confident that we will surpass our Soft Cap. We have seen incredible amount of interest already and investors who are onboard.  As for the Bounty campaign, it has nothing to do with our raise, as the amount has been allocated directly from our Marketing budget allocation, which is described in our white paper.

This note is particularly around the Video Campaign and the Content Campaign. Unfortunately, there have been some very poor quality submissions, which we had to reject. Moreover, some folks are submitting duplicates, irrelevant content, and so forth. Unfortunately, we will have to reject all of these.

Please take the time to make this as professional as possible. Otherwise, we will unfortunately have to reject the submission.  In addition, all those who participate in the video campaign, must submit the original video also to Virtual Rehab, as it will be posted on the Virtual Rehab channel per the guidelines provided.

Virtual Reality has actually been used since 1994 by Kaiser Permanente to treat acrophobics (people who are afraid of heights) and they were over 90% successful. It was then used to treat military combat personnel who returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Discorder) and they were over 75% successful. The only reason Virtual Reality did not take off was because it was too expensive back then. However, now, it is more affordable.  As for rehab, there has been plenty of research conducted by leading universities, which I include at the end of this message, which demonstrate that the use of Virtual Reality has a great positive impact on avoiding relapse post therapy. This is further proved by our work, which has demonstrated that 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across various metrics within the following categories:  1- Problem Recognition & Acceptance 2- Openness to Change 3- Locus of Control 4- Decision-Making Influences 5- Emotional Intelligence & Regulation 6- Motivation & Resilience  How is this being done?  Using what we call Cognitive Behavior and Exposure Therapy (CBT), where a user/patient is presented with cues/triggers that challenge their temptations. The user initially shows through the data we collect (heart rate, blood pressure, eye-tracking, and biodermal activity) that they are surely impacted by viewing alcohol or drugs when they are present in their environment or when they see someone consuming them. However, the more and more the user repeats these programs, the less they become impacted by the presence of these substances. Hence, through these programs, the user/patient becomes more psychologically aware and his or her mind adjusts to what is right from what is wrong. CBT is also a proven therapy, which has been used for many years.  Kindly find below some of the researches which has been conducted around this topic as well:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5729140/ https://teens.drugabuse.gov/blog/post/virtual-reality-and-drug-abuse-treatment https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28570305 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3125915/ https://www.drugrehab.com/2016/02/11/virtual-reality-used-for-addiction-ptsd-treatment/ https://www.ncadd.org/blogs/in-the-news/virtual-reality-tested-for-heroin-addiction-treatment https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ezvpaj/virtual-reality-is-being-used-to-treat-heroin-addiction  Thanks again for your question.

Moreover, the integration of the blockchain, which will ensure the privacy and the security of all information and all data of these vulnerable populations in a decentralized fashion will be fantastic. In addition, our $VRH token which will be used for ordering and downloading programs from the comfort of your home or anywhere you deem appropriate, requesting further analysis using our unique expert system and AI, and most importantly the incentives that we will be giving away for encouraging users to seek help and counseling is a first.  Lastly, the Virtual Rehab Center which will use a combination of the latest technology along with the traditional form of therapy will be the first worldwide and will bring the best results as recently the FDA approved an app which was used with traditional medicine and resulted in 40% decrease in relapse versus the traditional 16%.

We appreciate it.  Our market is over 261m individual who are impacted accordingly along with a spend of over $136b per year on treatment and rehabilitation.  We believe that the 400m total supply is quite a conservative one. 60% (240m) of total supply will be up for sale and each $VRH costs $0.10, which is also reasonable if you compare on CMC. However, we have not decided to up our total supply as we want to raise only what is needed and necessary for the project.  Given the amount of interest and investors who have already signed up to our ICO, we are confident that we will hit our Soft Cap.  Finally, regarding the exchange question. Yes. There are plans to hit the exchange. Please see the roadmap in the White Paper, Light Paper, and One Pager.

We will respond to the question based on our understanding of it. Kindly let us know if we haven't addressed it.  The commercialization of the Virtual Rehab product has partially occurred since we already have a working product. Having said that, there is more that we plan to do from a product development perspective, whether that is on the virtual reality, artificial intelligence, or integration of the blockchain.  The plan also includes work that will be done in order to seal partnerships with top-tier institutions, which will further add to the Virtual Rehab brand.  Moreover, we look to open the Virtual Rehab Center, which will be the very first center in the world that leverages virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology along with having medical doctors, psychologists, and therapists. The combination of both technology and traditional medical practice will produce even more stellar results (as proven by many studies and even recently confirmed by the FDA upon approval of an app that was to be used alongside traditional medical practice).  Other activities include Virtual Rehab Online Portal launch to the B2C market, Exchanges, New offices, along with many others which you can see in our White Paper, One-Pager, and Light Paper.

Everyone deserves a second chance and those who experience mental disorders, addiction, and offenders are the ones who are in dire need for our support. Ruling them out is ruling out 261m individuals from our society, which is not the appropriate thing to do - in our views. Virtual Rehab strongly believes in rehabilitation and our work along with that of leading universities and institution prove that the use of this technology along with the proper help, counseling, and potential medication, would result in most effective results.  Please find below some of the notable researches:  • Please also find the report which the FDA has released that further demonstrates that using an app complimented with existing medication/counseling results in 40% effectiveness versus the traditional form, which is 17% effective (https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm576087.htm). Imagine how much it would be with VR when you bring it even more to life along with Artificial Intelligence which allows us to further make treatment recommendation based on the gathered data !

As we are not providing any intravenous medication nor any medically-defined treatment, this actually does not fall under the category of needing licenses. In fact, within the US, the Digital Health is still working and improving their process of defining what needs to be approved by the FDA.  Our Virtual Rehab solution simply provides a virtual simulation of the real world using cognitive behavior and exposure therapy to trigger and to cope with temptations - no intravenous activity there.  Moreover, our unique expert system aims to identify areas of risk, to make treatment recommendations (although we do not actually prescribe any medication), and to predict post-therapy behavior.  Therefore, everything we do is within the context of Mental Health and Psychological Rehabilitation.  Does that mean we will not ultimately seek to be FDA-regulated? The answer is yes we will ONLY because we want to ensure that we add further credibility to what we are doing - although we have been recognized globally with awards and recognition, which I actually invite you to check out on our website at https://www.virtualrehab.co.  Now, we will most definitely require licensing when we open our Virtual Rehab Centers (first ever in the world), which will use the Virtual Rehab solution along with having medical doctors in attendance as well. We will seek the necessary licensing when this time comes.  As for the second part of your question, there are actually a number of hospitals that use Virtual Reality technology as part of their treatment. To name a few - Cedars Sinai, Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, New Life Addiction Treatment Center, Discovery House, Niznik Behavioral Health, etc.  Kindly note that this is not surprising since Kaiser Permanente, one of the US largest American integrated managed care consortium, leveraged this technology back in 1994 as part of the treatment of acrophobics (people who are afraid of heights) and they were over 90% successful. Then they went on to use as part of the treatment for military combat personnel who returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD and again, that was over 75% successful.  Thank you once again for your question and please do not hesitate to let us know should you have any more questions.",False

Great questions.  The answer to your question is yes. Users will need to obtain $VRH tokens in order to make use of our product.  Please find below the various use cases for the $VRH utility token:  1. User pays using VRH Token to have access to pain management programs 2. User pays using VRH Token to have access to addiction prevention programs 3. User pays using VRH Token to have access to cognitive behavior therapy programs 4. User pays using VRH Token to receive further analysis of the executed programs 5. User gets rewarded in VRH Token for seeking help and counseling  As for offenders, you make a very good point.  Did you know that within the US, 66% of offenders recidivize (re-offend) after 3 years of release and the statistics climb up to 75% within 5 years of release. Therefore, the system is broken and unfortunately focuses on punishment rather than rehabilitation.  Many offenders recidivize since they have not been treated psychologically whilst in prison or jail and they don't know how to integrate within society as well. We are taking on this task to prepare them for the re-integration, address the mental/psychological disorders, and teach them new behavioral skills.  Our results showed that 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across various metrics within the following categories:  1- Problem Recognition & Acceptance 2- Openness to Change 3- Locus of Control 4- Decision-Making Influences 5- Emotional Intelligence & Regulation 6- Motivation & Resilience  Thank you once again for your question.

Totally undertstandable. Just like medication, this will work for some and not others.  However, it is important to note that in our setting VR should not be used for more than 30-45 minutes per session per day (and we recommend at least one day in between one session and the other). It has been medically proven that the use for more than 30-45 minutes per session per day may result in:  1. Hallucination - which is due to the fact that you are putting someone in a virtual environment, which if pursued for a long time, can disconnect them from reality 2.

This is an extremely important question and a very valid one.  Our customers ask us pretty much the same thing.  First and foremost, it is important to note that these programs are there for those who seriously want to change and improve their psychological well-being, so just like anything, their heart and soul needs to be in it. Similar to sitting down with a therapist or a psychologist, the patient can actually fake it as they are afraid of the repercussions.  In our solution, we want to avoid that fear from being there, which is the reason why we put the user in an environment where they feel a) feel comfortable b) do not feel pressured to provide a particular response nor act in a certain manner. Hence, we begin by putting them in a favorable environment that allows them to start off with a great mindset.  Now, throughout the complete program we gather data about the users' actions and reactions along with the decisions being made. This data is then inputted into our unique expert system (which we are continuously enhancing to ensure that we perfect the artificial intelligence bit), and analyzed accordingly.  The unique expert system is meant to identify areas of risk, make treatment recommendations along with any existing medication being taken, and predict the behavior of the user in the future post the therapy session. Once the blockchain integration is completed in the future, users will be able to have access to this data analysis by paying for this service using $VRH tokens.  On top of all of that, we are working closely with a partner that is helping us develop and integrate sensors within the headset, which will allow us to further collect biometric data, such as the heart rate, blood pressure, eye-tracking, biodermal activity, and others, which will further allow us to ensure that the user is not faking anything and that if he or she does actually attempt to do that, they are detected immediately based on the biometrics and collected data.  Hope that this helps address your question. Please do let us know should you have any additional questions in this regard.",False

I wanted to share with you a couple of quick facts:  - Did you know that Alcohol and Substance Use account for 5.4% of world’s total percentage of disease? - Did you know that globally, 39 deaths per 100 000 population are attributable to Alcohol and illicit Drug use? - Did you know that Drug & Alcohol relapse statistics may reach up to 90% following a period of recovery? - Did you know that in the U.S. alone, 116 million adults struggle with chronic pain at a cost of $635 billion in lost productivity and treatment? - Did you know that in 2012, healthcare providers wrote 259 million prescriptions for painkillers. Note that 100 people die every day due to opioid drug overdoses?  I trust that you would agree that it is time for us to do something about all of this !  It's time to stop replacing one addiction with another !  It's time we also treat the mental and psychological issues at the same time !  Virtual Rehab has taken onboard this initiative and we are proudly leading the way - but it's not only talk - it's results as well - Our patients demonstrated 87% overall improvement across 6 different categories.

Great one indeed.  We will be using blockchain technology in order to allow us to serve the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) market. Yes ! This will allow Virtual Rehab to go mainstream; just like other projects are working towards making blockchain mainstream and used by the masses.  Virtual Rehab will leverage blockchain technology to provide a secure network to ensure privacy and decentralization of all data and all information relevant to these vulnerable populations (something that we do not have as of today).  And what gets us even more excited are the use cases for our ERC-20 utility token — $VRH.  The $VRH token has been created as a centralized currency to be used within the Virtual Rehab network. Users will be able to purchase and sell $VRH tokens in exchanges. The token follows the standards of Ethereum ERC-20 Standard token. Its design follows the widely adopted token implementation standards. This allows token holders to easily store and manage their $VRH tokens using existing solutions including ERC20-compatible Ethereum wallets.  The $VRH Token is a utility token and is core to Virtual Rehab’s end-to-end operations. The following section explains some of the use cases where the $VRH token will be used for within the Virtual Rehab network.  So, what are the use cases of the $VRH token?  When dealing with the most vulnerable populations out there, privacy and security of information/data shared, become extremely important. Fortunately, this all can be made possible when integrating blockchain technology as part of the Virtual Rehab solution.  Below are some of the use cases for the $VRH Token:  1. User pays using $VRH Token to have access to pain management programs  Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased $VRH Tokens to place order and to download several pain management virtual reality programs which they can use for physical therapy. All orders will be placed through the Virtual Rehab portal.  2. User pays using $VRH Token to have access to addiction prevention programs  Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased $VRH Tokens to place order and to download several addiction prevention virtual reality programs which they can use to learn new ways of avoiding substance use temptations. All orders will be placed through the Virtual Rehab portal.  3. User pays using $VRH Token to have access to cognitive behavior therapy programs  Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased $VRH Tokens to place order and to download several cognitive behavior therapy virtual reality programs which they can use to learn new behavioral skills along with additional training programs. All orders will be placed through the Virtual Rehab portal.  4. User pays using $VRH Token to receive further analysis of the executed programs  Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased $VRH Tokens to request further analysis of the virtual reality programs which have been executed through the Virtual Rehab portal. The analysis will be conducted through Virtual Rehab’s artificial intelligence solution.  5. User gets rewarded in $VRH Token for seeking help  As an incentive to reward those users who seek pain management, substance use addiction therapy as well as counselling to prevent repeat offending, Virtual Rehab will issue $VRH Tokens, which can then be used by users for trading on exchanges or for further use on the Virtual Rehab portal. Certain conditions will apply along with a proof that users have sought additional therapy and counselling. The rewards incentive will be claimable using the Virtual Rehab portal.   Hope this addresses your question. Please do not hesitate to let me know should you have any additional questions.  Have a great day.",False

Just to give you some history around this;  Virtual Reality was actually used back in 1994 by Kaiser Permanente to treat acrophobics (that’s people who are afraid of heights) and guess what? Kaiser was over 90% successful.  Then researchers moved on to use Virtual Reality on military combat personnel who returned from Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) and guess what? Again, they were over 70% successful.  Now, you might be wondering, if these folks were successful back in 1994, why didn’t Virtual Reality become mainstream until now?  Well, there were many reasons, and the main one is cost. Yes ! It was very costly — the equipment was costly, the process was costly, everything was just too expensive. It just didn’t make sense for organizations to use the technology due to the cost-prohibitive nature.  Fortunately, things have changed, and the price of equipment has dropped dramatically, and we expect it to drop further over the coming years.  So, back to your question, the way we have handled things thus far (since our inception) was by leveraging what we call cognitive behavior and exposure therapy; where the patient is actually subjected to triggers and temptations that they would see in the real world and we would see how well they would react to this, and whether their reaction would improve upon time (as they repeat the program or do others with more challenging situations).  The way we would ensure that the patient is not actually trying to trick the system is by using sensors that would capture heart beat, blood pressure, etc. These sensors would give us the ability to identify the areas of risk, recommend treatment (using existing medication prescribed), and predict the behavior of the patient in the future. All of that using artificial intelligence.  Our results showed that 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across various metrics within the following categories:  1- Problem Recognition & Acceptance 2- Openness to Change 3- Locus of Control 4- Decision-Making Influences 5- Emotional Intelligence & Regulation 6- Motivation & Resilience  All of that has been in the context of B2B.  Now our next step is to take this mainstream and use Blockchain technology to help us do so.  Virtual Rehab will leverage blockchain technology to provide a secure network to ensure privacy and decentralization of all data and all information relevant to these vulnerable populations (something that we do not have as of today).  And what gets us even more excited are the use cases for our ERC-20 utility token — $VRH.  So, what are the use cases of the $VRH token?  When dealing with the most vulnerable populations out there, privacy and security of information/data shared, become extremely important. Fortunately, this all can be made possible when integrating blockchain technology as part of the Virtual Rehab solution.  Below are some of the use cases for the $VRH Token:  1. User pays using $VRH Token to have access to pain management programs  Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased $VRH Tokens to place order and to download several pain management virtual reality programs which they can use for physical therapy. All orders will be placed through the Virtual Rehab portal.  2. User pays using $VRH Token to have access to addiction prevention programs  Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased $VRH Tokens to place order and to download several addiction prevention virtual reality programs which they can use to learn new ways of avoiding substance use temptations. All orders will be placed through the Virtual Rehab portal.  3. User pays using $VRH Token to have access to cognitive behavior therapy programs  Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased $VRH Tokens to place order and to download several cognitive behavior therapy virtual reality programs which they can use to learn new behavioral skills along with additional training programs. All orders will be placed through the Virtual Rehab portal.  4. User pays using $VRH Token to receive further analysis of the executed programs  Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased $VRH Tokens to request further analysis of the virtual reality programs which have been executed through the Virtual Rehab portal. The analysis will be conducted through Virtual Rehab’s artificial intelligence solution.  5. User gets rewarded in $VRH Token for seeking help  As an incentive to reward those users who seek pain management, substance use addiction therapy as well as counselling to prevent repeat offending, Virtual Rehab will issue $VRH Tokens, which can then be used by users for trading on exchanges or for further use on the Virtual Rehab portal. Certain conditions will apply along with a proof that users have sought additional therapy and counselling. The rewards incentive will be claimable using the Virtual Rehab portal.

We feel the same way and we are making it happen   Your comment is spot on actually. In fact, please also find a report which the FDA has released that further demonstrates that using an ""app"" complimented with existing medication/counseling results in 40% effectiveness versus the traditional form, which is 17% effective (https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm576087.htm).  Imagine how much more it is with VR as you bring it even more to life along with Artificial Intelligence which allows us to further make treatment recommendation based on the gathered data !  This is exactly why our results so far has shown that 87% of participating patients have shown an overall improvement across various metrics within the following categories:  1- Problem Recognition & Acceptance 2- Openness to Change 3- Locus of Control 4- Decision-Making Influences 5- Emotional Intelligence & Regulation 6- Motivation & Resilience   And now, we are taking things to a whole new level, to incentivize the patients to seek help and counseling by rewarding them with $VRH tokens (one out of 5 use cases for our $VRH token).

Just to add, one of the issues we have had all along is when someone is in pain or has an addiction, we unfortunately give them more medication so that they become completely dependent on that medication and we move them from one addiction to another.  The mental health and psychological well-being is an area we were clearly lacking in. With Virtual Rehab, this will change.

We are equally excited about the extended integration of Blockchain into our existing solution. The results we have had already since our inception are extremely promising and our customers are excited about what we do. Now, we enter into a phase where we go mainstream even more.   Kindly find below a quick snapshot:  The blockchain integration will allow us to serve the B2C market directly (which we don't serve as of today) while maintaining privacy and security of the data and information of the most vulnerable. Our VRH token will also be used for ordering new and existing programs, requesting further analysis, and for us to reward patients that seek help and counseling.  USE CASES  When dealing with the most vulnerable populations out there, privacy and security of information/data shared, become extremely important. Fortunately, this all can be made possible when integrating blockchain technology as part of the Virtual Rehab solution. Below are some of the use cases for the VRH Token:  1.   User pays using VRH Token to have access to pain management programs Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased VRH Tokens to place order and to download several pain management virtual reality programs which they can use for physical therapy. All orders will be placed through the Virtual Rehab portal.  2.   User pays using VRH Token to have access to addiction prevention programs Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased VRH Tokens to place order and to download several addiction prevention virtual reality programs which they can use to learn new ways of avoiding substance use temptations. All orders will be placed through the Virtual Rehab portal.  3.   User pays using VRH Token to have access to cognitive behavior therapy programs Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased VRH Tokens to place order and to download several cognitive behavior therapy virtual reality programs which they can use to learn new behavioral skills along with additional training programs. All orders will be placed through the Virtual Rehab portal.  4.   User pays using VRH Token to receive further analysis of the executed programs Virtual Rehab users will have the ability to make use of their purchased VRH Tokens to request further analysis of the virtual reality programs which have been executed through the Virtual Rehab portal. The analysis will be conducted through Virtual Rehab’s artificial intelligence solution.  5.   User gets rewarded in VRH Token for seeking help As an incentive to reward those users who seek pain management, substance use addiction therapy as well as counselling to prevent repeat offending, Virtual Rehab will issue VRH Tokens, which can then be used by users for trading on exchanges or for further use on the Virtual Rehab portal. Certain conditions will apply along with a proof that users have sought additional therapy and counselling. The rewards incentive will be claimable using the Virtual Rehab portal.
