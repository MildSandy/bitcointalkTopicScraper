The Smart City Coin Test Net is a utility token aimed to be used within the European Smart City Community. Our main goal is to provide Smart House Hardware and Services for the Members of our Community, enabling them to start monitoring their usage in real-time. We also present the business opportunity to all community members they will be able to collect SCCTN tokens in exchange for their energy data. We are incorporating the blockchain technology and SCCTN Utility Token to provide transparency, traceability, and safety of the entire network and community.  About Smart City Project Smart City team has developed a community-based solution and the infrastructure for resource-sharing. The idea is to use a collective approach toward problems that are practically unsolvable on the individual level. The city is Smart if it serves the people. Therefore, common denominators should be established. As behaviour is different to every individual, the issue of energy behaviour should be addressed at nuclear level - the last unit of energy transformation chain is a user. It is essential to respect the physical laws of energy - the first law of thermodynamics - energy can only be transformed. Instead of perceiving community members as consumers, they should be treated as users - transformer. An empowered user has a different attitude towards energy than consumer. Empowered user is more aware, respectful and understands his responsibility. The user is fully engaged in the process; while the consumer is often just obligated to pay for something he has a limited understanding of.  What is Smart City solution?  The Smart City solution is a plug'n'play system for energy control and management.  The Smart City solution can also be a Smart Home - a building block of any smart city.  The Smart City solution is an upgrade of a smart home:  It is an Ecosystem It is a Community Collective acquisition Data management Knowledge sharing Experience sharing Energy exchange Electric cars Internal economy  The Smart City solution is a retrofit system:  It fits in any existing home It is a plug'n'play solution - it can be installed as easy as your new TV  APP4SMARTCITY - The Smart Visualisation of Energy behaviour  The Cloud Application collects and presents data. Uses an array of algorithms and AI to discover patterns in the received consumption data. The Web Application allows Member access and control of Smart Devices in the Installation Set.  The essence of our Smart City team is forward-forward thinking experts that share the idea of free energy.  Our vision is to achieve a sustainable future with the use of modern technologies.  Our mission is to acquire information, learning, and sharing of the knowledge about energy transformation in our living environment, while working with the best in class hardware producers and service providers. A tailor-made solution has proven to be the best starting point in the quest to become energy efficient.  AI and Machine Learning - Evolution Algorithm:  Prediction about energy behaviour Control over energy behaviour  The Smart City Project represents a different point of view and sees each Member of the Smart City Community as a source of energy transformation and resources in different forms: data, know-how, experience, involvement, determination, electricity and physical heat.  A classical approach to saving energy and reducing energy costs of a consumer is focused on lowering the consumption without considering the consumer’s habits and needs. The Smart City Project is focused on the Member of the Smart City Community, addressing his or her specific needs, habits and energy self-sustainability at the same time. The project is not a simple “quick fix” for the common mistakes that often result in unnecessary consumption, but considers each Member as a set of habits, patterns, and beliefs and as a source of resourcefulness, self-motivation and creativity.

But where can you apply your Smart City technology? In small villages? You can use electrical inverters and accumulate in the period of cheap electricity and use in the period of expensive.,False
