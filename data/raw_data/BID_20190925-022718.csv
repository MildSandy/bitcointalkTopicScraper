As i saw on the pages before you are not planning to get the BID Token to another exchange than blockbid right?  Let´s say the value of one token increased to 50$, so with 0,1% trading fee you have to spend 50.000$ in the next 30min to get to maximum value out of your token. What about all the small investors who just spend a couple of dollars to get into crypto, so the bid would not be interesting for a lot of investors if the value is increasing (besides the gains of the token itself).  What is the plan with POS tokens who are traded on Blockbid are you gonna stake them and does the users get the stake rewards?",False

Instead of taking out a loan against traditional assets (e.g. house, car…etc), crypto-based asset loans allow you to protect your assets by taking out a loan against your coins instead, and receive fiat currencies (e.g. AUD) directly to your bank account. Blockbid’s crypto-based asset loans will first be offered within Australia but will expand to our global users in the near future.  Requirements: There is no minimum or maximum loan amount — if your account is fully verified and you currently reside in Australia, this option will be available to you and will be sent to your Australian bank account directly. How it works: You apply to Blockbid for the loan amount and agree to the credit terms. Your coins are then locked away in a smart contract, which dictates the terms of the loan. Once the loan is repaid, the coins will be released via the smart contract to your account. You can repay the loan amount at any time and keep your coins, as well as any profits earned through coin maturity. If the loan is not repaid by the time it expires, Blockbid will try to contact you through nominated phone numbers, email addresses…etc. If you’re uncontactable for a set period of time, the coins will be released by the smart contract to the credit provider up to the value of the coins at market value to repay the outstanding loan balance. Interest is automatically deducted from the coin value or can be paid monthly to the bank account that Blockbid provides to you. For example, if you have 5 BTC with a market value of $50,000 and apply for a loan of $35,000, you will first need to agree to the interest payment terms and conditions of the loan. Your coins will be held via the smart contract and the loan amount will be provided to you. Once the loan is repaid, your coins will be released to you via the smart contract, plus any profits.  Market Movement: If the value of your coins increases during the time of the loan, you can repay the balance of the loan at any time, your coins will be released to you via the smart contract, as well as any profits earned. If the value of your coins decreases during the time of the loan or the market moves into a negative position, the smart contract will automatically sell your coins before their value drops below the outstanding balance amount — any amount remaining after the loan is repaid will be credited to your bank account.

How it works on bittrex is suppose there is a coin with value of B 0.0015 and i made a purchase order of 1000 for 0.0010 it blocks my 1 BTC, if i am not able to cancel a particular order then it is just waste of my 1 btc which i can change my mind to buy some new other coin. If all i can do it modify that means i need to buy some set of coins somehow even if its for the bare minimum which means a order created has to be committed to anyhow no matter the amount. That is a flaw for me right there. Please tell if its different than this! Also what is your strategy for coins that are scams. You won't check the background and the volume it brings on the table. If you still list it without reading their whitepaper and the current happenings around the coin and whether or not they copied it from someone else, your customers will be the first to burn since they can buy from you only.",False

Etherdelta is not user friendly and many traders, including myself, refuse to use it for this reason.  If you're not from a Stockmarket trading background you probably aren't aware of the enormous gap in quality and ease of use between leading stockmarket exchange platforms and leading cryptocurrency platforms.  At present, even the poorest Stockmarket platforms are still a pleasure to use compared to the very best cryptocurrency exchanges.  I think you'll find that no current crypto exchange lists more than 500 or so individual coins - we plan to list 1000 within 6 months of live public launch.  Coinspot for example only lists 40 or so individual coins. 40 out of 2000 is not good coverage.  We will also be the first crypto exchange to offer insurance to users agains loss of coins from cyber attacks, and should be the first exchange to offer both a centralised and a decentralised exchange from a single interface.  Just as an example of common sense features from the Stockmarket that we will include - the fact that you can only cancel your buy or sell order on most crypto exchanges is really quite bizarre. It is far more efficient to amend an existing order rather than needing to cancel and order and re do another order, especially with all the decimal places involved in crypto.  There are numerous other common sense and efficient features such as this that we will be implementing.",False

This causes inconvenience and trust issues for users, as well as missed trading opportunities due to time lapse whilst funds are in transit between different exchange platforms   OUR SOLUTION  Blockbid will be an ultra-secure cryptocurrency trading platform which will host over 1000 different cryptocurrencies. No more having to register and login to several exchanges or use poor quality exchanges just because they are the only platform to list a coin you have researched and wish to purchase.  We also plan to solve the inconvenience of needing one provider to exchange fiat to Bitcoin/Litecoin/Ethereum, and another to purchase and trade the hundreds of smaller altcoins, by accepting fiat currencies directly.   WHY BLOCKBID?  Trade over 1000 coins on our exchange Ease of access - catering to new and experienced traders Security built from the ground up Low fee, feature rich, intuitive trading platform Insurance offered to users   SECURITY  Our developers stay up to date with the latest technological advances and are at the forefront of innovation. We offer   our users cutting-edge security, utility and scalability.  Front-end built on the latest fluid UI designs, which are also used by Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, Whatsapp, Dropbox and more.

BENEFITS OF USING BLOCKBID TOKENS ON OUR EXCHANGE  Blockbid tokens can be used on the Blockbid exchange to eliminate trading fees. Blockbid tokens are not used on a per trade basis. Rather, Blockbid tokens will give you a time window in which you will be permitted to trade as many times as you like for free.   BID TOKEN METRICS:  1 BID redeemed  = 30 minutes free trading 3 BID redeemed  = 2 hours free trading 25 BID redeemed  = 24 hours free trading 500 BID redeemed  = 30 days free trading 20000 BID = unlimited free trading for as long as wallet balance is intact; no requirement to redeem.   ICO PRICES  Week 1: 1 ETH = 360 BID Week 2: 1 ETH = 340 BID Week 3: 1 ETH = 320 BID Week 4: 1 ETH = 300 BID   PARTICIPATION  If you are a citizen or resident of The People's Republic of China or any entity formed under the laws of The People's Republic of China (each a ""Chinese Person""), you are not able to participate in the ICO sale.

The website buttons are all working properly - they scroll you down to the relevant part of the website. The Whitepaper button is just the only one with something downloadable.  Our developers and blockchain experts are already working full time, funded by private equity.  If you are a passionate investor/trader we encourage you to sign up as a beta tester - beta testing will commence about 4 weeks after the ICO has closed - assisting us through beta with quality feedback and suggestions will give you 100% free trading for 1 month after the live platform is launched to the public.  Limited spots available obviously for beta testers.",False
