Our goal, if three exchanges have three different prices, is to be somewhere between the lowest and the middle. Importantly, if you spend an hour trying to get a lower price elsewhere, the market is likely to have moved and you may have wasted both time and money.  Our algorithms are always getting better, and one of the things we work on constantly is getting higher limits per transaction and lower rates. Of course, these two goals work at odds with each other, for if we were to offer huge limits we can't offer a good price (due to slippage, which is a little counter-intuitive).  In all cases, as a user, if you are very sensitive to price and deposit limits, we recommend you use the Precise order instead of the Quick order. With the Precise order, you tell us exactly how much coin you will be converting, and this lets us calculate a better rate, and give you a higher limit.",False
