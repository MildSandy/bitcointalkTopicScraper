That's right. TNG token has three key functions. First of all, it'll be used as a success fee for future profits. It is possible to say that TNG token is used as a profit margin. Once an investor connects his or her account to an algorithm on Tradingene platform, he or she is required to have a small deposit of TNG tokens. This is done because we charge no money in advance and take only success fee. We need to be sure that investor will pay us and developer once he or she earns money. Since we cannot withdraw anything from investor's account we demand to have a deposit in TNG. This deposit grows once investor makes money. So if Tradingene provides good algorithms, deposits with tokens will be bigger, this creating a demand. Once in a month payment of success fee is made.  Second function of TNG token is a mean of payment for additional services. This is more clear, if we provide quality services, people take more services, this increasing demand. We are going to provide services for creators and investors. These are additional services and both, creators and investors, can use platform without these services. We just think that users can get more with our additional functions.  Finally, TNG token is required to guarantee VIP status for ICO investors. This status is important for active users. You need to hold the lower between either 30k of TNG tokens (if token costa less than 1 USD) or number of TNG tokens worth 30k USD (if token costs more than 1usd).",False

It has been announced at Friday, 04th of May. https://docs.wavesplatform.com/technical-details/waves-contracts-language-description.html  “Waves’ smart contracts will initially include account and token controls, providing functionality for implementing the most-needed scenarios like multi-signature wallets, atomic swaps, 2-factor authorization as well as more elaborate protections for coins,” commented Ilya Smagin, head of development for smart contracts. “We will also introduce a data transaction — a way to post oracle data to blockchain, which will be available from within our smart contracts code”. Waves’ initial release will allow the community to test non-Turing complete contracts, which will enable various account controls and other functionality.  After a series of high-profile problems with Ethereum’s smart contracts, Waves has taken a carefully-considered approach to implementation, with phased rollout, predictable computational overheads and fixed fees.  “It is really important to do this right. Non-Turing complete contracts will cover a large proportion of use cases, including smart accounts and smart tokens. These will be available from the Waves client for all users and will not require any specialist knowledge or expertise,” added Waves CEO and founder, Sasha Ivanov. Only when these features have been thoroughly tested and activated on the main net will fully Turing-complete contracts follow.  Smart contract functionality will be activated in May, pending approval of the new code by miners under the Waves Feature Activation Protocol.  Tradingene, the new ready-to-use Blockchain-based platform that allows investing in trading algorithms, will be one of the first projects to implement Waves’ smart contracts.  Tradingene smart contracts effectively manage the relationship between creators and investors throughout the auction process and the investment period. The contracts also allow TNG token holders and algorithm creators to agree upon success fees and other criteria of auctioned algorithms.  Tradingene announces smart contracts on Waves Platform  Waves smart contracts will enable the auction of trading algorithms and therefore one of the unique functions of the Tradingene platform will be realized.  During the auctions, the proposed amounts for investment and the success fee paid to the creators of the algorithms will be settled and recorded in the blockchain which demonstrates the transparency of the auctions and the anonymity of the participants identities. The smart contract records the chaosen algorithm, the size of the investment, the accepted success fee and the conditions for disconnecting from the algorithm.  Using the Waves platform for both token issuance and smart contracts, trading algorithms can be sold as an investment product, providing profitable tools for investing in cryptocurrency and other assets. We, Tradingene, strongly believe this will form the basis for a large community of both algorithm creators and investors, all benefiting from the growth in the use of trading algorithms as an investment product.  SMART CONTRACTS + WAVES  Smart contracts will bring a slew of new additions and added benefits to the Waves ecosystem.  For starters, smart contracts will allow for multi-signature wallets, which cannot be controlled by simply one person alone. In order to make a transaction, the necessary parties must provide their private keys at the same time. Additionally, two-factor authentication will also be introduced — meaning private keys will also be combined with hardware devices or secondary private keys.  Unlike other similar blockchains, Waves smart contracts do not use gas for non-Turing complete smart-contracts, which means that fixed costs are always known upfront. Compared to Ethereum, which people mainly use for Initial Coin Offerings because of its ability to create tokens, Waves is significantly more simple, efficient and cost-effective — for essentially the same service.  Additionally, with Ethereum, tokens aren’t actually held in users’ Ethereum addresses. Rather, they’re registered to a smart contract and every time you move them, you’re really just updating the information that smart contract records. Waves tokens, however, are like WAVES itself — meaning they are treated exactly the same and are held in your address, while the platform still supports token creation in the core and from the standard Waves wallet. In layman’s terms, Waves makes life lot easier for end users.  Furthermore, the tokens you create can immediately be distributed and traded on Waves decentralized exchange, DEX, with no further work. All-in-all, it’s a far more streamlined and useful approach.  Atomic swaps will also be added, which will allow parties to exchange cryptocurrencies hosted on different blockchains without the need for trust. The Waves team is already prepping for the implementation of currently-in-development atomic swap functionality and is actively recruiting the best researchers for the project. Once complete, integration of atomic swaps will allow ERC-20 tokens to be traded on the Waves decentralized exchange, DEX.  Additionally, smart contracts on Waves will allow for token freezes, meaning users will be able to introduce parameters which prevent buyers from selling or transferring tokens from their address for a specified amount of time — effectively freezing the token. This will be possible for any type of transaction.",False

Ruslan Mikhailov, Head of Tradingene Market Research & Trading:  It is no secret any more that the excessive profits of cryptocurrency exchanges are the envy of the traditional exchanges. But firstly, it is almost 100% clear that Adena meant they would simply add a crypto-currency as a core service.  Nobody will refuse the structure and system of stock trading which have been developed over many years. Secondly, raising concerns related to regulated market and fair conditions generally put this opening into question.  The same John McAfee repeatedly stated that all attempts to establish adequate regulation of the crypto-currency circulation will fail in the end due to decentralization (which, strictly speaking, pursues the idea of self-regulation).Consequently, in case if Nasdaq would start competing with cryptocurrency exchanges, that will either not happen soon, or Adena will have to revise the conditions for its opening.

The script opens a long position if the value of RSI falls below a lower threshold and opens a short one if the RSI value soars above an upper threshold. The threshold values are specified as launching parameters of the script (see in the code the lowerThreshold and upperThreshold variables respectively). The period of the RSI as well as the period of candle bars are specified as lauhcing parameters too (the periodOfRSI and timeFrame varialbes respectively).  When opening a long position the script closes a previously opened short one (if exists) and vice versa. To implement this logic the script stores ids of opened positions in the global variables: longPositionId and shortPositionId. The use of these variables also prevents positions from duplicating: a LONG position isn’t opened if longPositionId is not nil and the same is true for a SHORT one.  The RSI indicator signals overbought (when it soars above 70–80) and oversold (when it falls below 20–30) market. https://c.radikal.ru/c01/1804/86/cfe26a9335cf.jpg  When launching the script you may specify the following set of parameters (see the PARAMETERS text field at the right half of the page): https://c.radikal.ru/c20/1804/26/6704d7d573e1.jpg  After you click the Add button you will be able to set the time window for the simulated trading (plase note that it should not exceed 90 days): https://d.radikal.ru/d35/1804/72/ae85f8ab4f24.png  Now you may click the Start button, wait until the simulated trading is done and have a look at the results.

Simdaq also plans to trade, in this regard Tradingene can act as algorithms provider for it. Tradingene does not plan to trade as a legal entity, so we do not need any licensing and we do not have any competitive influence to Simdaq. One of the long term objectives by Simdaq is to make a marketplace for algorithms in the far future.

Tradingene does not give a possibility to buy/sell  algorithms, just to connect to its signals. And these are two essentially different approaches.",False

Ignoring the possible differences between the LONG and SHORT positions Often, the algo trader doesn’t see any difference between “bull” and “bear” trade (that is unsurprising, many of us have graduated from the “school” of Forex where it is difficult to notice it), and meanwhile often happens it is useful to work separately with positions for sale (SHORT) and purchase (LONG). Testing the algorithms, you will be able to see from time to time the positive result of trade. It is formed by two groups of transactions, for example, the profitable group of transactions of LONG in the set and smaller unprofitable group of transactions SHORT on the module (or the otherwise). Ignoring the possible differences between the positions which are opened at different times of the day Often, the algo trader doesn’t consider the fact that at a different time of the day the market can behave differently that will affect decisively success or fail of an algorithm work in general. It is possible to see statistics for an algorithm taking into consideration the time of day by means of the service of analytics available in the section of the website “Results of Modelling”. Having got acquainted with the statistics, perhaps want to add to the algorithm a time filter or to create a special subsystem which will distinguish the condition of the market (suitable for your strategy) from another (not suitable). The aspiration to entirely rely on the technical analysis indicators Really, in the literature devoted to exchanging trade, especially in texts which carry a hidden (or obvious) advertising manner, it is possible to meet many optimistic judgments concerning the widespread indicators of the technical analysis accompanied by the numerous examples of their successful application on the most different tools and time intervals. Nevertheless, we will dare to claim that the only indicators of stable and profitable trade system can’t be constructed. Certainly, indicators should be used in many trade algorithms, however, their signals should be filtered or confirmed with an application of the most different mathematical apparatus: mathematical statistics, time series, various machine learning, neural networks, fractals, etc. Firstly, we wait for the algo- the new original ideas which will help to create and realize a successful trade model. The values of parameters adjustment to an algorithm Almost any algorithm has input parameters which serve for control of its work in the market. The period of moving average or the threshold value of some indicator serving as the criterion of an entrance to a position, etc. can be such parameters, for example. As a rule, the author of an algorithm quickly finds what values of input parameters yield the positive result on the time interval chosen by it for testing and considers the mission completed. However, almost any algorithm can be “adjusted” on a concrete time span of the past where it will show the profit that, nevertheless, doesn’t give any guarantee that the algorithm will show positive results and on other time spans, especially future. Therefore, testing of an algorithm should be made on different market spheres to capture as it is possible a bigger time gap, extend at least in few years. Most likely you will see that at different time intervals the best result is yielded by different input parameters. In this case, we can advise you to apply methods of machine learning for an automatic configuration of your trade system on constantly changing dynamics of the market. The positive result of testing: what does it consist of? Having seen positive result of testing the algorithm, the study of the profitability schedule (which is available in the “Results of Modelling” section on pressing of the emerging icons with the image of the schedule in the table of results). The more uniform growth shows the profitability schedule, the better it is. It testifies the stability of trade system. To the other side, in the general positive profitability consists of two periods which are obviously different — unprofitable and profitable — it demonstrates that it is necessary to work on an algorithm as its success decisively depends on the nature of the market, and there is no guarantee that the period of profitability growth won’t be replaced by the period of its falling when market conditions exchange again. #tradingene #tradingeneration",False

Digital gold  First of all, it may seem that the term ""crypto-currency"" already hints that bitcoin is a kind of analogue of the country's money symbol, i.e. monetary unit. Let's try to evaluate it as a currency, i.e. assume that the price of bitcoin is nothing more than an exchange rate. In this case, the classical theory of finance, based on the absence of arbitrage, suggests that we start with purchasing power parity. Well, we have defined the equation, but can we apply it? The answer is ""hardly"". First, bitcoin is not a monetary unit of any country.  If the crypto currency is not money, then what is it? At the annual IFTA conference held in Milan in October 2017, Ferdinando Amertano argued that bitcoins have much more in common with gold than currency. We must say that this position has many arguments to call bitcoins - ""digital gold"". The fact of the limitation of both already gives them more in common than all the arguments in favor of the currency.  At the current stage, we have only one type of financial instruments - equity (we do not consider debt and derivative financial instruments, since the bitcoins have nothing in common with them even at the most fundamental level). How can we assume that bitcoin is an equity instrument? This crypto currency can be characterized as a share in a system that has a known limit. But again, to assess how an equity instrument is impossible - there are no cash flows, when liquidating its value is zero, it is difficult to determine the value of a balance sheet or similar market purchases.  Now, we think it's clear that bitcoin is an independent phenomenon that has no analogues. What we are seeing is a paradigm shift, rather than just an innovation. In academic literature the term ""commodity money"" gets its’ popularity. This is a completely new market, which at the moment is a big mystery, including its’ fundamental values and price forecasts.  #tradingene #tradingeneration",False

Liar’s Poker, based on Lewis’ time on the legendary bond trading desk at Salomon Brothers, is one of the first books that brought the opportunities in investment banking alive for me. Like all of Lewis’ work, it is impossible to put down. Lewis also demonstrated his uncanny ability to set out complex financial transactions and markets in clear, understandable terms. I read everything he writes; Flash Boys, Lewis’ story about the takeover of  American markets by high-frequency traders — in collusion with both exchanges and regulators — is another must-read for those seeking to understand today’s capital markets.    https://a.radikal.ru/a23/1803/8c/f462759ec1d8.jpg  Clicks and Mortar: Passion Driven Growth in an Internet Driven World, David S. Pottruck and Terry Pearce. Pottruck was President and Co-CEO of The Charles Schwab Corporation (itself an insipiring business) when he and Pearce wrote this book in 2000. I was living in Silicon Valley, experiencing the dizzying changes brought on by the Internet era firsthand. The beauty of Clicks and Mortar was its focus on the importance of corporate culture and values-driven management — age-old values — in a time of rapid, dislocating change. The book confirmed for me that the passionate pursuit of a shared mission creates business success. I believe the changes the blockchain will bring are no less profound than those the Internet brought and the insights of Pottruck and Pearce are as relevant today as the day they were written.  https://a.radikal.ru/a28/1803/e5/88f46d0600bd.jpg  The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle. Tolle writes about learning how to live in the present moment. His amazing book helped me to understand how my mind works, making it possible for me to turn off internal noise and live fully in the present moment. Tolle’s clear, kind work explains better than I ever can the power of living consciously. I meditate daily, and The Power of Now is the best explanation for the power of this ancient practice. It’s the book I recommend most often.  https://a.radikal.ru/a11/1803/8d/caba22323cae.jpg  Pattern Recognition, William Gibson. Gibson coined the term “cyberspace” and his science fiction, cyberpunknovels are renowned — and properly so — for their visions of the future. Pattern Recognition was his first book set in the present. It is one of my favorite novels (and I read a lot of novels, as they help me recharge from my hectic schedule). This story moves between Tokyo, Moscow and London, showcasing a kaleidoscopic array of characters in our modern world. He deconstructs many disquieting elements of our modern world, including rampant consumerism, the loss of privacy, and the fetishism of celebrity. The heroine of the story also has an amazing job: she’s a highly sought after “cool hunter” who hates brand names. I have already read this poetic novel three times, and I am certain I’ll return to it again.  https://c.radikal.ru/c19/1803/15/75802851be09.jpg  Growing a Business, Paul Hawken. Growing a Business was the first business book I ever read. It’s an amazing story of Hawken’s founding and management of a successful health foods business. Hawken clearly and confidently explains the challenges of entrepreneurship, sometimes with surprising insights. One of my favorites: business often fail because they have too much money, since this keeps entrepreneurs from being focused on keeping costs under control, knowing where their revenue will come from and making sure they know where their profit comes from.  https://a.radikal.ru/a08/1803/d4/545210a03c90.jpg  Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, Yuval Noah Harari. Harari’s sensational book is an anthropologist’s attempt to explain why Homo Sapiens came to dominate our beautiful little planet (especially since there were at least six hominid species). His answers are often surprising, and always provocative. The book helped me better understand humanity, opening my eyes to many aspects of human society both past and present. One of the greatest insights was the importance of “shared fantasy” in human culture. This is the basis for money, of course, something that bears considering as we enter the age of cryptocurrency.  #tradingene #tradingeneration",False

More efficient variant of fiat currency  To date, there have been several attempts to somehow determine the fundamental value of bitcoins in academic literature. For example, Yermack (2013) expressed an opinion that bitcoin has no intrinsic value at all. Jenssen (2014) argues that value of bitcoin is related to computer labor power required to produce it. A little later, Garcia, et al. (2014) stated that the estimated cost of mining bitcoin should at least serve as a lower boundary for its’ fundamental value.  Woo et all. (2013) put forward another hypothesis that the fundamental cost of bitcoin is based on its’ money-like properties. A similar theory was expressed by Polasik et al. (2014).  The last two theories — determination of fundamental value on the basis of computing power required to produce bitcoins, and the demand for a given crypto currency as a mediums of exchange, are of the greatest interest at the moment. The reason for this is the possibility of constructing mathematical and economic models for formulating and estimating hypotheses of bitcoin cost.  Regarding computing power, the most interesting work, in our opinion, is the work of Adam Hayes, published in 2015 under the title: Cryptocurrency Value Formation: An Empirical Analysis. Leading to a Cost of Production Model for Valuing Bitcoin. In this article the author formulates econometric hypothesis, and then creates a regression model to validate the hypothesis. The author tested the model on 66 most popular crypto-currencies and obtained interesting results.  Adjusted coefficient of determination was 0.83, which is quite high and reflects the model’s credibility. Omitting statically insignificant regressor (there were 2 of them in a model), the model looks like this:  ln (price) = -9.68 + 0.67 * ln (GC / s) — 0.98 * (Coins / m) + 7.43 * (algorithm type), where  GC / s — computational power in gigahash per second;  Coins / m — the number of new coins per minute (division of block reward by time between blocks);  Algorithm type — a dummy variable (0 if SHA-256 is used, 1 if scrypt is used).  It is interesting that all the signs of coefficients under regressors are confirmed by a priori judgments about their effect on the price. For example, a priori judgment on the influence of computational power can be formulated as “the more powers are involved in calculating 1 coin, the more it costs”, i.e. relationship is positive. The sign of “coins / m” regressor reflects the effect of diminishing marginal utility. Type of algorithm reflects the effect of a more efficient algorithm (scrypt, which corrects some of the shortcomings of SHA-256).  Thus, Hayes built a fairly reliable model for estimating the value of the crypto currency. The question of its predictive ability is still open, but the model itself is sound and logical.  #tradingene #tradingeneration",False

Medium of exchange  An alternative method of determining the fundamental value is much less developed due to its complexity and inability to fully collect all the necessary data. We are talking about the hypothesis of determining the fundamental value based on demand for crypto currency as a medium of exchange.  The most interesting, in our opinion, interpretation of this approach is reflected in a series of lectures by Princeton University on the topic of cryptography and bitcoins.  The economic model, presented by Pr. Edward Felten, is based on the following assumptions:  1. Demand for bitcoins is based on the need for transactions (as an alternative to fiat transactions) and the investment attractiveness of bitcoin;  2. The supply of bitcoins (without taking into account bitcoins, which are retained as long-term investments) is a constant value;  3. Transactional demand for bitcoins is determined by the sum of the fiat currency unit, to which the transaction is to be made at that moment and the bitcoin transaction rate.  Given the assumptions, we get that the number of bitcoins available at a given second can be expressed as:  S/D`  where S is bitcoin supply (in bitcoins), and D is the duration of the bitcoin transaction (in seconds).  The number of bitcoins needed at a given second can be expressed as:  T/P`  where T is the transactional demand (in dollars per second), and P is the price of bitcoins (in dollars).  Adopting the form of equilibrium in the market, we can conclude that:  S/D=T/P, or P= (T*D)/S  Assuming that the supply of bitcoins is constant, just like the length of the transaction, we can conclude that the price depends only on the transaction demand. Evaluation of transactional demand can be used to determine the fundamental value of bitcoins as a medium of exchange. The problem is only that, first, it is extremely difficult to assess the transactional demand. Secondly, supply in the market of bitcoins is not permanent. In my opinion, it is decreasing, as more and more investors buy bitcoins as a long-term investment, thereby withdrawing these units from circulation. These difficulties, however, do not influence the logic be behind the model which is sound and reasonable.  Summing up, we considered two most popular and, in our opinion, logical methods of fundamental value of bitcoin. The first one relies on computational power required to mine bitcoin, and the second one relies on money-like properties of the cryptocurrency. These hypotheses are based on a certain economic and theoretical basis and give us at least some understanding of what the price of bitcoins and crypto-currencies bears in themselves. Do these methods reflect the real picture? Probably not. Fundamental value is not always a good benchmark for valuing an asset. You can recall a tulip fever, The South Sea Bubble or, a more modern one, a dot-com bubble. For this reason, it is worth remembering these methods, but do not rely too much on their results during periods of violent emotional instability.  #tradingene #tradingeneration",False

As experts agree, the system is able to radically change the existing economic model and give an impulse to the real reforms, which are so necessary in Ukraine. The head of OpenMarket: we’ve conducted 24,202 auctions on blockchain, and sold assets for 692 million grivna.  In April 2017, the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine announced the readiness to begin the introduction of blockchain technology into basic registers and into sales of confiscated property ""SETAM"". Shortly before that, the American company BitFury announced partnership with the government of the country, which promised to provide a whole range of solutions based on distributed registry technology into the state administration.  OpenMarket is a state site created by the Ministry of Justice of Ukraine, which is authorized to sell arrested and confiscated property by conducting an online auction.  Movable or immovable property may become an object of the auction. In addition, we are engaged in the voluntary sale of any property (tangible and intangible assets), including the rights of claims under contracts, products, goods owned by right of ownership to the customer. The auction can be attended by the individuals and legal bodies, as well as non-residents.  The implementation of the blockchain on the Exonum framework makes it possible to confirm the data  integrity and consistency which is received by the system at any time.

We took it as the basis for development of a charitable project. In the process we have ensured one more time that blockchain for auction and for charity is the most correct technology, since everything is transparently.  Everything is quite simple for the auction participants. All they have to do is - to register,  make a bid and make a payment with a cryptocurrency. At the end of auction, winner receives a prize, and all the rest get their bids back. If you want, you may not take the bid, and donate it (or a part of it ) to the one of funds benefit. Moreover, you can not participate at all in auction, but simply donate any amount - we decided to add this opportunity for those who do not need sports souvenirs, but want to help.  Actually, not all the funds are ready to accept the donations made with cryptocurrency, so at the end of the auction we will have to transfer money received to fiat. We will necessarily publish the report, so that participants will see that all the funds have gone to the declared charitable funds.

Companies which are working on organizing block auctions for advertising spots, which will be presented on products and services of Ink.  AdEx says that such an auction is held for first time in the world, and this allows to take a fresh look at the features of Internet advertising.  The auction will be held in Ethereum network - through the main exchange of advertisements of the company AdEx.  The first auction involves sale over 2 million advertising spots on passenger boarding passes, and this will be first case of a blockchain-based auction.

The platform Shelf.Network will allow the dealer companies to enter into transactions for the sale, leasing and leasing of cars through the leading online stores in the respective countries.  As the developers note, Shelf.Network is a revolutionary protocol demonstrating the possibilities of using blockchain technology in e-commerce. The software is built on open source code, which can be easily integrated into user interface on the merchant side. Running shelf (shelf), merchant becomes a separate node in the network and automatically connects to other stores and lists of goods.  The technology of blockchain at the same time guarantees the invariability of each auction lot and allows exchanging offers of customers throughout the network.  Strain  A Secure Auction for Blockchains  Strain, a new auction protocol running on top of blockchains and guaranteeing id confidentiality against fully-malicious parties. As our goal is efficiency and low blockchain latency, we abstain from using traditional, highly interactive MPC primitives such as secret shares. Instead for Strain, we design a new maliciously secure two-party comparison mechanism executed between any pair of bids in parallel. Using zero-knowledge proofs, Strain broadcasts the outcome of comparisons on the blockchain in a way such that all parties can verify each outcome. The resulting latency is constant in both the number of parties and the bid length, i.e., asymptotically optimal. It is also low in practice, requiring only a total of 4 blocks. Strain also provides typical auction security requirements  like non-retractable bids against fully-malicious adversaries. Finally, it protects against adversaries aborting the auction by reversible commitments.  https://c.radikal.ru/c06/1803/f0/c329272999cb.jpg   Etheriya  Blockchain-Based Auction Marketplace about to Disrupt E-Commerce  Etheriya’s use of smart contracts will allow people from all over the world to auction both physical and digital goods and services, meaning almost everything can be sold on the platform, except for goods and services considered to be illegal, damaging, or detrimental to mankind. Right now, you can join their crowdsale on Bitcointalk or at their crowdsale website.  The use of smart contracts will allow for real estate auctions to take place in the auction marketplace, for example, as these are designed to eliminate third-parties such as lawyers and notaries who add hefty fees to these transactions. By pulling external facts to complete transactions, these can be completed at a fraction of the cost, and at a specific time.  The project will feature three different services: auctions, “buy now” options, and boosting services. Auctions will be blockchain-based and will allow users to gain maximum value for their offers. “Buy now” options simply mean users will be able to purchase goods and services at a fixed price and, finally, boosting services allow users to gain maximum visibility by getting their offer to the platform’s homepage or at the top of a category listing.  #tradingene #tradingeneration",False
