Will there be a Airdrop?  Yes, it's the first one. I don't think we're making an airdrop, but we're offering the pre-sale tokens at -90% price to give us the boost with the ITO, and also if we'll raise enough to get us on the exchanges before the main ITO to benefit the contributors. After the platforms launch the tokens can be also exchanged for platforms Vault coins, they won't be mined and will stand as platforms golden reserve. There are two other coins Power and Globe that will be used to reward miners, webmasters, traffic managers and sellers. The balance between different sectors will be reached through coins ratio adjustment based on algorithms.    And how will you involve users in your cyber reality?  We are building the community of people and organizations who share the common belief in the idea as we do.  The current model of the Web is competitive and controlled by third parties.  We see more and more advertisements, of course, it's a huge industry, but it results in network congestion, lost of junk data and slowdown even with updated protocols versions. Also there are information control and whole lot of other problems.  We can see the future of the Internet community and the Internet in general as decentralized, but with the current model it's not going to work.  The competition is just the way to make the third parties profit using it as the control levers for the marketing industry.  But it's the models logic.  So we offer the new model with collaborative and decentralized logic,  based on much greener flexible blockchain that doesn't exclude miners and reduced competition and monopoly.  By tomorrow I will upload the short version of the whitepaper with more diagrams for easier reading and understanding of the whole concept. But this is the idea we stand for and will make it work. With more contributions it will be easier and faster to achieve the result and finish the platform, with fewer contributions it will obviously take more time with fewer developers.  The pre-sale is on now and we made it as accessible as possible to any investor level.  Thank you for your time reading this.  Best regards, Dimitri",False

We believe in our idea and we are making Internet decentralized, Internet for the people and communities, where organizations decisions and actions are based on their communities interests and collective transparent voting, and Internet where the users will decide if they wish to see the information.  So also we came up with the harmonic advertisement methods and user preferences without cookies and decentralized search engines.

But not exactly the way it's offered with self-learning AI.  I see more and more ideas and documentaries where scientists say that the future of humanity is the ""hive intelligence"", where all of the people are connected to the same cloud with some sort of interface like implanted microchip with their brain, and minds are used as one giant computer operated by AI and society servers the purpose of hives operation ability. Of course, the human race had its flaws, wars lots of other things that have happened throughout the history, but I don't think we're a race of insects. It means there is no individuality nor personality, but there are other benefits, like the joint database of minds information.   I don't believe that is the way for the humanity to go. Not sure if you meant something else.   And certainly yes, decentralization and crypto are the future of the world.  Best regards, Dimitri",False

A fresh idea that I saw here in Altcoin section. It will really helps if you avail the copper member status for your account so that you can post images on your thread. Images will bring your thread alive. Honestly most of the viewer will not patiently read all the text details. ",False

I would like to state that we have realized that current version of the whitepaper and information on the website are a bit too much and we do value your time.  It’s a large project and there is a lot to it, so it was quite hard to squeeze everything in the short form, but we’ll do our best to do so for easier understanding and time-saving.  So in a few days’ time we’ll also publish the short version of the whitepaper in more human readable form and will use more diagrams to show how it works, as well as we’ll update the information on the website.      We are running the ICO for the purpose of the projects development and further expansion, so we have combined the current pre-sale and bounty by making early tokens -90% cheaper (25,000,000) than at the main ICO price to give us the boost. As well as the minimum amount of tokens to buy is 1 token (approximately 0.026 cents) because we want to make it available to the majority who cannot make large investments.  We stand for our idea and we are building the new decentralized Internet model based on the idea of collaboration, greener and flexible blockchain, information freedom, platform and the cyber world with solutions to major problems of today's competitive model.    We value every opinion and we will try to answer all the questions, so please don’t hesitate to ask, you may join our growing community, and all together we can make this project possible.    Thank you for your time.  Best regards, Dimitri",False

Thank you for your questions,  But of course there is information about the team if you will scroll down on the website there are team members, also you can see the member on the ICO Holder listing. I still have 2 members to verify their profile, but a complete list is on the website (including the companies who will also participate, plus we have more organizations interested, once we'll raise the budget).

Please keep in mind that there can be maximum of 25,000,000 tokens, but the tokens are released upon the purchase, so there can be less.  Minimum tokens to buy for pre-Sale is 1 (we truly wish to make it available and affordable for the majority who cannot afford large investments but still wish to be the part of the community and have access to early alpha and beta releases at the end of this year).  And also we'll release a short version of the whitepaper (hopefully by tomorrow), to make it easier to read.  Best regards, Dimitri",False
