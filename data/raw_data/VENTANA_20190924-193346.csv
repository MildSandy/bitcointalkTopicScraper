Also, our core object is to reduce online piracy by 80% in the next 10 years. We understand that eliminating piracy altogether would be nearly impossible. We want to reduce to a point where independent film and tv producers can keep making movies, because they are getting return on investment.  So, attacking not the viewers for pirating, but giving them a real quick, cheap option, whilst taking legal action to eliminate illegal content found online.",False
