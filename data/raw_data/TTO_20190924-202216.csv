There are several categories of companies/ products that compete with us on some features, but none that we know of that combines proven proprietary trading signals, algos, and strategies with low-latency multi-exchange execution platform in a way that we do.  There are several projects that develop execution platforms, but most of them have only basic signals/alerts (if any) derived from market data analysis  There are several platforms that focus on providing trading signals of some sort, but they are either highly specialized (i.e. Twitter feed sentiment analysis only) or, on the contrary, rely mostly on crowdsourced and very basic signals. Very few of them plan execution platforms of any type  There also are several companies that basically create research tools for people to come up with their own strategies  The majority of the most-hyped names in this space, in truth, lack market experience, and pedigree to deliver a platform that will be future-proof and will withstand the test of exponentially rising competition in profitable trades  The immaturity of this market and lack of professional competition is very well illustrated by the fact that there seem to be zero professional market data providers - and without full, reliable and detailed market data there can be no serious signals/algos/strategies developed. We've started recording our own market data back in January because we could not find any suitable providers.

There are two primary elements that make up this process: 1) Opinion evaluation: A natural language processing algorithm is trained to read and determine sentiment on individual social media posts. It generally returns something like a numeric value for example a score ranging  from -5 - 5 where -5 is very negative and 5 is very positive. 2) Determining what the consensus view is. This involves analyzing a significant number of posts over a defined period of time and trying to determine what the general agreement is from those samples/entries. This step is where spam filtering comes in. There are various ways to approach the spam problem but the simplest set  is a) Looking for repeated comment /identical comments b) Identifying spam sources by their previous activity (there are ways to profile this) c) Most importantly, ideally the consensus (majority) view will outweigh the spam entries if the data is properly aggregated.

You can set up different alert types for the signals of your choice.

This allows you to profitably trade a much broader set of strategies and minimize price slippage (the difference between the signal/suggested strategy price and the actual execution price).

Now we have to adjust it somewhat to crypto markets - but that's just a fraction of the effort  - we are in the late innings of adjusting our execution platform to crypto as well  - what we do have to develop from scratch - is the front-end and UI, since our platform initially was built for internal use only.
