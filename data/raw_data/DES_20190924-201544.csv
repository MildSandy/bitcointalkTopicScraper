EtherDelta, on which the Descrow platform tokens trading is available, is a decentralized exchange for ERC20 tokens trading, launched by the successful startup founder Zack Coburn in the summer of 2017. The deposit/withdrawal fees are quite minimal here, but the main advantage of EtherDelta is its safety, because, as well as the Descrow platform, the EtherDelta exchange is fully decentralized, i.e. the users transactions are being conducted directly between them, from wallet to wallet, bypassing the central distribution spot.  https://medium.com/@Descrow/descrow-platform-tokens-are-added-to-etherdelta-exchange-listing-202577f76f45",False

The problem of the ever-increasing number of ICOs that do not comply with the investment expectations of backers has become a stumbling block in disputes over the future of the crypto-investment market and the blockchain industry as a whole. Today it has become clear that a single solution that could provide 100% security for investors, simply does not exist. Only the consolidation of the efforts of interested actors of the crypto-currency market can lead to real results in the struggle of honest investors for their right to get fair profits from operations with crypto assets and investments in blockchain start-ups. A vivid example of combining efforts in the struggle for fair returns on investments and the transparency and probity of the crypto-currency market is the consolidation of the system and analytical capabilities of the international rating agency Neironix and the decentralized crowdfunding platform Descrow. Both projects have already presented revolutionary solutions for the crypto community to ensure the security of crypto-investments. However the wider the coverage and usage of algorithms and methods of the projects the higher the quality of these solutions.  Information sheet: The international rating agency Neironix is the first and the only representative of the blockchain industry, which has implemented and applied the world-known methods of risk management and multifactor scoring on the crypto market using modern mathematical methods.                                 Decentralized crowdfunding platform Descrow is a mechanism for the safe investments and support of crowdfunding campaigns with a unique tool hedging risks of venture financing industry and the use of smart contracts in the Ethereum network.                                 Consolidating efforts to fight the SCAM projects and filter unprofitable blockchain start-ups Neironix and Descrow will be able to provide the crypto-currency community with a set of unique tools and mechanisms for ensuring investment security, managing existing and potential risks of the crypto-currency market and returning of the capital invested in case of crucial deviations of the ICO projects from their development strategy declared.

As you can see, new items appear in the left menu compared to section “Investor” — “My projects” and “Find an expert”. The “Referral program” page also differs from that in the Investor section. It allows you to set voluntary referral rate for your ICO start-up in order to attract new investors to the project.  The “My Projects” page displays a list of your completed and current projects on the platform. In “Project management” page you will be able to do all basic actions on the platform: quickly change the referral rate, download a report, see the results of voting or fees statistics, check with the road map and, if necessary, make changes to it.      The button “change information” leads to the page where you can change or supplement the data about your project: add tags, format a full description (including the ability to add graphic elements), correct the list of media files and add extended information about team members (including their photos).        Project Roadmap  A necessary condition for the publication of the ICO project on the Descrow platform is filling out the Roadmap section. Roadmap is an integral part of strategic planning: it allows you set specific goals for the development of your business and monitor the progress of the tasks implementation. Also, the roadmap allows investors get more complete information about your project, its main stages and deadlines for them. The roadmap serves as an indicator of the quality and reliability of your project, so we advise you to consider its completion seriously To fill it out, go to “project management” and click on the “fill in” button in the “roadmap” panel. Add the required number of stages of project development and enter the number of days required for implementation of each stage. Than add a description of the aims you plan to achieve during the stages as well as the percentage of the total funds required for particular stages.       The minimum number of project stages is three. Keep in mind that during the ICO campaign you will be able to make changes to the roadmap of the project no more than once per stage. Also these changes are levied by a commission paid in DES tokens which amount could depend on the amount of the funds raised, on the course of the project implementation, on the roadmap changes already made in the past and other parameters important for the project success. Also, total period of the stages postponements can’t be more than 6 months. So we strongly advise you to choose the optimal periods of the stages implementation in advance, to consider your capabilities adequately and to make every effort to implement the project.  Creation of ICO Smart Contract ICO can’t be run without a smart contract. A smart contract is a computer program algorithm that ensures the reliability of bargains and financial transactions. He acts as an intermediary in the information and money transfer and an arbitrator that controls compliance of the agreement terms by the parties. Usage of smart contract gives many advantages. The parties are guaranteed to have and independent arbitrator while subjective factors are eliminated. Smart contract reduces the costs of implementing the contract (costs of services provided by the third parties) and minimizes the risks of wrong interpretation of contract’s terms. Moreover smart contract guarantees reliability of exchange of values and security of transactions. All of the above factors form investor’s confidence that particularly important in the ICO process. In particular, if the minimum amount of investment in ICO (the so-called softcap) is not reached, the smart contract automatically returns all the funds to investors, since in this case it is assumed that the project does not have enough funds for successful implementation. On the other hand, if the maximum amount of funds raised (the so-called “hardcap”) is reached, the ICO smart contract automatically stops the investing process, since too much investments could dilute the value of the tokens of the ICO project that investors receive in exchange for their investments. In Smart Contract section you can specify the main terms of your project: organizational, financial and other.To create a smart contract go to “Project management” and click on the “Create” button in the “Project Smart Contract “ panel. Fill in the name and an abbreviation of your token, the number of token decimals, the percentage of tokens intended for the project team.

Fee was considered from 0.5% for bigger events to 2% for smaller events. Hybrid Betting can allow users to bet against each other without considering odds and the bookmaker edge: new game will allow punters to take care just of other punters in a game with no stronger parts.

Normally, those projects that a) raise a lot of funds, b) decide to pay much money for early listing - go fast into large exchanges.  BUT - if you don't have spare 50-100 BTC to waste on early listing of your project tokens at several top-level exchanges - this is not your choice.  1. If you don't have much funds raised your choice is to: a) apply for less known exchanges, b) wait for their response with the forms to fill (uncertain time needed, normally from 1 week to 1 month), c)  send forms and docs needed d) wait for response (uncertain time needed) - positive or negative.  And many exchanges reply that have technical difficulties and ask to wait before they could consider NEW applications as there are more and more applications of new coins and tokens.  2. Descow raised only softcap what is not very positive factor. But we issued less amount of DES tokens on the free market what gives more value added to the tokens what is positive factor.  3. We focus on long-term and profitable development of platform rather than on short-term token speculations. That is  definitely positive. We are to launch our platform this quarter already. And our token holders will have opportunities to earn money if they perform unsophisticated but important tasks on the platform. On that condition our backers could regulargly get discounts on our services, participate in lotteries distributing part of platform incomes and get other bonuses in future. This is going to happen no matter what will happen with DES tokens on exchanges - and this will definitely have positive impact on token price.  4.

The project represents developments in FoodTech and will mainly deal with the creation of high-nutrition food powders and bars of grown algae and vegetables. Because of the latest technologies and equipment, as well as heating of the greenhouses by mining, it will be possible to produce food all year round. The farm will also own a gas-piston power plant — it allows to receive electricity at the lowest price in the world — 1.26 p / kW (according project data), which will significantly reduce the production cost. Project is advantageous for investors because it is built on a real economy and its tokens are part of the company’s capital (land and real estate), and because of decentralized management of a company — it allows all co-owners to have equal powers.  📍 Cloud OSS solution ApexFree, operating on PaaS and SaaS technologies. The project is designed to automate repetitive business processes and simplify the management of information, financial and other flows by integrating software products, services, technologies onto one platform. ApexFree will have the maximum amount of business functionality with real-time monitoring and management capabilities, accessing the platform as an arbitration for resolving disputes, efficient data processing.  📍 Clever farm “Sol-Invictus”. The farm will produce differentiated agricultural products on the basis of energy autonomy, which is achieved through the use of wind turbine and biogas plants. The farm is a set of several production modules: livestock and fish complex, growing vegetables, mushrooms, mixed fodder, and from the number and interrelations of these modules organization gets the main advantage — the possibility of maximum processing of industrial waste by cyclic use. Wastes in some modules serve as a raw base material for others. This system provides a high level of overall profitability (according to IRR project estimates of 65%), and the use of high-tech equipment makes it possible to significantly reduce costs.  📍 Cardboard construction Yohocube. The developing constructor consists of two forms: cubes and prisms, which are assembled from flat patterns. Simplicity of shapes and colors of figures gives freedom to creativity and helps to form creative thinking: combining figures in different ways you can get any object and then paint it in any colors, which make the game fascinating both for children and adults. Also the construction is environmentally friendly — parents can be calm for the health of their children if they leaving them to play alone.  📍 LeadRex platform. The project is aimed at increasing the conversion of advertising companies and combines many components. The basis of the platform is artificial intelligence, which is necessary for analyzing and selecting the target audience. Thanks to the platform’s advertising capabilities, everyone able to launch their advertising company in the shortest possible time and manage it centrally from the client cabinet of LeadRex. The most important innovation and technological feature of the LeadRex platform is artificial intelligence — it is an integral part of the service and each module as a whole.  📍 The platform for sending parcels with travelers Shipit. The key idea of the project is the creation of mobile app that will unite senders of parcels and travelers on the same platform. This will create a cheap, efficient and fast mail system. At the same time, all participants benefit: the traveler is a monetary rewarded, the sender can sent parcels in a short time and a guarantee quality. The project synthesize best business strategies of successful companies in the sharing economy and, with the help of block technologies, created a service built on transparency and fairness of operations.  📍 The platform for investing in real estate Bitcoin City. The platform is a real estate market. Using Bitcoin City tokens investor can buy an apartment, a building, a room or a part of them anywhere in the world, and the builder can attract investments with the help of blockchain technology. Thus, there will be buildings whose value will be expressed by digital assets. After exchanging tokens for square meters of the premises, the investor can receive an annuity — the percentage of the profit from the commercial use of this space. Or he can live in a purchased apartment (room) — digital assets are easy to sell and buy so with this system a person can easily move around the world buying and selling housing, and live in suitable places for him.  📍 SBC Platform — automated ICO training platform for start-ups and small business. The goal of the project is to reduce the cost of preparing high-quality projects for entering the ICO and to give impetus to their development. For this, the project offers opportunities for expertise, business analysis of ideas, technical and legal advice, assistance with marketing and investor search.

For today we have 23 projects in total ready for partnership with Descrow platform.  Mortgage platform Bloquid. The project allows to convert mortgage claims into the digital assets using the MU (Bloquid) tokens. This processes run in several stages: firstly, platform concludes two contracts with the owners of the real estate — an agreement of lending interest-free token as a loan and a real estate pledge agreement. After that a state registration of the real estate encumbrance goes and the smart contract issues mortgage tokens. New tokens are transferred to the borrowers, and real estate becomes part of the general fund of the Bloquid collateral.  Docnota. The project offers a new paradigm for creating, processing, publishing and exchanging documents on a secure platform with an open architecture and API. Existing problems of electronic document management cause legal consequences and Docnota project solves it by creating a technological platform on which documents are represented as a system of text blocks. Such structure means records, where each of the document blocks has unique parameters: identifier, information about the author, creation date, etc. This system protects documents from possible changes, and ensures the safety, reliability and ease of accessibility of documents. Also, we are pleased to announce early stage development start-ups that will also participate in Descrow platform test. Ecosystem of smart cities, based on financial model of an energy service contract where tokens is a “crypto-fuel” of the system. At the moment, 11 such projects are being developed in real settlements. Marketplace for the owners of mobile applications with the possibility of equity investment.

Digest on cryptonews.    https://www.ccn.com/sec-subpoenas-80-cryptocurrency-firms-including-techcrunch-fund SEC worries about the fast-growing crypto market. And it seems like the US Securities Commission turned from words to actions when it subpoenaed TechCrunch and 80 America’s crypto-currency companies on March 7. From the statement of Michael Arington, TechCrunch founder, it’s clear that there is nothing terrible in these claims and these measures are necessary for “a broader study of digital coins”. We can expect that the investigation will continue throughout the year — it is time needed for collecting information about the cryptoworld and creating rules that will govern this market. The most likely outcome of the events will be the accepting crypto-currencies as unregistered securities, which will put the participants of the American market under hard and unfavorable business conditions. Japan also has faced with the need to regulate the activity of crypto exchanges after $ 530 million were stolen from Tokyo Stock Exchange CoinCheck. The Financial Services Agency of Japan (FSA) forced the exchange to pay investor’s stolen funds, and provide a plan for improving the system before March 22. In the current conditions, the seven exchanges of crypto-currencies were punished and two of them — Bit Station and FSHO — were ordered to suspend business, reports Reuters. In terms of these occasions, it was decided to form a self-regulating organization in the crypto currency market that, with the assistance of the FSA, will create guidelines for regulating this market and protecting the consumers. According to Forklog, the organization will represent 16 exchanges and will begin to work in April 2018. The decentralized crowdfunding platforms such as the Descrow could become an alternative to a centralized regulatory structure. Descrow is designed to insure ICO investments from fraud through the development of the community of investors and partners of ICO and automation of the phased financing of the project.  http://descrow.com/ https://medium.com/@Descrow https://www.facebook.com/descrow3/ https://twitter.com/Descrow3 https://t.me/descrow_rus",False

Mar 19 Descrow continues to select projects for platform testing                     We are please to announce that 4 more projects will be presented on the test launch of the Descrow platform 📍 Platform for sport fans Sportco. This is a global community, designed to unite sports fans from all over the world into a single Sports Club. Members of the community will have the opportunity to communicate on their favorite topics, run their own blog, play themed quizzes, bet on sports and much more. At the same time, their activities will be rewarded: the higher contribution to the network they will give — the higher income they will get. Thus the project solves several problems at once: it unites sportsmen from all over the world, gives them the opportunity to earn on their hobby and provide the access to a wide information network. 📍 Platform for traders and investors Rublix. The “Hedge” App developed by the project will allow participants to make a trade forecast for a particular currency. In case of correct forecast, participants will be awarded by a Hedge rating and RBLX tokens, and in case of an error the rating will fall and the tokens will be taken back. Investors, in turn, can change their tokens to access the forecasts of a particular trader, and the price of the forecast will depend on his or her rating. Thus the Rublix provides a system of incentives for traders to publish honest information and to create more open and transparent market. 📍 Platform for creating and supporting gambling projects Trueplay. Online casinos are becoming more popular, however, both their owners and players face many problems related to technical and legal issues, as well as guarantees of honesty. The Trueplay project seeks to solve the problems of both sides and offers the Fairplay system — a combination of blockchain and offchain methods of organizing the casino activities. This will make gambling projects less expensive: casinos will connect to a ready-made technical system with operational and legal support. The platform will provide a high-speed payment system for players, as well as a full-fledged system ensurung trust. 📍 Crypto Fund PentaCore with active management. The company takes into account the difficulties and barriers an average investor faces if he or she desires to invest in crypto-currency assets — risks, the complexities of technology understanding and market analysis. And it offers a set of recommendations and products for easier investment. Initially company offers three type of products: investment fund PentaFund aimed at capital appreciation with emphasis on its protection through hedging strategies; information platform PentaView’s that provides easy-to-understand and high-quality data about cryptocurrency market; educational source PentaPost, where members can learn to analyze the market and to form investment portfolio. Thus, the project aims to increase the financial literacy of market participants and to provide them with tools for analytics and trading.

The project represents developments in FoodTech and will mainly deal with the creation of high-nutrition food powders and bars of grown algae and vegetables. Because of the latest technologies and equipment, as well as heating of the greenhouses by mining, it will be possible to produce food all year round. The farm will also own a gas-piston power plant — it allows to receive electricity at the lowest price in the world — 1.26 p / kW (according project data), which will significantly reduce the production cost. Project is advantageous for investors because it is built on a real economy and its tokens are part of the company’s capital (land and real estate), and because of decentralized management of a company — it allows all co-owners to have equal powers. 📍 Cloud OSS solution ApexFree, operating on PaaS and SaaS technologies. The project is designed to automate repetitive business processes and simplify the management of information, financial and other flows by integrating software products, services, technologies onto one platform. ApexFree will have the maximum amount of business functionality with real-time monitoring and management capabilities, accessing the platform as an arbitration for resolving disputes, efficient data processing. 📍 Clever farm “Sol-Invictus”. The farm will produce differentiated agricultural products on the basis of energy autonomy, which is achieved through the use of wind turbine and biogas plants. The farm is a set of several production modules: livestock and fish complex, growing vegetables, mushrooms, mixed fodder, and from the number and interrelations of these modules organization gets the main advantage — the possibility of maximum processing of industrial waste by cyclic use. Wastes in some modules serve as a raw base material for others. This system provides a high level of overall profitability (according to IRR project estimates of 65%), and the use of high-tech equipment makes it possible to significantly reduce costs. 📍 Cardboard construction Yohocube. The developing constructor consists of two forms: cubes and prisms, which are assembled from flat patterns. Simplicity of shapes and colors of figures gives freedom to creativity and helps to form creative thinking: combining figures in different ways you can get any object and then paint it in any colors, which make the game fascinating both for children and adults. Also the construction is environmentally friendly — parents can be calm for the health of their children if they leaving them to play alone. 📍 LeadRex platform. The project is aimed at increasing the conversion of advertising companies and combines many components. The basis of the platform is artificial intelligence, which is necessary for analyzing and selecting the target audience. Thanks to the platform’s advertising capabilities, everyone able to launch their advertising company in the shortest possible time and manage it centrally from the client cabinet of LeadRex. The most important innovation and technological feature of the LeadRex platform is artificial intelligence — it is an integral part of the service and each module as a whole. 📍 The platform for sending parcels with travelers Shipit. The key idea of the project is the creation of mobile app that will unite senders of parcels and travelers on the same platform. This will create a cheap, efficient and fast mail system. At the same time, all participants benefit: the traveler is a monetary rewarded, the sender can sent parcels in a short time and a guarantee quality. The project synthesize best business strategies of successful companies in the sharing economy and, with the help of block technologies, created a service built on transparency and fairness of operations. 📍 The platform for investing in real estate Bitcoin City. The platform is a real estate market. Using Bitcoin City tokens investor can buy an apartment, a building, a room or a part of them anywhere in the world, and the builder can attract investments with the help of blockchain technology. Thus, there will be buildings whose value will be expressed by digital assets. After exchanging tokens for square meters of the premises, the investor can receive an annuity — the percentage of the profit from the commercial use of this space. Or he can live in a purchased apartment (room) — digital assets are easy to sell and buy so with this system a person can easily move around the world buying and selling housing, and live in suitable places for him. 📍 SBC Platform — automated ICO training platform for start-ups and small business. The goal of the project is to reduce the cost of preparing high-quality projects for entering the ICO and to give impetus to their development. For this, the project offers opportunities for expertise, business analysis of ideas, technical and legal advice, assistance with marketing and investor search. Automation of the platform processes will significantly reduce the cost of services and make it more accessible for start-up entrepreneurs.

At the moment Descrow team is at early stages of creating the product. The team is already developing the platform and there is no doubt it will be launched soon. But even now we are facing threats and attacks. This fact proves that Descrow is aiming at the core of the ICO market problem. At the beginning of December, malicious unknown actors addressed the founders of Descrow project with a request to buy out our project. After receiving a negative response, they started threatening our team to fabricate the data about the founders and spread it through the web, as our project “may harm their business”, so they’ll try to damage the process of Descrow development. We know for a fact that Descrow s not the first ICO campaign in these several months, who have found themselves standing against such fraud. That is the evidence that this dirty job is performed by an organized group of people, who are monitoring the ICO market. Descrow, as a solution to fight scam, disturbs the existing state of things in the crypto market, which currently attracts scammers and allow them to put their fraudulent plans into action. We are open to everyone. Each of us is ready to meet in person and answer your questions with arguments. Dear members of crypto the community, beware of scam!

Normally, those projects that a) raise a lot of funds, b) decide to pay much money for early listing - go fast into large exchanges.  BUT - if you don't have spare 50-100 BTC to waste on early listing of your project tokens at several top-level exchanges - this is not your choice.  1. If you don't have much funds raised your choice is to: a) apply for less known exchanges, b) wait for their response with the forms to fill (uncertain time needed, normally from 1 week to 1 month), c)  send forms and docs needed d) wait for response (uncertain time needed) - positive or negative.  And many exchanges reply that have technical difficulties and ask to wait before they could consider NEW applications as there are more and more applications of new coins and tokens.  2. Descow raised only softcap what is not very positive factor. But we issued less amount of DES tokens on the free market what gives more value added to the tokens what is positive factor.  3. We focus on long-term and profitable development of platform rather than on short-term token speculations. That is  definitely positive. We are to launch our platform this quarter already. And our token holders will have opportunities to earn money if they perform unsophisticated but important tasks on the platform. On that condition our backers could regulargly get discounts on our services, participate in lotteries distributing part of platform incomes and get other bonuses in future. This is going to happen no matter what will happen with DES tokens on exchanges - and this will definitely have positive impact on token price.  4. Surely we are also working on exchange listing because we are interested in the Descrow project development. We just could not afford listing at top-exchanges for the moment.",False

The Post-Bounty program participants will be rewarded with DES utility tokens, which are used to sustain the platform and provide benefits for the token holders (service discounts, lotteries participation), in the same manner as it happened during the Descrow ICO. The remuneration fund for Post-Bounty Descrow program will be fueled with the project team funds. Why give the tokens away? The answer is clear. The program execution with the subsequent buy-out on the crypto exchanges will facilitate the tokens turnover and the general project development. We are certain that the working platform will create more profit than the speculative token trading. The Post-Bounty Descrow program differs from the conventional ICO bounty program in objectives and rewarded actions. The Post-Bounty Descrow program objectives include: Attracting the customers for the Descrow platform; Developing the crowdfunding community: the community of startups, venture experts and blockchain specialists. The Post-Bounty Descrow program reward system includes: Customer attraction program “Airdrop Descrow”, which will reward for attracting a potential customer to the official Descrow channel; Community development program “Descrow knowledge base”, which will reward for the distribution and the analysis of the useful data and methods, analytical project reports, for sharing the venture investment experience, lessons learnt and successful moves for startups, and the consulting experience. For our “Descrow knowledge base” program we are particularly interested in distribution of the experiences gained from participation (investing or launching) in the projects, which are connecting the blockchain technology with the real sector (logistics, medicine, finances, documents ledgers etc.), stimulating tokenization of the real assets, or creating the blockchain infrastructure (blockchain protocols, decentralized organizations etc.). Also we are providing our Program participants with the opportunity to determine the value of the content created and collected. So the evaluation of the content of “Descrow knowledge base” will be done not only by the Descrow platform experts, but also by the Descrow community and Post-Bounty program participants. We will be glad to reward both the distribution of the content (articles, comments, reposts, video etc.) and the analytical expert evaluation of the content. We are certain this will allow us to create the knowledge base that will have more value for investors, ICO project teams and community experts. This approach to the knowledge base creation has shown a sustainable results in investment and business education areas (MBA programs, startup accelerators etc.). The Post-Bounty program rewards will be paid regularly in DES tokens within each program phase equal to calendar month with the proportional token distribution. The remuneration will be processed after the end of the phase and checking procedures within a week (7 days) after the phase closure. There will be an opportunity to earn more within each phase by repeating the actions rewarded. The announcement of the new phase start will be sent via official Descrow telegram channel (@descrow) or via email. Please check your mailboxes, including the “spam” folder. We welcome blockchain enthusiasts, our partners, and platform clients to participate in our Post-Bounty program — all those who are interested in the crowdfunding industry and blockchain technology development. Join us! Together we will be able to implement new standards for effective, secure and professional crowdfunding in the global ICO market!

EtherDelta, on which the Descrow platform tokens trading is available, is a decentralized exchange for ERC20 tokens trading, launched by the successful startup founder Zack Coburn in the summer of 2017. The deposit/withdrawal fees are quite minimal here, but the main advantage of EtherDelta is its safety, because, as well as the Descrow platform, the EtherDelta exchange is fully decentralized, i.e. the users transactions are being conducted directly between them, from wallet to wallet, bypassing the central distribution spot.    Since the exchange is decentralized, trading can be conducted even before the official listing by the exchange management, i.e. at the time of application processing it is already possible to buy and sell tokens on the exchange. In order to do this, you need to click on this link. We advise you to add it to your bookmarks to prevent its loss.    Attention, please! To avoid fraud, be sure to check, whether the DES token address is valid https://etherdelta.com/#0x81a803d28ee340e8c3805362374703ffcbb8c0e2-ETH. In the link, after etherdelta.com, the address of our smart contract comes where DES tokens were issued: 0x81a803d28ee340e8c3805362374703ffcbb8c0e2. You can get into the token web page manually. In order to do this, you need to print the address of the smart contract, bitness ( and the name of the token (DES).    https://medium.com/@Descrow  https://www.facebook.com/descrow3/  https://twitter.com/Descrow3  https://t.me/descrow_rus",False

The organizers of the Benebit ICO have attracted, according to various estimates, from 2.7 to $4 mln and then disappeared with investors funds, having switched off the web site and social networks accounts. The organization of the fraud was quite high: Benebit have spent about $ 500 thousands $ for a marketing company.  The ICO promotion was in full swing, the social networks were alive with high activity, Benebit was all over the news, when suddenly it was discovered that some members of the team photos turned out to be stolen from the web site of the British school for boys.  As soon as the fraud was discovered, the website and Benebit accounts in social networks were disabled. In Benebit Telegram Channel — the only one which is still working — the investors cry out for a response, joking sadly by posting the telephone numbers of the suicide hotlines. One of the investors reported that he had invested 14 BTC and ETH 300 in Benebit.  This scam one more time underlines the necessity of revising the principles of the crowdfunding market: in any case, projects should not receive “cash in advance” — on the contrary, the funds infusion should go to the project gradually, and the decision on transferring must be made by the investors. Such is the working scheme of Descrow project, the decentralized escrow platform for ICOs maintaining. Just one day left before its own ICO ending.

It is important to recognize that a number of such projects will continue to increase and it will be more and more difficult for investors to keep track on all the diversity. Due to the growing number of ICOs, investors will need a third party point of view, an external audit, which at the moment is provided by the rating agencies. Recently the SWOT analysis frameworks for ICO projects started to appear in the market, and even the SEC has offered investors the check-up list for quick ICO project evaluation.  In fact only the external audit is insufficient in the ICO market. The optimal quality assurance can and should be achieved by the investors community itself and by a platform, where honest and promising ICO will be held. Why is it important? If one wants to do something really well, he should do it by himself. The same is true in relation to the “arranging” of investors funds. No one is interested in their actual growth as much as their owners do.  Descrow platform offers a unique approach to the ICOs investing. Decentralized escrow is the instrument which provides investors with the insurance in case of the project failure. The funds invested in the project are held on the investors account, being transferred to the startup by tranches, and in case of failure, returned back to the investors. With the Descrow reserve fund even the first contribution, partially or completely, can be refunded. Moreover, the voting mechanism provides impartial analysis of the project, as the voters have a vested interest in its accuracy.  During the last two months, Descrow has been conducting its own ICO, organized by all the rules of the platform itself. The softcap, 3500 ETH, has been already raised, and only 5 days remains until the end of the ICO, after which all the unsold tokens will be destroyed. You still have a unique opportunity to become a part of the safe crowdfunding market establishment and get the tokens of the project for your disposal. Since the end of December, they are being sold at a pre-ICO price.

This low marketcap gives investors lots of potential.  A tenfold decrease is more likely to meet the real needs of startups for developing their products, reducing the risk of global collapse of the entire newborn industry, increasing investors confidence and providing more startups with the opportunity to raise funds by ICO mechanism.

Chapter 2: Middle East, USA, UK   This is the second in the series of articles, prepared by Descrow team, which observes the particularities of ICO regulation in different countries, in order to bring light to the latest news and legal trends of the chaotic market of tokensales. The first chapter looked closer at Asian market, the second one focuses on the legal approach of Middle East countries, America and the foggy costs of Albion.  Israel Chairman of Israel Securities Authority (ISA), Shmuel Hauser, in December, has shown a very positive attitude towards ICO as a promising crowdfunding mechanism. Current ICO applause is indeed surprising as previously Hauser shared a skeptical view on Bitcoin, saying that it “looks like a bubble, it smells like a bubble, behaves like a bubble and feels like a bubble”. On the contrary,  his latest statements on ICO were quite welcoming. According to his speech, the initial coin offering topic should receive a welcoming legal and regulatory response to give Israel a chance to develop international ICO Hub and become the international financial center.  Contrary to countries that decided to outlaw ICO, Israel intends to carefully examine the field to find out the conditions that can make the crowdfunding mechanism safe. The Authority has dedicated resources to form a commission that will present results publicly in a form of an official report.  “We’ll have to consider extending supervision to currency securities and defining an appropriate regulatory framework different from the one we know for securities offerings”, — commented the ISA Chairman.  Generally speaking, at the moment the Israeli government takes a neutral stance on the ICOs and constructive approach towards the industry problems, standing for including ICO in the legal framework and creating mechanisms for investor protection.  The UAE In the middle of September Dubai Financial Services Authority has issued a warning on initial coin offering risks without mentioning any plans to regulate token sales. Without directly banning the ICOs, the financial regulator highlighted, that “these offerings should be regarded as high-risk investments”.  According to DFSA, the riskiest are the offerings, which are made “on a cross-border basis” as they might have “their own unique risks, which may not be easy to identify or understand”.  Contrary to Dubai, the regulator in the Emirate of Abu-Dhabi, Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSDA), is planning to strictly regulate cryptocurrencies and ICOs. According to Abu Dhabi regulator, virtual currencies are “commodities” and the majority of ICOs will be regulated as “specified investments”.  ICO is seen by a regulator as a mechanism, where investors “typically give virtual currencies to an ICO issuer in exchange for a proprietary digital medium of exchange, based on the DLT platform, which is called a ‘coin’ or ‘token’”. The regulator highlights that tokens differ in its nature and in some cases they do not “represent underlying financial asset” but can be “a digital identity record, a voting right, or simply access to software”. Tokens that will be classified as “specified investments” (securities, shares, and bonds) fall under the FSMR regulation. The FSRA will determine whether a given ICO is subject to regulation on a case-by-case basis.  The USA In July 2017 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued its stance on ICO: tokens can be defined as securities on the same basis as shares entering the traditional exchange. This statement has served as an etalon for other regulators, who shared their views shortly after the SEC announcement.  The SEC decision came as a result of the investigation on the decentralized fund DAO epic security breach, which had catastrophic consequences in June 2016: it caused the split of the second largest cryptocurrency network Ethereum. SEC has revealed that issued during its ICO tokens were nothing else but shares and therefore, were subject to regulations.  At the end of November SEC ex-employee, Joseph Grundfest in the interview to the New York Times declared that ICOs should be banned as soon as possible, due to the violation of all possible legal norms. In his opinion, the violation of the law via the ICO mechanism is so widely and openly in place, that it all seems “the almost comedic quality”.  “ICOs represent the most pervasive, open and notorious violation of federal securities laws since the Code of Hammurabi,” — Grundfest said in an interview.  Despite the SEC statements, most of startups do not even try to comply with the law.  One way or another, SEC has actually started to implement measures of ICO crime suppression. The Cyber Unit, established for this purpose in September, “focus the Enforcement Division’s substantial cyber-related expertise on targeting cyber-related misconduct, such as violations involving distributed ledger technology and initial coin offerings, market manipulation schemes involving false information spread through electronic and social media, cyber-related threats to trading platforms…”.  The Cyber Unit wasted no time and already brought two enforcement actions related to ICOs, PlexCorps, and Munchee, that, according to SEC, did not comply with the law. Additionally, SEC has issued trading suspensions of public companies that had promoted plans for future ICOs, such as First Bitcoin Capital Corp., CIAO Group, Strategic Global и Sunshine Capital.  Canada Following the US SEC statement, the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) has confirmed, that securities law may apply to ICOs, emphasizing that the digital nature of tokens does not determine whether or not a particular token is a security. According to the statement, the Howey test answers that question.  In the middle of October, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) released a statement that it is “keen to support” cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings. The OSC invites to take advantage of their consulting services that help ICO launching startups to comply with security law. Also, the OSC has established a dedicated OSC Launchpad team “to respond quickly to cryptocurrency offerings”.  OSC, being one of the largest financial regulatory agencies in Canada, has the Toronto Stock Exchange within its jurisdiction and administers the Ontario Securities Act and the Commodity Futures Act. The Commission in its statement shared that they intended to be flexible in their approach towards the ICO as an innovative financial mechanism “to find the right balance for those vested in this space”.  On the OSC web page, it is clarified that cryptocurrency offerings, such as ICOs, ITOs, and sales of securities of cryptocurrency investment funds “can provide new opportunities for business to raise capital and for investors to access a broader range of investments”.  Mexica Recently, in the middle of December, the Bank of Mexico, Mexico’s central bank, has issued Warning on cryptocurrencies and ICO, where cryptocurrencies were named “risky investments” and ICOs “could potentially violate Mexican financial law”. The approach is fully supported by Mexico’s banking and securities regulator (CNBV). According to CNBV statement, cryptocurrencies “are not officially recognized in Mexico as a legal form of payment…Some ICOs that originate and are emitted in Mexico could violate the Markets and Securities Law and constitute a financial crime”.  However, the Mexican regulator statement includes no direct ban on ICOs. Moreover, it lacks specific regulatory guidelines and fines. Therefore, on the one hand, it gives Mexico’s Central Bank broad authority to regulate operating companies, inspecting and issuing suspensions. On the other hand, it leaves startups enough space for maneuver. Interestingly enough, in its statement, the regulator also claims that the upcoming bill “will drive innovation and competition by establishing a clear operational framework”.  The Isle of Man In a week after the Chinese regulators’ decision to outlaw ICOs, the official representative of the Isle of Man, Brian Donegan, released the island stance on this method of crowdfunding. The representative has shown an enthusiasm to develop the regulatory framework under the island jurisdiction, for which, as he added, a certain time for clarification and procedures establishment is needed. Under its jurisdiction in 2014-2015, the regulatory frameworks have been developed that allow launching ICOs in compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations.  Mann, being a self-governing British crown dependency, which is not part of the United Kingdom or the European Union, is an offshore territory. Tokens, which are welcomed by its regulators, will have a legal status under its jurisdiction. The Isle of Man has become one of the first countries to develop a regulatory apparatus for cryptocurrencies designed to promote ICO. The island government counts on becoming the trial zone for the ICO “massive vertical market”.  The United Kingdom At about the same time the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has ringed an alarm bell around the fact that initial coin offerings (ICO) resemble the same characteristics as initial public offerings (IPO), as well as private placements of securities and crowdsales. The FCA has warned that the authority plans to “conduct a deeper examination” and will assess if it needs to take “further regulatory action”. Also, the regulator warns investors to be conscious of the risks involved and that some of the purchased tokens might fall under regulations and has to be registered.  That being said, the FCA acknowledges that cryptocurrencies bring new opportunities for startups, as the innovative investment schema, and for investors – as an access to a broader range of investment tools. By one means or another, the startups that are planning to raise fund via ICO should be extremely careful while using the collected funds, as the careful attitude towards such questions mean, in particular, care for the investors, as the token price, and consequently investment returns, depend on the success of the project.  The materials are prepared by the Pr-department of Descrow project, a first in the world platform for secure ICO investments.

Among other issues, the draft law addresses the theme of ICOs. The Central Bank and the Finance Ministry are planning to impose restrictions on the ability to purchase tokens for non-professional investors: they`ll able to purchase one project`s tokens in volume, not exceeding the sum of 50 thousand roubles. If approved, the changes are due to come into force by 1 July 2018.  The Russian government’s position significantly differs from that published by the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko a few days earlier, who actually have given the green light to the development of blockchain sector for his country economy. According to the decree, presented on 22 December, individuals get complete freedom when dealing with tokens -they can own, buy and sell them for Belarusian rubles, foreign currency and electronic money, as well as giving, exchanging and bequeathing them. This activity will not be regarded as entrepreneurial, moreover, its participants will be provided with tax incentives — exemption from income tax and taxes on profits and value added.  If the Russians will be allowed to register their companies in Belarus, many of them would find it much easier to work on the territory of the Union state, instead of spending a lot of money for flying to Switzerland or Singapore and meeting all the legal requirements of these countries.  Descrow is watching closely all the developments around the ICOs regulation in various jurisdictions, for this question is quite important for the ICO success. Belarus can become a kind of a sandbox for the ICOs legal regulation, though maybe a number of peculiarities of the internal policy may discourage some investors. Follow our news, Descrow definitely will cover further developments on this issue.  http://descrow.com/  https://medium.com/@Descrow  https://www.facebook.com/descrow3/  https://twitter.com/Descrow3  https://t.me/descrow_eng",False

The code considers the moral and legal principles of safety during the initial coin offerings. The document is intended to guidance on moral, legal, and security practices and obligations in the ICO industry.  The CVA president Oliver Bussman said that the code was developed in connection with the rapid development of blockchain and ICO space.  “The Crypto Valley Association knows the best assets to the crypto space are the dynamically talented entrepreneurs that are our members. We want to be sure to provide these members and any new members of the CVA with an ICO-specific Code of Conduct as they embark on their ICO. It is an exciting process, a process that for many entrepreneurs and companies has the ability to change the landscape of the crypto field.”  The Association of Crypto Valley is committed to remove some risks out of the ICOs practice and to improve the quality of the ICOs final products and services. In a press release, Bousman explained:  “The rapid development of token launches has raised concerns around stability and security, and as a leader in this field, it’s [the CVA’s] responsibility to support the industry. The widespread adoption of this framework, combined with careful supportive regulation would bring stability to an exciting but uncertain trend in blockchain.”  Descrow fully supports such initiatives — putting the ICOs into legal framework will give this field the opportunity to gain the trust of investors. However, the main thing we need to achieve this goal is to increase awareness for both startups and investors. ICO has yet to form its own community, and the tool of decentralized escrow will facilitate this process.  https://medium.com/@Descrow/crypto-valley-association-issued-its-own-code-of-icos-conducting-7d3977ae194d",False

The involvement of escrow agents or companies, as a guarantee of liability, turns out to be an insufficient measure, due to the human factor that discredits the security of an independent, distributed system.  Decentralized escrow is a new concept in the blockchain space, that provides a mechanism of control over the invested funds, which could be the best solution for regulating the decentralized market of ICOs.  The platform for ICO investments DES, founded by the head of Russian Blockchain Association Sergey Besedin,  includes an in-built instrument for decentralized escrow, by means of which investors can control their invested funds by themselves, in a decentralized manner. DES will be a first in the world project to guarantee the independence of escrow and the only  decentralized solution for the transparent and fair use of funds, once the crowdsale is over.
