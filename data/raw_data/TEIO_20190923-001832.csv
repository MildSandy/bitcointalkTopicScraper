It's funny because I was in Kassel with my partner for a concert and not really involved with the Documenta Exhibition. However, just taking a brief walk this beautiful construction caught my eye. It wasn't running but I just walked around admiring it before spotting the QR code and - lo and behold - discovered not only its fascinating history but that it's connected to my crypto world!  We came back the following day when it was tabled to run and loved putting my own energy into stamping a physical coin and mining a crypto coin in the same process. The irony is after all the early excitement about mining and ASICs in late 12 early 13, I ended up with two paperweight BFL units that weren't worth running by the time I got them so this was actually the first crypto I've mined. Also fascinating to learn about the history of slave-labour for coin minting and did some reading-up of my own one evening too. Thanks for that.  I have not really kept up with alts and ICOs so I don't really know how they work, (nor have I downloaded the app nor read the white paper) but I'm assuming the private key with which I signed the transaction to send the BTC will let me claim my TEIO when the time comes? That's of secondary consideration for me really. Whatever happens with the TEIO, I'm happy to have experienced that, have massive respect for those of you who thought it all up and brought it to fruition and happy for you to have the 5mBTC anyway  All the best with the next stage of the project",False

The existence of “mills of blood” can be traced back to IV A .c in Grece This kind of machine was an apparatus used in places where neither wind nor water were available as means of production, and only labor could be used as source of energy. There were three of these kind of mills in Latin America, all three were used to make silver coins during the Spanish colony. There was one in Mexico, one in Peru and one in Bolivia. The MoB presented at dOCUMENTA 14 in Kassel is a reproduction of the Bolivian MoB.     During the 100 days that dOCUMENTA 14 will run in Kassel the MoB will produce as many teios as the audience manages, out of a limited of 30,000 planchets. Each of this teios will in turn mine a crypto-teio. At the closing of dOCUMENTA 14 the production of these coins will stop and there will be no possibility to produce more teios, nor crypto-teios. The MoB will be destroyed. All of the teios produced will be collected, certified and deposited in a safe.                          ICO Distribution _____________________________________________________________________________   During the 100 days that dOCUMENTA 14 will run in Kassel the MoB will produce as many teios as the audience manages, out of a limited of 30,000 planchets. 30,000 more teos will be created by mining in order to maintain the Teios network.     Visitors to Documenta art exhibition or this website will be able to buy the tokens generated each week.  The number of existing tokens will be distributed in proportion to the invested value in BTC each week from July 1st, 2017.  The mill will be the only miner of the network until the end of the ICO and it will be destroyed at the end of the art exhibition as well as the mold used for the physical coins.  The reward for block resolution will always be 1 coin and there will be a 2 minutes space between blocks starting at the end of the ICO.30,000 more teos will be created by mining in order to maintain the Teios network.     The price of each coin will be determined by the number of coins generated each week (max 300 days), proportionally according to the amount invested.  During the Documenta 14 Art Exhibition, the “Mill of blood” will be generating metallic coins that will end up in an armored box placed in the underground of the mill. This box will be kept at Deutsche Bank at the end of the ICO and the physical coins will be used to support the value of the cryptocurrency that is generated each time a visitor spins around the mill making a coin fall into the box.
