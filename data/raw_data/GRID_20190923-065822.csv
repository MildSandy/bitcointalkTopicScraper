On November 11th, our public token sale ended finishing the sale of GRID tokens. To all those who purchased, thank you! We thought it would be helpful to give a brief overview of where we are with regards to funding, development, and operations. We’re especially excited by the work we’ve accomplished that will set our direction into the new year, and we’d like to share that as well. Funding Below are the current holdings of the company. To date we have spent zero of these funds, but we will begin to utilize them as we complete the spinning out process from ConsenSys. 94,070.8 ether 570.5 bitcoin $125,000 At the time of writing, this amounts to ~$38.5m, which is ample to implement our roadmap. The plan is to sell only enough crypto to cover a six month run rate at any given point in time. Unsold Tokens A popular topic of discussion in our slack (now telegram!) has been regarding what we will do with unsold tokens. We are working with our legal team to reach a conclusion on where to put the unsold tokens from the sale and the tokens held in treasury for marketing and customer acquisition (90m). At this time, Grid+ has no plans to sell GRID tokens ever again. Furthermore, we have no plans to spend any significant number from the latter basket — as our business strategy has evolved since the initial allocation was made. The current options are: Burn them Lock them up for 1–2 years Other options not yet considered For the unsold tokens (~50m) we have the legal approval to lock them up, so we will do that soon (for 2 years). This will give us more time to approach a more permanent strategy. As of today, the unsold tokens remain in the sale contract. The treasury tokens require additional analysis, but we will continue to work on a strategy for those as well. Development Our high level technology strategy is to stand on the shoulders of those who have come before, while adding our strategic special sauce to the mix. We have begun diligently reviewing offerings from a number of firms who provide specialty software to electricity retailers. These solutions are modular, so our plan is to use their stack for pieces where blockchain doesn’t make sense (e.g. upstream interfacing with wholesalers) and implement our modules where appropriate. In parallel, we have begun to define the initial version of the agent API. This will be logic that runs in the secure computing environment and will affect how third party applications interact with the device’s keys. The first version of this API is fully mapped out and we are starting to implement it in the form of a low level module that will interact with the secure signing firmware. In a similar vein, we have identified a board to utilize and are mapping out the firmware for it. We will provide updates via our blog as development continues. The technology is really exciting and we’re looking forward to sharing! Austin Meeting From Nov 20–22, we met as a team in Austin to discuss our roadmap and interview candidates for open positions. This was an extremely fruitful working session and has solidified upcoming milestones in our timeline. We will have more information on product developments in the coming months — let’s just say we are excited about what our agent device will become and what we can bring to the energy space. The Near Future In summary, we are on track to implement our designs for the future of energy. We will be heads-down in the coming months and will continue give the community updates on our progress. We are still targeting both the first version of the agent device and the launch of an energy provider in Texas in 2018.",False

Consensus 2017: Energy Markets Panel Rice Blockchain Conference: Ethereum Smart Battery Swarm   Abstract  In the past ten years the cost of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar panels and wind turbines has decreased significantly. This has led to expeditious and widespread adoption. Additionally, battery prices are rapidly decreasing, making them economically viable to supplement variable generation renewable resources by storing energy for the electrical grid. The confluence of these developments has created an emergent electrical grid where the means of production are less centralized and the control systems are less likely to be strictly top-down. The concept of independently owned and controlled DERs is known as the transactive energy grid.  The transactive grid promises to increase durability of the electrical grid while simultaneously increasing efficiency and enabling the adoption of more renewable energy. However, the distributed nature of the transactive grid poses two major challenges primarily related to technical control and grid administration. Both challenges can potentially be addressed using a blockchain. The ConsenSys energy team has several years of experience building and demonstrating proof-of-concept blockchain-based distributed energy resource management solutions. Through this experience, ConsenSys identified the opportunity to form Grid+, which will build natively Ethereum-based utilities in deregulated markets. Grid+ will demonstrate production ready blockchain-based energy solutions at scale in competitive commercial environments. In doing so, Grid+ will enable the transactive grid of the future while proving the advantages of Ethereum over incumbent technologies.  Grid+ is developing a hardware and software stack to create a secure Ethereum enabled gateway and connect Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The hardware gateway, or “smart energy agent”, is an Internet-enabled, always-on appliance which will securely store cryptocurrencies and process payments for electricity in real-time. The agent will also programmatically buy and sell electricity on behalf of the user and intelligently manage smart loads (e.g. Tesla Powerwall or Nest thermostat). The software stack will work in conjunction with the smart energy agent to make payments using a combination of Grid+ designed payment-channels and a Raiden network hub (when available). Grid+ is developing a system architecture that allows a typical user to leverage cryptocurrencies while remaining unaware of it’s use. Interestingly, the implementation of a secure, always-on system with low friction payment rails provides a missing piece of critical infrastructure in the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. The Grid+ infrastructure has many uses beyond electricity and will be key to enabling the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies.  How does Grid+ Work?  Grid+ functions as a commercial utility in select deregulated markets in the United States. Grid+ agent devices pay for all electricity bills automatically and in real-time. All payments are done over state channels using BOLT tokens. Each BOLT token is equal to $1.00USD and is are 100% backed by USD deposit. All fees from these payments are held by a fee vault smart-contract called Karabraxos.     Fast Token Facts  Token Model: The Grid+ system will have a two token model.  One token known as GRID and the other known as BOLT.  GRID will be staked by Grid+ customers to allow customers access to near wholesale electricity prices.  The other token known as the BOLT will be a stable token backed by USD deposits and issued by Grid+. BOLT can be used by Grid+ customers whom do not wish to have forex risk associated with cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum.  Token Sale: We will be holding a token sale of the GRID token sometime in Q3 of 2017.  Token Sale Cap: The sale of GRID tokens is planned to take place in a Reverse Dutch Auction with a cap which is yet to be determined.      Links  Website Whitepaper Twitter Medium Slack",False
