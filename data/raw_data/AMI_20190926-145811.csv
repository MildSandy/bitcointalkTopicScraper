Are you a cryptocurrency enthusiast looking to be part of the next biggest blockchain tech? Then you’re in luck.  As we have been spreading the word about our ICO, we are now opening a contest for explainer video that more easily demonstrates the value of our Product, our ICO.  We thought we could pay someone to make exactly what we want, or, we could have some fun and involve the community. So, let's do this.  We will pick 3 winners that will SPLIT THE 10,000 AMI TOKENS  Judging will be based on the following:  a. Entertainment Factor (20% of the score) b. How well the AMICORUM.LIVE is explained and understood (50% of the score) c. Originality (30% of the score)  Rules:  Your video can be as long as it needs to be.  Royalty free music only is to be used if any.  Any form of video is accepted including animation, person speaking and anything in between so long as the message is clear.  Video must be uploaded to Youtube and submitted to marketing@amicorum.live and sent no later than May 5th, 2018.

INTRODUCTION TO AMICORUM.LIVE  AMICORUM (Latin word close to the meaning of Gathering of Friends) is an innovative platform that will decentralize the ticket re-sale industry using blockchain and secure identity platform.  The platform will be secure, transparent and free of any transaction/processing fees for buying and selling of only authenticated tickets in the secondary resale market.  Sellers will be able to list their tickets in fiat (using a market-feed oracle, the platform will calculate AMI prices at the time of purchase) that will be authenticated with smart contract and Buyers will be able to buy tickets with the AMI token (the new cryptocurrency based on Ethereum blockchain) at 0 transaction fee and 0 processing fees.

The platform will be secure, transparent and free of any transaction/processing fees for buying and selling of only authenticated tickets in the secondary resale market.  Sellers will be able to list their tickets in fiat (using a market-feed oracle, the platform will calculate AMI prices at the time of purchase) that will be authenticated with smart contract and Buyers will be able to buy tickets with the AMI token (the new cryptocurrency based on Ethereum blockchain) at 0 transaction fee and 0 processing fees.  Rewards will also be offered to users for transacting on the platform.  WEBISTE I WHITEPAPER I TELEGRAM I FACEBOOK I TWITTER I LINKEDIN I REDDIT I ANN THREADI   https://i.imgur.com/jaEW95i.png  PRE SALE STARTS ON April 1, 2018 WITH 20% Bonus Tokens  TOTAL SUPPLY DURING PRE-SALE – 20,000,000 AMI TOKENS  TOTAL TOKEN SUPPLY DISTRIBUTION  80%: Total ICO Distribution – 40,000,000 15%: Reserved for Founders/Management – 7,500,000 2%: Reserved for Advisors – 1,000,000 3%: Reserved for Marketing/Loyalty Purposes – 1,500,000   CURRENT PROBLEMS IN THE REAL WORLD  Even though we have seen a continuous growth in technologies and developments within the global ticketing industry, there are still a large number of problems including:  Transaction Fee – Although the seller is able to sell their tickets online, the buyer still needs to pay for the ticket, platform fee and a transaction fee that is charged by their bank.  The AMICORUM.LIVE platform will take away this pain from the buyers and provide a seamless experience free from any transaction fee or bank fee.  The platform will be used to sell tickets and buy tickets at the cost listed.  Untrusted/Counterfeit – Despite the usual warnings on the website asking buyers to only buy tickets from the box office or a reputable ticket exchange website, they still direly go straight into this problem.  And even fuel it.  The most usual case is when the same ticket is sold to 10-15 enthusiasts or even more.   The first ticket holder to arrive gets to view the event or attend the concert/festival and the rest have to just go back home.   The problem creates a two-way issue – one for the enthusiasts who were keen on attending the event and spend a lot of money and other the organizers who could have sold one more ticket to the enthusiasts.  At the least, there is no one winning here.

LIVE is secure and gives the clear picture of the transactions. Transactions are based upon the fee-based blockchain ecosystem for the collection of tickets listed by professional and independent resellers, removing the transaction costs, fraud and enabling the customers who buy tickets. While this process takes place, the seller will list his ticket and he enters the prices of the ticket on the platform of Amicorum and Amicorum will certainly convert the cost in AMI tokens that will be paid by the buyer. Buyer needs to confirm the ticket what he purchased and creates a transaction or token exchange where they can take in exchange of ticket. Depends upon the Ethereum blockchain, the transaction will establish after the confirmations received from the network. Tokens are directly sent to the seller and tickets will be available to the customers in their account and you can download the tickets for the future use which is available at the event. Amicorum will change all the business techniques that are related to listing a ticket of a person, sale, pre-sale, token release, rewards and releasing the tickets for festival or concert. Tickets are distributed within time while the funds are connected with each time of the sale.",False
