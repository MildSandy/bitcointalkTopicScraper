The project is quite young, can I get acquainted with your previous experience?! Hi Miike, We have little experience with ICOs but if you view our WhitePaper you will see that we are serious brewers backed by consultants who have created over 100 award winning beers. You may have noticed that we won best beer in the first competition we entered in November.  We have a significant craft brewery currently capable of producing 90,000 litres pm.  We are using ICO experts to launch BEER Coin as a new model of crowdfunding. The two key value drivers are that BEER will be optionally convertible to shares in real, operating craft breweries. Also, rather than mining BEER we are releasing as prizes on beer sales by Brewery Consortium partners to stimulate trade, increased sales and desirability. We will be releasing numerous updates on medium.com but early indication is that there are many craft breweries very interested in partnering us on this venture",True

For most craft breweries setting up an ICO is prohibitively expensive. Also, our plan is too invest in partners and drive their beer sales by releasing BEER Coin as prizes on sales. Hence, they have the benefit of BEER without the cost of creating their own token.  Multiple breweries creating their own token is no different to multiple new app developers or exchanges creating own token but in the traditional world of brewing there is less drive to do so. Also, our partner cooperation program will include the best breweries and fuel rapid expansion.",True
