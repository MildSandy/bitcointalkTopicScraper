In the first phase of a clinical trial, the proposed drug safety is tested  1/1 and those tests last for more than two months and usually involve a number of healthy volunteers who are paid to be part of the trial. The aim of this study is to observe how would the human body react to the tested drug or device  and different dosages and intensity are included. The statistics showed the 70% of drugs/devices pass this phase.  The second phase tests the efficiency of the drug/device and usually lasts from several months to about two years.  The number of volunteers in this phase jumps to hundreds of people. Many of the studies conducted in this phase are  random and they are usually applied on two groups of people. The first group takes a dosage of the experimental  drug while the other group takes a standard medication while thinking that they're taking the actual experimental drug.  The researchers are unaware of the actual experiment too. This is done to observe the psychological effects and  human behavior. By gathering this information, the investigators deliver comparative information about the safety and  efficiency of the drug or device to pharmaceutical companies and the FDA. About 33.3% of the tested drugs or  devices go through phase I and II.  The third phase of clinical trials are randomized as well and they usually have several hundred to thousands of  volunteers. In this phase the scale of the testing is way bigger and testing a drug or device would take a minimum of  2 years or even more. By having a large number of volunteers, the investigators get a better understanding and more  details on the effectiveness, benefits, and the possible harmful or unwanted reactions. When a drug/device passes this  phase, pharmaceutical companies are able to request approval from the FDA to start marketing the drug.  The fourth phase and the last phase is named Post Marketing Surveillance Trial which is a study that starts after the  drug or the device is available for consumer use. There are three main objectives of this study, first pharmaceutical  companies compare the new drug or device to other existing drugs. Secondly, they observe the long-term effectiveness  of the drug on the patient's progress and life quality. Third, they determine the cost-effectiveness of the new drug  compared to existing or popular drugs. The results of this phase can lead to having the new drug or device taken off  the market, or some restrictions may apply when using the new medicine or tool.  The cost of running these clinical trials is now higher than ever, with expenses running at between $30 million and $70 million for a single Phase III trial.  Integrating Blockchain technology with Clinical trials will give the following benefits:  1: Security to the clinical data and protection from any alteration   2: An immutable record that will show data and all changes in a consistent matter     3: Past data that will show the complete history of clinical information  4: peer-2peer payments via smart contracts  5: Operation interoperability between several systems and data formats  6: Protection of privacy is possible. Blockchain technology allows adding and verifying records to an immutable ledger  without compromising the content of each record.   7: Control of access to the content of each record by using encryption keys. The public key shows that the record  exists while the private key gives access to the content of the record.",False

Very good to know what you mentioned about the companies already they have partnered but one thing i want get clarification whether those companies will allow Clin Tex to use blockchain for their transaction in order get no fraud in between the mediators? Hi there! Pharma companies running clinical trials will all initially agree to place clinical trial metrics and measures on blockchain to foster collaboration without risk of compromising commercial sensitivities and using the security and immutability of blockchain to protect data. So Clintex themselves won't be focussing on this initially, but the setup of the platform should minimize or remove the risk of these sensitivities. I hope this answers your question.",False

My favorite part are the tokenomics and part of the Conclusion paragraph:  ''ClinTex, I feel have a very impressive and ambitious project here. The stats they put forward in their whitepaper are very convincing. They will combine the efficiency and safety of blockchain with predictive analyses and machine learning and revolutionise this industry. Their ecosystem, which is planned to roll out throughout 2019 and into 2020 is perhaps one of the best laid out platforms I have seen in a long time. The team here are striving to bring real change to the world, which in my view is what blockchain is all about. What is more, is that ClinTex has first user advantage in the clinic trials industry. The CTi platform being developed, in my opinion, will achieve a more collaborative process by bringing all stakeholders together in one ecosystem.

In the first phase of a clinical trial, the proposed drug safety is tested  1/1 and those tests last for more than two months and usually involve a number of healthy volunteers who are paid to be part of the trial. The aim of this study is to observe how would the human body react to the tested drug or device  and different dosages and intensity are included. The statistics showed the 70% of drugs/devices pass this phase.  The second phase tests the efficiency of the drug/device and usually lasts from several months to about two years.  The number of volunteers in this phase jumps to hundreds of people. Many of the studies conducted in this phase are  random and they are usually applied on two groups of people. The first group takes a dosage of the experimental  drug while the other group takes a standard medication while thinking that they're taking the actual experimental drug.  The researchers are unaware of the actual experiment too. This is done to observe the psychological effects and  human behavior. By gathering this information, the investigators deliver comparative information about the safety and  efficiency of the drug or device to pharmaceutical companies and the FDA. About 33.3% of the tested drugs or  devices go through phase I and II.  The third phase of clinical trials are randomized as well and they usually have several hundred to thousands of  volunteers. In this phase the scale of the testing is way bigger and testing a drug or device would take a minimum of  2 years or even more. By having a large number of volunteers, the investigators get a better understanding and more  details on the effectiveness, benefits, and the possible harmful or unwanted reactions. When a drug/device passes this  phase, pharmaceutical companies are able to request approval from the FDA to start marketing the drug.  The fourth phase and the last phase is named Post Marketing Surveillance Trial which is a study that starts after the  drug or the device is available for consumer use. There are three main objectives of this study, first pharmaceutical  companies compare the new drug or device to other existing drugs. Secondly, they observe the long-term effectiveness  of the drug on the patient's progress and life quality. Third, they determine the cost-effectiveness of the new drug  compared to existing or popular drugs. The results of this phase can lead to having the new drug or device taken off  the market, or some restrictions may apply when using the new medicine or tool.  The cost of running these clinical trials is now higher than ever, with expenses running at between $30 million and $70 million for a single Phase III trial.  Integrating Blockchain technology with Clinical trials will give the following benefits:  1: Security to the clinical data and protection from any alteration   2: An immutable record that will show data and all changes in a consistent matter     3: Past data that will show the complete history of clinical information  4: peer-2peer payments via smart contracts  5: Operation interoperability between several systems and data formats  6: Protection of privacy is possible. Blockchain technology allows adding and verifying records to an immutable ledger  without compromising the content of each record.   7: Control of access to the content of each record by using encryption keys. The public key shows that the record  exists while the private key gives access to the content of the record.",False

''Developing new medicines is a $350 billion industry, with each new treatment requiring enormous funding and resources before it can be introduced to the market at an average of $2.5 billion per new medicine (Tufts, 2014). Nearly 80% of clinical trials are overrunning their timelines by an average of 10.8 months (Covance, 2013), which translates into as much as $8m in lost revenue each day a drug is delayed (Cutting Edge Information, 2005). Further to this, the number of clinical trials taking place is rising and along with it the associated costs, meaning the cost of new medicine is soaring. This is the problem ClinTex intends to solve.''

Exactly! I'll quote a part from the whitepaper containing information on the Risk Based Monitoring App (CTi-RBM):  ''For example, a common problem in clinical trials is unevaluable patients. If a patient is not evaluable in a clinical trial, it means that their data cannot be used to assess the efficacy/safety of the drug. This issue can generate significant problems for the pharmaceutical company as it needs a certain number of evaluable patients to deliver a statistically relevant assessment. Failure to do so can result in the failure of the entire clinical trial. The causes of this are multi-fold. For example, an unevaluable patient/study can result from the patient not taking the study medication correctly or not performing certain study procedures. The CTi-RBM application will utilise machine learning by applying algorithms to historical and current data to identify patients with a high risk of being unevaluable, thus targeting site monitoring resources on the areas of highest need and risk. This example will be repeated for major sources of risk in a clinical trial, thus making the CTiRBM application a powerful proactive and predictive tool for risk-based monitoring.''  Maybe you know any other examples where this could be helpful?  ",False

However, these academic research applications of CTi are simply to serve as a foundation to refine the platform and demonstrate benefits for use in large scale pharmaceutical trials. The main power and application of the CTi platform will therefore be in late phase clinical trials  (i.e. Phase IIb/Phase III) and in Post Marketing studies (Phase IV).  This is where the full extent of CTi analytics can deliver most efficiency savings.  In answer to the second part of your question, we have significant experience on the team from the medical and more importantly, pharmaceutical and clinical trial background (see https://www.clintex.io/home#team). This experience at this stage is pivotal to guiding our CTi development and deployment strategy. When it comes to real-world implementation, we have, and will continue to build our project management and developer expertise to ensure successful and impactful deployments of CTi. At this stage, we do not propose to actually run or manage clinical trials on behalf of pharmaceutical companies, and so our clinical trial expertise will continue to be consultative rather than hands on. Our Mission is to provide the industry the tools to make their own clinical trial more efficient, and to help them deliver faster medicines at lower cost.",False

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the software that runs on the Ethereum network and allows for the creation and development of different applications all on one platform. It has an unparalleled track record in hosting decentralised applications which enable the execution of smart contracts, which parties can fulfill certain conditions and validate those conditions automatically using code. Due to smart contracts’ self-executing nature, single-party manipulation is averted because control over the execution of the smart contract does not fall into the hands of a single party.
