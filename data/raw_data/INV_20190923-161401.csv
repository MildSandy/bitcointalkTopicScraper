A definite step towards that was picking the token ICOs which can boost my portfolio and I am sure Invacio will prove to be the perfect decision for me.  My well wishers cautioned me when I was joining ICOs to carefully scan promoter credentials, roadmap, white paper, intent of the ICO products etc and Invacio is a 5 star ICO in all these areas. Its an effort of more than 5 years of development by William James Dalrymple West (CEO and Founder) and the team.  What is Jean (Invacio AI nucleus)  Invacio is a vision built around Distribute AI with many distinct product and solution categories. Jean just like any nucleus is not self-sustaining but feeds on Invacio Data— not only the way a brain depends on blood and nutrients and oxygen, but even more the way a child depends on the world for experience. Her eyes and ears open to it always, when Invacio systems are fully powered up she receives real time feeds from live CCTV networks worldwide, interprets images, listens in on audio broadcasts, processes shipping news, tracks aircraft, cars, sea-vessels, knows the weather, is very interested in market-data of course (especially this); she also surveys the masses of data we receive from NASA, from live satellite feeds, and takes in data even from Hubble.  Although Invacio Data’s original purpose had been to serve as Jean’s learning data, it now works quite as much the other way. Her analyses enrich our data resources continually, so that more and more the available data is proprietary, and to be found nowhere else in the world. The constant flow of this real time data, and Jean’s analysis of it, are no small part of what makes it possible for her to comprehend and react even to systems as famously difficult as stocks and the foreign exchange market.  Products and Solution details can be found from White Paper at the website  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-bOaHPFoG1DJfquXi1vtwUOrDqQ46cA2lZIEtoqur-I/edit?usp=sharing  AN ICO unlike others  Invacio Products and solutions are mostly ready and planned to be released immediately after ICO in phased manner. Unlike other ICOs, Invacio already have a full fledged team of developers and support staff and boasts of some of the big industry names on advisory board.  Invacio Coin is a token developed to ERC20 standards. What makes this ICO very attractive for investors is the shares being gifted by Founder to the tune of Investment coming in. This is like sharing wealth and growth for the investor community.  The token use case is threefold :-  ● Firstly Invacio will use INV Coin as a means of driving revenues by immediately releasing products post ICO which will increase the value. ● Invacio will be using INV Coin (using Tamius) as a paired currency in order to allow it to better track alongside fiat currencies which will allow Invacio to blur the line between fiat and crypto currencies. Doing this allows Invacio to offer debit cards, bank accounts and all the banking solutions. ● Finally INV Coin will be redeemable directly against Invacio products and services.  In early November Invacio addressed the United Nations (ESCAP) on the use of their multi-agent system AI for the ethical generation of wealth and the administration of disaster situations and their upcoming ICO is intended to raise the funds required to launch a company designed to make a real difference to people's lives.
