How will the token be held, in what wallet, how will it be awarded?  A: We published our Token Mechanics here. We address a fundamental problem with AI, which is data classification. There is no way we could model past project outcomes without customer insights, and we achieve that by paying through our tokens.  DREAM Token is a payments token backed by smart contracts used to pay for freelancers, gigs, and premium services. We will also charge for API access for insights into our data sets.  We‚Äôve already proven through DREAM Rewards that tokens are a powerful marketing tool and have had 50,000 claims so far. We will continue DREAM Rewards as an off-platform customer acquisition channel.  At the moment the only incentive to achieve profile completion on DREAM is to get listed on our website. Part of our customer acquisition costs will be paid through DREAM Tokens to push users further down the funnel.  https://dream.ac/  Read more: https://[Suspicious link removed]/dH395VE",False

In the traditional hiring economy such as LinkedIn or a headhunter, one would need to go through various, un-verified and inconsistent data in different formats through various channels to uncover talents.  It is a hit-and-miss process that requires a lot of valuable time to research and long, multiple interviews to find a potential candidate.  DREAM utilizes blockchain and AI technology to verify talent's credentials, store their past work history/projects, effectively matches and assembles the team, based on skills, reputation, and personal fit. DREAM specializes in offering talents who major in Blockchain related industry, but talents from other industries are also welcome to be verified and listed to offer their services in DREAM.  In addition, DREAM also provide unique features such using AI to building the structure of one's new project, utilize the tried and true knowledge that was learned from previous success projects and make that info available to the new clients.   The Whitepaper will help you understand DREAM better ;-)  Let us know if there's anything else you need? thanks!",False

We're updating the whitepaper and website and will push all the updates early next week. It‚Äôs really important to build a product that customers need.   ‚Ä¢ We're working through a final legal review, however we're looking good. We‚Äôll only ramp things up when we are legally sound.   ‚Ä¢ We've just about sorted the KYC processes to align with the financial regulators in Gibraltar. We had to push out the dates which are now fixed:   > Whitelist: 26th May > Pre-Sale: 9th June ‚Üí 16th June > Main-Sale: 16th June ‚Üí 14th July    ‚Ä¢ We have a business development team (Vladimir is owning that) ready to kick start next week.   ‚Ä¢ We've spent a lot of time planning our marketing strategy. We're going to focus on the working with and engaging with our community. We could spend lots on paid ads and banners, but DREAM is a community project. Community engagement will be our focus.   ‚Ä¢ Our Rewards Program has already had 20k claims approved and we've done no marketing - we'll be working this channel to really work with our community.   ‚Ä¢ We have a backlog of announcements and PR, we just want to schedule things at the right time. You just wait üëç üöÄ   I want to share our mission: ‚ÄúBring people together. Create opportunity. Deliver success. Be open, honest, and transparent. Never compromise on quality‚Äù. This is true to our heart, and this is who we are.  We‚Äôre not some crappy token sale, the ecosystem we‚Äôre building is a new way of working. We have a live revenue generating platform, an incredible team, 12 months of work on the DREAM project, and loads of support.   I am pitching DREAM every day to VC‚Äôs and accelerators and they love it. We‚Äôre going to smash this. üëä  This time next week, the project will be going for it. Our team will be here every day and you‚Äôll see traction.    Feedback is welcome.

Not only does their platform seem incredibly well thought out, but they have already built the foundation of it with Moneo and had immense success doing so. Although contractor marketplaces such as Upwork and Fiverr are entrenched, their core value proposition centers on the idea that contractors are willing to pay 20% of their project payments to Upwork in exchange for access to a large client base and a trusted escrow system. Yet over time, contractors find long-term clients and no longer need the security of Upwork‚Äôs platform. When that happens, they cannot take their reputation with them, locking them onto the platform. If Dream were just a marketplace that solved the reputation issue, they would already be an interesting investment. But they appear to be much more. They are a platform for the blockchain era, using the technology to maximize efficiency. By using a crypto escrow system that they themselves designe, they offer flexibility not available anywhere else. In short, Dream is a next-generation platform that matches projects with workers and continuously improves itself from studying the outcomes of these pairings.  Risks     Upwork and Fiverr have huge brand recognition and it could prove challenging to earn the trust of contractors who rely on them for their livelihoods. -3.5     Allowing reputation portability is great unless the accuracy of ratings from other platforms is low. This would then throw off the accuracy of Dream‚Äôs recommendations. -3  Growth Potential     Dream has a highly qualified team that has already built and refined the core product. +4     They solve essentially every issue that contractors have with existing centralized platforms. +3     There is an unusually low fixed token supply which means that it takes far less capital going in to raise the price. +4     Their platform will continuously refine itself thanks to AI and machine learning. +3  Disposition Dream earns a 7.5/10. Although this rating is incredibly high, I believe in this case it is justified. Everything from the token economics to the quality of the team to the product they already have running smoothly begs the question why there is not more publicity around this project. Proof: https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-dream/  This is very good result!",False

When people read the whitepaper (and when we talk about the project) they get it. At the moment the landing page in the first 60 seconds isn‚Äôt clear enough. The team is lucky enough to have access to some marketers who have launched some of the worlds biggest startups to help with this.   ‚Ä¢ DREAM will then need to issue the final version of the whitepaper for legal review (later this week).   ‚Ä¢ DREAM are preparing to publish a lot more content. DREAM have hired https://dream.ac/davidthewriter who has already started writing some blogs.   ‚Ä¢ DREAM are looking to push the whitelist start out to the 12th of May to deal with the compliance/regulatory requirements.   ‚Ä¢ Next week is when marketing will accelerate considerably.

Over the past 18 months thousands of blockchain projects have been handled through Moneo. The current model of hiring individual freelancers for larger projects just doesn‚Äôt scale. Clients often don‚Äôt know what they need, managing freelance teams is onerous, time is wasted, and closed reputation systems are restrictive.  Despite this, demand for freelance talent is increasing. To properly take care of that demand, DREAM is being positioned like an accelerator. DREAM will crowdsource knowledge to scope ideas and structure projects. It will use decentralised reputation systems and AI models to build teams, providing access to a very high quality network of incubators, accelerators, and investors that is currently being built.  DREAM has built a solid team and are deeply immersed in the startup community ensuring that they develop a solution that people want and need. In the next couple of weeks the flood gates will be opened, and you can expect lots of exciting announcements.
