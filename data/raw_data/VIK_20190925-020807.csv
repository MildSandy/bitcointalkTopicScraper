Vikky is an application that allows you to advertise short term jobs, displaying locations on the map from chores such as electricity and water repairs, houses, gardening, etc. to deliver goods from one place to another. Vikky draws on a route map that connects the departure and destination (such as the itinerary), allowing the recipient to easily find a task suitable to their flight. Or a carrier could get more goods on the way to their destination. Vikky also allows users to filter by industry category of interest, or by language of use. Just change the language, for example to Chinese, the Chinese community in the world will see each other regardless of geographic location. This also helps communities to be separated, and not messing up together. Users only need to choose the work nearby which suits themselves, apply for it and wait for the response of the employers. When both sides have agreed, the work will be carried out. Workers receive their earnings when work is completed. Worker or outsourcer information is valued by the community, which enhances the reputation of the employer and the poster, contributing to the reduction of false or fraudulent information. However, only individuals who have traded through Vikky can judge the others, this is the way to avoid phony assessment. Participants in Vikky are very diverse: from ordinary housewives, students, students, engineers, mechanics, to companies that need to recruit short-term workers, and even those who travel, long-distance truck drivers, and even Uber, Grab drivers. Airbnb's owners can also hire a cleaner with Vikky. Or guests of Airbnb can also rent bicycles, find guides, etc. through Vikky.  Vision of Vikky As an after-comer, VIKKY recognized in Southeast Asia, Grab won the Uber by a variety of payment methods from cash to credit cards, services are plentiful and various fulfilling demands from motorcycles, cars, delivery ... Vikky also realized to focus only on the delivery array would be far more risky than expanding for short-term jobs on the same platform. Users can filter information by industry category, or map to find the nearest, most appropriate task available.  And payment solutions will vary from cash, cards, to blockchain technology. Thus, the world will no longer gap in terms of payment rates, payment methods, ...  The technology Vikky will use the blockchain technology on the ERC20 / Ethereum platform to create the VIK Token. This means that the VIK Token will be fully integrated with the latest features of the Ethereum blockchain system. This is a distributed ledger system with automatic calculation, reliable and secure. Use VIK Token combined with VIK Wallet as the basis for payment, instead of using the normal cash payment gateway. More specifically, VIK Token is a new electronic money type used to exchange and pay for services on the Vikky platform. VIK Wallet is a secure and secure electronic wallet used to store VIK Token as well as to allow the VIK Token to be transferred to other digital exchanges.
