To capitalize on this need, we have been developing a ‚Äòwhite label‚Äô solution on top of the current DAPP. White labeling the Blocktix system allows promoters and organizers the option of embedding our full ticketing solution within one of their own apps making it possible to create a seamless experience for the consumer without needing to install different apps for the same event. The whitelabel solution is under continued development but has already been tested at a live event in December of 2018. The solution performed flawlessly with under 1% of ticket buying consumers requiring technical assistance with the application. Most of the attendees of the event AND the promoter of the event were blown away with how the system worked. The ability to add a proximity beacon to the entrance of the event made it possible for the embedded Blocktix whitelabel to instantly push the ticket to the home-screen of all attendee devices entering the venue. The attendees received a notification to open the ticket so it could be instantly scanned. We are currently further testing and refining the MVP of the Blocktix whitelabel ticketing solution to meet the needs of the market. This process of development and iteration will be ongoing through 2019. We have further expanded the whitelabel development path to provide a solution to application developers looking for a way to build local downloads of their app through sponsored local events. More on this to come in future updates‚Ä¶ The ‚ÄòCrypto Winter‚Äô and Blocktix The ‚Äúcrypto-winter‚Äù has been a challenging time for most all projects involved in the space. During this temporary growing-pains period for the crypto industry, Blocktix has delivered on the following: A fully functional and useable ticketing system built on the blockchain Tested the ticketing system in the real world with two live events of nearly 20,000 attendees (test only % of tickets) (July 2018 & September 2018) Developed a whitelabel solution to further meet the needs of the ticketing marketplace (MVP November 2018) Fully ticketed an event of over 500 attendees on the whitelabel solution with NO backup to the ticketing system. (December 2018) A new website directed towards promoters and the event marketplace (January 2019) Blocktix is now continuing the development of the DAPP and whitelabel solution to lead a sales push of the ticketing solution into the marketplace. The Blocktix company is financially solvent and has used funds for development efficiently. Funds are available for continued development and expansion of Blocktix for years and maybe far longer as revenue sources begin to be developed. Thank you all for your continued support of the Blocktix ticketing solution and our goal of disrupting the ticketing industry through application of blockchain technology. Sincerely, Rob Schins",False

Blocktix is an Ethereum based, counterfeit-resistant solution for individuals and event hosting businesses to distribute, advertise, and transfer ownership of event tickets or passes.  Event hosting is an expansive and growing market, yet much like the financial industry, it suffers from constant, systemic challenges regarding fraud prevention, transfers of ownership and intermediary cost.  Utilizing Ethereum smart contracts, the Blocktix platform will leverage the power of decentralization to resolve the systemic issues currently plaguing the event hosting industry.  Blocktix will combine on-chain ticket distribution, a trustless p2p ticket exchange and an incentivised advertising network to create a single source event hosting platform that replaces the fragmented legacy systems currently in use.  The Blocktix platform will have a dramatic effect on the event hosting industry as it will reduce distribution, transfer and promotion costs up to 90% and create real-time accessibility for concertgoers to instantly obtain/sell tickets. These improvements will enhance the concert attendee's purchasing experience and amplify the event host's ability to return a profit.  For further explanation of the technical details and function of the system, please see our whitepaper  The Path forward We believe the Blocktix user acquisition plan will simultaneously grow the Blocktix and Ethereum ecosystems.  User Acquisition  Although many counterfeit-resistant ticket distribution systems have been developed, some using central ledgers and even some proposed utilizing blockchains, most of these current solutions experience one major obstacle: user adoption. Event hosting businesses cannot use ticket distribution systems that have no users, regardless of the security benefits and cost savings those systems offer. The Blocktix team's experience in the event hosting and marketing industries, has enabled the development of an innovative and practical plan to solve the user adoption challenge. The objective of this three-part plan is to bootstrap the system with a network of users, making it economically advantageous for other event hosting businesses to host their events on the Blocktix platform.  Blocktix Event Hosting  A portion of the future crowdfunding will be used by Blocktix to host a series of concerts. These concerts will be held near college campuses in California, focusing on venues capable of hosting 10,000+ attendees. In order to gain access to these concerts, the attendees will be required to purchase tickets through the Blocktix application, with ETH/TIX as the only accepted methods of payment. For most concertgoers, the desire to attend a concert and to see their prefered artist perform, will outweigh the small learning curve associated with using the Blocktix system. (see FAQ)  For these events, Blocktix will act as the event host rather than occupying a sponsorship role. As the event host, we will retain the events' proceeds and any surplus revenue resulting from the events. All proceeds from these events, along with any surplus revenue, will be transferred forward and reused to host additional events. This strategy will enable Blocktix to host a long series of events, thereby adding tens or hundreds of thousands of concertgoers to the Blocktix network and, ultimately, introducing these individuals to the Ethereum ecosystem.  To help supplement the cost of events and extend the number of events possible, Blocktix will explore sponsor partnerships with companies in the crypto-currency/blockchain space, focusing primarily on crypto-currency exchanges. As all Blocktix events will require ETH/TIX as the only method of payment, all concert attendees will need to have a basic exchange account. A partnership with Blocktix will allow an exchange to acquire tens of thousands of new customer accounts while also providing marketing opportunities at the events. These partnerships will add additional sources of revenue to Blocktix events, thereby greatly extending the number of hosted events possible.  Rather than attempting to acquire a share of current crypto-currency users, the Blocktix user acquisition plan directly targets mainstream individuals (concertgoers) and exposes these individuals to crypto-currency. For this reason, we believe the Blocktix user acquisition plan will simultaneously grow the Blocktix and Ethereum ecosystems.  User Retention  A portion of the event hosting fees will be allocated to retain users and encourage reuse of the Blocktix system. After each new event, ETH/TIX tokens will be distributed to every application wallet that has used at least one ticket to a prior event. With each new event held, additional TIX/ETH will be distributed to each prior user. The continued disbursement of ETH/TIX will increase the value in each prior user's wallet and thereby create an increasing incentive to purchase additional tickets for concerts hosted on the Blocktix system.  Incentivised Advertising  All previous ticket users will receive fees for viewing in-application event advertising. This incentive to view the event advertising will increase the effectiveness of the in-application advertising. Receiving the incentive fees will increase the amount of ETH/TIX in each user's application wallet, encouraging them to purchase additional tickets for concerts hosted on the Blocktix system.  Attracting Event Hosting Businesses  The Blocktix user acquisition and retention plans have been designed to develop a network of Blocktix users, with an interest in event attendance. Access to this network will represent a valuable opportunity to target a concentrated base of tens/hundreds of thousands of users, with the additional benefit of each user possessing a wallet balance, ready to use toward purchasing tickets. The unique Blocktix platform allowing open access to this network of users will provide a very compelling economic and practical incentive for event hosting companies to choose the Blocktix platform when hosting their events.  Conclusion  Blocktix is an incentive driven system for both ticket users and event hosting companies; it adequately eliminates the limitations of existing platforms, including offering solutions for counterfeit and transaction fraud, reducing promotion associated fees by nearly 90% and improving the overall user experience. By providing solutions to the constant, systemic challenges in the event industry, Blocktix will swiftly become the most cost-effective and prefered platform for event hosting.  *Blocktix will operate in cooperation with event promotion companies, artist management companies, event venues, ect.  TIX Tokens The Blocktix platform will require TIX Tokens to be used as a system access fee and to have new events show up on the event feed. TIX tokens will also be required to place in-application advertising. TIX and/or ETH tokens will be necessary to facilitate ticket purchases and P2P transfers. The hosting, transfer and marketing fees will be distributed to TIX token holders who participate in the event/advertisment verification process which is open and available to all TIX holders.  Fee rates will initially be set as described below. Fee rates will be increased/decreased by majority vote of TIX holders after launch of the system.    Posting fee based on number of tickets and total value of all tickets offered, roughly 2%.    2% of the value of all p2p transfers through the exchange platform.    A per contact fee for direct marketing to local users of the Blocktix application. The amount of this fee will be based on regional advertising network traffic.  Blocktix fees are designed to eliminate spam, compensate token holders who participate in the event/advertising verification process, discourage for-profit ticket trading (scalping) on the P2P exchange, and to incentivise mobile application users to view event advertisment. There should be no expectation of profit from TIX token ownership or from the Blocktix system.  Crowdsale The Blocktix crowdsale will be an opportunity to acquire credits (TIX) to host events and advertise on a decentralized event hosting platform, built on Ethereum. Crowdsale funds will be allocated to complete development of the system, provide funding for the user acquisition strategy and fund promotions that will transition Blocktix into the most economically sensible platform for event hosting businesses.

The types of fees include: Service Charges Building Facility Charges Processing Charges Shipping Charges or E-Ticket Convenience Charges  Blocktix will save small to medium event hosts much of the ticketing fees, as well as marketing and advertising fees.

Utilizing Ethereum smart contracts, the Blocktix platform will leverage the power of decentralization to resolve the systemic issues currently plaguing the event hosting industry.              Blocktix will combine on-chain ticket distribution, a trustless p2p ticket exchange and an incentivised advertising network to create a single source event hosting platform that replaces the fragmented legacy systems currently in use.              The Blocktix platform will have a dramatic effect on the event hosting industry as it will reduce distribution, transfer and promotion costs up to 90% and create real-time accessibility for concertgoers to instantly obtain/sell tickets. These improvements will enhance the concert attendee's purchasing experience and amplify the event host's ability to return a profit.              For further explanation of the technical details and function of the system, please see our whitepaper        Vision        The world may not yet be ready for decentralised systems, more specifically the consequences they carry. We see it as our duty to help change that. Immutability of the blockchain, the fact that transactions are set in stone, is praised by many until they are confronted with the theft or loss of their own funds. Humans are bound to make mistakes, it is inevitable but to some degree controllable.              The Bitcoin network for example does not process transactions that are deemed to be too irregular, but this technique does not play well with the wide range of capabilities Ethereum provides. A different approach has to be adopted to solve the issue at hand. We want to make smart contracts more secure by creating static standard templates such as our ticket contracts in combination with user friendly interfaces to reduce the amount of possible errors.              We are avid technologists with a passion for block chain technology and want to promote its use cases as much as possible, but we believe that Ethereum smart contracts are too complex for the average computer users and that factor is inhibiting its growth to the masses.
