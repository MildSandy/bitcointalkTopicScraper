The tokens themselves have literally no utility other than being a vehicle for (1) the company raising money to spend, and (2) being a quick flip for investors who wanted to get a good return based on the FOMO from people who didn't get in.  No FOMO here.  FOMO-based flips happen when the ICO is still fresh in the mind and there's lots of emotions running high from people who missed out and think they're losing money.  These tokens aren't transferable for many days, by which time we'll all have cooler heads and won't be upset about missing out on this investment whatsoever.  Definitely not one to hold - not many ERC20 tokens are worth holding to be honest.  The vast majority have no long-term prospects (given the fact that they're largely undeveloped projects with little utility for their own tokens, and given the fact that the marketplace is changing rapidly and there's nothing stopping a Monetha-killer coming along in a few months.)  Still pissed off that companies do these quick-draw ICOs: shows that they're more interested in grabbing money quickly rather than distributing tokens fairly to prospective investors.  I truly wanted to invest a large sum in Monetha, but these ridiculous panic-driven ICOs that are over in a matter of minutes are getting fucking old.  I'll be over this missed opportunity in an hour, after I've guzzled a bottle of wine.  There'll be another hot ICO along very soon...",False

Merchants would love to have a DTRS that is transferable and could be implemented with major online stores.  If a vendor accepts more than one currency, it means that he opens the doors to more people who are willing to spend different currencies, which is extremely beneficial.  When you think about it, a regular merchant could use PayPal all the way. The problem is, that he would have to spend bigger percentage for fees, and he will only be able to accept FIAT currencies. Monetha meanwhile, has a plan to do FIAT to FIAT transactions of Blockchain, together accepting other cryptocurrencies. With low merchant fees, this could be the game changer in the industry  Regards, Monetha Team",False

We are not looking at our competitors as being an “ICO e-commerce competitors” or not ICO competitors. If you look at this more broadly, we can name a few: BlockPay, Coinpayments in terms of payment processing and uPort in terms of reputation. But non of these have a solution that covers both: decentralised trust that is working flawlessly with payments.  Actually at first, Monetha was meant to be only a payment processing company, but after doing a lot of research we understood that trust is the key element for the global commerce.  As for the exchanges - it was our agreement that we can't disclose the names of exchanges at the moment, but what we can tell you, is that we plan to get listed on exchanges in 2-4 weeks after the ICO.",False

If we take a look at uTrust and Monetha, one clear point stands out - Monetha has Decentralised Trust and Reputation System, which is transferrable, powered by Smart Contracts, which hold all the information about the purchase (warranty, buyers info, etc.), and adjusts the ratings automatically.  Based on the information saved during the transaction (for example warranty), clients and merchants will be able to file/solve a claim, rate each other, view ratings etc. Their history is then recorded onto the immutable Ethereum blockchain so that others can make well-informed commercial decisions.  So for example, once the payment is made, the trust rate for merchant increases. If client makes a review, trust rate increases as well. If client makes a claim and merchant does not react to it, the smart contract decreases the trust rate. Different weights of how smart contract changes the trust rate will be assigned to different actions  Think about this use case: imagine you are a merchant from China. The only way to sell your products to the global world and be trusted at the same time is to be part of Alibaba. Moreover, if you suddenly decide to start selling on Ebay, there is no way you can transfer that trust rate you earned.  Our token holders can benefit by receiving a voucher proportional to the amount of tokens he holds from a third of our revenue, or if he spends MTH tokens, he'll receive a loyalty reward (more about it in our whitepaper).

Hopefully somebody can clear this up for me.  In the Monetha video at the 4 minute and 40 second mark the CEO is telling people that if they participate in the ICO that they will receive a significant portion of revenue.  If Monetha has revenue flowing to the token holders, this makes Monetha a security, which in and of itself I am okay with. The SEC said that they were going to be coming after crypto exchanges which trade tokens which are viewed as securities. What happens if exchanges suddenly stop listing tokens which are securities? If there is no market for this token to trade in, then how is there price discovery? If there is no price discovery, then how does anybody ever expect to get their money back?  I suggest everybody read the blog post from Shapeshift from a couple of weeks ago. It describes how they are about to begin to delist a bunch of tokens because they were determined to be securities. The way you determine if a token is a security is by performing the Howey test. (Google Howey test if you don't know what it is.)  The Howey test is simple. If all 4 elements are present, then the SEC will classify it as a security. Those elements are.  1)Money is raised 2)For a common enterprise 3)With the expectation of a return 4)From the efforts of others.  https://info.shapeshift.io/blog/2017/08/17/shapeshift-and-tokens-securities  If Monetha is actually planning on distributing profits, then I cannot participate. A simple solution is for Monetha to simply not redistribute the profits. Just keep piling the profits back into the business, or find some other way of rewarding the token holders within the system. Your business idea is good enough that you do not need to give token holders profits.     ",False

It's important to consider that many regulators may follow these examples because of the fact that it's currently unregulated.  We spoke with our experienced lawyers in Switzerland, and this decision was made to protect you (the investors), and ourselves when such regulations come. Not only that, but we believe this new token model will benefit the ecosystem, and will help us with the future growth, which equals to the income growth, which then equals investor return growth.  This voucher model is approved by KPMG lawyers from Switzerland. You can read more in the whitepaper.  Regards, Monetha Team",False

Nine months ago, when my creators sat down at a table, a simple question came up — how I, an elegant, decentralised, efficient and easy to use payment processing solution, should be named?  When my co-founders started looking for a name, they wanted my name to be associated with payments. After some research, they noticed a similar pattern — in many languages, a word “Moneta” is related to coins: Monēta in Latin means “money”, while Moneta in Italian means “currency”, and “coin” in many countries, from Russia, Estonia to Vietnam. Considering the fact, that Monetha was built for the Ethereum community, by the Ethereum community, having my name left at “Moneta” wouldn’t simply do it. My team members are big believers of Ethereum Blockchain, thus, they wanted to show their appreciation — by adding the letter “H”, Ethereum abbreviation “ETH” was placed in my name.  My team understands that every member of the cryptocurrency community wants to have trust in the projects they take part in, therefore, they wanted to further display our trust and dedication to the Ethereum community. That’s why Monetha’s abbreviation is similar to Ethereum’s (ETH and MTH), which will also be helpful to remember my name in the future.  by: Monetha team",False

The team gave sketchy answers in a bid to evade my questions. When I insisted, They banned me. It's obvious they ban anyone who ask questions.   Hello nelson4lov, thanks for your question.  Regarding the “centralisation” and “decentralisation”. Monetha is a legal entity in Switzerland (Monetha GmbH), that is creating a payment solution levering blockchain technology. We have never said that Monetha is fully decentralised. We are developing payments system with a decentralised trust and reputation layer on top of it. Before blockchain that was never possible and those two were separate business models. Monetha combines them. Monetha is as much centralised and decentralised as TenX, OmiseGo, MetalPay, Iconomi, BAT and many more. All of those companies are legal entities creating products levering blockchain technology. And all of those companies have business model from which they will earn money (and reward their token holders as well). Every company needs revenues to grow and to make it a sustainable business. Capital raised during the ICO is only the first step towards a successful company. We need that to develop the product and market it. Then, we will need revenue from our customers to grow the company. As any other business.  Regarding the smart contracts: we took a lot of time and focus in creating and auditing them (3 different auditors have done it), that’s why it took a bit longer than we expected. We will publish them today so everyone could have a look.  Regarding the reddit post: we are sorry. This was a mistake done by our admin to who we told that Reddit is mostly for announcements and ICO questions. All of the product related questions should be directed to our Telegram or Slack in which we did answer same question of yours. Once again, sorry for the mistake, it should have not happened.

If we take a look at uTrust and Monetha, one clear point stands out - Monetha has Decentralised Trust and Reputation System, which is transferrable, powered by Smart Contracts, which hold all the information about the purchase (warranty, buyers info, etc.), and adjusts the ratings automatically.  Based on the information saved during the transaction (for example warranty), clients and merchants will be able to file/solve a claim, rate each other, view ratings etc. Their history is then recorded onto the immutable Ethereum blockchain so that others can make well-informed commercial decisions.  So for example, once the payment is made, the trust rate for merchant increases. If client makes a review, trust rate increases as well. If client makes a claim and merchant does not react to it, the smart contract decreases the trust rate. Different weights of how smart contract changes the trust rate will be assigned to different actions  Think about this use case: imagine you are a merchant from China. The only way to sell your products to the global world and be trusted at the same time is to be part of Alibaba. Moreover, if you suddenly decide to start selling on Ebay, there is no way you can transfer that trust rate you earned.  Our token holders can benefit by receiving a voucher proportional to the amount of tokens he holds from a third of our revenue, or if he spends MTH tokens, he'll receive a loyalty reward (more about it in our whitepaper).

And where will Monetha secure the necessary liquidity to help the users/merchants exchange between fiat and cryptocurrencies? In my understanding, if I want to pay a merchant with btc or eth, for example, my btc/eth needs to be sold to an exchange to get the fiat to pay the merchant. And if payments with Monetha is going to grow bigger, I believe there will be a very serious transaction issue because exchanges everywhere do not have enough liquidity without moving the market price significantly. All I can see is that Monetha can work in very small scale, but may be just impossible to scale larger. So help me to understand this. Where will Monetha secure the necessary liquidity to service multiple $millions of total transactions per day? Because if Monetha cannot secure such liquidity, then users/merchants using Monetha will have to face very volatile price rates, and possibly very long waiting/confirmation time. And I am sure this isn't just a problem to Monetha, but also a major problem to every company/startup that plans to venture into crypto-based online payment industry. The fiat-based online payment industry is different however, because the fiat liquidity is already in existence. The same cannot be said of crypto-based industry. Can Monetha enlighten me on this?",False

Because Switzerland has the best regulatory form for Blockchain startups. Zug, the city in which Monetha is established, has a vibrant community of Blockchain enthusiasts.  Best Regards, Monetha Team  Quote from: gamerfan on August 24, 2017, 06:58:14 AM In my opinion this is a very valid project, with only one weakness. They assume the ETH economy will continue to grow, which is not sure at all. I think they should allow different methods of payment besides ETH, when the product will be released.  Hello gamerfan, thanks for your interesting thought.  What matters about Monetha, is that we are able to accept more than just ETH as a currency. In the long run, we plant to accept all popular ETH based currencies. That might be the added value to the Merchant.  But the biggest potential, as explained by Justas during last week's live Q&A, and our longer term vision is: FIAT to FIAT transactions through the blockchain. (Peer-to-peer examples: Circle, Abra)  The biggest potential lies in FIAT to FIAT transactions through the Ethereum (or any other blockchain that has solved scalability and has smart contract capability).  Our goal is to be the gold standard of reputation and payments. And as for this moment we look at Ether and Ethereum based cryptocurrencies as a perfect niche to kickstart our traction and develop the product around the blockchain and smart contract capabilities. In not so distant future we see FIAT to FIAT currencies being processed through Ethereum blockchain and then the Decentralised Trust and Reputation will take its route of giving the merchant and the client a trust rating. This will be remarkably important for the mass adoption of our technology. No learning curve, just efficiently processed payment with your favourite payment method. Through the Ethereum blockchain.

We will take every step necessary to stop any fraud activity, but that doesn't necessarily include a lawsuit (it may include reporting him to the bank, so they charge him the amount of money he scammed, etc.).  As far as our payment protection goes, there are four aspects that we plan to implement: A: There will be a chargeback pool in case of emergency issues, so that we can issue a refund to the buyer. B: Every merchant will be registered with us as a legal entity. In case of any fraudulent activities - we will have all the details of the company, and will be able to take legal action if need be. C: That’s where DTRS comes to help - if a merchant has been in business for couple of years, trying to gain his reputation, it simply wouldn’t make sense for him to lose the large amount of positive reviews to save money by not issueing a refund. D : We’re preparing for this by prototyping and strategising an inclusion of an algorithm that would recognise and red flag an unusual behaviour from the merchant and the client. The solution might pivot as we will collect a significant amount of real data, because we need real data to be able to find the best solution to prevent scammers.  Regards, Monetha Team",False

MTH holders will be able to spend these vouchers only with e-commerce stores by Monetha's merchants.  Regards, Monetha Team  Quote from: rejosh on August 18, 2017, 12:19:04 PM I have few questions, how MONETHA differ from UTRUST. I have read both the whitepaper for me utrust sounds superior from monetha. Both are payment block chains based on the same concept as how PayPal works. Rod map looks similar for both.  Utrust have shown some advantage over PayPal in there white paper. They have payment protection in place. Do you provide any payment protection for the buyers or sellers. If you don’t have payment protection it’s unlikely to attract consumers.  The only advantage I can see is that you have a great experienced team. That make me to think to invest in your project.       Hello rejosh, thanks for your question!  As far as our payment protection goes, there are four aspects that we plan to implement: A: There will be a chargeback pool in case of emergency issues, so that we can issue a refund to the buyer. B: Every merchant will be registered with us as a legal entity. In case of any fraudulent activities - we will have all the details of the company, and will be able to take legal action if need be. C: That's where DTRS comes to help - if a merchant has been in business for couple of years, trying to gain his reputation, it simply wouldn't make sense for him to lose the large amount of positive reviews to save money by not issueing a refund. D: We’re preparing for this by prototyping and strategising an inclusion of an algorithm that would recognise and red flag an unusual behaviour from the merchant and the client. The solution might pivot as we will collect a significant amount of real data, because we need real data to be able to find the best solution to prevent scammers.  If we take a look at a bigger picture and other competitors, the most important feature of Monetha is DTRS (Decentralised trust and reputation system)  In Monetha, payments and trust will work flawlessly together. We are letting merchants accept mobile payments from their clients and at the same time ensure the trust for both the merchants and the clients.  The information needed to ensure a trustful relationship between buyer and seller (such as warranty) will be recorded onto the blockchain together with the payments (at the moment of payment). Smart contracts will automatically amend each party’s trust rating according to an algorithm that assesses the quality of the transaction.  Based on the information saved during the transaction (for example warranty), clients and merchants will be able to file/solve a claim, rate each other, view ratings etc. Their history is then recorded onto the immutable Ethereum blockchain so that others can make well-informed commercial decisions.  So for example, once the payment is made, the trust rate for merchant increases. If client makes a review, trust rate increases as well. If client makes a claim and merchant does not react to it, the smart contract decreases the trust rate. Different weights of how smart contract changes the trust rate will be assigned to different actions  Think about this use case: imagine you are a merchant from China. The only way to sell your products to the global world and be trusted at the same time is to be part of Alibaba. Moreover, if you suddenly decide to start selling on Ebay, there is no way you can transfer that trust rate you earned. However, Monetha is able to solve this issue, because it's reputation is easily transferable.  To add a point, it is worth mentioning that nowadays the reviews made on Amazon that are connected with confirmed payments are always prioritised by Amazon algorithm in the review list and carry much more legitimacy. With Monetha, every review is “linked with payment”.  You can read more about DTRS in our White Paper here: https://www.monetha.io/static/media/Monetha_White_Paper.58f83d45.pdf  Or in this blog post here: https://medium.com/@monetha/people-ask-me-what-is-your-main-strength-cf72c6fd2754  Quote from: gembira on August 18, 2017, 12:49:51 PM You still not annonced hard cap?

We want you to understand that any ""revenue sharing"" token will not be able to promise any revenue in the first months, just because it's hard for a company to yield any profit without a working product. Think about it - when you invest in an ICO, you're not expecting them to make a working product within a week, and start giving you immediate returns.  This decision as done due to the regulatory issues so as it would not hurt the company and investors. Any dividend sharing token will most likely be considered as a security when the tighter regulation comes.  We had to choose between the short-term and the long-term. We chose long-term.

Merchants will be able to adjust how high/low rated purchasers they want to accept. Based on that trust rating, merchants will be able to decide whether to sell the goods or not; either manually or letting the system to block the purchase according to the settings. For example: buyers with a very low trust rate (a new ones as well) will not be able to make purchases if the merchant says so. If the merchant accepts the payment from a low rating person he definitely has more risk to be scammed (getting a negative review). But that will be up to a merchant to decide.

But as you probably know, the switch to Casper is coming soon, or it could be a switch to Plasma (read more at: plasma.io), that may solve scalability issues. Switching to Casper will (probably) result in more transactions per second on the Ethereum network. The algorithm also accommodates faster block times compared to using the proof-of-work algorithm currently in place. This will also have an impact on the network’s gas prices, which will increase and decrease based on how much the network’s validators can handle comfortably. At the same time, state channel allows to put more transactions into one block, resulting in decrease of cost per transaction. If Casper and State Channel works as it is promised to work, Ethereum should not face scalability issues. Which results in much cheaper and faster Peer-to-Peer transactions for merchants while utilising the blockchain technology. Which also results in scalable technology on which products such as Monetha can be build.  Even having all these facts above, we still have to acknowledge the fact that the biggest risk is Ethereum being able to deliver on Casper and State Channel technology, because payment gateway (as any other blockchain based companies) needs a scalable blockchain technology to make a real impact.  On the other hand, we should also mention, that Monetha is a blockchain agnostic solution, which basically means that we need a blockchain that has a smart contract capability and which is scalable to run our product. So, in case Ethereum will not able to solve the scalability issues (or even if it will), we will be able to migrate to other blockchains, for example Tezos, or any other blockchain that has solved scalability issues and has a smart contract capability.  To add a point, we think it is very important to start now (and as a result take more risks) in order to be able to take a pole position and be the first mover (as PayPal was in pioneering the online money transfers in the early 2000s) in creating a next generation payment processing solution combined with a decentralised trust and reputation for global commerce. If we start when all the scaling problems blockchain technology now faces are solved, it would be too late.  Regards, Monetha Team",False

To see how much is one stake worth, the total amount in the pool must be divided by stakes (1000/100=10 MTH for 1 stake). That means, that one person will receive 100 MTH for his 10 stakes (10*10=100).  We hope that makes it more clear! Monetha Team",False

The biggest potential, as explained by Justas during yesterday’s live Q&A, and our longer term vision is: FIAT to FIAT transactions through the blockchain. (Peer-to-peer examples: Circle, Abra). The biggest potential lies in FIAT to FIAT transactions through the Ethereum (or any other blockchain that has solved scalability and has smart contract capability).  Our goal is to be the gold standard of reputation and payments. And as for this moment we look at Ether and Ethereum based cryptocurrencies as a perfect niche to kickstart our traction and develop the product around the blockchain and smart contract capabilities. In not so distant future we see FIAT to FIAT currencies being processed through Ethereum blockchain and then the Decentralised Trust and Reputation will take its route of giving the merchant and the client a trust rating.  This will be remarkably important for the mass adoption Regards, Monetha Team  Quote from: deddod01 on August 16, 2017, 08:20:45 AM Hello dev, i see and read in every post member signature comment always ask bounty problem when in tread monetha it is clear reward bounty, rules, and how to follow bounty live in read only.

There are few important points that have been changed: *MVP installations bounty rewards has been reduced to 40 000 MTH due to the low amount of participants, and it has now been reallocated to the influencers and ambassadors bounty pool. *Bitcointalk signature and avatar bounty rewards has been lowered by half, due to low amount of participants, and it has now been reallocated to the influencers and ambassadors bounty pool. *Bitcointalk moderators will now get 1 stake instead of 5 for every post in their thread. *Influencers and ambassadors bounty reward pool has increased to 1 838 000 MTH.  If you have participated in signature and avatar bounty, your bounty will still remain considered as being in the unchanged pool, until the August 14th. This means, that you will receive double the stakes of the current pool (334 000 MTH) for putting the signature before today. If you continue to participate in the bounty, you will receive the regular amount of stakes from August 14th.  Anyone who wants to participate in the signature and avatar bounty from now, will receive the regular amount of stakes.

To see how much is one stake worth, the total amount in the pool must be divided by stakes (1000/100=10 MTH for 1 stake).

You’ll have to claim your profits with your tokens. That will be done by you sending MTH tokens to a profit sharing smart contract which will automatically check how much of a profit do your MTH tokens carry and then it will automatically send ETH to your wallet proportionally.  For example, if you hold 1% of all the MTH tokens, you will automatically receive 1% of the profit that will be distributed.  Smart contract will let you claim your profits ONLY ONCE with the same address per quarter. If you have already claimed your profits with the address, profit sharing contract will detect that. Moreover, your tokens will be sent back once the profit claim “window” ends. You will send the tokens to the smart contract, after you get the proportion of the ETH and then your tokens will be sent back at the end of the profit sharing timeframe (for example, 2 hours).  Let us know if you have any other questions.  Monetha Team",False

If I buy MTH on an exchange and they didn't claim their profits for the quarter, can I send them out and claim the profits?  Hello Azmojo and thanks for your interesting question!  To answer your first question - if you fail to claim your profit during the quarter, your shares will simply be distributed to the rest of the people who claimed it. This could be comparable to bounty rewards in multiple tokens: Lets say the profit for our first quarter is 1000 ETH. If there are 2000 people who hold the MTH token, all in equal proportion, they should all receive 0.5 ETH each. However, if 1000 people miss the claim ""window"", and there are only 1000 people left, then the 1000 ETH profit will be distributed to them, making it 1 ETH each.  Your second question is quite interesting, but in a nutshell, anyone who holds MTH tokens during the claim ""window"" can redeem the profit reward. Lets say today is the only day this quarter when you can redeem your profit. The only way for you to redeem it, would be to send your MTH tokens to the smart contract address. Your tokens would then be held till the end of the day today, making it impossible for anyone else to redeem same tokens twice.  Monetha team",False

Thanks for the question.  The most important thing to understand is that Monetha is a mix of PayPal and Trustpilot on the Ethereum blockchain. PayPal does not have a trust system integrated with payments and Trustpilot does not have a payments system integrated to their trust service.  In Monetha payments and trust will work flawlessly together. We are letting merchants accept mobile payments from their clients and at the same time ensure the trust for both the merchants and the clients.  The information needed to ensure a trustful relationship between buyer and seller (such as warranty) will be recorded onto the blockchain together with the payments (at the moment of payment). Smart contracts will automatically amend each party’s trust rating according to an algorithm that assesses the quality of the transaction. Based on the information saved during the transaction (for example warranty), clients and merchants will be able to file/solve a claim, rate each other, view ratings etc. Their history is then recorded onto the immutable Ethereum blockchain so that others can make well-informed commercial decisions.  So for example, once the payment is made, the trust rate for merchant increases. If client makes a review, trust rate increases as well. If client makes a claim and merchant does not react to it, the smart contract decreases the trust rate. Different weights of how smart contract changes the trust rate will be assigned to different actions  Think about this use case: imagine you are a merchant from China. The only way to sell your products to the global world and be trusted at the same time is to be part of Alibaba. Moreover, if you suddenly decide to start selling on Ebay, there is no way you can transfer that trust rate you earned  As of now, during the MVP stage, merchants can already install our product and accept Ether currency. During the product development we will introduce an opportunity to accept different Ethereum based crypto currencies (tokens) depending on their trading volume (this is important having in mind that merchants will be willing to exchange to fait).  All the best, Monetha Team",False

If you look at this more broadly, we can name a few: BlockPay, Coinpayments in terms of payment processing and uPort in terms of reputation. But non of these have a solution that covers both: decentralised trust that is working flawlessly with payments. For example uPort works on providing reputation for different business verticals (but they do not have integrated payments), while Monetha is super focused on ecommrece. That's why we need payments for work together with reputation.  Actually at first, Monetha meant to be only a payment processing company, but after doing a lot of research we understood that trust is the key element for the global commerce.  For example: reviews made on Amazon that are linked with confirmed payments are always prioritised by Amazon algorithm in the review list and carry much more legitimacy.

I read the white paper and have the following questions:  1/ Ethereum congested blockchain  During the past weeks, the Ethereum network was heavily congested due to the number of Ether based ICOs and their related blockchain. Since you hope to become a leader in e-commerce transactions, how would you cope with the currently congested Ethereum blockchain ?  2/ Merchants receiving crypto  I like the idea bringing new people into the cryptoworld. However, why don't you mention the cost of converting Monetha token / Ethers into fiat and receiving fiats for the merchant ? As you know, all exchanges charge significant Fiat remittance fees. So the final cost may more than 1.5% for the merchant.  3/ Clients paying with crypto  Will the app enable non-crypto holders to buy Monetha token / Ether by credit card or via itunes for instance ? It would bring more customers into cryptos.  4/ Collaboration with major e-commerce players such as Shopify  What is their incentive to work you ? Aren't you a competitor to their business ? Do you factor revenue sharing agreements with them in your business model ? If you don't get a deal with one of them, you will have a hard time convincing merchants ?  5/ ICO Will you go for a ""first subscriptions take all"" or make sure that tokens are also distributed to smaller orders ? How will you make sure that the ICO wallet is not hacked.  6/ Token  It seems that there won't be any more tokens issued after the ICO. Do you confirm ?  7/ Exchanges  How soon after the ICO will the token be traded on exchanges ? Are you already in advance talks with reputable exchanges ? Thanks in advance and good luck with the ICO!",False

We undestand that as of now, Ethereum or any other blockchain in more broader terms has not solved the scalability issue. It is the same as Internet was not as fast as it is now in 1980s and Amazon could not have existed at the scale of 2017 back in the time.  All in all, you can consider Monetha as being a blockchain agnostic solution. which basically means that Monetha can run on any blockchain that has solved scalability and security issues and has smart contract capability. As of now, Ethereum is a gold standard for creating applications using smart contracts. It might be any other blockchain (or group of blockchains) in the future.  2. First of all, Monetha will integrate with cryptocurrency exchanges to enable merchants to exchange crypto to FIAT (government backed currencies) seamlessly. For example Kraken.  1.5% commission fee that Merchant pays for Monetha's payments processing and Decentralised Trust and Reputation System does include an exchange rate.   And the reason is: in the payments industry, there is no standard of having an exchange rate included into the payment processing. Exchanging to a different currency is a merchant's prerogative and no one enforces it. PayPal and other major payment processing companies do not include an exchange rate into its transaction fee. For example not only does PayPal take 2.9%-4,4% (depending on a country) + $0.3 transaction fee from the merchant, but also exchanges the currency with a bigger rate than the standard.  All of the currency exchange is being done for a separate fee. For example, VISA not only has a separate exchange rate fee (which is usually bigger than a regular exchange rate fee) but also a Dynamic Currency Conversion fee (which is normally around extra 2%) and sometimes even a foreign transaction fee (1%-5%, usually 3%) if the payment was processed abroad.  Moreover, your currency exchange is always an optional thing. You cannot and should not include it into the transaction fee.  For example, here is the fee schedule for one of the most popular crypto exchanges - Kraken: https://www.kraken.com/en-us/help/fees. If you are a merchant in Europe, the highest transaction fee that you will pay using Monetha is 0.26% when the volume is lower than 50.000. To withdraw euros via SEPA you will pay EUR 0.09.  If a merchant is in Europe and receives Ethereum based cryptocurrency and exchanges it to euros it would go like this: 10 - (10*0,015) - (10*0,0026) = 10 - 0.15 - 0,026 = EUR 9,824  We also acknowledge the fact, that in other cases and other countries the exchange rate might be higher.  But, you have to remember that the merchant does not only pay a transaction fee when accepting payments with traditional payment gateways. There are bunch of other fees that merchants have to pay, such as:  ● Retrieval Request Fees and Chargeback Fees are paid when someone claims for a chargeback. The best-known payment gateways such as PayPal and Stripe charge merchants a USD 15 chargeback fee. ● Flat fees that include: Terminal fees to buy the needed terminal for retail merchants, PCI fees paid to Payment Card industry for compliance OR noncompliance ● Annual fees, Monthly fees, Monthly minimum fees, IRS reporting fees, network fees, etc. ● Incidental fees that consist of: Address Verification Service (AVS), Voice Authorization Fee (VAF), Batch Fee, and NFS fee. ● Marketplace fees for Alibaba, Amazon, etc for ""providing and facilitating"" the trust system. Think about his use case: if you are a small merchant in China, the only way to sell goods to the global world and be trusted at the same time is to join the Alibaba. You won't need to pay a fee for a payment gateway, but Alibaba will charge you a pack of other high fees.  When combined, it calculates to a high amount of money that the merchant has to pay per year for a payment processing.   As we do not include an exchange rate, here is the situation:  Monetha will charge a 1.5% transaction fee from merchants. Of that, 0.5% will go to a smart contract for the Monetha token holders and other 1% will go to the company as revenues. An interesting fact is that the average traditional payment gateways take approximately only 0.25% + 0.1 from the total fee as their revenue. This 0.25% + 0.1 is a markup fee to the interchange rates. For example, if the total transaction fee that merchant is charged is 2.9% + $0.3, the 2.65%+ $0.2 is the interchange part that banks, credit card associations and others are dividing and 0.25% + $0.1 is the markup part, which payment gateways take home as a revenue.  3. At the moment this method is not covered by our development timeline, but we do have different strategies of how to achieve mass adoption for people who are “not in the crypto world”. For example, the long-term vision of Monetha is to process fiat to fiat payments through Ethereum blockchain, so the merchant and the client would both have the benefits of the payment efficiency/DTRS that the blockchain brings.  4. Their incentive is very simple - to equip their merchants with the best possible technology for payment processing and trust and they are in no way a competitor to Monetha, just as PayPal isn’t a competitor to Shopify. We have different strategies that let us reach the high scalability of onboarding the merchants and integrations with Shopify, FirstData and others is just a one of them.  5. We want to make our token sale fair for everyone and that’s why we decided not to do a pre-sale and give every investor big or small a level playing field. The security question is very important to us and we are doing everything to ensure the security and for security reasons, we wouldn’t like to get into the technical details.  6. That is correct. In addition, all the tokens that won’t be sold - will be burned.  7. Very good question. To have a pole position and to get listed on the exchanges as soon as possible we are already in talks with the highly regarded exchanges. At the moment it is hard to give an exact time frame, but we’ll do everything in our power to make it as soon as possible.  Thank you for the best wishes!",False

As a seller I pay more fees and have a chance go get low scores that will ruin my business? Makes no sense.  2- If a merchant has low score he will just ditch your service no? The score does not work well as they will avoid services like yours. I'm a merchant and have a lot of transactions and I would never use this. Bitpay is good and cuts all this ''b***'***' And many of major big merchants as amazon, ebay etc already have a feedback system so you will never get to this merchants.  3- It will be really easy for merchants to ''fake'' the score...your system is paradise for fake score sellers as I see it.  4- What makes your service different from others? Are you solving a problem? I don't understand your concept and honestly I will not invest in this.  5- Essentially you are not solving any problem. You are not creating anything better than systems that already exist. Your system is expensive, the feedbacks can be easily fakes therefor this is useless. No merchant want scores in their private webpage transactions. The score system only works well in webpages that have multiple merchants..such as amazon, ebay, ali, etc...  6- Your token is useless.    7- Majority of ICOs out there are scam. I only invest in ideas that bring something new to the table. That solve a problem. That change something that exists to something better. Not monetha for sure.

The answer is not going to be long, because from the 8 points that you made, only two of them were valid or constructive.  In regards of “how are we different” and why do we take “a higher fee” than the other crypto payment processors (which we don’t). The uniqueness of “Monetha” is not only it’s efficient payment processor, but most importantly the Decentralised Trust and Reputation. The most important thing to understand is that Monetha is a mix of PayPal and Trustpilot on the Ethereum blockchain. PayPal does not have a trust system integrated with payments and Trustpilot does not have a payments system integrated to their trust service.  In Monetha payments and trust will work flawlessly together. We are letting merchants accept mobile payments from their clients and at the same time ensure the trust for both the merchants and the clients.  The information needed to ensure a trustful relationship between buyer and seller (such as warranty) will be recorded onto the blockchain together with the payments (at the moment of payment). Smart contracts will automatically amend each party’s trust rating according to an algorithm that assesses the quality of the transaction.  Based on the information saved during the transaction (for example warranty), clients and merchants will be able to file/solve a claim, rate each other, view ratings etc. Their history is then recorded onto the immutable Ethereum blockchain so that others can make well-informed commercial decisions.  So for example, once the payment is made, the trust rate for merchant increases. If client makes a review, trust rate increases as well. If client makes a claim and merchant does not react to it, the smart contract decreases the trust rate. Different weights of how smart contract changes the trust rate will be assigned to different actions  If you’re a small merchant in China and you are selling goods to the global world, the only way to do that and be trusted at the same time is to be a part of “Alibaba”. Moreover, if you decide to start selling goods on “Amazon”, there is no way you can transfer the trust that you have built on “Alibaba”. With Monetha, this small merchant will not only be able to accept payments with Monetha payment processor, but also build his universal trust rating while paying only a fraction of a cost compared with centralised marketplaces and existing payment processors.   More on how decentralised system works: https://medium.com/@monetha/people-ask-me-what-is-your-main-strength-cf72c6fd2754  As you probably know, Bitcoin and the payment processors who use it (for example Bitpay, which takes 1% commission, compared to our 1,5%) are not a very scalable technology (at least for now if no other changes occur) with a limited amount of coins which make the transaction cost and the transaction time increase respectively with an increase in demand. Now more than ever, the community is coming to a consensus that Bitcoin is a store of value, like gold and not a method of payment.   You have to remember that the merchant does not only pay a transaction fee when accepting payments with traditional payment gateways. There are bunch of other fees that merchants have to pay, such as:  ● Retrieval Request Fees and Chargeback Fees are paid when someone claims for a chargeback. The best-known payment gateways such as PayPal and Stripe charge merchants a USD 15 chargeback fee. ● Flat fees that include: Terminal fees to buy the needed terminal for retail merchants, PCI fees paid to Payment Card industry for compliance OR noncompliance ● Annual fees, Monthly fees, Monthly minimum fees, IRS reporting fees, network fees , etc. ● Incidental fees that consist of: Address Verification Service (AVS), Voice Authorization Fee (VAF), Batch Fee, and NFS fee. ● Marketplace fees for Alibaba, Amazon, etc for “providing and facilitating” the trust system. Think about his use case: if you are a small merchant in China, the only way to sell goods to the global world and be trusted at the same time is to join the Alibaba. You won’t need to pay a fee for a payment gateway, but Alibaba will charge you a pack of other high fees.  When combined, it calculates to a high amount of money that the merchant has to pay per year for a payment processing.   In regard of our “useless token”:  In order to encourage networks effects and create an ecosystem for our payments and DTRS solution, we are going to introduce a loyalty program for clients. That is unprecedented as most loyalty programs are facilitated by merchants themselves and not payment providers.  Every purchase made via the Monetha payment system will reward the client with 0.2% (the percentage might change over time) of the value of the transaction in Monetha tokens from the Monetha loyalty pool. This is provided by Monetha no matter what goods or services the client buys or where the merchant and client are based. ● Loyalty tokens can be used during any purchase using a Monetha wallet: ○ The client picks an item he/she wants to buy ○ If the client has Monetha tokens she/he can apply them to reduce the items cost. The client gets a discount. ○ Monetha tokens are converted to ETH in real time. ○ Monetha tokens are returned to Monetha loyalty pool. ○ Monetha platform covers a discount for the merchant, so he gets the full item price. ○ Monetha tokens can be applied for up to 70% of the purchase value. ○ The client is still getting 0.2% of the amount paid by ETH (or other cryptocurrency) after loyalty is applied. ● Tokens acquired in this way are eligible for a discount for 6 months. Unused tokens are returned back to Monetha loyalty token pool. ● The client cannot convert tokens exchanged in this way to any crypto or fiat currency. ● The merchant is able to provide bigger loyalty discounts for his clients by adjusting his loyalty settings in merchants interface. ● Clients with high trust are eligible for higher discount percentage than 0.2%. ● The exact percentage of loyalty MTH tokens granted with every purchase might change over time.  Monetha will charge a 1.5% transaction fee from merchants. Of that, 0.5% will go to a smart contract for Monetha token holders and other 1% will go to the company as revenues. An interesting fact is that the average traditional payment gateways take approximately only 0.25% + 0.1 from total fee as their revenue. This 0.25% + 0.1 is a mark-up fee to the interchange rates.  For example, if the total transaction fee that merchant is charged is 2.35% + $0.2, the 2.1%+ $0.2 is the  interchange part  that banks, credit card associations and others are dividing and 0.25% + $0.1 is the  markup part , which payment gateways take home as revenue. With this in mind,  we are giving our Monetha token holders almost double the rate that an average global payment gateway takes per transaction as their revenues . Moreover, we not only decrease the transaction fee that merchant has to pay, let alone the other fees that he will not have to worry about anymore, but we are also left with approximately four times the rate to do business with.  I hope this answers your concerns/questions. We respect your right to express your opinion of deciding not to invest in Monetha and to be honest we wouldn’t want you to. We believe that our investors should be positive, open-minded and strongly believe in the mission of changing the face of payments and trust in the global commerce.",False

Regarding the 1.5% transaction fee:  1) 0.5% of 1.5% transaction fee will go to Monetha investors. So we are left with 1% as a company revenues. 2) Traditional payment gateway takes 0.25% + fixed fee as their company revenue from total fee which is around 3% + fixed fee. But the thing is that payment solution business is always a scale business. You have to generate a lot of transactions in order to be profitable. Having this in mind, we have almost four times the rate to do business with as compared with what an average global payment gateway takes per transaction as their revenues.﻿ Which gives us big ""buffer"" for growth until we reach the sufficient transaction volume.  Moreover, you have to remember that the merchant does not only pay a transaction fee when accepting payments with traditional payment gateways. There are bunch of other fees that merchants have to pay, such as:  ● Retrieval Request Fees and Chargeback Fees are paid when someone claims for a chargeback. The best-known payment gateways such as PayPal and Stripe charge merchants a USD 15 chargeback fee. ● Flat fees that include: Terminal fees to buy the needed terminal for retail merchants, PCI fees paid to Payment Card industry for compliance OR noncompliance ● Annual fees, Monthly fees, Monthly minimum fees, IRS reporting fees, network fees , etc. ● Incidental fees that consist of: Address Verification Service (AVS), Voice Authorization Fee (VAF), Batch Fee, and NFS fee. ● Marketplace fees for Alibaba, Amazon, etc for “providing and facilitating” the trust system. Think about his use case: if you are a small merchant in China, the only way to sell goods to the global world and be trusted at the same time is to join the Alibaba. You won’t need to pay a fee for a payment gateway, but Alibaba will charge you a pack of other high fees.  When combined, it calculates to a high amount of money that the merchant has to pay per year for a payment processing. Thus, we not only significantly decrease the rate merchant has to pay in order to accept payments, but we have more room to do business with.  There will definitely be a possibility to decrease the 1.5% fee for businesses that have huge transaction volumes.  3) We are not only a payment processor. Together with the payment processing comes the Decentralised Trust and Reputation system which is included in the same 1.5% transaction fee. Today, if merchants want to have a trust rate, he/she has to join one of the centralised marketplaces like Amazon, Ebay, Alibaba, etc, which charges merchant ridiculously high fees and most of the time hold money for a very long time. Other option is to pay additional money for services such as Trustpilot which does not work as it supposed to while leaving a lot of so called ""empty space"" between very bad and very good comments.   Regarding online and brick&mortar:  As you can see in our product development timeline on our website or White Paper, the last milestone is to enter the Retail (physical brick&mortar) stores once we have a fully functioning and working solution with Decentralised Trust and Reputation for e-commerce.  E-commerce is converging with physical commerce through mobile and new transaction technologies in the traditional world that leverage the mobile technology: strong authentication, NFC communications and Tokenization of traditional payments. So our target market is much bigger then online.   Hope that answers your questions! Monetha Team",False

First of all, Lithuania is not a Slavic country (it would be similar to calling a Chinese person Japanese). Geographically it is considered to be a Northern Europe country (Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark) and politically Lithuania is being considered as a Baltic country (Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia).  Baltic countries are very well known for its educated and talented people, especially in the IT development and in both the traditional startup scene (Skype, TransferWise, Pipedrive, Vinted, Yplan, TransferGo etc.) and in blockchain (Edgeless (Top 65 coin), Mysterium Network (raised over $15M in their ICO), Polybius (raised over $31Min their ICO)).  Second of all, the Monetha is actually very diverse and its team received 9 out of 10 rating in the most popular ICO rating site ""ICO Tracker"" (that's even before a former PayPal executive and one of the most influential figures in online trust and reputation joined Monetha).  5 out of 12 team members are not Lithuanian (2 are from the United States, 1 from the UK, 2 from France) and all of the other team members have international software development and business experience in countries like the US, UK, Israel, UAE, France, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Malaysia and many others.  We're happy that ICO concept enables strong projects to raise capital no matter of their geographical location, skin color or false nationalistic stereotype. The way investing in startups should be.

Bounty campaign is almost ready and will be launched soon. Regarding your question:  1. 1.5% commission fee that Merchant pays for Monetha’s payments processing and Decentralised Trust and Reputation System does include an exchange rate.   And the reason is: in the payments industry, there is no standard of having an exchange rate included into the payment processing. Exchanging to a different currency is a merchant’s prerogative and no one enforces it. PayPal and other major payment processing companies do not include an exchange rate into it’s transaction fee. For example not only does PayPal take 2.9%-4,4% (depending on a country) + $0.3 transaction fee from the merchant, but also exchanges the currency with a bigger rate than the standard.  All of the currency exchange is being done for a separate fee. For example, VISA not only has a separate exchange rate fee (which is usually bigger than a regular exchange rate fee) but also a Dynamic Currency Conversion fee (which is normally around extra 2%) and sometimes even a foreign transaction fee (1%-5%, usually 3%) if the payment was processed abroad.  Moreover, your currency exchange is always an optional thing. You cannot and should not include it into the transaction fee.  2. Regarding the fees paid by the merchant:  For example, here is the fee schedule for one of the most popular crypto exchanges - Kraken: https://www.kraken.com/en-us/help/fees. If you are a merchant in Europe, the highest transaction fee that you will pay using Monetha is 0.26% when the volume is lower than 50.000. To withdraw euros via SEPA you will pay EUR 0.09.  So, let's take an example where merchant is in Europe and receives Ethereum based cryptocurrency and exchanges it to euros it would go like this: 10 - (10*0,015) - (10*0,0026) = 10 - 0.15 - 0,026 = EUR 9,824  We also acknowledge the fact, that in other cases and other countries the exchange rate might be higher.  But, you have to remember that the merchant does not only pay a transaction fee when accepting payments with traditional payment gateways. There are bunch of other fees that merchants have to pay, such as:  ● Retrieval Request Fees and Chargeback Fees are paid when someone claims for a chargeback. The best-known payment gateways such as PayPal and Stripe charge merchants a USD 15 chargeback fee. ● Flat fees that include: Terminal fees to buy the needed terminal for retail merchants, PCI fees paid to Payment Card industry for compliance OR noncompliance ● Annual fees, Monthly fees, Monthly minimum fees, IRS reporting fees, network fees , etc. ● Incidental fees that consist of: Address Verification Service (AVS), Voice Authorization Fee (VAF), Batch Fee, and NFS fee. ● Marketplace fees for Alibaba, Amazon, etc for “providing and facilitating” the trust system. Think about his use case: if you are a small merchant in China, the only way to sell goods to the global world and be trusted at the same time is to join the Alibaba. You won’t need to pay a fee for a payment gateway, but Alibaba will charge you a pack of other high fees.  When combined, it calculates to a high amount of money that the merchant has to pay per year for a payment processing.  3. Regarding the business model:  As we do not include an exchange rate, here is the situation:  Monetha will charge a 1.5% transaction fee from merchants. Of that, 0.5% will go to a smart contract for the Monetha token holders and other 1% will go to the company as revenues. An interesting fact is that the average traditional payment gateways take approximately only 0.25% + 0.1 from the total fee as their revenue. This 0.25% + 0.1 is a mark-up fee to the interchange rates. For example, if the total transaction fee that merchant is charged is 2.9% + $0.3, the 2.65%+ $0.2 is the interchange part that banks, credit card associations and others are dividing and 0.25% + $0.1 is the markup part , which payment gateways take home as a revenue. Having this in mind, we have almost four times the rate to do business with as compared with what an average global payment gateway takes per transaction as their revenues.",False

""Monetha"" will have single step and one fee only: a transaction fee of 1.5%.  2. MILESTONE #2 Full e-commerce solution + exchange to FIAT currency (EUR 1,7M/Mid 2018) Accept Ethereum tokens, and enable merchants to exchange Ethereum tokens to their local currency and transfer funds to their preferred account. Smart contract wallet, real-time analytics, and a dashboard for merchants.   May I ask any insight into how is the Monetha team planning to exchange into FIAT , under what poor conversion rate?  In my professional opinion this is not fully possible.  Specially when all this is handled with a 1.5% fee (which includes some profit in case of success, but not enough to cover the FIAT exchange rates!!)   Seems mathematically doomed, this could be a dream come true, or a very ingenious path I can not see, or total bs.  I can´t see how this guys can deliver on their promise (Except with a very poor Exchange rate)  And what kind of legal advice would they bring to local markets they are aiming for which are regulated by law.  Or is this a more underground solution?  I´m quite interested and also very skeptical.   Example.  Amount of money after a $10 dollar transaction. $9.85.... <<<-----  LOL    ...... why not 9.90? LOL  How can you accomplish that? Which fees are not covered?   hmmm maybe its $9.85 in Ethereum, minus amount that the exchange will take for converting Ether to USD.   Probably as $0.60~0.99 cents? (ether to fiat is not cheap,) so after $10 amount in Ether you would get $8.85 amount in usd or even less.",False

Thanks for the very good questions.  Here are our answers:  1. First of all, Monetha will integrate with cryptocurrency exchanges to enable merchants to exchange crypto to FIAT (government backed currencies) seamlessly. For example Kraken.  2. 1.5% commission fee that Merchant pays for Monetha's payments processing and Decentralised Trust and Reputation System does include an exchange rate.    And the reason is: in the payments industry, there is no standard of having an exchange rate included into the payment processing. Exchanging to a different currency is a merchant's prerogative and no one enforces it. PayPal and other major payment processing companies do not include an exchange rate into its transaction fee. For example not only does PayPal take 2.9%-4,4% (depending on a country) + $0.3 transaction fee from the merchant, but also exchanges the currency with a bigger rate than the standard.  All of the currency exchange is being done for a separate fee. For example, VISA not only has a separate exchange rate fee (which is usually bigger than a regular exchange rate fee) but also a Dynamic Currency Conversion fee (which is normally around extra 2%) and sometimes even a foreign transaction fee (1%-5%, usually 3%) if the payment was processed abroad.  Moreover, your currency exchange is always an optional thing. You cannot and should not include it into the transaction fee.  3. Regarding the fees paid by the merchant:  For example, here is the fee schedule for one of the most popular crypto exchanges - Kraken: https://www.kraken.com/en-us/help/fees. If you are a merchant in Europe, the highest transaction fee that you will pay using Monetha is 0.26% when the volume is lower than 50.000. To withdraw euros via SEPA you will pay EUR 0.09.  So, if we are taking the example you provided and if merchant is in Europe and receives Ethereum based cryptocurrency and exchanges it to euros it would go like this: 10 - (10*0,015) - (10*0,0026) = 10 - 0.15 - 0,026 = EUR 9,824  We also acknowledge the fact, that in other cases and other countries the exchange rate might be higher.  But, you have to remember that the merchant does not only pay a transaction fee when accepting payments with traditional payment gateways. There are bunch of other fees that merchants have to pay, such as:  ● Retrieval Request Fees and Chargeback Fees are paid when someone claims for a chargeback. The best-known payment gateways such as PayPal and Stripe charge merchants a USD 15 chargeback fee. ● Flat fees that include: Terminal fees to buy the needed terminal for retail merchants, PCI fees paid to Payment Card industry for compliance OR noncompliance ● Annual fees, Monthly fees, Monthly minimum fees, IRS reporting fees, network fees, etc. ● Incidental fees that consist of: Address Verification Service (AVS), Voice Authorization Fee (VAF), Batch Fee, and NFS fee. ● Marketplace fees for Alibaba, Amazon, etc for ""providing and facilitating"" the trust system. Think about his use case: if you are a small merchant in China, the only way to sell goods to the global world and be trusted at the same time is to join the Alibaba. You won't need to pay a fee for a payment gateway, but Alibaba will charge you a pack of other high fees.  When combined, it calculates to a high amount of money that the merchant has to pay per year for a payment processing.  4. Regarding the business model:  As we do not include an exchange rate, here is the situation:  Monetha will charge a 1.5% transaction fee from merchants. Of that, 0.5% will go to a smart contract for the Monetha token holders and other 1% will go to the company as revenues. An interesting fact is that the average traditional payment gateways take approximately only 0.25% + 0.1 from the total fee as their revenue. This 0.25% + 0.1 is a markup fee to the interchange rates. For example, if the total transaction fee that merchant is charged is 2.9% + $0.3, the 2.65%+ $0.2 is the interchange part that banks, credit card associations and others are dividing and 0.25% + $0.1 is the markup part, which payment gateways take home as a revenue. Having this in mind, we have almost four times the rate to do business with as compared with what an average global payment gateway takes per transaction as their revenues.",False

Monetha will charge a 1.5% transaction fee from merchants. Of that, 0.5% will go to a smart contract for Monetha token holders.  An interesting fact that we mentioned in the White Paper and should mention here is:  the average traditional payment gateways take approximately only 0.25% + 0.1 from total fee as their revenue. This 0.25% + 0.1 is a mark-up fee to the  interchange rates. For example, if the total transaction fee that merchant is charged is 2.35% + $0.2, the 2.1%+ $0.2 is the  interchange part  that banks, credit card associations and others are dividing and 0.25% + $0.1 is the  markup part, which payment gateways take home as revenue.  With this in mind, we are giving our token holders almost double the rate that an average global payment gateway takes per transaction as their revenues . Moreover, we not only decrease the transaction fee that merchant has to pay, let alone the other fees that he will not have to worry about anymore, but we are also left with approximately four times the rate to do business with.",False
