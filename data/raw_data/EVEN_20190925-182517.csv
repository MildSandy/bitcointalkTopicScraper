The project’s Soft Cap amounts to 100,000,000 EVEN tokens sold, which is equal to 17,000 ETH (or the equivalent in BTC and LTC). While carrying out the ICO, the team is developing a platform and expanding the business for cross-chain technology, predominantly in Asian markets, which naturally requires a certain outlay of funds. Nevertheless, in the scenario when Soft Cap is raised successfully, over 54% of of the outlay will be spent on development. If the Soft Cap is not reached, 46% of the investment may be spent. The remaining funds will be returned to the investors' cryptocurrency wallets which provided the investment.",False

Miners will be able to profit from performing distributed network operations on their nodes.
