If interested in token pre-sale information, email us at tokens@bigdatablock.com   About Big Data Block  Big Data Block is changing the future of big data processing by combining open source software that connects massive networks of computers to orchestrate large tasks, and the decentralized nodes of a global blockchain network. Two great things, even better together   Blockchain & Big Data Need Each Other  Big data analysis is currently only available to large organizations capable of building massive large scale data computing environments which are prohibitively expensive to build, run, and maintain. BDB removes all of the headaches associated with big data processing by using blockchain technology to spread the computing burden across computers within BDB’s ecosystem.     Ask the team questions and get answers instantly!  Join the conversation    Twitter   Facebook   Telegram Read The Whitepaper    Team View Our People    Solutions   What Technology Is Behind Big Data?  The most common technology solution to solve big data processing is Hadoop; which takes the classic data processing paradigm but looks at it from a more standard software development mindset.  The classic way people manage data is utilizing large database systems that centralize the processing of this data into large monolithic systems like Oracle or SQL Server or Teradata.  The issue is running a large monolithic database application to manage and process data requires meticulous and time-consuming structuring can be difficult and expensive to scale at large sizes.  Hadoop moved away from structured data and created a distributed model to process data more horizontally, distributed to any number of computers or nodes.  The raw processing power is across a large number of nodes and the processing is broken up so the jobs can be run in smaller chunks across a truly distributed system.   Why Big Data And Blockchain?  While big data is very popular now it still requires a fair amount of technical expertise and expense to implement.  Big data is one of the hottest skills right now and hiring or contracting is expensive.  Running Big data at scale also requires significant technical capabilities.  Large companies with deep pockets can do this, but not everyone can.  That’s the problem we are solving. We are democratizing big data. It’s  possible to create a very small managed big data instance that can run on nodes on computers globally.  The ability to send a big data job into a decentralized big data environment creates infinite scale and lowers the cost to run these jobs dramatically.  The benefit for those running these nodes is payment in BDB tokens.  Our intuitive interface allows jobs to be submitted with just a few clicks.  Very little technical knowledge is needed to run these previously complex and expensive jobs and you only pay when you need a job run.  All that is needed is the data, the metadata about this data, and the rules for analyzing the data.  The job is run on as many nodes as are available and returned to the requestor. Another significant advantage BDB is overall data security as data is spread across many nodes and all the data is destroyed after each job is run leaving no trail and no data to be hacked.   What Is A Real World Example Of How A Typical Job Would Work?  Sara runs a company that owns and operates a small solar farm to provide energy to her local area.  This farm collects a lot of log data from all the solar panels.  She is a small energy producer so every dollar counts and she wants to be sure her solar panels are as optimized as possible.  She is collecting all this log data but doesn’t have a large tech staff nor does she have the experience to parse it all and gain any real insight from it. Here’s where BDB comes in.   With BDB Sara can now take all the data and create performance ranges from highest to lowest of the energy output of each of her solar panels.  This will immediately tell her which panels are the best and worst performing.  From this data she can then look into the individual logs for the worst performing and see if there are obvious indications of any issue with those panels.   Sara simply logs into the BDB portal and defines her BDB job.   Once the job is set up the system will determine the size and complexity and provide a cost in BDB’s and Sara can decide if she would like to execute the job.  She executes this job at a cost of $38 USD.  The data is then uploaded to the BDB system which processes and sends the output file back to our secure landing zone for Sara to let her know her job is done!  Sara decides to run this job weekly and pays less than $155 per month!  BDB TOKEN STRUCTURE   Big Data Block™ (BDB™) Is Proud To Announce That We Have Finalized Our Token Structure. The BDB™ Token Is An ERC20 Compliant Utility Token. The Price Per Token Is .50¢.   Structure Detail:  Our goal from Day 1 has been to offer a majority of our tokens to early adopters. Our structure allocates a majority of the tokens to the crowd sale for this reason. Token Sale – Tokens sold during the crowd sale. There will be tiered discounting (announced in concert with our ICO date currently slated for Late Spring/Early Summer 2018).  Min purchase is .01 ETH and max is 20 ETH. Founders and Advisers – Held by founders and advisers. Reserve – Future incentives for employees, data scientists and the BDB™ community. Presale – 50% discount for a limited period beginning on April 1, 2018 and ending when sold out. We are capping the amount and making a few tokens available to early adopters. Bounties – Rewarding those that believe in BDB™ and help get the word out. Non-profit Fund – Our goal has always been to find ways to help the world. Tokens will be issued to help students, nonprofits, data scientists, researchers, academic institutions, NGOs, governments, and others who can make a measurable impact in the world. Founders Vesting Schedule 6 months after ICO completion – 33% 12 months after ICO completion – 33% 18 months after ICO completion – 34% We are very excited to be continuing our journey with all of you.

We are really excited to be building this. It will really bring big data tools to the masses. We will be much cheaper than everything else out there and can scale to rival the largest cloud big data solutions. There’s also the fact that all your data isn’t in one centralized system. Decentralizing the data makes it much more secure. We are discussing bounty programs. Nothing decided yet but I will let you know. Thanks for your support!!,False
