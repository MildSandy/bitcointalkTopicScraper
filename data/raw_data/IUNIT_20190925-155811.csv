We are not a bank but we are offering traditional banking services on top of your decentralized wallet - think of it as Banking-as-a-Service. We are simply implementing banking features to be used out of your crypto wallet. Unless cryptocurrencies are outlawed in their entirety regulations won't affect our approach to banking-as-a-service. For the areas that require banking licenses or money transmitter licenses we will obviously procure those licenses, but many of the services that we are offering do not require additional licenses. We chose very carefully where to incorporate our business and we decided on the US, because of the stringent regulations here that will allow us to build a serious business that will actually revolutionize banking as we know it. Another very important point is that our first main target client to use our platform is the US Government with their foodstamp program (SNAP). We carefully designed our system and our processes to be compliant with every regulation and restriction in the US to be able to compete in this market",False

It is used to pay for redemptions, fees and staking for the Masternodes/Block producers  2) Stablecoins: These are asset-backed tokens that are secured 1:1 by their respective Fiat counterparts. In other words for the USIU (US-$ pegged Token) for every issued token an equivalent amount of US-$ will be deposited in a trust account. When the stablecoin is redeemed the token is destroyed and the equivalent Fiat amount is paid out to the holder of the token. These deposits are daily reviewed by our auditor and audited at the end of every month.",False
