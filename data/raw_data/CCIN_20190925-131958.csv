They will see that the project tokens are buying and that means they are interesting to other people. If the project has a nice idea it is not necessary to look at other investors. We are planning to attract people through our unique services.  So I explain to some people that for promising projects there is no need to make bonuses and discounts - so they will collect the required amount of investment during ICO. It seems to me that bonuses should be given at the initial stages. This stimulates investment, of course, if the project is quite popular, then less money should be spent on advertising.  The best advertisement of the project is the bounty campaign. This forum is visited by all potential investors. Therefore, the more people will participate in the signature campaign the better.",False

For all the time the market fell, everyone was tired of seeing a decrease in their own investments. And that's why everyone increasingly hopes for the nearest growth of the market. unfortunately, the market does not want to grow and, perhaps, very large growth not will or it will not happen soon  Growth can begin at any time. It all depends on the desire of large capitals. There are many factors on which  depends growth of the market. Nevertheless, I think that all the same market trends are created by a large trader.

I wonder why there are no promotions and bonuses for those people who buy immediately with the start of sales.  I also find this developer solution strange.

Let us while we think how to help the developers of this exchange to implement their plans properly and on time.  And what is there to think. Developers need money to implement the project. The more they collect the investments the better. You can invest your money and help advertise the project for new people.  My friend had several hundred Bitcoins and he spent them on expensive cars and girls. He could open his own business or invest in a promising project. But he did not. Money without a mind and plans do not give anything good.  Your friend's example is not the worst. At the end of spring, all news channels showed a story about a guy who on YouTube showed off big money earned on crypto-currencies. Later the bandits beat him and robbed him, took away all his money.  This guy did a very stupid thing. You should never brag about your money.
