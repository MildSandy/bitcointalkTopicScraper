Blockstack's platform helps entrepreneurs and engineers build these apps and deliver better end-user experiences.   - The traditional internet has many central points of failure and trust, like (a) the Domain Name System (DNS) servers, (b) public-key infrastructure, and (c) end-user data stored on centralized data stores. We present the design and implementation of a new internet, called Blockstack, where users don’t need to trust remote servers. We remove any trust points from the middle of the network and use blockchains to secure critical data bindings. Blockstack implements services for identity, discovery, and storage and can survive failures of underlying blockchains. The design of Blockstack is informed by three years of experience from a large blockchain-based production system. Blockstack gives comparable performance to traditional internet services and enables a much-needed security and reliability upgrade to the traditional internet.  TOKEN SALE  The token sale closed December 1, 2017.   - We’re thrilled to announce that the Blockstack token sale for accredited investors has come to an end, with a total of $50M closed and allocated.  Over 800 individuals and funds participated, including Union Square Ventures, Foundation Capital, Lux Capital, Winklevoss Capital, Blockchain Capital, Digital Currency Group, Kevin Rose, Michael Arrington, and Qasar Younis (the former COO of Y Combinator).  Additionally, over 8000 people received vouchers for a potential future purchase of up to $3000 worth of tokens (subject to applicable law).  TGE is coming soon - slated approximately for Q3/Q4 2018.  ATTENTION!  Announced Blockstack Community Rewards Program, in which you can earn tokens Stacks, performing various tasks.   - Anyone who completes a task posted by the community — technical or non-technical — will be rewarded with tokens. Each task will be denominated in Stacks, the native token to the Blockstack network, and redeemable subject to applicable law.  As we grow, these Stacks tokens will be used to perform various operations on the Blockstack network, whether you’re a user wanting to pay a premium subscription for a social network, or a developer registering an application. You can read more about Stacks in the token whitepaper.  Do you want to become Evangelist Blockstack?
