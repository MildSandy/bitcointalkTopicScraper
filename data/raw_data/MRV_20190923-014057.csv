Macroverse Macroverse is a procedurally generated universe, available to be used by blockchain-based games. Rather than paying expensive gas costs to store environment and level data on the blockchain, or spending large amounts of developer effort on custom world generation algorithms, game developers will be able to use Macroverse as a piece of game development middleware, and to find settings for their games by exploring the single, shared Macroverse universe.  The Macroverse world is generated by the Macroverse Generator (MG), a system of smart contracts. The Macroverse Star Generator, which produces a galaxy of over 200 billion stars of various classes, is deployed at address 0x56D96b6a5F33E2efE5BE66065D5b9C230B1f4e0e using this source code. Addresses with a balance of (currently) 100 MRV or more may query the generator's various constant functions and receive information about the Macroverse world.  Virtual Real Estate Players exploring the Macroverse world will be able to discover, claim, and trade virtual real estate. If you find a particularly compelling star, planet, or geographical feature, you will be able to purchase it and make it yours. Ownership of real estate may confer beneficial effects or advantages in supported games.  Virtual real estate claims are manged by the Macroverse Registry, a system of smart contracts. Currently, the only contract is the Macroverse Star Registry, at address 0x6C00556F471cbe518007D62bc4ACEd6d8e537c9D using this source code, which allows players to claim (transferable, releasable) ownership of star systems, by putting up a deposit of (currently) 1000 MRV.  MRV Token The Macroverse token, MRV, is an ERC20-compatible token on the Ethereum blockchain. Players must hold a minimum balance in the MRV token to query the Macroverse system, and deposits denominated in MRV must be put up in order to claim virtual real estate. The MRV token will be distributed in a crowdsale beginning July 1st at approximately 10 AM PST.  Token Facts Name: Macroverse Token Symbol: MRV Decimals: 18 Token Contract: 0xAB6CF87a50F17d7F5E1FEaf81B6fE9FfBe8EBF84 Total Supply: Up to 100,005,000 MRV Available for Sale: 100,000,000 MRV Crowdsale Price: 5,000 MRV per ETH Crowdsale Start Scheduled: 10:02 AM PST on July 1 Crowdsale Duration: 90 days Crowdsale Contract (same as token contract): 0xAB6CF87a50F17d7F5E1FEaf81B6fE9FfBe8EBF84 Crowdsale/Token Contract Source: Here More details are available here.  The MRV token is intended to function like a software license, enabling people to use the Macroverse system. It is not indented to represent a stake in the Macroverse project, and is not designed to increase in value over time.  In addition to trying to sell tokens, I'm posting here to gauge developer interest in building atop a platform like this, and to gather suggestions as to what features would be good to have when extending the system from just generating stars down to generating planets, terrain, weather, and other world features described in the whitepaper.

and a white dwarf. There's all sorts of gameplay possibilities there; even something as simple as a Noctis clone, where you fly around refueling at white dwarfs, would be pretty fun.  Reading console dumps is not a particularly slick way to explore the universe, so I'm planning to develop a nice front end to let people explore the generated world in a web3-enabled browser, to hopefully be completed before the crowdsale is over. Is that the sort of prototype you're looking for?",False
