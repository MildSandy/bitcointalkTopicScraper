All this about staking this token and creating that mobile phone...... enough of the expansion and diversion from the original idea.  At least if the team had launched the product they had the ICO for and had flooded shopping malls and retail outlets with the XPOS devices it would have brought in a regular revenue stream for the Pundi X team and they would be able to have credibility by showing the world and showing investors they succeeded in making the XPOS device available worldwide and commonly used.

Those who sold of when the coin was at an all time high missed part of the monthly airdrop but are much happier.  At the time of the ICO 1 Ether was worth 500 PXS (Ether was pegged at 500 USD)... I remember buying PXS at the last minutes worth 900 usd (900 PXS) The Pundi X team would the go to perform at token slip after some time. 1 PXS = 1000 NPXS... So i had 900,000 NPXS. As time went on along with the monthly airdrop my NPXS number grew to around 1,300,000 NPXS. This was the best time because it's when pundi x tokens had an all time high of 0.015 USD per token  My Pundix Token worth was roughly around 20K USD. Imagine just from 900 USD in ICO... The price lasted a couple of days then the mighty drop started. It has never been the same again since then. Luckily I exited when my Pundix portfolio value dropped to worth around 15K.  I like the project. The team seems committed but it doesn't seem to be popular thus token value is way too low right now. I could probably give it a second chance in future",False

That will be possible if the project is hype, people look for success in short term also so they will buy a hype project. Ideas on a project can easily imitated, and even if a certain project have launch it first but they are not guaranteed they will be successful.  PundiX is a good project, I don't see any similar project with a big vision like PundiX, however, we cannot force the kind of success that we have in our mind when the project has not matured yet. Talking about PundiX certainly doesn't need to be doubted because it is a project that can be said to have a bright future but indeed we have to wait for the project to be truly successful If the project have a bright future, how can Pundi X's price fell from 100 sats to 7-8 sats?",False

I DM them and are in chatt with them now. Not all positive but the team have to wake the fuck up. They doing nothing imo to spike the price up or attract new investors to buy in to this project. And all the time we see someone use the XPOS they try to promote the use and payment in NPXS. This looks like to have the opposite effect imo. Why not use ETH or BTC on the XPOS so other investors see that its possible to use other payment options and not only NPXS. I know and think they all know that its possibke but we need to get it out there. Pundi x and the XPOS are crypto neutral so we welcome all to be used on the XPOS not only NPXS. But it looks to me that crypto twitter and many others not know this. The idea behind the project is perfect but looks dead. Why dont BTC and ETH promote the XPOS so other investors see that its possible to pay with both on the XPOS. Small things like this will attract all BTC and ETH holders.,False

After the airdrop i will no longer hold my NPXS but i will trade all the swings and buy in again at a lower price. If we i do that now i might lose % from the airdrop thats why i just keep holding.

If Pundi X was so serious why did they launch the Xphone before making success with the XPOS ?  If asking me are the XPOS a failed project. Thats why they did try to hype things up with the Xphone.

XPOS units alone are more limited but can you imagine a million or more users buying the Xphone over the next few years and using the phone and being a node to help the network? So having a blockchain, Xphone and XPOS, hardware and software operating systems all in-house are going to really accelerate token burning to the point that the price will be less open to manipulation as supply goes down and more organic rises in price over time as more and more gas is needed to work the transactions, more utility of the token will be driving up the demand and decreasing the supply. This is a magical formula that other blockchains like Ethereum don't have right now. I am not a financial advisor but anyone who has some cash or btc / eth to spare, do yourselves a favor and just grab at least one million NPXS if you can afford, or try to use that as a goal and put it aside and forget about it until the next bull run. Then you can see what you want to do then. Even if we have a good bull run, I will always hold an NPXS bag and will try to take profits and buy the dips on the way up so that I always replenish my stick but for now at these low levels, most of my bag is sitting and collecting airdrops.

That may seem like a minor thing but consider that it's quite well known in both Singlish (Singapore slang) and Manglish (Malaysian English slang) you can imagine that the project's immediate neighbours might find it a little odd, to say the least! I've even seen articles allude to how odd the name sounds before writing about the actual product and tech. Not the greatest first impression, if you ask me.  Rebranding is nothing new: look at Raiblocks (NANO) Antshares (NEO), Darkcoin (DASH) among others. I think a similar name change might do this coin a whole lot of good.

CoinNest will be the first Korean cryptocurrency exchange to launch 300,000 Pundi X Pass cards, the NFC-enabled physical multi-currency (fiat and cryptocurrencies) wallet and list the PXS token on February 24, 2018. Coinnest has more than 500,000 members registered over a year. It offers the the most extensive selection of cryptocurrencies for trading among all the exchange platforms in Korea, including BTC, BCH, BTG, BCD, ETH, ETC, WTC, HSR, QTUM, NEO, INK, TRON, TSL, ENT, ADA, GAS, MCO, KNC, BT2, BT1 and others. Starting from 17:00 GMT+7 (Seoul time) on February 24, PXS will be available to trade on Coinnest. The Pundi X PASS card is a physical multi-currency (fiat and cryptocurrencies) wallet. The owner can top up cryptocurrencies in this card through Pundi X mobile app or via the Pundi X POS devices, which are connected to the blockchain platforms. They can use this physical wallet to complete transactions without the need of their mobile phones, laptops or other online devices. The card can serve as a mean to facilitate a smooth onboarding experience for the next billion crypto users, who are not familiar with the current process of acquiring cryptocurrencies. “Pundi X’s solution allows people who have little or no access to cryptocurrency easily conduct transactions. We are excited to the first exchange platform to introduce Pundi X PASS Card and lower the technical threshold of trading cryptocurrency,” says Xander Kim, CEO of Coinnest. Pundi X introduced its blockchain-based POS solution with a mission of bringing cryptocurrencies to mainstream adoption. This solution will enable physical store owners to use either cryptocurrency or fiat money to complete transactions on the blockchain. The company aims to solve the last mile challenge of cryptocurrency transactions and bringing cryptocurrency into daily life. “While the Korean cryptocurrency exchange platforms contribute a significant amount of trading volume, interest in Pundi X POS solution is very high in South Korea. PXS listing and Pundi X POS solution deployment with CoinNest are the significant steps for us to enter Korean market. This helps Pundi X to accelerate our market penetration,” says Zac Cheah, CEO and Co-founder of Pundi X.",False

Announced in a Twitter post, the move comes after the integration of the two networks late last month. The agreement says that Pundi X will be the anchor for the local currency, making it possible for business operators to make cross-border payments at better rates.  The Pundi X POS platform will also start supporting the Stellar Lumens native currency XLM. It will act as the issuer of credit to the Stellar network for all transactions on the platform using the Indonesian rupiah.  Inefficiencies in money transfer systems mean that international transactions are often made using US dollars. One aim of the partnership is to reduce these inefficiencies and encourage the use of the local currency in international trade. The use of XLM in retail stores also provides convenience for Indonesians wishing to make purchases using cryptocurrencies.  The concept builds on the already successful Pundi-Pundi model, one of the most popular cashless payment apps in Indonesia. It already has a user base of 100,000 and more than 500 merchants are using it in Jakarta.   Pundi X is a digital currency point-of-sale (POS) service provider. It has its own POS devices that can connect to the blockchain. This allows purchases in retail stores and also allows users to buy XLM tokens using fiat currencies, mobile wallets or bank cards.  The Stellar network is a blockchain platform that enables transactions between different financial companies and payment systems. It uses a fast clearing and settlement feature to allow a seamless movement of funds between parties. The XLM token used on the network provides a bridge between the different currencies transacted.

Mathematically it has no difference whether the token is priced 2.736USD or 0.002736USD as the difference in total supply means the total market cap is the same. However, after receiving multiple requests and evaluating the token economy, we have decided to make the split. After the split, a token will be worth 0.002736 as of today’s ETH price (13/01/2018).  As we perform the token split, for every PXS token that you own, you will get another 999 tokens via airdrop. Please keep your PXS in a wallet which you have ownership of the private key, including but not limited to, MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, Trezor device and others so that you can safely receive the airdrops.  The split will happen anytime after ICO and no latter than 1st March, likely sooner than later. Exchange trading will commence a few days after the split.  Note: Request for comment articles are reviewed by Pundi X and will only be activated once it enters “ANN=Announcements” phase.  https://medium.com/pundix/rc-request-for-comment-pxs-token-split-f43c77b77a0b",False

Indonesian market is large and bitcoin is becoming a trending topic in here, people follow the news about bitcoin but they find it difficult to purchase it since there are only few options.

We have struck three strategic partnership recently:  1. NU Cash app integration. NU is an organization in Indonesia with 100 million members and NU Cash App allows its members to use the app to pay utility bills and religious donations amongst others payment utilities.  2. Bulog app integration. Bulog is one of the biggest (if not biggest) cooperation convenience stores with 25,000 shops in Indonesia, and their Bulog app allows users to buy and pay cashless. The owners of Bulog is encouraging this so that they can also track performance of each stores.  3. Warmindo partnership. We have been able to successfully roll out cashless payments in Warmindo restaurants. There are 45,000 Warmindo shops through out Indonesia and the Warmindo brand is own by the famous Indonesia conglomerate that produces the delicious Indomie (for you noodle lovers ^_^)  We want to make it clear that item 1 and 2 is not rolled out yet but agreement is in place. This is done in partnership with E2Pay. E2Pay's CEO is also our president advisor. For item 3 we have started the successful roll out of cashless at Warmindo, at current request we cannot fulfill demand but we are supporting as many Warmindo restaurants as we can. The partnership with Warmindo is to use our cashless app and the next step (soon) is to also roll out our Pundi X POS device at Warmindo locations so that users can not only pay cashless, but buy sell and pay with cryptocurrency.",False
