Numbers say that about 20% of patients around the world faced misdiagnosis. The core of the TrustedHealth ecosystem is the Trustedoctor platform, a partner of TrustedHealth and an already functioning system that connects patients with the best doctors regardless of the patients’ location, help to find the right medications without necessity to travel and therefore saving time when it’s a lifesaving factor. Nowadays, Trustedoctor is focused on providing help to patients with brain and lung cancer and planning to expand the list of diseases (two more diseases will be added till the end of 2018). 50 world’s leading doctor specialists from six countries are currently working on the platform have already helped more than 200 patients from 25 countries. The platform also allows doctors to communicate with other doctors for their professional consultations. TrustedHealth is supported by 16 medical organizations. From a patient’s point of view TrustedHealth has the following features. Medical data will be stored in decentralized storage with exclusive access of the corresponding patient owning this data. The data can be shared or sold to doctors, research centers, or educational institutes for medical or scientific research. The platform is also open to other organizations that can become a part of the ecosystem if they can help patients or doctors, for example, diagnostic labs, pharmacies, patient organizations, and insurance companies. Their ERC-20 utility token called TDH will be the currency within the ecosystem, including the Trustedoctor platform. Users will be rewarded with TDH for engagement and transactions within the ecosystem. Similar to Trustedoctor, other partners coming to the platform will use TDH as a primary payment method. Though payments can be done with fiat money, there ones using TDH will have discounts and other incentives. The total token supply is 300 million, 50% will be sold on ICO, 20% will go to the company, and 30% – to the team.  Team TrustedHealth’s team consists of 19 specialists in medicine, blockchain, software engeneering, finance, management, advertising, marketing, and design. Most of the team members are full-time employees. TrustedHealth’s CEO Greg Jarzabek is an alumnus of Harvard, ESCP and Warsaw School of Economics, worked many years as a credit trader. When his mother died of cancer, he decided to focus on developing a network helping people with life-threatening diseases and founded the Trustedoctor company. They also have 15 advisors, most of them are professors or top specialists in medical sphere, as well as professionals in blockchain and entrepreneurs.  Summary TrustedHealth is focused on a few simple functions – connecting patients with doctors, providing communication between doctors, storing user data in a secure way, and engaging other healthcare organizations to join the platform community. And this is just we like the most, because it’s much better to do simple and narrow functions perfectly than spread your interests, plans and features on several spheres and this way increase risks of failure because of lack of attention to each feature. And here is one more important thing – a working product. Yes, for now they only deal with two diseases, but their good results are clear and obvious, so it’s a promising start. Take into account generosity of the idea, because it will likely attract new doctors and investors. Thought general forecast is positive, the project’s possible success will depend on how fast they will engage people to the platform and for how long they will stay there.  A decentralized platform connecting patients with world-leading doctors to beat life-threatening diseases.",False

Here is a long but helpful text about the differences between TrustedHealth and Medibloc and others.  The biggest difference is that we are working in the field of specialised medicine and will integrate the blockchain technology for improved outcomes for patients with life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. Our focus is on linking patients with leading doctor specialists, hospitals, private clinics, research labs, etc. and putting data to better use for all ecosystem partners. We are building TrustedHealth with the experience from www.trustedoctor.com - a startup in specialised medicine that already connects more than 85 world’s leading doctor specialist and 300+ patients around the world.  Our technology is already in use (watch How it works video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgPzm5GsiYM).

Sorry if you found my answer too general, although the answer basically remains the same.  TrusteDoctor and specialized medicine in fact, is not meant to treat as many patients as possible in the shortest time possible but to treat the patients as GOOD as possible. All the diseases we deal with at TrusteDoctor (Lung and brain cancer, so far) are very bad diseases so we want to grow slowly and to ensure enough doctors/specialists before onboarding thousands of patients. We're dealing with people's lives after all.  TrustedHealth on the other hand, opens up for other partners to join in, such as hospitals, research institutes (TrusteDoctor already on boarded 17 of them) etc. with the goal to make specialized medicine at top notch level available wherever you are and whoever you are. Right now, how many options do you have to be treated by the best doctors in the world? Probably not too many, unless you are lucky and live in the same country as the best specialists.  That's a short recap, I invite you to read our whitepaper, where we explain in more depth with technical background etc. You can find it here: https://trustedhealth.io/pdfs/TDH_Whitepaper-cc7bc343ca57bb6556f86df736698340.pdf?vsn=d",False

Firstly, specialised medicine is expanding rapidly and is getting more and more vital for the well being of patients globally - especially with the annual increase of cancer diagnosed patients. Cancer and other life-threatening diseases have become a global problem and we still rely on local and outdated solutions. We believe the best treatment for the patient’s disease might not always be in the nearest hospital. There has to be a better way, based on the best knowledge out there.    Secondly, we know the space of specialized medicine very well since we began our journey with Trustedoctor in 2016. Since then Trustedoctor (LINK) has helped over 300 cancer patients from more than 25 countries, by linking them to the world’s leading doctor specialists and offering them a priceless second opinion leading in some cases to treatment and life-changing experiences (Read the story of Maike, one of the Trustedoctor patient here: LINK[/size])  Third reason, the current specialised medicine system is fundamentally broken. We can do better.[/size]   PROBLEMS WITH THE CURRENT STATE  OF SPECIALISED MEDICINE  Despite huge amounts of money and resources spent in specialised medicine each year, the current system is broken. Here are some of the problems we have identified together with leading doctors, hospitals and patient initiatives.   1. The right medical expersite is not in one place. 2. High misdiagnosis with around 20% of patients around the world with up to 45% relating to cancer. 3. There is a lack of collaboration and transfer of knowledge between medical practitioners globally. 4. Limited access to population health data 5. Inconsistent rules and permissions for accessing patient data 6. Varying data standards 7. Fraud and non-transparency (“Healthcare fraud is estimated to have cost around $US30 billion over the past 20 years in the United States alone”)    SOLUTION IN TWO STEPS   FIRST STEP: TrustedDoctor - A working platform with a track record of saving human lives (https://trustedoctor.com/) [/center]  Trustedoctor - Your direct link to world’s leading doctor specialists - is the first TrustedHealth ecosystem partner. Trustedoctor gives patients a choice and a direct link to world’s leading doctor specialists to match their specific needs with doctors’ corresponding specialty and enables interactive consultation on a virtual platform, in the interest of time and travel. In just the fields of brain and lung cancer, we have already helped more than 200 patients from 25 countries, empowering them with access to the right specialists without worrying about the barriers of geography, time and finances.     TrustedDoctor track record since 2016:  1.INDUSTRY 200+ Cancer patients linked to the best possible treatment 25+ Countries 85+ specialised and recognized doctors and specialists 30+ Patients organizations and hospitals joined the network  2. ACADEMICS  Harvard New Venture competition February 2017 - Finalist  3. MEDIA RECOGNITION BBC NEWS DIGITAL HEALTH    SECOND STEP: TrustedHealth (www.TrustedHealth.io)  TrustedHealth is a patient and doctor-centric health ecosystem in specialised medicine engineered on blockchain. Along with Trustedoctor, TrustedHealth is an ecosystem that goes beyond just patient care, using technology and community to find cures, share information, analyse illnesses and save lives.  With implementation of blockchain technology and issuance of the Health Token (TDH), TrustedHealth will be able to build a holistic network of healthcare services in specialised medicine and focus on finding the best methodologies to deliver better health outcome for patients in life-threatening diseases from anywhere in the world.     WHY BLOCKCHAIN?  Benefit  1  -  Better  security  of  medical  data. Thanks to a peer-to-peer decentralised storage system holding shredded and encrypted data on dispersed servers connected with Ethereum blockchain. ● Make it more reliable, not all eggs in one basket ● Diminishes the privacy breaches by one single entity (who holds the data) ● Your encrypted files are spread across multiple nodes or hosts ● No single host holds any significant piece ● Decentralised distributed storage network ● Improves speed, reliability and availability ● All transactions are audited ● Tracked by smart contacts (no abuse of privacy), transparency assured· everything is time-stamped, delivering secure integrity of data ● Reduce the storage costs – far more affordable for hospitals ● Decentralised cloud is on average 10x less expensive than current cloud storage providers. Storing 1TB on SIA costs US$2 per month, compared with US$23 on Amazon S3   Benefit 2 – Data storage customisation thanks to blockchain overlay which allows for the easy adjustment of the storage to relevant national regulatory requirements. It also allows for ease of participation and the use of smart contracts to know where the data is stored and by whom. Geolocation of stored data is managed and defined in the algorithm which follows the regulatory rules of each network participant based on the country of origin and type of data.   Benefit 3 - Increased interoperability of patient data records between systems allowing for easy data sharing and common research. 29 Medical records and patient  information are crucial to the healthcare system around  the world.   Healthcare organisations, such as hospitals and insurance companies, need to share patient information to conduct their business. Medical records, however, present many challenges to the healthcare system. Current healthcare record systems are a mess of disconnected databases and medical history is fragmented and siloed, preventing doctors and patients from building a complete record of health. Records are often spread across different facilities and providers in incompatible databases. The vast majority of hospital systems still cannot easily or safely share their data. One  of the most pressing problems with the current system  is  knowing whether the  information that has been shared  is accurate and that it has not been tampered with.  Interoperability issues continue to be a chief concern throughout the health industry. The lack of interoperability leads to high costs, it also makes these systems loaded with private patient information very vulnerable to security breaches or fraud or other cybercrime related activities.   Benefit 4 – Control of the data by patients and doctors. In the blockchain environment, patients are able to maintain full access and control of their own data, providing access to the healthcare providers they’d like to share it with. This enables hospitals, insurance companies and labs to connect in real-time and share information instantly and seamlessly, in a secure way. This is ideal for medical research, 30 facilitating the kind of longitudinal studies that can really help best understand illnesses. Since data stored on blockchains can be shared securely with a pre-approved and trusted group of individuals, patients are assured that their data is being used properly and that there is complete transparency, accuracy and trust in the information across all of its users.  Benefit 5 - Smart contracts will allow for rewarding of the data uploader and storage  provider. Our goal is to create a health ecosystem which truly belongs to the proper stakeholders: patients and doctors. The blockchain implies a decentralised control mechanism in which all have an interest, but that no one exclusively owns. This is an architectural change that generalises past medical records and allows us to create an ecosystem beneficial for all participants. On one side, participants can, in exchange for rewards, provide their extra hard drive space for processing. On the other hand, participants providing relevant medical data are rewarded for their contributions whenever their data is used in research and by other network members.
