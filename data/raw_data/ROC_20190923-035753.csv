Thanks for your feedback, one thing I'd like to point out is the main feature of the ROC token is that holders of this token are entitled to receive shared profits paid as an ETH dividend every quarter.  The size of the dividend paid is what will increase the value of this token over time which will hopefully give long term token holders good protection from a pump and dump scenario. The company is also keeping 28% of all tokens as the company only makes its profit from the same dividends paid out to all token holders.  So even though there are 5,000,000 tokens being created, the maximum amount ever possible to reach the market will be 3.6 million tokens with 500k of those tokens (the development teams allocation) being locked for 12 months and the companies tokens being locked permanently.  Another notable feature is that the company and the development teams token allocation is only emitted proportionally to the amount of tokens sold to the public.   Our tokens are also redeemable for services and discounts within our project once it is live, for example 1 ROC token will be exchangeable for 3 months of website membership which will cost the fiat paying customer $89.95. ROC token holders will also be able to sell their tokens on our website to fiat customers who want to save money on the fiat prices.  https://ico.rasputinonline.com  Join our Slack Channel  https://rasputinonline.slack.com/join/shared_invite/MjE3NDQ4MzEyMTQ1LTE1MDEwODI3NjgtOTExZjYzODlhNw  If you have missed any of the events in our live broadcast studio, you can see pictures and updates on our Slack and also our Facebook page  https://www.facebook.com/rasputinonline  OP  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2002224.0",False

I like this planning as it is a straight tool to increase the value of the token to $89.95 after the start of this token in your website.
