I predict this projects is very difficult to achieve the target, although only softcap. Why I saying that ? 1 : ICO has been running from September 19th until this moment only collect 25% of the desired softcap. 2 : the number of tokens is too much and ambitious. 3 : that amount is very difficult for whales to control prices in the market. 4 : less promotion But many Promoters are out. promoters rate in terms of tokens, stake, not FIAT.  If token sell get $ 750k dollar , promotor get $ 50k dollar. If you give them token on presentase % maybe 1-2% from token sold they are Will be stay for support your projects.  I just provide additional input for your project. multiply the promoter, campaign funds are replaced in percent , burn token that does not sell well.  token supply too much makes investors lazy to invest here. there should be 5 days left to make a massive overhaul. lower the softcap and lower the token supply. if you still want this project running.",False

They should have created a mSPHR a la IOTA for their marketplace and a SPHR for the exchanges/ holders At this level, it inplies a low price in BTC, hence an ETH or LTC only trade... hence lower volumes ...

GameCredits/MobileGo is already doing something very similar with moderate success.  I do extensive research in everything I want to invest in, so I read your entire white paper and explored your entire webpage. After my extensive research, I am almost certain this will not work out.  You can prove me wrong but let me list my reasons and questions.  Reason 1: 2 TRIL Supply. Token Price = Market Cap / Supply. Assume Cap is 87M, which would already be a generous assumption for an ICO with no working MVP until 2018. Supply is 2 TRIL. Price is 87M/2TRIL = $0.0000435 USD per token. 1 Satoshi is the same price at the moment of this posting. Market cap needs to be 87M now for each token to be worth 1 satoshi, not 50M as stated in the outdated Whitepaper. It is unlikely and unrealistic to expect $87M+ ICO with no Minimum Viable Product until 2018 and a team of 4. Most ICOs do not raise that amount nor is there a need to raise that amount.  Expected Outcome: ICO raises less than $87M, making these tokens worth less than 1 satoshi. Now they'll never be traded until the market cap hits $87M, which is never because the market cap won't move as it won't be traded.  Unlikely Outcome: ICO raises $87M+, securing the 1 satoshi level for this token to be traded at. There are market dynamics and 1 satoshi sell wall will drive potential investors off, as there is an abundance of potentially great investments at the moment that does not look like its blocked by a massive 1 satoshi sell wall. Even if there are buyers it will just look like no one is buying because there will be no buy orders as those will be instantly gobbled up by sell wall at 1 satoshi, and the 500% bonus can contribute to this. It will be a challenge to pass the 1 satoshi hurdle that should not be risked in the first place which can be simply fixed by lowering the 2TRIL supply to 200BIL. The ICO would have to raise $200M+ so the pricing can start at 2-3 satoshis for me to feel comfortable. It will leave some leeway for the potential increase of BTC price or fluctuation in this token, as well as staying away from 1 satoshi. I outline later why 1 satoshi in my opinion is not a good idea and will be more harmful than beneficial, for having 2TRIL tokens.  ---  Reason 2: Absurd 500% Bonus. Absurd Bonuses overall. But I analysed it. It's not really 500% on Day 1. Interesting sales tactic, but this can in actuality be simplified to 340,500 SPRS / ETH, with 300% / 167% / 100% / 33% / 0% bonus. With this kind of bonus and gap, the sell orders at 1 satoshi level will be there for a long, long time. This kind of bonus is unprecedented even among scam ICOs. Eventually this will not increase liquidity, but rather decrease it as people are seeing there is no profit to be made. There might be profit but that's not how it works, when people see this massive sell order wall at 1 satoshi, they will be driven away. They will feel less incentivized to buy in. Because any buy orders will be instantly fulfilled at 1 satoshi level, leaving a massive sell orders at 1 satoshi level. There are plenty of other promising coins to invest in that they can find that doesn't look like it has such a hurdle. The hurdle to break from 1 satoshi to 2 satoshi level is not easy, a 100% increase.  Let's do some math. Let's be realistic here. You raise $10M from ICO, and really, that's all you need, seeing as the team and advisors keep 15% as well. Let's assume an even spread of buyers for each bonus tier.  (1,362,000 SPRS + 908,000 SPRS + 681,000 SPRS + 454,000 SPRS + 340,500 SPRS) / 5 = 749,100 SPRS per ETH on average. ETH = $325 currently. $1 USD = 2305 SPRS. $10M * 2305 SPRS = 23,050,000,000 SPRS  Now since 1,240,000,000,000 was on sale, the proportion of sales we achieve is 23,050,000,000 / 1,240,000,000,000 = 0.01858870967 Which is the equivalent of 1.85887% of the sale.  This means the remaining SPRS will be spread among investors proportionally by 53.7960954447 times multiplier. Thus, each $1 USD = 2305 SPRS * 53.7960954447 = 124,000 SPRS.  Or we can say, $1 USD = 22,745 Satoshi = 0.00022745 BTC = 124,000 SPRS. The average investor gets 124,000 SPRS tokens per $1 USD, which should be worth at least 22,745 satoshis or 0.00022745 BTC to break even. Meaning each token should be valued at 0.18342741935 satoshis, which is impossible. We have to wait until the market cap is worth 87M+, then the valuation is 1 satoshi.  Expected Outcome: Bonus gap and outrageous bonus for early investors will lead to mass selloff for a long time, especially since MVP comes 2018. If starting price is 1 satoshi, I am confident the liquidity will just decrease over time until the platform is up and running next year, which begs me to question why have an ICO now? The decisions made by this team is highly questionable. If the starting price reaches 3 satoshis by some divine luck with hundreds of millions of dollars being poured in for ICO, you can darn expect with this bonus model that it will be driven down to 2 and then 1 satoshi.  ---  Question 1: If the ICO raises under $87M, how will we reach $87M if no trading is going on so that this coin will be worth 1 satoshi each? According to your whitepaper, you will not list it on exchanges until it hits the market cap necessary to trade at 1 satoshi. This does not make sense. How will the market cap move without trading taking place? Market cap is simply calculated by Token price * Supply. Token price will not move itself without trading.  Question 2: Why 2 TRIL tokens? you said in White Paper to avoid fractions and market scalability and greater liquidity with narrow bid-ask spread. There is a problem here. With 2 TRIL tokens we won't even hit the 1 Satoshi mark realistically to get off the ground first. It's like building a giant wall in front of yourself, and trying to jump over to take off, but more than likely you'll just run into the wall and fall. This is complete overkill as Ripple, which is likely to be adopted by banks one day, only has 38BIL tokens, not 2000BIL tokens. Bytecoin, which you should and could use as a great example, has 184BIL and trades for 33 Satoshis or $0.0001435 USD, with a 260Mil market cap. If your coin gets stuck at 1 satoshi massive sell wall it will be dangerous and more harmful than beneficial for the decision to create 2 TRIL tokens. Yes, 2 TRIL tokens is your dream target, but realistically speaking here, unless you have 200M+ already in investors that see the promise of your product, then 2 TRIL tokens will lead to its demise. If you want 2 TRIL tokens that bad, cancel the ICO, work on it until 2018, do ICO in 2018 when you see opportunity of the next ICO/crypto craze round.  Question 3: What about ETH? Tokens are more likely to make it on EtherDelta before big exchanges like Bittrex or Poloniex. Can we trade these tokens for ETH denominations?  ---  Review: Market Need: 9.5/10 - In short, developers are getting screwed by centralized fees that take ~30% of their revenues from them, this can help Blockchain Fit: 8.5/10 - Payment through these tokens can remove the need for fees Founding Team: 7/10 - Extremely talented team, however no prior projects of a similar scale has been attempted by this team Blockchain Talent: 8.5/10 - Blockchain enthusiasts, I have no doubt can get the job done, however there is no MVP yet Equitability: 0/10 - Absurd bonus gap for ICO, absurd token supply, absurd ICO ""cap"", everything was absolutely outrageous  My Suggestions: Option 1: Stop and come back next near for ICO after you have MVP. Why try to fit in now near the end of the Summer crypto craze with nothing to show for it? This project would be so much more promising if it came back at the next wave of crypto craze with something that is actually working beyond a White Paper.  Option 2: Decrease 2TRIL to 200BIL so we can have 1 satoshi at 8.8M raised, a much more realistic goal. Even then I do not expect this presentation or ICO to raise much more than 8.8M, and a 1 satoshi level, in my opinion, is extremely distasteful. It definitely does more harm than good to have a 2TRIL token count.  ---  I put a lot of time investigating each and every investment that I make, and while you guys got the idea right, there are too many red flags for me to get involved in this. Good luck Spheris and to any investors. Hopefully you can prove me wrong or revise your arrangement.",False

So as you can read in our whitepaper, we have particular reasons to go with a 2 trillion token supply, as opposed to smaller supply. We have a clear perspective for the future with this project, and want to build on and sustain this vision going forward. It is not our intention to be “just another alt-coin”, but rather want SPRS to gain big value thanks, in part, to the merits of our platform and our work.  An important point regarding future trade of SPRS-BTC: We are currently checking options with several exchanges to allow trade of bulk SPRS for BTC, so that you will be able to trade tokens regardless of our market cap. What we mean by bulk is, for example, being able to trade 1,000 SPRS for BTC. We will definitely update you about this!  Crowdsale Bonus Structure We have received a lot of feedback regarding our bonus structure, and are in the process of re-evaluating it to make it more attractive and fair for everyone. We value community input and take feedback and criticism seriously. We will be updating you on this as well in the coming days.    Hello Kenny,  Thank you for your kind words and favorable scores regarding our project and our team! To address some of your points regarding SPRS tokens:   According to your whitepaper, you will not list it on exchanges until it hits the market cap necessary to trade at 1 satoshi. This does not make sense. This is something that we’re currently looking to change, as addressed at the start of this post.   Question 2: The same answer applies here. We want people to be able to trade SPRS-BTC as we hit the exchanges, without waiting for a specific market cap to be able to do that.   What about ETH? Tokens are more likely to make it on EtherDelta before big exchanges like Bittrex or Poloniex. Can we trade these tokens for ETH denominations? Yes, of course.  - Spheris Team",False

This is something we wanted to do differently, as part of the plan of providing a comfortable and a dev-friendly decentralized app distribution platform. A platform without fees, as Spheris is intended to be, should especially appeal to independent devs, for whom 30% is a big blow to their bottom line. This extends to situations where devs won't necessarily sell their apps via Spheris marketplace, but rather use Spheris as a payment processor (SPRS tokens) instead of credit card companies or Paypal (who charge fees).  To put it simply: the Spheris distribution platform is free and is built around SPRS transactions for which we do not charge fees. Devs who use the platform will no longer need to pay 3rd party fees for payment processors, website setup and hosting, among others.  - Spheris Team",False

Website • Whitepaper • Blog • Telegram • Twitter • Reddit • Github    Spheris is an open-source decentralized application marketplace, with a standalone solution for payment processing. Planned with a vision to eliminate 3rd party fees, Spheris platform aims to become the go-to place for developers who wish to be in control of their revenue, and consumers who wish to pay directly to the developers. With Ethereum’s blockchain technology, new possibilities open up to disrupt the status quo and shift the paradigm toward giving more to developers and consumers, without the involvement of large corporate entities. In addition to providing a new distribution vector for developers, Spheris introduces customizable subscription options and validation for apps, a feature-extended crypto wallet solution, as well as optional decentralized storage solutions with other blockchain projects.                         We chose a more dedicated and focused approach to provide a decentralized application marketplace. Such an approach allows solving problems in novel ways: Fees. Traditional app stores take a 30% cut from each sale, in addition to registration fees. Opting to self-publish your apps will result in third-party payment processing fees. Developers will not be subjected to any fees on the Spheris platform. Censorship and Restrictions. Apps that don't comply with the numerous app store guidelines get rejected or de-listed. Proper rating and ranking systems, along with the power of the community, ensure this will not happen on the Spheris platform. Point of Entry for Developers. Currently, many developers across the globe cannot sell on various app stores due to bureaucracy and legislation. There is no requirement to form a legal entity or even open a bank account in order to sell on Spheris. Ease-of-Use. We want to make sure that developers don't need any kind of additional technical blockchain skills in order to sell on Spheris. Spheris will provide all necessary tools for a comfortable and friendly user experience.     The Spheris platform is comprised of five separate, function-specific components. They are:  Catalog: A database of registered developers and applications. Browser: the Decentralized Application Marketplace interface. Manager: an enhanced crypto wallet for managing subscriptions and payments. Signal: an anti-piracy subscription validator component. Storage: a storage integration framework for fast and easy remote content distribution.     Latest Translations: (한국어 |Français | Italiano | Português)       We introduce Spheris tokens (SPRS) as part of the Spheris solution. SPRS will be created once we deploy our smart contract on Ethereum blockchain. Spheris DAM is being built with the idea of creating a standardized currency for conducting software related business in a pseudo-frictionless market environment.  The total amount of SPRS created will be 2,000,000,000,000 (two trillion SPRS).  Why Two Trillion?  Convenience. Given that SPRS tokens are meant to be used as the currency for buying/selling software, we want software price representations in SPRS to be convenient for worldwide markets.  Scalability. Taking into account that the Spheris platform will continuously attract new users, SPRS market price will rise to the point of disrupting software prices which are traditionally tied to a fiat currency index, unless scalability is taken into account.  Greater Liquidity. Higher number of outstanding SPRS tokens can result in greater liquidity for the SPRS token stock. This will facilitate trading and will narrow the bid-ask spread.  SPRS Tokens Allocation    Spheris Crowdsale is LIVE!  Crowdsale SPRS token supply: 1,240,000,000,000 SPRS. Base rate: 1 ETH = 300,000 SPRS. Accepted currencies: Ether, Bitcoin.   Refund policy: the minimum contribution total required is 2,525 ETH. If minimum isn’t reached at the end of the crowdsale period, contributors will receive a refund. Unsold SPRS tokens will be distributed proportionally between crowdsale contributors.   Crowdsale duration: thirty days. Hard Cap: 10,000 ETH. SPRS tokens will be allocated right after your contribution to your ETH wallet. SPRS tokens will be frozen and will be sent to you at the end of the crowdsale.
