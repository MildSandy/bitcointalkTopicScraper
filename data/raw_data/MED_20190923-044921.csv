Since the very beginning of MediBloc project, our team has put our utmost effort into studying the blockchain technology as well as medical record system, and have concluded that building our own blockchain platform that is specifically designed for personal health record management was inevitable.  We had initially thought that building MediBloc platform as a Dapp using EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) will be most cost-efficient and most effective in securing scalability and trust as EVM is most widely used for smart contract development. We came to a conclusion, however, that MediBloc’s own blockchain platform will serve as a foundation for us to establish more efficient and solid security system of personal health records. We firmly believe having the complete control over blockchain core and MediBloc service will give us an ability to adapt and improve our product better and faster than any other projects according to market needs, where the market trends and the technology itself are ever-changing.

MediBloc team had decided to burn unsold tokens in order to solidify the foundation of our project and protect the interest of token sale participants. The exact amount of unsold MED token was 2,033,615,900 MED, roughly around 20% of total MED supply. As of 4pm January 20th, 2018 (Korea time), the unsold MED token has been BURNT as announced before.  There will be no return once we burn all remaining tokens, so the team at MediBloc was extra cautious in this process.  Total of 2,033,615,900 MED has been transferred to a Quantum Hex address equal to 0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 in two separate transactions. Transaction IDs for the two transactions are as follows.  Transaction 1: b620452ba17916f25532c1ef13953868b54c09f7b9762760a35c2a9552166d77 (10 MED transfer)  Transaction 2: 5ce5208dbf9532f73dbe54b3086cd97b47b759daf6f12861970069bad2414002 (2,033,615,890 MED transfer)  The status of Quantum Hex address 00…01 that holds all the burned MED token can be confirmed through Qtum Explorer.

Bounty distribution may be withheld at the discretion of the MediBloc. The most common circumstance would be due to the incomplete Bounty condition requirements. Additional Bounties can be rewarded to users who are particularly active during the MediBloc ICO campaign, in the case there are leftover MED from the Bounty pool.
