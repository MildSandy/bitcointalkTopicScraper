This is where Iris is a name to reckon with.  Iris is the Decentralized Electronic Healthcare Record. It is a digital healthcare ecosystem, built using the Blockchain technology.    The Iris Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) gives you back control of our healthcare data, and let US decide who, when and where it can be accessed.  The common problem as most people already knows that current electronic healthcare records don‚Äôt allow patient data to be shared between healthcare providers, which results in compromise of quality of care.    The Iris EHR stores data on the blockchain, facilitating universal access and a single true source of data. But that is not the only part here, thanks to the system that is built by Iris; it is going to help us get the right around our data as a patient. We will have absolute control over our healthcare data and option to earn from it through the Iris Data Marketplace.  Also, users will also be able to mine Iris Tokens by uploading personal healthcare data to their EHR database. Data is then anonymized, stored and made available for purchase (if we allow) on the Iris Data Marketplace. It will allow users to earn additional Iris Tokens from the sale of their data on the Iris Data Marketplace.    Now is our chance to be part of such revolutionary project that will allow many key principal agents to participate in the Iris Ecosystem, which will include Miners, Buyers, Public, Iris Operations, and Token Issuer.  So come and be part of the NEXT BIG THING in the world of Health with the Pre-Registration open!
