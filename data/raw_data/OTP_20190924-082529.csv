And yes, in this tread they are not active, but it doesn't mean that the project is scam or not active.  Well then kindly ask him to address to people's questions here. Not sure how things exactly works, but IMO, a project needs to attend to most of their channel as they can, without leaving one unattended, especially one that can be considered as a major ""meeting point"" and ""reference page"" for crypto community. i haven't a right to answer this your question, i'm not from their team.

If I remember correctly, there was a concept similar to yours one or two years ago. I can't remember if they were building an app or ""in set"" with their own coin, but the gist was they propose to build a system where someone can use crypto for a daily life micro transaction like buying coffee.  I remember that one of the main problem they encountered was the fact that both party needs to have the system. And although, from that project, I can see that it is quite easy to arrange a coffee owner and a coffee drinker (which mostly quite familiar with recent technologies) to adapt crypto payment, I find it hard to introduce this concept to... grocery sector, or bread and butter.  Do you have special strategy to penetrate this certain segment?",False
