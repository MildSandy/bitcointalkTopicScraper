Solid Asset with Liquidity [https://egold.trade]","Win-win mining: How EGD tokens holders can earn on verifying transactions Introducing Digital Gold Out of all the prized metals, gold has always been the most treasured as an investment opportunity. In the past, stakeholders used gold to diversify risks, especially those through the use of futures indentures. Its practical scarcity, compactness and great demand in the industry made it a highly preferred product. However, due to its paucity, investing in gold was not always practical. As technology reached new heights, people found a new way to transact gold i.e., converting it into a digital asset that can be operated globally — this is the very thing EGOLD project deals with. This digital gold asset — GOLD — is always backed by physical gold or exchange-traded funds (ETF) and its price equals one ounce of gold at any moment.  Gold & Graphene The daily circulation of the gold market is nearly $27 billion. The migration from traditional market to crypto will make gold trading faster and more transparent. With digital gold customers could now access, pass on and transfer gold effortlessly. To make the transactions still faster and cheaper, EGOLD deploys its own blockchain built on Graphene technology and scheduled for its launch in 2Q 2018.  There are many rationales behind the usage of Graphene technology by the company. It’s an open-source, offering a wide variety of tools required to bring the project to life. Furthermore, it sticks to the modern security standards and has a lot of global financial blockchain systems got on its base. As soon as EGOLD blockchain is launched, it will be used to operate GOLD digital assets — crypto gold. This can be used for speedy and secure transfers, as an investment tool and as an instrument for hedging risks.  Still, EGOLD is not only about GOLD, it also has EGD token used as the stake in EGOLD blockchain PoS (Proof-of-Stake), and it guarantees the miners rewards for verifying transactions with GOLD.  Verifying transactions and getting 75% of commissions EGD refers to the EGOLD tokens. The more EGD a person owns, the number of blocks he can validate and add to the chain. Miners may get about 75% of commission once the transactions are validated. The other 25% is allocated for charity and for EGOLD company development. Still, EGD tokens will enter the scene once EGOLD blockchain is set up — but the purchase of the future stakes will take place during ICO.  EGD tokens stand for EGD Pre-Launch tokens and will be emitted on Ethereum blockchain in a limited supply. 10 000 000 EGD is to be emitted and 7 000 000 tokens will be sold during the crowdsale which will happen on September, 20.  In Q2 2018 EGD tokens will be transferred as EGD for verifying transactions in GOLD. Once the user has more EGD tokens, they can get verify more transactions and get a larger bonus.  Physical gold is an age-old method of wealth preservation and EGOLD’s novel solution gives 100% gold-backed token. The launch of the EGOLD project will interrupt the gold market and bring a stable solution to the cryptocurrency market. The market is in the middle of a paradigm shift uphill on the road to a greater adoption and EGOLD’s progressive notion will endure attracting money into this new ecosystem.   https://egold.trade/win-win-mining-how-egd-tokens-holders-can-earn-on-verifying-transactions/",True
