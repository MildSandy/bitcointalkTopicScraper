We would like to finally break the important news about the expected PGC token exchange listing. We have received the reply from our legal team – as you know, Paygine ICO has been approved by the SEC under Regulation D, which means we have certain requirements to comply with. This is relevant in particular to the rule 144 (available here https://www.sec.gov/reportspubs/investor-publications/investorpubsrule144htm.html)  Here is a quote from the document: ...Before you may sell any restricted securities in the marketplace, you must hold them for a certain period of time. If the company that issued the securities is a “reporting company” in that it is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, then you must hold the securities for at least six months. If the issuer of the securities is not subject to the reporting requirements, then you must hold the securities for at least one year. The relevant holding period begins when the securities were bought and fully paid for. The holding period only applies to restricted securities. Because securities acquired in the public market are not restricted, there is no holding period for an affiliate who purchases securities of the issuer in the marketplace. But the resale of an affiliate's shares as control securities is subject to the other conditions of the rule...  Thus at this point in time we have no other choice but to wait exactly one year from the moment our token sale was concluded which is 17 August 2018 before we can list our token on an exchange. However, we would like you to know that we are exploring ways of making listing as quick as possible. We will keep you updated on the latest news!",False

We have completed our token sale and would like to thank each and every one of you for supporting our project! You must have certain questions for us that we would like to address.  First and foremost we want to make it clear that we don’t stop implementing our project, but instead plan to put as much effort as needed to launch the PAYGINE financial platform as fast as possible. Yes, we really didn’t manage to raise the planned amount within our token sale, but you may remember that our project is based on BEST2PAY – a real business and one of the leading payment systems. We are ready to fund the project through our own means!  The main question that we will take on in the coming days is the issue of getting PGC token listed on exchanges. We have already begun negotiating with three platforms and we are waiting for a confirmation from our legal team so you will get to hear the news about listing dates in the near future! Thus all our ICO participants will be able to put their tokens out on the secondary market or keep their PGC (a quick reminder that the tokens can be used to pay for services at discounts of up to 30%).  We are ready to answer all your questions on social media or over email at helpline@paygine.com   We would like to thank you for your support once more – together we will reach great heights and create a truly unique project!",False

To quote Businessinsider, less than half of all ICOs in 2017 (48% to be precise) were considered a success. And of the $5.6 billion raised, a quarter was collected by the few largest ICOs.  What about this year? According to Coinschedule in 2018, in total, 517 ICOs have raised over $11 M in just the first 6 months of the year. However, only 265 ICOs have managed to raise 50-100% of their planned hardcaps, whilst only as little as 18% reached their hardcaps. Once again, about $4.7 billion was collected by the 10 top projects, including Telegram, Petro, TaTaTu, etc.  With that in mind, 2018 promises to be a true year of the ICO. With competition going strong, one can call 2017 the year of the ICO. Lots of projects failed to reach their targets during their tokensales. Be it a weak whitepaper, poor marketing, lack of trust from the investment community, non-existent token value, or a combination of all of these factors.  It's time to forget about the ""homemade"" ICOs of 2016 and 2017. Developing an MVP is key to an ICO's success in 2018.  PAYGINE is founded on a real business!

The very idea of confidentiality these days seems closely related to cryptocurrencies, however, this is not entirely correct.  Confidentiality, in simple terms, can be divided into two things – anonymity and untraceability. Anonymity means it is impossible to establish the user's identity while untraceability makes his actions impossible to be traced back to him.  When it comes to confidentiality in cryptocurrencies, most of them have the ability to provide anonymity, however easy it is to lose it. Untraceability, on the other hand, is not fully achieved as through analyzing transaction logs a researcher can identify certain users if anonymity of at least one of the involved addresses has been compromised. There is a number of methods used to achieve confidentiality in cryptocurrency space.  ·       CoinJoin – method of bundling transactions to obfuscate the source of the coins in transaction  ·       Chaumian CoinJoin – method of obfuscating the transaction log by using a central operator and blind signatures  ·       CoinShuffle – method of obfuscating transaction logs without a central operator using end-to-end encryption  ·       Confidential Transactions – method fully hiding the actual amounts, both incoming and outgoing, from third parties  ·       Ring Confidential Transactions – method utilizing ring signatures to obfuscate the source of the coins in transaction  ·       Stealth Addresses – method of calculating addresses to receive coins in a confidential manner  Every method listed above has its pros and cons that can only be truly evaluated in practice.",False

Why? Because we understand that potential participants of our project don’t like the current market rates and the fact that PGC is pegged to the US dollar further makes investing during a bear market an unprofitable deal.  HOWEVER! We are sure that the future belongs to cryptocurrencies and we are sure that in the near future they will continue growing. This is why we have decided to set the rates of the coins we accept (Ethereum and Bitcoin) at these heart-warming levels. Starting today and until cryptocurrency prices go over the level we have set for our ICO, 1 ETH = $700 and 1 BTC = $10000.  What does this mean?  This means that when you purchase 1 ETH worth of tokens you get 700 PGC without the weekly bonus or the purchase amount bonuses and referral bonuses.

The decision was made on March 14, 2018 and then crypto-currencies reacted to it with a small drop in their rates-bitcoin fell by 3%, Ether by 4%, the rest of the crypto – currencies by 2-7%.  Google and Facebook acted as one of the main platforms for advertising of crypto companies and blockchain startups. Therefore, the ban on advertising on these sites will make significant changes in the marketing policy of these companies and, most likely, will lead to an increase in its budget. In addition, first of all, all kinds of fraudulent projects and projects that are at the stage of active promotion will suffer from the prohibition of ICO advertising.  By the way, ICO organizers and their marketing specialists can bypass the prohibitions of Google and Facebook. All they need to do is to exclude keywords that are banned from their advertising texts. At the same time, crypto-enthusiasts are confident that over time the giants Google and Facebook will remove the ban on ICO advertising for crypto companies that are in the legal field.

Moreover, most of the major banks of the world still use in their practice the systems introduced in the 1960-1970s.

Thus, most of the financial resources of the companies did not go to the development and implementation of innovations but to the maintenance of these obsolete systems.

The event was large-scale and gathered the most active participants and leading companies in the industry. More than 100 companies, about 70 crypto industry experts, a rich business program and discussion of topical issues of the market. Within the framework of presentations many interesting topics for discussion appeared, including, for example, the question of importance of the blockchain or bitcoin? Stepan Gershuni made a report in which he once again spoke about the advantages of the first cryptocurrency, and also showed why bitcoin is still relevant despite the ups and downs of the rates. We talked a lot about the future of the blockchain industry and what will be the future for both individual miners and large companies in the next 5-10 years, discussed derivatives in the crypto-currency market, security problems, regulation and exchange trading. An interesting report was made by Alexander Smirnov, a head of the Department of control and audit of LH-Crypto, who spoke about the difference of crypto-broker and cryptocurrency exchanges and what benefits brokers have. At Blockchain Russian Week LH-Crypto company presented a beta version of the crypto-broker, which is now launching (the ICO of the project was successfully completed in February 2018). Among the participants there were many mining companies that actively promoted the idea of mobile mining – two miners were installed before the entrance to SKOLKOVO, although they did not cause much enthusiasm among the guests of the event – mining is becoming less popular and profitable today, given the decline in rates and increase in cost. But the projects implemented in the financial sector and promoting the integration of cryptocurrencies into our daily lives enjoyed special attention. So, the project Paygine – open financial blockchain platform designed specifically for FINTECH and crypto – business, based on a real successful business-Best2Pay also presented their project within the framework of the event. – We received good feedback, talked with market experts, discussed with them the prospects for the development of the digital economy and cryptocurrency and the possibility of using blockchain technologies in everyday life. We have once again made sure that the problem solved by Paygine project is very relevant, and 70% of visitors who came to our stand, specified the date of the start of our service and noted that they would like to become Paygine customers, - said the project team. In total, Blockchain Russian Week lasted for 5 days-during this time, participants managed to immerse themselves in all the subtleties of the industry, as well as in an informal atmosphere to discuss all the issues with professionals. Conducted training seminars and master classes for beginners in the sphere of cryptocurrency and workshops on specific topics: smart contracts, crypto-currency arbitrage, a detailed explanation of the work of TOP 20 world's cryptocurrency. A hackathon for young developers was also organized, where dozens of talented developers in the field of blockchain fought for the recognition of the blockchain community and a significant cash prize. At the end of the week, the participants of the event came to the conclusion that cryptocurrencies are a ""unique economic and technological tool"", and the community should understand this as soon as possible in order to make the right decisions further. In turn, Russia should study international practice of their application in order to be able to develop in this direction.",False

The cryptocurrency market today is a multi-billion dollar business so it is simply impossible to ignore its existence. All highly developed countries of the world are actively working on the legal framework for the use of cryptocurrencies. However, today there is still a serious problem that prevents the cryptocurrency from reaching a new level-the banking sector.  Cryptocurrencies are a high – risk zone for banks, so they do not want to work with it and refuse to open cryptocurrency accounts, block them or set unreasonable limits and restrictions on cryptocurrency transactions.  Ø How will Paygine project be able to remove obstacles to the use of cryptocurrencies in everyday life?  Today full use of cryptocurrency can only be in the framework of the cryptocurrency exchanges – here you can buy, sell, or exchange for others. But in order to use cryptocurrencies more widely, financial institutions – banks should work with them. Since simply obtaining a financial license or building relationships with existing classical banks will not be able to fully solve this problem, for the introduction of cryptocurrencies in the banking sector under Paygine project it was decided to acquire ownership of two banks in comfortable cryptocurrency jurisdictions – in the European and Caribbean regions.

A: Yes, they may be revised and adjusted, but not dramatically. If we reach the hard cap, we buy three banks — in the Caribbean, Europe, and obtain an MTL in the USA. In case of the minimum scenario, we will partner with banks and purchase or create not a bank but a financial institution (e-money institution or PSP(UK)), which is way cheaper than buying/creating a bank.
