MVP in development.,"Thank you! In July we successfully completed the first stage of the MVP development and now we are ready to tell you a little about it!  So, what does it all mean and how far did it take us down our road to a more transparent and efficient gaming world?  This time we were focused on the infrastructure creation for our end users. It was a complicated task, as our solution caters to all kinds of iGaming industry operators, both on-line and land-based, who provide all kinds of games with their own specific rules and features.  We can now report that a big part of the infrastructure has been created, including that of personal cabinets (user accounts) which allows us to register and authorize new users within the system. These users can start using it right away.  The user can now purchase SPX tokens, deposit them and realize transactions. Remember the question, “how are the tokens to be used?”. For casinos and other iGaming providers they are the currency which will be used to address the random numbers generator (RNG), buy a a subscription or purchase other system services. The value of the token will be recognized as it is used in numerous transactions and provides access to pure randomness and transparency.  The current development stage allows users to access the API with its basic interface. A universal solution for all kinds of games is provided – as we mentioned earlier, the Sp8de protocol doesn’t need to know the rules of the game except those that are most common to the game (number of possible outcomes); therefore, it can be widely applied to a large array of different gaming products. It’s an additional proof of fairness – Sp8de protocol cannot have any impact on the process except that for which it is designed, so it provides equally fair and transparent conditions to both the casino and the player.  As the system evolves, there will be more opportunities provided for both casinos and players. The next big update will be available in late July and then we actually will show you some of the system on the interface level. As the MVP development goes on, the system will become more and more sophisticated providing not only incredible speed and total transparency but also security and opportunity to create totally new users experience – again, in July we will tell you about some amazing features which are not present in the market yet and are waiting for the right minute to be “unlocked”!",False

The previous stage was mostly dedicated to the infrastructure creation for the end users. A big part of the infrastructure, which allowed for the creation of personal cabinets (user accounts), purchases, token deposits, and the ability to execute transactions and to access the basic API, was developed in the previous stage.  Within the current stage the basic protocol development went further to provide the verified randomness and ease of integration. There were significant changes made to: •   The modules of integration; •   Randomness generation; •   Operations history (storage module).  New members joined development team, and their expertise in UX/UI helps us to create easy to use, smooth interfaces. Technical sophistication now meets simplicity and comfort, and much of their time was dedicated to further development of users’ infrastructure and security systems.  There also was significant progress made with regards to the clients library development, in August these works are expected to be 100% completed, which means that the system now can be efficiently integrated with both the on-line and land-based gaming providers back-end.  That was a great step for us, but even more important things are yet to come! As all of these core elements are executed, we will be able to finalize the core systems and start building the testing environment throughout the next stage. Shortly, within the next month, we will be developing the demo web-site showcasing how our system works, and of course this web-site will contain demo-games!  After that - the crucial stage of fine-tuning and debugging, warming up the engine, and checking everything one last time, and… and then everything is ready for us to play!",False

MVP in development.,"   Gentlemen,  this is not precisely correct. I would even say it is outright wrong. The jackpots work as follows:  1. In essence, it is an airdrop of tokens, however, with major modifications. 2. Every token sold during the previous sale rounds has a chance of winning a jackpot. 3. Jackpots are large lots of SPX tokens that will be granted to a lucky guy, the owner of the token that will be chosen as a winner. So, any winner will get the entire lot. In other words, there will be only 10 wallets (or less) who will win 28,888,888 SPX token jackpots during the first jackpot round. 4. Jackpot tokens do not participate in the subsequent jackpots, so winning a jackpot does not increase one's chances of winning another one. 5. Round I jackpot tokens will be frozen for the period of 9 months (+1 month for every next jackpot round (10 months for round II, 11 months for round III) and +3 months for the jackpot round IV (14 months)). This is done to avoid the chance of a couple of folks collapsing the price of SPX on the day of the exchange listing. 6. An important aspect of the jackpot campaign is the presence of jackpot factors attached to every token. This makes the game much more interesting and allows anyone to actually influence one's odds to win the jackpot. These factors work in the following way:    a. The factor is the probability multiplier. Without these factors, every token would have a probability 1/n of winning a jackpot, where n is the total number of tokens. With factors, the formula changes to Factor(j)/(Factor(i)%*%n(i)), where j is the factor of a token, i is the group of tokens, n - the number of tokens in the group. Every group is defined as having some factor that every token within this group holds and a number of tokens that belong to this group. For example, there are 84,942,511 SPX tokens with factor 88,8 that have been distributed during the pre-sale round. Such tokens are unique and will never appear in the subsequent sale rounds. A token with 88,8 factor is 4,93 times more likely to win a jackpot than a token with factor 18.    b. The total probability of you winning the jackpot is calculated as follows: (Factor(j)%*%n(j))/(Factor(i)%*%n(i)) where j is a group id of tokens that you hold, n - the number within each group. So, simple weighted probability. Of course, these numbers are different for every sale and jackpot round depending on how many tokens remain in the pools.    c. The factors are decreasing within every sale round as the tokens are being bought out. They also decrease between the sale rounds: tokens in round II do not hold as powerful factors as those in the round I. 7. Finally, note, that those who participate in the SP8DE public sale earlier, participate in more jackpot rounds than those who decide to step in later on. Every sale round is followed by one jackpot round, so those who buy SPX during the second sale round do not participate in the first jackpot.",False

MVP in development.,"   First off, agreed, decentralization is the new Big idea that will change the entire societal structure. That's why we do what we do.  Regarding the cost - it depends on when you enter our sale. Obviously, the earlier - the better: e.g. you get 98,888 SPX per 1 ETH if you enter on the pre-sale phase, 88,888 - during the sale I phase, etc (you can check the graphs above - it's explained in detail). The general utility you get by participating earlier is actually even higher than just the classic 'early bird discount'. The odds per token of winning a jackpot are higher the earlier you participate. Also, you will participate in more jackpot rounds the earlier you enter the token sale.  Regarding what we are trying to raise - we have a softcap of 3,000,000 USD: this is the bare minimum we need to make the entire project operational on time and packed with the desired features. If we don't raise this, we send back all the crypto we have received and work more on the project before launching another public sale.  But, even as of now, the likelihood of this happening doesn't seem significant.",False

Their technology is extremely sophisticated and quite new and many features that are unique to it and are also essential for bringing SP8DE live are still not released. Our target is to develop the beta by July-August,2018.  We believe that speed of release should not be favored over the quality of the product: we respect our community and want to always beat the expectations.  The main benefits for the token holders are the following: 1. Be entitled to a part of the fees (we are POS-based); 2. The price appreciation is obviously the major factor: we opt for the deflationary model with capped supply, so assuming SP8DE gains in popularity and user base, the price of SPX will steadily increase; 3. Get the chance to win the jackpots: this is also a major motivator. Our ICO is designed to include random airdrops of large chunks of tokens, which we call jackpots and only the holders of SPX are allowed to participate. 4. Participate in the voting for the best DAPPS; 5. Many other features that are currently being designed and developed and are yet not disclosed to the public. Can't say much about these: can only say that we have many ideas are working hard on making the best of them come true as soon as possible.",False

MVP in development.,"   We opt to be regulated as a gambling institution. There has been uncertainty regarding this aspect as formally we are not hosting or developing any e-gaming applications on our own, we simply provide a toolbox, a platform that is capable of injecting unbiased distributed entropy at arbitrary frequencies for the purposes of developing and deploying distributed applications. In fact, Sp8de goes far beyond casino applications; gambling is simply the most obvious use-case.  In light of this, we have had an uneasy choice between not getting licensed having to argue every time why we do not need the license to operate and going through the nightmare of acquiring the licensed casino status without an actual need to do so. So, finally, answering your question: yes, we are going to be regulated. We will offer all the gambling applications developed on our blockchain a choice to pass our audit and get the 'licensed' status. This choice is completely voluntary.  Yet, the prosses of acquiring these licenses is long and tedious, so it is still on our roadmap. We plan to accomplish this by the time we release our platform at least in Gibraltar. Others will follow shortly afterward.",False

Spade is designed to suit the purposes of all the actors comprising the online casino landscape and as such represents the new breed of digital institutions, a distributed intermediary.   site - https://sp8de.com White Paper - https://sp8de.com/sp8de_white_paper.pdf Short Paper - https://sp8de.com/short_paper.pdf Fast Deck -  https://sp8de.com/fast_deck.pdf  Distribution The entire token distribution will be 8,888,888,888 SPX of which 3,655,555,558.4 (41.125%) will be in the form of token sale and 3,455,555,552 (38.875%) will be given as a jackpot to those who have participated in the “token sale” rounds.  The rest of the tokens 1,777,777,778 (20%) will remain with the team. Tokens that remain with the team and the Sp8de Foundation might be locked for a period of one year after the ICO. The SPX ERC-20 token will be distributed to all participants in the ICO after the end of the ICO itself.  Pre ICO Tokens will be called DSPX (for regulation reasons) ICO Tokens will be called SPX. After the Tokens will fully distributed all DSPX Tokens will become SPX  Cap A soft cap of US$4,000,000 (four million) is set and the hard cap is 49,033 ETH.  Timeframe & Schedule The token distribution begins on Monday, January 08, 2018 and ends on Sunday, March 11, 2018 and is scheduled as in the manner illustrated in Table 4 below. The Pre-Sale lasts for 24 days while each Sale phase will be seven days followed by a Jackpot that is distributed entirely within a single day after every Sale.    Sale Stages & Jackpots The token distribution will be made in accordance with the following exchange rate of SPX for 1 ETH:   In addition, airdrops in the forms of jackpots will be done as follows. (for detailed description see white paper.      Those participating in the earlier jackpot rounds have small chance of winning large lot, while those participating later on have larger chance of winning, but are rewarded with smaller lots. In addition, earlier contributors participate in more jackpot rounds: e.g. sale I investors try their luck four times, while those entering at sale III can only participate in two jackpots. This shouldn’t discourage late participation: the largest combined pool of prize tokens is played during the fourth jackpot round. For every lot we run a procedure which randomly selects one token out of those already issued. The holder of this token becomes the winner of the lot. Each token being sold has a specific factor attached to it, the jackpot factor. The likelihood to win a lot is proportional to this factor. Mind, that jackpot factors are ordered: even within one sale round, earlier contribution is rewarded with more ‘powerful’ tokens. The distribution of these factors for every round is shown in the table below.    Tokens Not Sold The proceeds of the token sales as well as the tokens that remain in possession of the team will be used to promote and develop the project as outlined in the Road Map section of this paper. In the figure below, we show how the proceeds will be utilized. When needed the tokens allocated to the Spade Foundation and the team might be used for further promotion and as part of an incentives scheme.     THE BOUNTIES WILL BE ADDED SOON HERE",False
