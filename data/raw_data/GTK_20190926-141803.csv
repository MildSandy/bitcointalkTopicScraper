Join now [LIVE],"THE SMART TOKENIZATION BLOCKCHAIN WEB - FACEBOOK - TWITTER - LinkedIn - Telegram - MEDIUM  The Money By Design blockchain is a monetary software that allows the creation of tokens able to finance economic, social and politic activities.  The  blockchain  and  the  institutions  (public,  private  and  social)  belong  to  two  worlds  that everything opposes.  The institutions blame the blockchain for: -its lack of transparency, -its lack of control, -its unstructured environment,  and blockchain blames institutions for: -their highly centralized aspect, -their slowness, -their lack of intelligence and social dimension.  Money By Design wants to gather them by building on best of both worlds.  OUR CORE IS TO BRING THE POWER OF BLOCKCHAIN TO INSTITUTIONS.  1. WHAT IS THE MAIN ISSUE? When it comes to finance an activity, you can: -invest the profit coming from your sales but charity and social organizations are note involved -look for fundraising but you have to accept to share your power -ask for a credit and increase your debt with interests -call for a crowdfunding but with limited ambition  2. WHAT IS OUR SOLUTION?  Our aim is to create THE 1ST BLOCKCHAIN DEDICATED TO SMART TOKENIZATION.   Money by Design develops a solution absolutely necessary for institutions and businesses. It  allows to  safely  measure  and  represent  the  value  of  any  material  or  immaterial  asset  that  will make  possible  their  monetization.  Therefore,  we  provide  those  organizations  a  new  means  of financing: -Government crypto-bond emissions -Cultural heritage refurbishment funding -Charity funding (turning donation to investment) -Monetization of state immaterial assets -Voting system    «Gutenberg  gave  the  capability  to  print  books.  BC  gives  the  capability  to  print  tokens.  Smart tokenization will be the emergence of an infinity of economic thinkings and use.»  3. HOW DOES IT WORK? Smart  tokenization  is  made  possible  through  the  strength  of  our  token  and  the  reliability  of  our architecture.               A. WHAT ABOUT THE TOKEN To make a comparison, our token is to currency what the smartphone is to rotary dial phone. The rotary  dial  phone  was  only  used  for  calling  (receiving  and  transmitting  calls)  while  you  can  do almost anything with a smartphone with all the features and applications inside. It  is  exactly  the  same  with  GeoToken  (GTK)  that  integrates  7  different  features,  far  beyond  the payment function.  THE SMART TOKENIZATION BLOCKCHAIN  > 3 of these features are dedicated to consumer and allow everyone: -to save money  by  managing  his  wallet  as  a  multi-support  fund  composed  of  sovereign currencies and cryptocurrencies in unlimited number -to consume using the token as a means of payment multi-support (smartphone, IoT, debit card) -to  vote and  participate  in  community  decisions  by  giving  tokens  a  governance  function  not found in the blockchain yet  > The other 4 features are said to be expert and B2B oriented: -to measure in order to apprehend some markets on different scales and secure wallets -to produce by the authentication and valuation of assets in order to monetize them -to market through new models of network exchanges and investments -to monitor in order to frame and rule all social and economic relations             B. WHAT ABOUT THE TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE? The technical architecture is a hybrid structure between public BC (highly distributed and out of control)   and   classic digital   world   (centralized   and   regulated). This decentralized structure guarantees authority nodes the possibility of exercising control over the activity of the blocks and a regulatory power that  will  allow  institutions  to  uphold  certain  rules  of  compliance  and transparency they require. It prevents from money laundering and fraud. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, we introduce an «amend» function which gives the system the ability to correct itself via the action of the higher nodes. Moreover,  this Proof  of  Authority  does  not  use classical  mining (highly  expensive)  and  enables the use of less energy.             C. AND THE TOKEN VALUATION? From  its  business  model  point  of  view,  MbD  is  also  outstanding  in  the  valuation  of  its  token, completely  disruptive  compared  to  extreme  and  speculative  behaviors,  but  in  accordance  with the expectations of real investors, institutions and users. The valuation of the GTK is based on:            •its economic value, based on the value of its technological assets and user benefits            •its social  value, based  on  the  growth  of  users  and  resulting  from  the  Metcalfe  formula. The more users, the higher the value. The   combination   of   these   2   values   enables   the   token   to   refer   its   price   on   a   tangible computation formula that offers exponential and secured investments.    THEREFORE, GTK IS THE 1ST AUGMENTED DYNAMIC CURRENCY.  Our goal are: -to create an infrastructure that will enable the smart tokenization of the economy -to make available the completeness of the features of the currency -to create a bridge between the world of institutional finance and the world of Blockchain -to reduce the burden of blockchain on environment  MONEY BY DESIGN TURNS BLOCKCHAIN INTO HUMAN PROGRESS.
