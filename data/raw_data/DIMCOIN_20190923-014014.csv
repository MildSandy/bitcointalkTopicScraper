The price of Dimcoin does not seem to be going up any time soon because of the failure of its team to fulfil its ICO  The ICO ended in August 2017 and two years they made over $14 million from the ICO but they have failed in doing anything of substance.  In May 2018 the market capital of Dimcoin was over $24 million but today it is less that $670,000 with a 24 hour trading volume of just $515  These links provide the information needed to show Dimcoin has been a monumental failure:  https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dimcoin/  https://icodrops.com/dimcoin/",True

People who think they can bully others to obey their command and play along with their games until they get it as they want regardless of the cost of others. You thought you could sell tokens at the price of 2,5$ but did not see that it was an escrow service that required a buyer. I agree with you that DIM didn't communicate well and the whole thing was a mess, but what you are doing at the moment does not make any sense. DIM didn't scam you, why should they? For what benefit? And for such a small amount of money as your tokens are worth? come on... Use your head. I do not make any sense that DIM should scam you for such a low amount when they have millions from a ICO.. As for the very last comment from my side - you have your tokens back and you didn't lose anything. The only thing you end of losing now is your self-respect and the respect from others.",True

Its supposed at December its fully working and hasnt been implemented phase 2?  I hope soon will be launch. Sometimes it's very hard to raise a discussion with investors like you -- always negative. The team is doing a very good job in keeping us the community informed and I am more than happy with the progress they have made so far. HYBSE will be launched and the team should take their time implementing the best exchange ever - free of flaws.  Quote from: Dr Charles on October 23, 2018, 10:49:19 PM  I'd rather see a delay on a product launch over a prematurely launched  one. A sour launch can not only ruin the project/brand, it will cause even more turmoil in the community. Not to mention damage to the price per token.  Things like this cant be built overnight and launched right away. If they are... most likely the project was a money grab or constructed by novices.  Imagine an exchange launching that has not been hardened or thoroughly tested for bugs... it goes live and we all deposit our coins. Shit hits the fan and something goes wrong. At that point we will not only wait for more updates but our money will be locked up too. Not saying that an early launch means failure but better safe than sorry in my opinion. My point exactly - HYBSE will eventually go big never mind all the tough experiences we have had previously - it's real life and this kind of things always happen and doesn't mean the project failed - instead it gives the team more time to refine the project hence we are already running tests as the community.",True

But mostly those exchanges listing coins for free are just some minor ones who try to attract new users. That's why  just a few people are voting for them  because they would need to sign up for the exchange just for voting. Therefore I think we should go with the free listing if possible but not pay for some unknown exchanges,True

It's funny that I came across a comment that was written by you, what an amateur input, who still writes that. Why do you always want to be the negative individual around this community? Some time back, you wrote this: Quote from: therealwafdawg on February 26, 2018, 02:46:42 PM Just unloaded 10,379 Dim tokens and it feels great!  My question is why are you still here in June spreading FUD whereas you have sold all your tokens in February, and it felt great, its funny to see that individuals like you still exist in this planet. I mean, selling your tokens was totally up to you, you made the final decision. My other question is, what are you trying to archive? Convince us into selling our tokens as well? Okay, let me quickly answer that, that's what you won't get, I for one and I know it goes for others as well, are in this project for the long run, not trying make ""quick profit"" but instead ""real profit"". I hope the feeling you got when you unloaded your tokens remains the same forever.  Some of the things that you might be missing or failing to think about includes understanding that the DIM is a complete ecosystem, it will take sometimes until everything is up and running, rather take all the time building the best project than rushing to deliver a project that is full of flaws, the fact that the product will be delivered to us for use make us calm and it's actually what matters the most. In one of your previous comments, you mentioned that you were one of the early investors during the pre-ICO, but I don't why I keep getting the impression that you didn't read the whitepaper and understood what the project is all about, but instead, you just jumped in only because ""Clif"" said ""it's a keeper"", even if you did read it by yourself, I think you didn't understand it hence you just rushing some overnight profit.  The DIM-E comprises of too many projects which should all be up and running before we can actually consider the ecosystem to be fully functional, the DIM has too many projects lined-up within the ecosystem even the ones we have never heard anything about. Read the recent updates from the team, the one thing I don't like is ""FUDDERS"" and only because they are too lazy to read, even something that is in front of their eyes.  Here are some of the things you need to work on so that you can become a better investor: Read a lot Think outside the box Stop being ignorant Stop being pessimistic",True

Yes, you can buy DIMTOKENS here: https://nemchange.com  The ask price atm is 6.29 XEM per DIMTOKEN and the bid is 4.25 XEM per DIMTOKEN  You can alway put in a offer lower than the ask price, and see if anybody fills you How many Dimtoken were distributed in total?  I think there might as well be some kind of calculator created when the first figures of revenue come in. Might be really interesting to see. I think the Dimtoken are quite undervalued right now The total supply if Dim Token is only 10 million. I think it's not a bad idea to buy them now between 4.25 and 6.29XEM before the platform is released. Well, it's a very cheap price.

Most of the things might have been delayed but that doesn't automatically imply that HYBSE will be delayed as well, the team is working very hard to make this ecosystem a success.

Those that are looking for a quick payout, thus nothing is more important that getting on top exchanges and driving up market cap to cash out at a hefty gain. 3. Those that got in knowing it's going to be a long term endeavor but also believe you've got to get the recognition out there first for it to be a long term endeavor. These are the investors that are looking at a long term gain, plus a short term gain.  I believe we can satisfy all 3 groups of investors. The key is to satisfy the 3rd group, to take that approach.

Since you are a bit left behind, let me start with the recent updates that the team have been working on. First of all, they recently recruited promoters from all over to spread the word about The DIM Ecosystem, ambassadors will be announced soon, then again, more exchanges were announced after the HitBTC listing(and my personal opinion is that, HitBTC is decent exchange and we are all aware of it, I have used it several times without experiencing any complications), the dimexplorer.io block explorer and forum.dim.foundation were developed and are currently functional, the new CTO was announced with more than 25 years of experience within the Telecommunication sector,  the development bounty was published to the public, the open source GitHub repository, and very recent, the office video was published, which was what every investor expected from the team.  Regarding the wallet, what is bad about it? I have used it for months now without any complications as well, the UI and UX is way more than I expected and I personally think that the team did a great job compared to the previous version. Stop spreading FUD only because you sold your DIMCOIN and DIM TOKENS, we didn't sell ours, we are still holding and we still believe in the team. I assume that most investors you are watching this thread, who are still holding their coins and still believing in the team won't tolerate this kind of input, rather just keep quite if you don't have anything to post.

Second, all debit cards issuers for blockchain has problems after visa closed the issuers. DIM i working on finding the best solution. That is true, too many coins are listed on bigger exchanges but the are not increasing in value, a good example is dogecoin, listed on more than 100 exchanges, this includes the big, medium and small sized exchanges, and been around for more than 5years but not going anywhere in value. Listing in big exchanges doesn't mean that the value will increase. By the way, I don't mean that dogecoin is a badcoin. Lol. That's a very good example, the value hardly goes up. I remember I invested some time back and ended up dumping it. However, it has a great community behind and can be considered popular in some cases. Some of the factors influencing the value to increase is just simple economics, supply and demand not big or lots of exchange, however, sometimes listing on more exchange might drive the demand higher. In this case, we just need to be patient, DIM will list on more exchanges soon, official announcements were made in the past weeks.

That is true, sometimes we like prentending/acting like newbie whereas we have been in the crypto universe for some time, whenever the value goes down we start making noise like it's something new, whereas it's normal, and we are aware that the value's will definitely recover. Almost all currencies are experiencing a decline and the same will go for DIM, that's a fact, when they all recover, DIM will also recover.

Good coins can get pumped and dumped too so I won't jump to conclusions  But is that why you invested? I invested because of the opportunities in the future. This will first play out I the end of 2018.  the problem is most don't want to have a loss in the investment even if its temporary That is true but sometimes we need to be patient in order for us to make massive profits, cryptocurrencies investments are volatile which in this regard can be considered high risk. Usually, patient investors harvest so much, unlike panic sellers who tend to regret at a later stage and end up deciding to buy back in at a higher price. I personally made too many investment mistake and I usually try to learn from them so that I don't make the same mistakes again.

Did you see their was done working like way""Road map / Whitepaper""?. Im either of investor looking for good move not really to talking about increase of price. I think that the team is currently doing a very great job, they recently announced exchange after exchange and hopefully this trend will continue. The communication has improved more than 100% this include regular updates and news releases, launching of their DIM Foundation forum and the explorer and more.  The team is doing a good job and as an investor, I am totally impressed. I think they are unprofessional, why? I do not think I should give them an applouse what they did, but getting out of the plan is a bad one, building up without a plan. build without a good foundation, will end up worse. Lemme see what will be happend on future. I don't see anything unprofessional with the team, I think they are doing a great job compared to most ICOs which recently launched, rome wasn't built in one day, so you need to understand that building an ecosystem is not a child's play, it will take some time until everything runs smoothly, and the team is doing a good job in making the ecosystem a success, although it might take some time, but we will get there. We shouldn't judge but instead we should be supportive for the sake of our investments.  Quote from: vinicdemorais on March 12, 2018, 02:25:49 PM Dimpay status update? HYBSE status update?

I bought on day 1 of the sale and bought more subsequently.  Went off of Clif High's report and their whitepaper, which is in fact, excellent, however it's all theoretical since they haven't accomplished a single thing. Even the wallet is sub par. Also of note is the opportunity cost to buy Dimcoin.  BTC was around $3K when i first sunk funds into Dimcoin. Opportunity loss should not be overlooked. The telegram chat comment speaks to the lack of enthusiasm and community around the project.

I am one of the investors of DIMCOIN and DIMTOKEN. I am a long-term investor. But I can also understand the people who are complaining. The first round of the ICO has finished before 8 months ago and team cant follows the roadmap. There is a lack of communication with the investors. In additiın Second ICO (DIMPAY) is just their greed. The timing was very very bad.   I wouldn't say the DIMPAY ICO was launched out of greed, it was mentioned in the whitepaper that there are several components that make up the Ecosystem, this includes HYBSE, Wise, DEPOTWALLET, DIMPAY and others. Are you going to say the same thing when they launch the HYBSE ICO? I personally think they are trying to build up their Ecosystem and ensure that it's functional. The Ecosystem won't be functional without the above mentioned organisations, correct me if I am wrong.  Just to fill you in regarding their communications, they had weekly AMA's with the Head of Communications and the community asked questions during the sessions, however, it was recently cancelled and from now on they will be weekly updates from the team, I read on telegram.   Yea I know DIMPAY ICO was mentioned in the whitepaper and is necessary for the ecosystem and also a third ICO (HYBSE ICO) is coming. My object is to ""the timing"" and of course, you are right HYBSE, DEPOTWALLET and DIMPAY are the components of the DIM ecosystem. We are all in the same boat here. I am one of the investors, I believe this project I like the idea and even there are some delays I also believe the team.    Oh my god ?! A third ICO ? Don't you guys think it may be a little bit too much ? The team is really and I feel like they are taking us for idiots. Why would they need a third ICO, they need to focus on building their platform instead of asking for more money seriously. They already raised a lot of money it should be more than enough to succeed. And honestly I don't think anyone will invest in their third ICO. It's more like you haven't read and understood all the documents provided by the organisation, HYBSE is being integrated into blockchain. Please re-read the documents.  Quote from: vinicdemorais on February 21, 2018, 05:27:25 PM My friend, please! It will not have more ICOs, only Dimpay, and it was mentioned in the whitpaper.  Dimcoin will go to the moon soon.

That's true, and there is a say that 'patience isn't just ability of waiting but how you behave while waiting', most investors tend to sell for a loss since they lack patience abilities. The coin recently got listed and here we are expecting the $10 mark this soon, it's still very earlier adding to the fact that some components of the ecosystem are not yet functional.

In additiın Second ICO (DIMPAY) is just their greed. The timing was very very bad. I wouldn't say the DIMPAY ICO was launched out of greed, it was mentioned in the whitepaper that there are several components that make up the Ecosystem, this includes HYBSE, Wise, DEPOTWALLET, DIMPAY and others. Are you going to say the same thing when they launch the HYBSE ICO? I personally think they are trying to build up their Ecosystem and ensure that it's functional. The Ecosystem won't be functional without the above mentioned organisations, correct me if I am wrong.

This looks like some good momentum for DIMCOIN!  Recently, on December 8 2017, the French government announced its plans to allow unlisted securities to be traded on distributed blockchain ledgers. Since Brexit, the French government has made a number of new changes to facilitate Paris in becoming more important for financial innovation, which have included payroll tax cuts to labor reforms, and more. Now, the Prime Minister is allowing French banks and fintech companies to list their securities on an online exchange underpinned by blockchain technology. The concept allows securities — such as stocks, EFTs, and commodities, to be traded peer to peer without middle men like brokers and custodians. However, currently listed securities on financial exchanges will be ineligible and still be required to go through custodians and clearing houses.  So how will this exactly happen? And when will this happen? The advantages are monuments for global trading. Currently, no blockchain platform exists to implement this concept. However, the DIM Ecosystem seems to align perfectly with the French Prime minister’s recent news. The DIM Ecosystem is already in motion and under development.  The DIM Ecosystem is a Perfect Match  The DIM Ecosystem is a multifaceted project which initially launched its ICO in July 2017. The ICO raised over 14 million USD. The paramount of the ecosystem is the Hybrid Stock Exchange (HYBSE). As outlined in the whitepaper nearly six months prior to France’s recent announcement, the HYBSE will allow small and medium sized companies to trade securities on the NEM blockchain platform — from anywhere in the world, to anywhere in the world — instantly, with much lower fees. Other facets of the project include DEPOTWALLET, which will enable the storage of various cryptocurrencies as well as fiat currencies and the payment solution DIMPAY which will be a mobile wallet allowing the storage and usage of currencies anywhere in the world.  DIMCOIN is based on the NEM blockchain which is already a well known and well functioning platform. Additionally NEM and Trezor announced that NEM will be integrated into the Trezor hardware wallet platform with the next firmware update. This means you can secure your assets on the NEM blockchain (including those from DIMCOIN) on the Trezor hardware wallet.  DIM is very strict on being legally complaint and they are going through the necessary paperwork needed for the launch of HYBSE in mid 2018. As of now, 10+ companies are confirmed to be listed on the HYBSE at launch and the number will continue to climb. At this moment, due to legal obligations, the DIM Foundation cannot reveal which companies will be listed. The recent news would allow French companies to easily list on the HYBSE with a lot of the red tape being already cut with this announcement.  Both DIM and France’s visions of an online exchange to trade securities seems to align perfectly. Only time will tell the success of HYBSE and DIM as the future of Equity on the blockchain. But this could bring them one step closer.  Sources/Further Reading Dimcoin.io Dim.foundation Valuation of DIMCOIN",True

I think the team is very careful to come out and say today is sure for listing as all depend on the exchange. Remember, HitBTC promised today for DIMCOIN team.

Sure promises were made, and not neccesarily lived up to. The second ICO was not the best idea, it was foolish to think it would be a good idea even for a second, not quite sure what the team was thinking but I am sure their actions are part of a bigger picture, which we don't all see at the moment. It would help a lot more if the team was more communicative, and Richard responded to ALL AMA questions, rather than ignoring the 'inconvenient ones' (Hope you're reading Rich).  There are a lot of areas that can be improved upon. Just remember we're all humans, we all learn from our mistakes and no team is perfect. Every company has its flaws and strenghts. I think we should be supportive, and hope that the DIM team learns from their mistakes.  That is life, shit happens. Performing a public lynching of the team ain't going to help you recoup any money - in fact the end result is the opposite, because you encourage everyone to dump their coins. You hurt the morale of the team, and you're also being an ass. If the project has failed, then there is nothing you can do about it. Your money and my money is lost.  So to all of you fudding and crying. Shut up, grow a pair, and accept the fact that patience is what pays off. Not just in investing/gambling (or however you wish to call it).

Dimcoin is only launched on the NEM blockchain, but they are not dependant on each other as far as I know. Please correct me if Im wrong. I guess what Thifruck meant was that if NEM manages to create a hype than it is likely that Dimcoin will be positively affected by that hype due to its connection to Nem, so maybe people would also start to buy DIM, but if NEM goes down, doesnt neccesarily mean that Dim holders are gonna sell.

Wut? Im the one an investor for a Dimcoin project, team sould have a considering about date of another ICO. Investor have a long time to waiting DIM will be tradeable on exchange / market. About tradeable is so close based roadmap. then another ICO ? the team is not busy?  All they are doing is selling a chunk of the dimcoin inventory at 4 cents with bonuses. The proceeds will be used to develop the dim ecosystem which benefits the token holders. This is good for investors of the original ICO. I know that, and let make it fair and this idea make unfair for those first of investor. Just make tradeable to an exchange / market then start with 4 cents.  I think this situation is good for old investors. You are wrong because 4 cents price is artificial. No one bought this coin at 4 cents. When tradeable start at an exchange with 4 cents everyone is going to dump it and the price will fall in one second at the lower level of 1 cent with a huge red candle. But if new people buy this coin (of course we are not sure if they will buy or not) at 4 cents, this price (4 cents) is going to be a bottom price for many investors. And the buyer probably set their buy order at the higher level of 1 cent. This means artificial 4 cents price will become a real price.  But I am not sure 1500 BTC (15.000.000 USD) can catch or not. Original ICO was 14.000.000 USD and at the original ICO we also bought DIMTOKEN. This ICO is going to sell only DIMCOIN not DIMTOKEN. If this is are a good news or best way, so are you would to buy my balance DIM? Even I can given you special offer just for you <3   I can find an escrow service for our deal and i willing pay of serice:) Interested..? I guess no  I can maybe buy some of your tokens (just tokens) if you can give me a good price as you mentioned. I want to keep them for long-term investment. And after this situation, I think the price of tokens will increase.",True

We can not be sure about the dump. It is a probability. But DIMPAY could minimize the fall of the price (if there will be a dump). Because the real price of the ICO will be somewhere between 1 cent and 4 cents (Now the real price is at lower than 1 cent)  If the price will pump at the start of the coin everything is perfect.,True

DIM Tokens will be tradeable on HYBSE whereas DIMCOIN will be traded on major exchanges.  Quote from: Cmoh on October 04, 2017, 08:14:54 PM How could I send or sell the Dimcoin from the nano wallet as I couldn't find any such link. Is the Dimcoin worth or some digital figure? You currently cannot sell your DIMCOIN since it's not yet listed on any exchanges. However, you are able to transfer DIMCOIN and DIM TOKENS to another DEPOTWALLET or Nanowallet address, you just need to ensure that you have XEMs on your wallet which will be used to pay transaction fees.  Quote from: Babad00k on October 06, 2017, 01:38:16 PM I have dimcoins and tokens in the nanowallet in a form of mosaic. How will I be able to sent the dimcoins to an exchange but not touching the dim tokes? Anyone can explain that to me? When you make a transfer, you simply choose which mosaic to attach on the drop-down arrow. If the mosaic that you are not willing to transfer is automatically attached, simply remove it and attach the one you are willing to transfer. For instance: If you are willing to transfer mosaic dim:coin and mosaic dim:token is already attached, you remove it since you don't want to transfer it.

Or should I contact them for more payments? Yes sir, it is safe to say that you have received your investment. Try to understand that DIMCOIN is a mosaic built on NEM Platform, and it will always be a mosaic.  Quote from: bitcoin9999 on October 10, 2017, 11:33:08 PM 1 dimcoin = 6 cents right now so it is much improved from the initial 1 cent.  with dim token you can collect 30% of the traded DIMCOIN is currently valued at $0.04 per coin not $0.06.  Quote from: peschi on October 11, 2017, 08:09:40 AM So, when are we able to trade DimCoins? Any plan when we hit an exchange? DIMCOIN will be listed on major exchanges towards the end of Q4 this year. Unfortunately, we cannot reveal which exchanges as yet but mostly the ones that XEM is listed on. Don't hesitate to ask if you have further questions.",True

First of all, this was a stupid mistake on my part. I missed the ICO for DIMCoin, and figured I could try and purchase from someone else. That was mistake #1. Mistake #2 was that as a newbie I was too trusting thinking that being a ""Full Member"" meant someone had credibility, and not researching how membership grows on Bitcointalk. Mistake #3 was not using an escrow service.  After payment was sent (on September 4th at 12:49 am Forum time), and confirming payment was received, user SmokeySmokey offered he would do the transfer (which he didn't) and then stopped replying to messages. After multiple messages, user replied apologizing for the delay (more than 24 hours after his last communication, even though user was online multiple times). On September 6th at 11:47 am (Forum time) user sent message indicating DIMtokens and DIMcoins had been sent, but nothing ever showed in my Depotwallet. I have requested the transaction ID or link to verify the status of the transaction but the user has disappeared once again not providing me with that info (user has been online multiple times). Because DepotWallet was experiencing issues as noted by DIMCoin on this thread, I contacted DIMCoin and asked them how long could a transaction take. They replied that it doesn't take that long and suggested opening my DepotWallet on the NanoWallet, which I did, but nothing showed up. I notified the user of this, still no reply. I am hoping this might actually encourage him to provide me with a transfer ID (after one last attempt at communication yesterday, I notified him today I would proceed as I shall see fit, and that is warning other users).  Here are the screenshots of the purchase agreement, payment confirmation and last communications with SmokeySmokey: https://imgur.com/kQPmGM5 https://imgur.com/iNDX1ro  This is the link to the transaction I did to the BTC account he mentioned: https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/tx/462144c16cde5ebfc9fc5274719ed9b45a0b778bddb92a45cd3affbaa76c805a/ (also, here is the screenshot of the transfer I made: https://imgur.com/yykFqNe )  This is the screenshot to my depot wallet were as of today (September 14th) no DIM tokens or coins have been transferred (I also have multiple screenshots from previous days in case you need to see those): https://imgur.com/XUhyBMH and this is a screenshot of some of the messages I sent asking about the transfer and requesting a transfer ID: https://imgur.com/b7RT0CB , https://imgur.com/c1V3Ct8 , https://imgur.com/6FUBsFx  I lost 0.0195 BTC trying to purchase 50 token and 2000 dimcoin (not the biggest investment for many, but I wanted to start somewhere). No need to reply with rude comments please. I am just posting this as a warning for all newbies out there or for people who are too trusting like me (use escrow or wait until it hits the exchange. It will be more expensive, but I am sure it will be worth it).  Now, my question is ... how do I report this user? I've seen there is a ""Trust"" section. Could I report him there?",True

There could be cheaters trying to exploit this by sending somebody else transaction hashes.  I mean is easy to find out in the block explorer the transactions that were sent out of exchnages to DIMCOIN address and try to claim those.  Example: User A sent from exchange to ICO. User B has not sent anything.  User B checks the block explorer and find TX hash there. User B tries claim the transaction that wasn't his and sends to you TX hash.  User A tries to claim his own transaction and send TX hash which is equal to TX hash that user B sent to you.  Neither of them have filled your form during the ICO.  How do you identify which one is laying and who sent the transaction?,True

If you're an investor, it's your reponsibility to read the White paper and technical documents.  The DIMCOIN ICO will have 10 million DIM TOKENs. With each token priced at $1 each, the maximum amount that can be raised through the tokens is $10,000,000. If there is still a demand for coins after the tokens have been depleted, individual coins will be sold to the public. These coins will not have benefits attached as the tokens do, i.e. the commissions given to token holders will not apply.

It is very clear that there is only 10.000.000 DIMTOKEN. here what whitepaper says  ""The DIMCOIN ICO will have 10 million DIM TOKENs. With each token priced at $1 each, the maximum amount that can be raised through the tokens is $10,000,000. If there is still a demand for coins after the tokens have been depleted, individual coins will be sold to the public. These coins will not have benefits attached as the tokens do, i.e. the commissions given to token holders will not apply. After the tokens have been depleted, the price of coins will increase with $0.01 per coin for every $2,000,000 reached. After $30,000,000 has been reached, the DIMCOIN price increment will cease and the price per DIMCOIN will remain constant""   Quote from: rigel on August 11, 2017, 10:58:11 AM Quote from: ophyrim on August 11, 2017, 10:48:13 AM Quote from: rigel on August 11, 2017, 09:29:49 AM   3,200,000 dim.token left in creator account: http://chain.nem.ninja/#/account/NDDRG3UEB5LZZZMDWBE4RTKZK73JBHPAIWBHCFMV/0    How could it be?

Or I'm calculating the things wrong? As I will need to wait at least 4 days for one transfer if I want to buy tokens. And do you plan to list DIM in exchanges soon?

The Dim Coin is capped at 9 billion.  The tokens are only available during the ICO and represent equity in the ecosystem. 1 Dim Token is the equivalent of 100 Dim Coin.  Each Dim Token is priced at $1 USD.  With each purchase you also receive the same $ amount of Dimcoin + the ICO bonus.  For example if you participated in the pre-ICO where there was a 30% bonus and purchased $1000 USD using BTC, you would receive 1,000 Dim Tokens + 1,300 Dim Coins.  If you pay using NEM, then you get an extra 10% Dim Coin.  The Dim Coin is what will eventually be on exchanges such as Bittrex.  They have an initial price of .01 USD. Depending how successful the ICO is, this price will rise.  Currently they are close to raising $7M USD for the project.  The price of Dim Coin escalates based on certain thresholds, i.e. if they raise between 12M-14M, the initial dim coin price will be .02 USD, 14M-16M, .03, and so on.  If they raise $30M, USD, the price of each Dim Coin will be .12 USD which is the max price during the ICO.    Dim Tokens will receive 30% of the fees of the network, the other 70% will go to the HYBSE - the Hybrid Stock Exchange, used to cryptonize assets and trade them as securities, the HYBSE will sit in the middle between buyer and seller similar to the CFTC. Cryptonizing assets is a form of vetting and verifying their value before they are marketable and available for purchase.  The other portion will go to WISE Consulting - a 3rd party that will manage the conversion of fiat currencies into the equivalent fiat currencies on the platform which will be pegged 1-1.  For example, you can have USD on the platform the way you do in your bank account and use it for ""regular"" e-commerce. If i have 100 USD, i can convert it for 100 DIM USD which is basically money in a bank account.  Dim Coin is building an entire eco-system.  Participation in this ICO will yield outsized returns.  In the scenario explained above, just a $1000 investment during the ICO phase is worth $2300 or $2400 if participating with NEM. This is right off the bat.  This is the minimum amount without any price appreciation.  I would not be surprised to see returns of 10-15X later this year when Dim Coin trades on exchanges. Also holders of Dim Tokens have the added bonus of being an stakeholder of the platform.  Each transaction requires ""stamps"" which are the fees.  I recommend this ICO and put it on the same par as Veritaseum and Populous.  ",True

This causes the market to find its true price. After a while trading will be flat and this is good. It may or may not be under ICO price but its a good time to buy back what you sold.

HYBSE is online, the stock market is used but its still under heavy redesign so we can show its full potential. There are currently 5 REAL companies on there and more to come.

Some developers want privacy and they are not visible on any website and the other 3 we show with picture and their nicknames. We have also hired an external IT company that is working on new features for the Depotwallet. Be patient and you will see the results of our efforts soon, we will publish everything once the beta testing is over.  For more information about our team, the foundation, updated roadmap and our external companies that are working for the DIM Ecosystem please wait until our new Foundation Website is up and running, there we will have a Q&A and also a Foundation Support where all questions regarding the Development will be handled.  We will publish a new Foundation Blog soon where we will address each Topic in a separated official Statement. There are a lot of scammers out there, spreading false information about our Ecosystem, who we have decided to centralize all official communication on our Blog that will be up and running soon.

I just want to give a friendly advice to everyone mainly new XEM users that will use NanoWallet or DepotWallet.

Lastly, token holders with +50 DIM Tokens will receive a portion of the 30% net fees earned on the transfer of DIMCOIN and DIM Currencies within the DIM Ecosystem.

The DIMCOIN is built on the NEM blockchain which has limit of 9 billion XEM.  The total amount of DIMCOIN available is also 9 billion.  They have been created already and can not be mined like bitcoin.  They are stored in multisignature accounts under the care of the DIMCOIN Foundation.  You are correct that not all people will get DIM Tokens because only 10 million Tokens are available.  The tokens are limited because they have benefits to token holders such as: suggestions and voting on the destiny of the DIM Ecosystem, and holders with +50 DIM Tokens receive a percentage of the 30% net fee transfers from the DIMCOIN and DIM Currencies within the DIM Ecosystem according to the number of tokens they own. The system allows only allows for 10 million Tokens.  People who buy tokens but wish to trade them can do so using their Depotwallet.  They will be able to trade them peer-to-peer with other DIMCOIN users. The DIM Tokens are tradable for the majority of other cryptocurrencies.",True
