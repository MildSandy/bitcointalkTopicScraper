In order to reach and surpass the token sale soft cap of $3,430,000, this opportunity will be available until July 30 or the moment VRT successfully concludes all current dealings.  The team is working with a number of funds and private investors at this time. As the VRT team works to finalize pre-arrangements with these investors and funds, everyone will have more time to learn more about the VRT Project and to take advantage of this great investment opportunity.  At this time, VRT has not reached the soft cap of $3,430,000, so the team is working with private investors to raise that minimum needed to develop all plans for the future. The hard cap is $16 million. With that in mind, the team will offer a private fundraising round following the token sale for investors and large funds. During this special sale—June 1 to July 30—VRT plans to raise a total of $1,5 million with participation from the $50,000 funds. The target is $1.5 million USD overall.  BTC, ETH, BCASH, DASH and LTC currencies are accepted, and tokens purchased via ETH will be distributed to participant wallets on the Ethereum blockchain, with a balance closed in smart contracts. All funds raised are received and saved in multi-signature wallets. Each VRT token is equivalent to $1 USD.  The team will continue to update the community on the progress of development as current investment dealings are finalized. Meanwhile, VRT will continue to develop the VRT WORLD platform and virtual reality park franchise, which are already up and running. Additionally, the team is working on new content and knows that everyone in the VRT community will be excited about this quality material and further project development.",False

This is not surprising, as improved modern technology turns virtual reality into an entirely new experience. According to analysts, the VR industry is highly likely to create a multibillion market in the next few years. However, one of the key issues getting in the way of full-blown development of this technology is a lack of quality content for VR equipment. We offer a solution that will entice thousands of developers from all over the world to create and monetise quality VR content - a VRT platform serving as a decentralised VR marketplace. The platform will be based on blockchain technology, which guarantees an honest and transparent distribution of funds and the protection of intellectual property rights. In addition, VRT users will have access to platform SDK and API that will make it possible to involve a large number of developers in improving the system. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WaFl215YiGA",False

Soon the situation can dramatically change — powerful headsets will be deprived of associated equipment and will cease to constrain users. The first steps in this direction have already been made — today let us talk about Oculus Go and HTC Vive Pro.  Oculus Go  Oculus Rift is perhaps the most famous VR headset on the market. Everyone have heard of it after Facebook bought Oculus VR for more than $ 2 billion.  The consumer version of the Oculus Rift went on sale in March 2016, the Oculus Touch controllers in December of the same year. Facebook does not disclose how many devices was sold, but on Steam (the largest online gaming store) there are about 70 thousand owners of Rift. True, it is worth adding that Oculus VR is developing its own store of VR-applications — Oculus Store.  At CES 2018 Facebook presented Oculus Go — a light version of Rift with a price of $ 200 instead of $ 600. Oculus Go do not need an external computing node (PC) or a smartphone. At the same time, the resolution of the picture is 2560x1440 against 2160x1200 at Rift. Additional characteristics are not provided, but the concept of a cheaper and self-contained headset is impressive. In China, by the way, Xiaomi will produce a copy of the Oculus Go — Mi VR Standalone (with 32 or 64 GB of flash memory).  Jason Rubin, one of the leaders of Oculus VR, in a recent interview honestly outlined the minuses of Rift — insufficient resolution, solid weight and a requirement to use in conjunction with the PC. In fairness, these are technical disadvantages, not conceptual ones. Oculus VR is aimed at high-quality graphics, a wide field of view and, of course, the lack of additional wires. Partially named ideas are embodied in the Go helmet.  A promising development of Facebook is the Oculus Santa Cruz glasses, summarizing the power of Rift with Go mobility. This device is “all in one”.  It is noteworthy that Facebook cares not only about the hardware, but also about the creators of content. In January 2018, the Start program was announced, aimed at novice developers under the VR. Participation is free of charge. Companies registered in the program will open access to products (including Oculus Santa Cruz), and to technologies.  https://medium.com/@VRTOKEN/new-vr-headset-oculus-go-and-htc-vive-pro-e7ff197be23c",False

In this case, there are eight of them, and this gives amazingly accurate tracking to a millimeter of a separate movement. In this case, each active label can be assigned its own algorithm of operation. They are not tied to a specific geometry.  Active markers have advantages in production. Microchips for markers (as well as lenses and cameras) are supplied by Optitrack, a long-established manufacturer. Microcomputers in MSI backpacks with MSI VR ONE replaceable batteries transfer data to virtual reality glasses. The glasses can be of any brand but the preference is given to the VR-helmet Oculus. As a result, the total weight of all the equipment that a player wears for participation is significantly reduced in comparison with analogues.  Perhaps most importantly, the fact that several participants are able to interact in virtual reality is realized, which VRT World’s Full-Body Tracking VR technology gives in full, and this is the impetus for the active development of eSports and collective travel. Note that participants can be in different countries even. The marks of active players on the soles of their feet, wrists, and back ate tracked by the cameras, and the movements of the main parts of the body are calculated and completed according to the reverse kinematics algorithm. The algorithm is based on the knowledge of human anatomy and calculates the rotation of the joints. The company took great efforts, carried out intensive research and shooting of movements in order to confidently create this leading innovative program.

Personally, I think VR-parks need to attract and promote VR technology among the broad masses of the population. The entertainment industry is optimally suited for this. Many of you have seen the VR-parks in small towns? I - the most of any roller coaster or skydiving in the Oculus Rift. Year through 2-3-4 we will see VR-parks in almost every city. The explosive growth of miniaturization, and therefore cheaper batteries and computer systems will in the near future to use VR at home, or most approximate to them. And at this moment all of competitors will be able to survive and provide a qualitative growth of the one who will create the ecosystem for the development and commercialization of new solutions in VR\AR. SDK should solve this problem and the marketplace for solutions built on this SDK will allow to commercialize VR-objects, games, educational programs from third party developers.",False

Before taking the decision to participate in your ICO, I read a lot of material in the web and agree with the analysts that VR is one of the most promising technologies of the future. It will take a couple of years and the development of technologies will allow to miniaturise all the elements necessary for a complete immersion in virtual reality, their cost will decrease and the technology of virtual / augmented reality will be available to all. Possible neural interfaces in the near future will replace the existing ways of interaction with virtual reality. And these technologies are now at the stage of entering the market. In the near future virtual reality will be a huge multi-billion dollar market allowing to immerse yourself in virtual reality at home, and will be the impuls of development for various types of business: medicine, education, space exploration and other spheres, which we don't even know now. And those companies who begin to popularize virtual reality will become the leaders of this emerging market.

I think that for those who are interested in the project it will be useful to receive information from different sources.  At the same time, the authors will be able to confirm or deny this information.  So what I read:  1. The service VRT makes it possible not only to completely immerse themselves in the virtual game world, but also to earn money using the increasing popularity of crypto-currencies. Players can exchange and trade in game resources and items, participate in competitions and receive rewards for gaming achievements.  2. The blockchain VRT platform provides a wide range of tools for software developers who will be able to create content and monetize it.  3. On  VRT platform it is planned to use streaming with translation in TV / OTT / VR formats.  4. It will be possible to purchase a franchise of VRT-project for crypto-currency for the opening of  the VR Park in a territory where the VRT project has not yet been submitted.  5. The first virtual park was opened in Moscow under the name Z8.  6. In 2018, the company plans to release a new game for VR-park every four months.  7. By the end of 2018, it is planned to open 40 parks in the EU, the US, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea.  What from what I listed really corresponds to the official information of devs?",False
