Huge amounts of knowledge and money are a requisite in order to make a successful investment; in addition, the real estate market is a one-horse town industry where the most profitable properties are traded amongst each other, not to mention the unclear notary and financing costs. Crowdfunding based on blockchain has the potential to unleash a revolution in this industry.  What does Mijn Vastgoed™ strive to do?  Mijn Vastgoed is a dutch initiative, and only focus on the dutch market. We want to make it possible for everyone to invest in real estate. That is why Mijn Vastgoed is developing an online platform where individual investment properties can be divided into blockchain tokens and offered. Platform users are therefore entitled to a part of the rental income and the surplus value when the property is sold. The blockchain tokens can be purchased and traded on the online platform, enabling customers to purchase and sell their real estate investments at lightning speed.  Why is Mijn Vastgoed™ organising a token sale?  The financing for the development of the online platform is done through the issuance of dividend tokens. These dividend tokens entitle the owner to a dividend from the company. By acquiring funds this way, Mijn Vastgoed makes it possible for everyone to invest in the start-up. The dividend tokens must not be confused with the later blockchain tokens that make it possible to invest in an investment property on the online platform.  The ICO starts at the first of june  The whitepaper is already in English. The English website is coming soon.
