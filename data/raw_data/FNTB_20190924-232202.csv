I agree! I want to tell you about the reasons for the growth of FinTab tokens Return on investment is based on a constant increase in the FNT token: - Demand for the service is growing due to constant advancement and development of functionality. - Burning a token provides a deficit and an increase in the cost of tokens. - The functionality of advertising increases the demand and turnover of tokens.  Accordingly, the predicted starting point for the growth of the token rate will be the introduction of paid accounts in the system and the beginning of the burning of the tokens.",False

Finally, it happened! The trades started on the exchange for FinTab Service. EtherDelta is the first trading platform where you will see FNTB tokens.   Available trading pairs: FNTB (FinTab) / ETH   EtherDelta is a decentralized platform for trading ERC20 tokens. It was launched in the summer of 2017 by Zack Coburn, who had already initiated successful projects before, one of them was FirstBlood. The exchange is in demand because of low commissions to replenish the account and withdraw funds, a large number of coins, and most importantly security, since the trade is decentralized, from the wallet to the wallet and do not enter the single centre.     [Important!] How to find the FNTB token on EtherDelta? As mentioned above, EtherDelta is a decentralized exchange, which allows you to trade even before the official listing by the management of the exchange. This means: while your application is being processed, you can already buy / sell tokens on the exchange. To do this, you need to click the link: https://etherdelta.com/#0xbd4b60a138b3fce3584ea01f50c0908c18f9677a-ETH     Add this address to the bookmarks so you will not lose it. After the official listing, all orders will be saved, just the address will be changed to short and there will be an opportunity to select a token from the list of all tokens.   Attention! Beware of scammers. To verify this is a valid address (actual before the official listing):   1. https://etherdelta.com/#0xbd4b60a138b3fce3584ea01f50c0908c18f9677a-ETH In the link after etherdelta.com/# there is the address of our smart contract. 0xbD4B60a138b3fce3584EA01f50c0908c18f9677A  2. You can manually go to our token page:   a.       Choose the ""Other"" in the token list http://take.ms/NtzZO b.       Enter the data (you can specify the coin name FNTB or FinTab) and click ""Go"" http://take.ms/Ro6ZG    How to trade on EtherDelta, do input and output means, there is a lot of information on the Internet. Due to the heavy workload, we will not be able to answer these questions. As an example, we can recommend to study these materials (prepared by EtherDelta. FinTab is not responsible for them and the possible misunderstanding):     https://youtu.be/gb34BYTg5F8 https://www.reddit.com/r/EtherDelta/comments/6hrxjw/etherdelta_guides_for_first_time_users/   We also negotiate with the other exchanges and continue to develop our service.

Private investors don't need an overloaded system which is more difficult for understanding than cryptocurrencies. For traders the maximum automation is required not to waste their time on accounting and analytics. Traders make transactions on various exchanges (because of the rate difference) and financial accounting becomes a very laborious task. For funds it is needed to reduce the routine processing of huge transaction flows from their customers. It is important to decrease the complexity of maintaining internal accounting and improve its accuracy.

Bancor Protocol is a promising technology that turns any token into a ‚Äúsmart-token‚Äù that will automatically without any additional actions from the author traded or exchanged for any smart-token.   How is works  A smart token contains one or more other tokens that form a ‚Äúreserve‚Äù, which allows anyone in real time to buy a smart token in exchange for any of their backup tokens, according to a special formula that balances the volumes. The percentage of reserve that the author chooses is called Constant Reserve Ratio (CRR). The reserve currency can be any ERC-20 token. In our case, we plan to use the Bancor token as a backup token and set the CRR initially at 1% (for greater volatility) and increase (over a year) to 10% to reduce volatility, which is important for FNTB tokens, as means of payment in the FinTab system.  What it gives to users  1. Token‚Äôs liquidity. Regardless of the volume of trading on the exchanges, there is always a possibility in the Bancor Network to exchange one smart-token for another, including a Bancor token. 2. There is no additional commission in the Bancor Network, only the gas price (Gas). 3. Additional financial security of the token.

Let‚Äôs analyze each service in details.   Blockfolio    Blockfolio is a popular mobile application for crypto-currency accounting for IOS and Android.  However, this service does not automatically transmit the information about transactions and the absence of web-version makes the manual data input inconvenient, especially with a large number of transactions and currencies.  Also, recently the users have been writing about service instability and frequent failures of the application.  Blockfolio is suitable only for personal use with a small number of currencies and transactions, but not for traders and cryptophones.   FinTab   In addition to the application, FinTab service includes a web-version and has a number of key benefits. There is no need to entry all data manually. With the help of secure integration through the API, the service automatically transmits the history of trading on exchanges.  FinTab uses a more advanced system to calculate the profitability of your portfolio, taking into account the various commissions and transactions such as input, withdrawal, currency exchange, etc. Also the service allows you to create an unlimited number of portfolios with the ability to provide access to other users, which is a good solution for professional traders and crypto funds.

Burning of tokens:   In FinTab system the burning of tokens that have entered the system as a service payment will be implemented:  - When paying for the service 10% of FNT tokens pass to FinTab team.  - The remaining 90% of the tokens are burned.

According to statistics, the greatest profitability is made by projects that collect NOT large amounts on the ICO.  After all, if the project has collected several million dollars for an ICO even without a prototype, then the project needs to do something really incredible in order to increase its capitalization, in several times.  This year there was a boom in investment in block projects. The volume of investments amounted to more than $ 4 billion. Most projects enter the market without a prototype, they collect extremely large amounts under the guidance of non-experts in this field. All these factors together create a huge risk for investors.  Today Fintab is almost completed service, which will change the market of financial accounting for cryptocurrency. The project has already collected about $ 160,000, which indicates that the FinTab token has a very large margin for increasing its capitalization and, accordingly, a great chance to show very high interest rates.

But at the same time, once again assessing the possibilities of the current smart contract, we came to the conclusion that FinTab needs a redeploy smart contract:  we are planning to implement the Bancor Protocol; it is necessary to take into account the new capabilities of the system; it is essential to improve the logic of the token.  Read ahead for more detailed information why we decided to do this, what are the consequences and how we will perform it.  Background  The current smart contract https://etherscan.io/token/0x9D613a7A10CD550C7a0826c6deEcFF6f1B3e9879 was deployed in October before pre-ICO started. Since then, we have significantly expanded the potential capabilities of the system and want to take them into account in a smart contract.   Moreover, we are planning to implement the Bancor Protocol and make a ""smart token"" to increase the liquidity of our token. Bancor Protocol is a promising technology that turns any token into a smart-token that will automatically trade or exchange for any other smart token without any further action from the author. This technology significantly increases the liquidity of the token and expands its capabilities. In the near future, we will prepare a detailed announcement.  Name of new token: FNTB  Automatic accrual of tokens  Current and future token holders should not worry about the issue of accruing the new tokens. This will happen automatically: each FNT token owner will automatically receive the corresponding FNTB amount for the corresponding wallet.

Moreover, it will offer: ‚Äî both desktop and mobile versions, which will be synchronized automatically; ‚Äî the accounting of ICO tokens (even the ones that are not issued yet); ‚Äî ability to add currencies that are not present in the market yet; ‚Äî ability to add custom exchanges and wallets; ‚Äî the buy / sell / exchange currency functions, as well as transferring between the exchanges; ‚Äî calculation of portfolio dynamics and its profit/loss and ROI considering multiple transactions* (replenishment, withdrawal, exchange); ‚Äî calculation of currency dynamics and its profit/loss considering multiple transactions* (replenishment, withdrawal, exchange); ‚Äî other standard functions (exchange rates, notifications, etc.)  *The example of multiple transactions: say you‚Äôve purchased a currency at one rate, sold it at another rate, purchased it again and sold it, traded it for another currency, etc. It becomes challenging to calculate the percentage of currency profitability, as well as the whole portfolio ROI. FinTab team has found the solution to this problem. Now you can always be sure to know your exact profit or loss (% or absolute value) on each currency or portfolio, no matter how many transactions you‚Äôve performed.  But those are not our main differences Our main point is our positioning. The service is intended for use by the following user categories:  Traders ‚Äî active users, working both on short and long positions. They perform numerous transactions and may have several active portfolios. Unlike the ""Individual investors"", traders perform series of transactions: several transactions within the same currency - purchase, exchange, transfer, withdrawal. They need to keep a record of these transactions and be able to see the overall statistics. Moreover, it is important to automate the addition of transactions.  Trusts ‚Äî in other words, traders who take third-party finance under management and supervise several clients. They need to be able to separate the agent and client accounts, and actively interact with the technical support for individual improvements. The agent account will feature the possibility of setting the client cabinet for each separate client: displaying the relevant information, placing a personal logo, generating a report, etc.  Here are the vital features that will be implemented for these types of users: ‚Äî the unlimited number of portfolios divided into public and private ones; ‚Äî personal cabinet with reports system and extended analytical tools; ‚Äî simple, yet powerfully protected integration with cryptocurrency exchanges via API for the automated transaction data transfer (in order to exclude the manual transaction input).  For trusts (traders managing multiple clients) the most important features will be: ‚Äî division into agency and client accounts**; ‚Äî personal technical support.  **Each client‚Äôs individual portfolio access. You can set up the information you wish to display to each separate client. At the same time, unlike the ordinary portfolios, the client accounts are automatically synchronized with the agency accounts, thus, performing any transactions in your agency account you won‚Äôt need to manually duplicate them in your client‚Äôs account.",False

We take into account what is really necessary and important for each audience.  *Private investors Private investors don't need an overloaded system which is more difficult for understanding than cryptocurrencies. The investor does not care how much the currency has grown; the only thing that matters is how much he has earned and how he can earn more. At the same time, not all users know the basics of trading and they need recommendations.  *Traders For traders the maximum automation is required not to waste their time on accounting and analytics. Traders make transactions on the various exchanges (because of the rate difference) and financial accounting becomes a very laborious task. If the trader takes the finance under management he needs to report to the clients to make it as clear and simple as possible not wasting much time. And it is extremely significant for traders to understand their efficiency. All the traders strive to create the most effective and attractive portfolio to obtain more portfolios under management.  *Funds For funds it is needed to reduce the routine processing of huge transaction flows from their customers. It is important to decrease the complexity of maintaining internal accounting and improve its accuracy. And for clients as for investors the most important thing is to understand how much they have earned.  At the same time, funds need this kind of service in any case but in-house solution is costly and requires labor and temporary resources.",False

We take into account what is really necessary and important for every audience.  Private investors Private investors don't need an overloaded system which is more difficult for understanding than cryptocurrencies.  The investor does not care how much the currency has grown; the only thing that matters is how much he has earned and how he can earn more. At the same time, not all users know the basics of trading and they need recommendations.  Traders For traders the maximum automation is required not to waste their time on accounting and analytics. Traders make transactions on various exchanges (because of the rate difference) and financial accounting becomes a very laborious task.  If the trader takes the finance under management he needs to report to the clients to make it clear and simple as possible not wasting much time. And it is extremely significant for traders to understand their efficiency. All the traders strive to create the most effective and attractive portfolio to obtain more portfolios under management.  Funds For funds it is needed to reduce the routine processing of huge transaction flows from their customers. It is important to decrease the complexity of maintaining internal accounting and improve its accuracy. And for clients as for investors the most important thing is to understand how much they have earned.  At the same time, for funds need this kind of service in any case but in-house solution is costly and requires labor and temporary resources.    Beta-version  Web-version                                                                                  Mobile app    Ecosystem FinTab FinTab is an analytical system based on the financial accounting service for cryptocurrency but in addition there are other interactions that perfectly complement our system.   Service FinTab is a SaaS product with paid services. The cost for the service for the ""Pro"" and ""Manage"" accounts will be fixed in USD, but payment is accepted in FinTab tokens (FNT).  P2P interaction P2P interaction: traders could sell the information about their crypto-portfolio through our system. In addition the rating of best traders will be compiled.  Advertising platform Advertising platform: placement and display of advertising will be held decentralized: each user can enable or disable ads. For the ads view the user obtains tokens from the advertisers.  System of signals Analytical system and recommendations for trade using Artificial Intelligence.     System development Depending on the collected funds FinTab will implement the following features:     Issue and Sales of the FNT Tokens We have estimated the number of our potential users by the third quarter of 2018. Based on this we have calculated how many tokens we can issue. The calculation formula can be found in WhitePaper. A total of 16.5 million FinTab tokens (FNT) will be issued: ‚Äî 14 million FNT will be sold out in total during all the ICO stages for system development. ‚Äî 1.5 million FNT reserved for the team and partners. ‚Äî 1 million FNT reserved as a reward for helping the project (bounty).      The reasons for FinTab tokens growth Return on investment is based on a constant increase of FNT token rate: ‚Äî The demand for the service grows due to the constant promotion and development of the functionality. ‚Äî The burning of token ensures the deficit and the increase of token cost. ‚Äî Advertising functionality increases the demand and turnover of tokens.  Accordingly, the predicted starting point for the growth of the token rate will be the introduction of paid accounts in the system and the start of the tokens' burning.   Burning of tokens  In FinTab system the burning of tokens that have entered the system as a service payment will be implemented: ‚Äî When paying for the service 10% of FNT tokens pass to FinTab team. ‚Äî The remaining 90% of the tokens are burned. When using FinTab as an advertising and P2P platform, tokens are not burned (since 90% of the tokens are given to users and the remaining 10% to FinTab team).

Successful independent launch of the pre-ICO, despite the absence of speculative early investments, which have already become a ‚Äústandard‚Äù for ICO projects, has benefited in more than 50 percent of the expected amount of investments in the very first hours, and it clearly demonstrates the relevance and potential of the project.    The potential of the project and its relevance is confirmed by rising attention from other blockchain projects in this segment, including large ones. On October 20, right after the successful start of the pre-ICO, Mikhail Fadeev (FinTab CEO) signed a cooperation agreement with Alexei Vuiko, a representative of iCrypto SA, which is currently working on the creation of Datarius ‚Äì the first social p2p crypto bank.   At the bilateral meeting in Kiev (Ukraine), the partners discussed various options for integration on parity terms, which would have a positive impact on the liquidity of FNT tokens in the future. Mikhail and Alexei evaluated the potential for joint cooperation, and outlined a plan for further consultations.  Datarius' principles of work are based on transparency, openness, independence, globality and social orientation, which fully comply with the principles of FinTab - and this was the key factor in making this decision.  Moreover, the FinTab team is actively engaged in core events. Since the launch of the pre-ICO, the project representatives managed to speak at two conferences and already received invitations for several major events.  Why FinTab receives so much attention and provokes interest?  Firstly, this is one of the rare cases when a team is able to demonstrate a working product at the stage of pre-ICO. To date, the service is at the beta stage and has an Android mobile app, but it‚Äôs already understandable that the project is about to evolve and become a leader within its market. Secondly, the project is of investment attractiveness for users. Clear and simple service monetization and token burning system provide the prospects for the FNT rate growth. More details can be found on the FinTab website and WhitePaper   Plus, pre-ICO bonus conditions are excellent: 75% discount compared to the price at the main stage of the ICO.   And thirdly, FinTab technology has a perspective not only in B2C sector, but in B2B as well. And this brings the project to a whole new level. We can assume that the contract with Datarius is just the beginning. The project will be of interest to numerous cryptocurrency funds and financial systems.

So payments go to addresses which are not connected with cointracts directly, but investros always see all transacrions in their personal account and all token transfers from smart contract to their wallets. 2. StartICO team provide some escrow functions about investro's money and smart contract will recieve money/tokens back only after ICO will end. 3. We want to provide the opportunity to make investments not only in ETH, but also in BTC other altcoins and Fiat money on legal field.

To reach such number, we would need to sell out absolutely all the tokens (to take the Hard cap), without bonuses (during the 3rd and 4th weeks of the ICO, without selling anything at all in the first 2 weeks). The real number is the Soft cap. As for now, the Soft cap is 15 million FNT, but will most likely be reduced to 10 million FNT. 10 million FNT equals $3.4 million (taking into account the fact that people will buy tokens during the whole period of 4 weeks, that is, including the bonus accruals).  The team will receive only 10% of the tokens paid for the service, the remaining 90% will return to the market as dividends (see the WhitePaper, ""Issue and sale of FNT tokens"" section). Thus, the core funds for development, promotion and remuneration for 2018 will be formed during the ICO. Starting from 2019, the number of users must become sufficient, so that 10% will be enough for the full maintenance and development of the system.  ICO budget distribution (sorted irrelative of the expenditure): ‚Äî Promotion of the service: we need to attract 300,000 users by the third quarter of 2018. ‚Äî Mobile application development for iOS. ‚Äî Elaboration of the ‚ÄòManage‚Äô accounts functionality. ‚Äî Development of our own API for currency rates, ICO tokens and their historical values. ‚Äî Development of our own blockchain for processing and storing the user transactions database. ‚Äî Formation of the 24/7 support service. ‚Äî Server and administration costs. ‚Äî Security and safety systems: all user data will be completely safe, even the FinTab team will not have the access to it. By decentralizing the storage and processing of the database (by the means of blockchain) we will in fact eliminate the chance of losing or hacking the data. ‚Äî Legal registration of the company.  Salary for: ‚Äî The team of developers (about 15-20 people). ‚Äî Promotion Department (pr, marketing, community support - about 10 people). ‚Äî Technical support team (5-6 people).  Profit of the company. In our case, ICO is not just some sort of crowdfunding, but the way of selling the tokens for ""Pro"" and ""Manage"" accounts‚Äô payments (of which we will only receive 10%). All that goes beyond the stated costs is the company's profit for 2018.  That is why FinTab is not just a service, but the accounting system for crypto-currency portfolios. One of the main problems of existing services is that they do not have enough resources for development. That's why we decided to have the ICO in order to make a cool, working service - the system that will be used by funds and traders - and maintain it at the highest level.",False

Burning of tokens We decided to abandon the dividend system (charging tokens to investors, to return to the market) in favor of  burning of tokens. How the smart contract will work when you pay for the service: Every month (the first day) 10% of FNT tokens entered from the users (as a payment for the service) go to the FinTab team. The remaining 90% of FNT tokens entering the system as payment for the service will be burned every month (first day). * Exposure per month is needed to reduce gas costs when transferring tokens.  The reason why we switched to the system of burning of tokens Legal aspect of the system. Using the dividend system, we came under the control of such regulators as the SEC. Burning of  tokens allows you to expand the geography of the service. Legal aspect of users. Dividends are treated as a certain income over a period of time. Accordingly, for investors this may become an additional taxation. Technical aspect. Payments should be made to investors who have more than 2500 FNT on their account. But what if these funds were transferred to the stock exchange, to several purses / exchanges? Because of this, there could be problems with accruals or their complete absence. Economic aspect. With a significant number of investors, the cost of transferring tokens could reach very high values.  Investors' interest Burning of tokens will lead to an increase in the deficit of tokens, especially given the constant growth of users. Thus, we can predict a more rapid growth of the token rate (than in the case of dividends).  Users' Interest To ensure that the deficit of tokens does not lead to a sharp rise in the cost of the service, we fix the cost of the service in USD: ‚Äî ""Pro"" account ‚Äî $19/month ‚Äî ""Manage"" account ‚Äî $95/month  Payment is also accepted only in FNT tokens. With the growth of the FNT rate, the cost of service in tokens will decrease, remaining fixed in USD. Moreover, with the increase in the cost of the token, you can save a lot on using the service if you buy in advance (on pre-ICO or ICO) FNT tokens.  Issue of tokens Switching to the system of burning tokens and a fixed price in USD also allowed solving the problem of the future uncontrolled growth of the cost of the service. In this regard, we decided to reduce the number of tokens produced by 5,000,000.  1. Pre-ICO (12 October - 12 November 2017). At the Pre-ICO stage, 2 million FNTs will be put on the market. Cost of 1 FNT = $ 0.1 Soft Cap - $ 63,000 Hard Cap - $ 200,000  2. ICO (December 2017). At the ICO stage, 21 million FNTs will be put on the market. Cost of 1 FNT = $ 0.4 Soft Cap - sold 8 million FNT Hard Cap - sold 21 (+3 in case of sale of reserve) Million FNT At the ICO the following system of bonuses will operate: ‚Äî In the first 48h + 30% of tokens. ‚Äî In the next 5 days + 20% of tokens. ‚Äî In the second week + 10% of tokens. ‚Äî In the third week + 5% of tokens. ‚Äî In the fourth week bonus accruals are not made. If all tokens are sold out within the first 3 weeks after the start of the ICO, a reserve fund will be used. Otherwise, tokens from the reserve fund will be destroyed. After the fourth week, the sale of tokens ceases. All unsold tokens will be destroyed.  Conclusion Switching to the system of burning of tokens and fixing the cost of the service in USD: Preserves investment attractiveness (and even increases in the long term). Provides a fixed transparent cost for users, despite the growth of the token rate. Solves the legal issue. Simplifies and makes more reliable technical implementation.",False

We take into account what is really necessary and important for every audience.  Private investors Private investors don't need an overloaded system which is more difficult for understanding than cryptocurrencies.  The investor does not care how much the currency has grown; the only thing that matters is how much he has earned and how he can earn more. At the same time, not all users know the basics of trading and they need recommendations.  Traders For traders the maximum automation is required not to waste their time on accounting and analytics. Traders make transactions on various exchanges (because of the rate difference) and financial accounting becomes a very laborious task.  If the trader takes the finance under management he needs to report to the clients to make it clear and simple as possible not wasting much time. And it is extremely significant for traders to understand their efficiency. All the traders strive to create the most effective and attractive portfolio to obtain more portfolios under management.  Funds For funds it is needed to reduce the routine processing of huge transaction flows from their customers. It is important to decrease the complexity of maintaining internal accounting and improve its accuracy. And for clients as for investors the most important thing is to understand how much they have earned.  At the same time, for funds need this kind of service in any case but in-house solution is costly and requires labor and temporary resources.

We have carried out the analysis of 17 cryptocurrency accounting services. They can be divided into 2 categories: Broad functionality, but unhandy interface. Good design and usability, but lack of features.  Portfolio accounting services comparison https://preview.ibb.co/hbBFPQ/Portfolio_accounting_services_comparison.jpg Original spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14sIHtNYW99iZ8lf2Lfin_0sSfR1_xspjgCe38KclOOE/edit?usp=sharing   Let‚Äôs consider the chosen services in more detail Coin.fyi The service lets you add currencies and specify their USD value. Absence of other transaction types, limited to a single portfolio only. The system simply calculates the summarized portfolio value and ROI of currencies and portfolio. It‚Äôs a very simple scheme. Even Google Tables or Excel can offer a broader functionality.  Cointracking It has plenty of features, half of which are not in demand even among traders or trusts (many transaction types have in fact the same meaning). Yet it‚Äôs the most functional system; it offers standard reports with an export option, dashboard, import from various exchanges via CSV, API integration, forecasting. Cons: all features are very inconvenient to use, free version has a scaled down functionality, there‚Äôs no mobile app and no analytics on multiple transactions*. It also has just one portfolio, which makes the system pointless for traders and trusts.  CryptoCompare The most usable of the existing services. It allows you to create multiple portfolios, offers the overall basic analytical tools for portfolios and currencies. Cons: no mobile app; no transaction import/export feature; no automated data transfer from the exchanges; no reports; no exchange/transfer transaction types; impossible to perform multiple operations*; no guest access feature ‚Äì portfolios can either be public, or private. Thus, the service can be great for personal use, but doesn‚Äôt meet the needs of traders and trusts.  Blockfolio The only decent mobile app as of today. It‚Äôs got the buy/sell feature, the notification system, the wide choice of exchanges. Cons: there‚Äôs no desktop version, which makes it exhausting to add many transactions and currencies. Also, there‚Äôs no percentage calculation for multiple transactions*. The service is only good for personal use with a small amount of currencies and transactions.   How is FinTab different from its competitors? The free version of FinTab will have functions similar to CryptoCompare and Blockfolio. Moreover, it will offer: both desktop and mobile versions, which will be synchronized automatically; the accounting of ICO tokens (even the ones that are not issued yet); ability to add currencies that are not present in the market yet; ability to add custom exchanges and wallets; the buy / sell / exchange currency functions, as well as transferring between the exchanges; calculation of portfolio dynamics and its profit/loss and ROI considering multiple transactions* (replenishment, withdrawal, exchange); calculation of currency dynamics and its profit/loss considering multiple transactions* (replenishment, withdrawal, exchange); other standard functions (exchange rates, notifications, etc.); blockchain implementation for decentralized processing and storage of users‚Äô transaction database. *The example of multiple transactions: say you‚Äôve purchased a currency at one rate, sold it at another rate, purchased it again and sold it, traded it for another currency, etc. It becomes challenging to calculate the percentage of currency profitability, as well as the whole portfolio ROI.  FinTab team has found the solution to this problem. Now you can always be sure to know your exact profit or loss (% or absolute value) on each currency or portfolio, no matter how many transactions you‚Äôve performed.  But those are not our main differences Our main point is our positioning. The service is intended for use by the following user categories: Traders ‚Äî active users, working both on short and long positions. They perform numerous transactions and may have several active portfolios. Unlike the ""Individual investors"", traders perform series of transactions: several transactions within the same currency - purchase, exchange, transfer, withdrawal. They need to keep a record of these transactions and be able to see the overall statistics. Moreover, it is important to automate the addition of transactions. Trusts ‚Äî in other words, traders who take third-party finance under management and supervise several clients. They need to be able to separate the agent and client accounts, and actively interact with the technical support for individual improvements. The agent account will feature the possibility of setting the client cabinet for each separate client: displaying the relevant information, placing a personal logo, generating a report, etc.  Here are the vital features that will be implemented for these types of users: the unlimited number of portfolios divided into public and private ones; personal cabinet with reports system and extended analytical tools; simple, yet powerfully protected integration with cryptocurrency exchanges via API for the automated transaction data transfer (in order to exclude the manual transaction input). For trusts (traders managing multiple clients) the most important features will be: division into agency and client accounts**; personal technical support. **Each client‚Äôs individual portfolio access. You can set up the information you wish to display to each separate client. At the same time, unlike the ordinary portfolios, the client accounts are automatically synchronized with the agency accounts, thus, performing any transactions in your agency account you won‚Äôt need to manually duplicate them in your client‚Äôs account.",False
