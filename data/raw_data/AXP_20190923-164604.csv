As many of you may know, we initially planned for the token sale to last until March 22nd. You all quickly showed us that this estimate was wrong, however, as your interest and contributions propelled our token sale forward, allowing us to reach our hardcap in only 89(!!) hours. Due to the hasty fulfillment of our hardcap, we have received the following question; ""Does this mean that nothing will happen until after March 22nd, as you are now way ahead of schedule?"". The short answer to this is ""No"". The long answer is much more exciting and prosperous. We are ahead of schedule, but this does NOT mean that we will rest on our laurels; in fact, the exact opposite is the truth. We are working day and night for aXpire and our community, and we sincerely hope you will be around to see our developments as we progress forwards. Not everything can be disclosed at a moments notice of course, but know this; we have a lot of exciting times ahead, some even right around the corner.  We are in the final stages of the distribution phase, which is still ongoing. We know that this phase has been slower than ideal, and for this; we apologize. Once this phase ends, we will be able to move at a much higher pace moving forwards as significant changes, as stated, are planned.  Remember that you can always ask us a question and we'll be here to answer you. Stay awesome, and keep an eye out for further announcements!",False
