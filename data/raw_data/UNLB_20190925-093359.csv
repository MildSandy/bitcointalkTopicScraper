In dispute case, you initiate Safe Deal and attract a third party for arbitration.

Arbitrators are anonymous and make their decisions independently of each other, which completely excludes corruption risks and accusations of bias.  All decisions taken by the arbitrators are final and not subject to appeal. Since the resolution of disputes is decentralized, for the decision, the smart contract determines the remuneration to the arbitrators in the amount of 10% of the transaction amount. Costs for payment of arbitration procedure is divided between both sides of the dispute according to the principle of inverse proportionality.",True

From our experience of negotiations with representatives of Qiwi, we concluded that the companies are already well aware of the blockchain technology, but are still wary of projects that are not so much connected with blockchain as with crypto-currencies and we normally perceive their suspicion.  Whatever it was, we have never failed the principle - any problem is solved by itself, if the task is correctly set. We have an initial version of the solution of the problem connected with the use of fiat payment systems, which I will not describe here yet. I note that this option solves not only the task associated with putting Fiat on the platform, but it reflects the very mission of Unolabo Skillmarket.  Thank you for drawing our attention to this. Because, for example, PayPal, ensuring the security of p2p-deals in fiat, is our competitor and it was unreasonable to point it out from our side. This is my fault, which I will now eliminate.",True
