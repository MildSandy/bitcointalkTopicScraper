We plan to build a large industrial platform, the capacity of which will reach up to 2,000 farms. Further, the number of calculated capacity will be increased continuously. The capacities will be used for obtaining direct profit from mining. Over the time, capacities will be leased for cloud mining.        MINING  Mining today is a long-term and highly profitable business that will remain relevant for a long time.  We are engaged in mining altcoyins such as ZCash and ETH, which are just gaining popularity and are beginning to be used in accordance with their intended purpose. The surge in activity in the field of mining now led to a rising in price and a shortage of components for mining equipment. More and more people are interested in cryptomining business, but they faced a lot of difficulties. Mining in industrial scale is very expensive and specific, mining at home is accompanied by a number of inconveniences for unprofessional miners.  However, industrial mining is discredited by the presence of unscrupulous market participants such as ""cloud mining"", according to statistics, 85% of such companies operate under the Ponzi scheme.  We are the first company today that offers to become co-owners of mining equipment, in turn, others offer their equipment for rent!

Could be wrong. This the new HODL?  Also found this nugget in the Whitepaper.  Then the surge and the rapid growth of the course of the Etherium are expected. By the way, it is the Ether can become the second crypto currency, the capitalization of which will overcome the mark of one billion dollars. At the moment, this can boast only bitcoin, the capitalization of which exceeds 14 billion.   I have no idea what this even means. Hopefully the bounty covers proof reading.  Not sure they understand how commodities work either.  Any materials, the extraction of which is limited, become more valuable - for example, the oil, the gas, the gold and so on.
