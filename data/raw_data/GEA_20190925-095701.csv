When modern commercial gold mining started in 1984, it accounted for only 1.5% of Mali’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In 1991, after a commercial mining code reflecting internationally accepted standards was implemented according to the International Development Association, commercial gold production proliferated from 4 metric tonnes that year to 48 metric tonnes in 2008.  Simultaneously, Mali relaxed the enforcement of mining codes and this led to greater foreign investment in the mining industry. From 1994 until 2007, national and international mining companies were granted approximately 150 operating licences along with more than 25 certificates for mineral exploitation and an excess of 200 research permits. Government revenue originating from mining contracts totalled less than 1% of the state’s income in 1989, but increased to nearly 18% in 2007. Rising international gold prices have also increased exploration, investment, and production in the mining sector.  The upsurge in gold prices, from an average US$ 445 per ounce in 2005 to US$ 900 per ounce in 2009, has nearly doubled Mali’s profit on gold production. This increase in the gold price has translated into higher royalties (a minimum of 3% and maximum of 65% depending on when the mine started production), profit taxes, and dividend payments.

The actual state is our licensed right and responsibility to start and pay for the 4-year rent of this land within 2 months. If we won`t start the rental according to our license, we will be fined by local authorities of Mali. After this stage risks soften and we begin to depend on the heavy machinery supply terms. If our contractor fails with machinery deployment on our site, this will cause lesions to GOLDEA. Another risk is the gold content deviation. it may be less then 10 tons, namely 5 or 7, and thus we will end our mining beforehand, but the rental period is already payed for the hole term. Etc.

Especially associated with oppressive labor in mines or quarries What is the official position of Goldea on this difficult issue?  We contract heavy machinery, and our mine is the pit-type technology without risk of cavern closure or dungeon blockage with workers down there. Moreover, the approach is ecological and social with providing additional drinking water and food supply to the surrounding villages, renting their residents at our anxilliary duties.

As I understand, gold mining is income source for large companies in the industry. On the one side, Goldea will be too small at first stages, so they won't pay attention on tiny fish. But Goldea will grew and new problems will appear. This applies to any business. As soon as there are significant volumes, there will be problems. No one wants an additional competition. This must be taken into account immediately.  Local license providers are afraid of large companies due to size and poverty of the country.
