We are preparing some great news for you guys, regarding our further cooperation as well as official APP production.  While we are waiting for an upcoming news, we decided to continue an “Ask me anything” rubric and today’s question is “World Bit Bank and VISA cooperation”  Well, to begin with, we would like to say that VISA — is the world’s second-largest card payment organization. It is an American multinational financial services corporation headquartered in California, United States. It facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards, gift cards and debit cards.  World Bit Bank is going to become the world’s first legal cryptocurrency bank. Our project is rather widespread and unique. That is why we are going to cooperate with the world’s largest and stable financial corporations in order to provide our users with the best services.  According to the projects road-map, after ICO is finished, we are going to buy an already existing bank. After that, we will implement cryptocurrencies into its activities. Each bank, we are going to buy, has all necessary agreements with VISA, so the electronic cards we will issue would be the same as usual bank cards. The difference is: you will have an opportunity to verify your transactions in cryptocurrency. It means you can create a bank account in any fiat currency or in cryptocurrency. Surely it would be also possible to pay  https://medium.com/@coinwbb/world-bit-bank-visa-cooperation-fb0f46d9d96f",False

And the electronic cards we will issue would be the same as usual bank cards. The difference is: you will have an opportunity to verify your transactions in cryptocurrency. It means you can create a bank account in any fiat currency or in cryptocurrency. Surely it would be also possible to pay either in ""usual"" currency or in cryptocurrency where it is possible.   Now our team is developing a mobile app to make it possible for you to control your transactions online Of course other bank services are also available If a store accepts cryptocurrency the transaction will be made using blockchain technology thus faster cheaper and more secure. If not you will have to use an electronic payment system such as visa or mastercard. It would be also fast and secure but most likely more expensive Here is a short illustration https://drive.google.com/file/d/15rU4RoeAwWA_voFhsQGF0n5WOkxXAX-L/view?usp=drivesdk  Thank you very much for your genuine interest.

In our case it's cryptocurrency transactions. It's completely impossible to create WBB without these licenses - it won't be legal. Our company is registered in Estonia where we've got our licenses. They are local but valid for the whole EU and for many other countries. License is a guarantee that we are on a right way and do everything legally. For our investors it's a confidence that our project is not a flimflam and we will not disappear with their money. We are not able to answer what do other companies and why they avoid licences and transparency. We confess many projects prefer such a rule: everything what is not prohibited is obviously allowed. But it's not always so. Licenses give us trust and it is the most important thing in our business.  In the nearest future we will post a video with our expert explaining licenses and why they are important for us.  Thank you for a good question. Wish you a nice day!",False

Good to see a group making it happen.    My main concern are the timelines being unbelievably ambitious to be realistic... acquiring 10 banks in just over a year. Even if you have the money I doubt it's legally/procedurally possible to move that fast; the paperwork from lawyers alone I imagine would take longer than a year to takeover 10 banks.  That said, good luck!  True transparency in baking would be revolutionary.  As for other comments like ""finally somebody making crypto legal"".  Crypto is not illegal.  Crypto cannot be illegal.  Just like cash or gold asset cannot be illegal.  If your country considers crypto a currency or an asset-of-value and you do not declare it for taxable purposes chances are you are committing a crime but the crypto itself is not illegal.  Cash is not illegal, you can use it for illegal purposes but the cash itself is not illegal.  I make this point because many outside of the crypto community think crypto is illegal which is uninformed (at best), so we should try to at least have the proper perception and terminology within the crypto community itself.",False
