Pay is heavily depended on the type of task. You first need to go through various qualifications to be able to do different types of tasks. There is also a system with multiple levels (your level will upgrade after you have finished a certain amount of tasks). I think untill level 4 (not sure on this but i guess about 15000 tasks) you will have a daily limit of 500 tasks. Coming back on a daily basis and finishing your tasks will enable you to upgrade your level and open up more and better paid tasks.,False

The stock photography platform allows content creators to connect their social media accounts to Lobster’s image and video database. The ease with which users can upload photographs and videos ensures a constant stream of unique and original content. Throughout this process, Lobster handles licensing options, which allows companies to source content without maneuvering licensing matters.  Effect Force will aim to enrich a large portion of the Lobster catalogue with accurate metadata, to provide more information for Lobster’s AI and algorithmic engines to utilize for faster, more relatable search results.

A decentralized AI network can really push the technology forward. However, I have a couple questions about the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"" part in your Lightpaper. There you claim that such a technological leap may result in a greater inequality and assume the possibility of tax on AI. Why do you think that inequality in that case is a bad thing? Indeed, that is a fact that income inequality in capatitalistic countries is growing, however it doesn't mean that poor are getting poorer. In fact, all income levels are benefitting from the economic growth. On of Effect.AI goals is to make AI technologies more accessible and affordable, which means that automation will eventually drive prices of a lot of things down. If various goods and services begin to cost less people and buinesses have more disposable income left to spend on something else and consequently these extra disposable income will create new jobs based on the people's demand. Taxing AI or machines is basically no better than any form of protectionism because in these case as soon as you gain some decrease in technology cost you instantly depreciate it by the burden of taxation. The idea of taxing machines is not a new thing and was popular in the 19th century as well, as at these time people were also afraid that machines would steal people's jobs. But we can see now that the technological progress has only resulted in the growth of prosperity and creation of new jobs. So why are you so in favor of using Effect.ai for taxation?",False

Three days remaining until EFFECT.AI Token Sale The Effect.AI Token Sale will take place on Saturday March 24 at 11am Central European Time. A lot of people have reached out to us over the last few days to ask about the bonus structure. Originally, the plan was to have a 10% bonus in place just for the beginning of the Token Sale’s second stage. However, our community members felt a bonus would be much more appropriate for Stage 1. We heard you and we agree. Therefore:  The Fair Share Distribution stage of the Token Sale will have a 10% Bonus for all participants. A calculator will be available during the Sale to calculate how many EFX (and bonus) tokens your NEO/GAS contribution will yield.  A Token Sale in Two Stages As we have explained in an earlier update, the Effect.AI Token Sale is divided in two stages. Stage 1, also known as Fair Share Distribution, will have a personal cap of 1200 euro that is reserved for each participant for the first day of the Token Sale. After 24 hours have elapsed, Stage 2 of the Token Sale begins. The second stage allows you to fill an additional allocation up to 25,000 (twenty-five thousand) euro.  Stage 2 EFX tokens are sold on a first come, first serve basis.  Safety and security We ask that you remain vigilant with regards to possible scams. We will not ask you to transfer funds before the Token Sale or via any other means than the Token Sale itself. If you do experience problems leading up to (or during) the Token sale, contact support@effect.ai for assistance.  https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@effectai/update-now-10-bonus-for-all-stage-1-token-sale-participants",False

Sally’s addition to Effect.AI’s Board of Advisors is their third board announcement this week. Preceding her were bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem and The Bee Token co-founder and CTO Tony Tran.

As a prominent thinker in the field of disruptive technologies, Sally has a proven track record in identifying industries that are poised to create significant advancements. Furthermore, her deep connections in many different communities will prove invaluable when attracting workers for The Effect Mechanical Turk.  Why Effect.AI?  Effect.AI is an Amsterdam-based project that is working on a decentralized network for Artificial Intelligence and AI related services on the NEO blockchain. Sally explains her reasons for becoming an Effect.AI Advisor as follows:  ‘Given my confidence in blockchain as a highly disruptive technology, I was keen to identify a project that can harness blockchain’s potential to open up opportunity and really start pushing the boundaries of transformation. Effect.AI does exactly that. The decentralized platform for AI development combines multiple emerging and disruptive fields to create something radically new, democratic and potentially of huge benefit to society — by including groups that remain underrepresented. Effect.AI is pushing the innovation of artificial intelligence from too often behind closed doors, to open, accessible and centre stage’.  Sally’s role as an Advisor  Effect.AI is excited to welcome Sally Eaves to its Board of Advisors. Her experience will prove key in finding the right partners for the project and making sure its potential to reach multiple layers of society is realized. As Effect.AI’s platform is not just for programmers, but for users and workers as well, Sally will assist in making sure the project’s benefits will be available to as many people as possible. Especially those who, traditionally, never had the opportunity to interact with these technologies or reap their transformational benefits.

When it comes to influential thinkers in the cryptocurrency space, few have left a  bigger mark than Brooklyn born and raised entrepreneur Charlie Shrem. Back when  Bitcoin was still in its infancy, Charlie co-founded BitInstant, one of the first places  where users could exchange Bitcoin for traditional funds. Now 28, Charlie’s  considerable experience with cryptocurrency, its key players and its opportunities  make him an invaluable asset for any project that’s out to make a name for itself in  the realm of blockchain.   On advising for EFFECT.AI   Effect.AI is an Amsterdam-based project that is working on a decentralized network  for Artificial Intelligence and AI related services on the NEO blockchain. It was when  Effect.AI announced its plans for the network’s first phase, the Effect Mechanical  Turk, that Charlie Shrem became interested in joining the project. Charlie on joining  Effect.AI: “It’s been a dream of mine to build a decentralized Mechanical Turk for a  long time and I have always felt it was one the best possible use cases for crypto.  Effect.AI is working hard to make this dream a reality and I’m very excited to have  joined the team.”   Added value   Charlie Shrem’s added value to Effect.AI cannot be overstated. As an advisor, Charlie  will 1. leverage his know-how to aid Effect.AI in creating a resilient, lasting and open  platform for AI development and 2. assist in the acquisition of strategic partners that  will make that possible. Charlie will meet with key members of the team twice a week  to discuss progress on current objectives and propose alterations if necessary.

We have also deployed this algorithm on the websites of international brands. His master thesis was based on this algorithm. So we can compete with even the highest AI devs BUT!... We are NOT building AI here people! If you read what we are building you will realise that this is a platform to aid in the development of AI. We are not creating AI itself. So a more important question on our experience is how good are we at building platforms. Answer: We're fucking great at it!

That’s less than a day from now! It’s been a real rollercoaster and the Effect.AI team is stoked to reach this landmark moment. To make it even more exciting, we will reward the first 200 Whitelist applicants with a limited edition Effect.AI t-shirt! To make sure everything goes smoothly for the Effect.AI Whitelist, we are implementing a strict know-your-customer (KYC) procedure. This document will tell you exactly what to expect and what to prepare for.  Restrictions Before you consider signing up for the Effect.AI Whitelist, please be aware of the following restrictions:  ● Regrettably, citizens from the following territories cannot sign up for the Whitelist or participate in the Public Token Sale: Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea), Ethiopia, Iran, Iraq, the People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea (South Korea), Sri Lanka, Syria, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Vanuatu, Yemen and the United States of America. ● You must be at least 18 years of age.   Requirements  If these restrictions do not apply to you and you want to sign up for the Effect.AI Whitelist, here are the things you will need to prepare for:  ● You will need to submit valid identification. The following identification documents are accepted: passport, identity card, driver’s license or a residence permit. ● When using an internationally accepted ID card, you will be asked to scan both sides of the document. ● You will be required to submit a clear photo of yourself (a selfie). On this photo, you will need to be identifiable as the same individual that’s on the identification documents. Remove hats and accessories.   Make sure both the identification documents and the selfie are clear enough to read, mind your fingers and prevent excessive glare from flash photography.  ● A valid NEO wallet address is required. Generating a new wallet before participating is safest. We recommend the NEON wallet. A tutorial will be made available to you through the whitelist URL.   For your safety Effect.AI will go to great lengths to prevent scammers from targeting any of our community members. In addition, these are some of the things you need to be aware of to participate in the Whitelist safely:  ● https://www.effect.ai is the only correct URL. Visually confirm this is the URL you’re using when signing up for the Whitelist. The exact Whitelist link will be communicated once it goes live to prevent scamming. ● Bookmark our website. Always check the URL and make sure it’s secured with the green lock icon. ● Beware of any links you receive through email. Scammers can make it look like an official URL, only to redirect elsewhere. ● Effect.AI will not ask you to transfer funds during the Whitelist process. Neither will we do so on Telegram, Reddit, by email or on any other channel. We will explain how to safely transfer funds in the runup to the Public Token Sale (exact date TBA). ● If you have problems filling in the whitelist form, go to our official Telegram channel (https://t.me/effectai) and contact an admin. ● Be wary of anybody contacting you without asking them for help first. ● Also be wary of fake admins using official looking avatars. Real admins will never ask you to transfer funds or ask for your private key. ● Our team will monitor the official Telegram group throughout the Whitelist process to assist you with any trouble. ● Only use the form on our official website. Any other forms are fake. ● Effect.AI will never ask for your private key.   If you have any questions, please join our Telegram channel and contact one of our admins. We hope to see all of you on Wednesday for the Effect.AI Whitelist!  Effect.ai T.me/effectai Facebook.com/effectai Twitter.com/effectaix Github.com/effectai",False

Hot on the heels of yesterday’s announcement of Charlie Shrem’s advisory role at Effect.AI is yet another high-profile addition to Effect.AI’s Board of Advisors. Co-founder and CTO of The Bee Token, Tony Tran, is coming on board to provide valuable input in the areas of machine learning, computer vision and blockchain technology. Tran is well known for his involvement in The Bee Token, a blockchain-powered short-term housing rentals platform. His background in artificial intelligence and blockchain technology will add tremendous value to Effect.AI and its plans for decentralized AI development.  On becoming an advisor for Effect.AI  Effect.AI is an Amsterdam-based project that is working on a decentralized network for Artificial Intelligence and AI related services on the NEO blockchain. Tony expressed great interest in the way Effect.AI has prioritized making its platform open and accessible:  “The Bee Token was founded to solve real problems for real people. Everyone knows how complicated the housing situation is in San Francisco and when people start using The Bee Token, we should be able to alleviate some of those problems. We couldn’t do that until the technology was there though and you see something similar with Effect.AI: they are on the verge of utilizing blockchain technology to give everyone access to something that previously simply wasn’t accessible in this way. I’m very excited to help them launch their project.”  What Tony can do for Effect.AI  As a veteran advisor with a strong background in machine learning, Tony Tran is perfectly suited to advise the Effect.AI team during development and, perhaps even more importantly, assist in the acquisition of strategic partners that will further strengthen the Effect.AI project. Tony will be consulting with the team on a regular basis.  Join the Effect.AI Whitelist now  Effect.AI’s Whitelist went live earlier today. Interest has been overwhelming, but there’s still room for you to reserve a spot on the Whitelist. The Whitelist is available on the Effect.AI website. Before heading there, you can read this release to learn more about the requirements. The rest will be explained to you during the process.

The Token Sale has a soft cap goal of 4,820,000 euro. The hard cap is set at 14,820,000 euro. Due to overwhelming interest in the project, we expect to hit these targets before the Token Sale's end date. The challenge, however, is reaching these goals with the aid of a well-balanced group of reputable participants. This objective informed the way Effect.AI's whitelist and KYC (know-your-customer) process is structured.  Building a resilient and enduring platform  Effect.AI wants to build an AI development platform that will stand the test of time. To do that, we have to design a platform that is highly resistant to outside influence or manipulation by third parties. Because that necessarily means preventing whales and syndicates from acquiring a controlling interest in the project, the first step towards creating a healthy foundation lies in a strict whitelist and KYC process.  When can you expect the whitelist?  The team is putting the finishing touches on the whitelist as we speak, so hang in there! We expect to open registration somewhere in the coming weeks. As always, Effect.AI's Telegram users will get a head-start. Join us on Telegram.  What else is happening?  Our team attended the Anarchapulco event in Acapulco, Mexico last week.

I have a burning question - just would like to have a better understanding. Could you please prepare a simlified version of explanation about Galaxy Pool and its liquidity function? Thanks in advance  A: The Galaxy Pool will allow any user to easily sell or acquire EFX tokens. This ensures that using the Effect Network will be possible even when liquidity is low (when it's hard to buy or sell EFX on external markets). To ensure that this pool is not abused by traders, buying and selling tokens with it is restricted to people that use services on the network. An other advantage of the Galaxy Pool is that it maintains a stable exchange rate for EFX, so people or algorithms that make EFX on the network have more security on the value of their earnings.  ~Jesse  Q: When is whitelist open?  permalink embedsave reportgive goldreply  A: We are working to create a fair whitelist for everyone and we will announce the whitelist a few days in advance. We want everybody to have a chance to participate in our tokensale and keep the big whales out.  ~Laurens  Q: Hey Chris, I'm intrigued about the project but I have a couple of questions:  1) With respect none of your team have experience in running a business which can generally be mitigated by having a strong advisory team. However at this time none have been announced?  2) How close are you to an alpha?  Thanks and hope to hear back...  A: Members of the team have extensive experience and knowledge of running successful businesses. We will release our advisory board members 1 week before the token sale. We are working closely with them now and they have been providing incredible support and knowledge.We are finalizing the prototype release now. Effect M-Turk prototype will be followed by the Alpha release shortly thereafter. We aim to have the Beta on NEO release by the end of Q2 this year. ~Chris",False

Please find quotes below and our updated roadmap.  Quote Chris | Effect.AI:  ""Hey! The road map is on page 14 of the light paper I believe. And as for advisors, we have them but dont feel the need to announce them right now. There is a smoke and mirrors show with crypto projects. We have found that most advisors on projects are paid for their picture and thats where the partnership stops. All of our advisors actually advise us on our project and we look at them as partners. That said, we will announce them eventually. We have fantastic people working on and with this project. Also, we have been approached by the big players, one being the BIG player and we are not open to parnerships with them. The smaller AI entities like start-ups, Universities and mid size AI development firms are our focus.""  ""Our team has grown to 14 most of which are high level developers. We also have partnerships with tech companies that will be released to the public soon😉 The lead devs on the Effect.AI are more then capable of driving this ship to the full realization of our vision.""",False

After reading the whole whitepaper and speaking to the team - Let me recount some of the much needed great strategic choices they made:  The Galaxy Pool - this pool is used to ensure some form of liquidity in the beginning, which is harder to find in most new ICOs, but most importantly - since the prices there can be monitored, this pool is the best protection against pump-and-dump schemes. If a pump starts - it inevitably will stop when it reaches the Galaxy Pool's rate. This helps protect the new token from FUD stemming from those pumps-and-dumps.  The Honor system - this system makes achieving quality data for AI and ML much easier - you can choose a threshold amount of honor for those who provide your data, ensuring the quality of that data, and rewarding trusted data producers.  Community reach - the team is the most responsive and outreaching ICO team I've seen yet - they answer all questions, and give the community a chance to contribute to the future of this platform - like choosing a new name for the token.  No pre-sale - the ICO will be available to the whole public, with a cap of 25000€ per participant. This is basically a superwhale-protection, that ensures that the system stays as most decentralized as possible.   All in all, as I said - this is the #1 ICO to participate in and contribute to. I'm definitely in - and you? ",False

Artificial Intelligence is with the blockchain one of the most exciting and disrupting technology (according to PWC Artificial Intelligence could contribute up to 15 trillions $ to the global economy). Not a week goes by without an article about new achievements made in AI. The power that AI could bring in the future is scary if only a few organization control it such as Amazon, Google or governments.  In order to decentralize the knowledge around AI. Elon Musk created Open AI that enables people to share discoveries and knowledge in Artificial Intelligence. But there is a problem with Open Ai it brings only one part of the equation. With OpenAI you can share knowledge but you don't have a decentralized marketplace where you can offer and ask for programmes to perform AI task.  That's why we need Effect.ai because it will complete the equation to fully decentralize AI.   Also, I want to highlight some of the green lights of this ICO such as the low hard cap (1 482 000€), maximum investment of 25k€, a team with great knowledge in AI.

Effect plans to address these problems by creating what they call the Effect Network. Like other decentralized applications, the platform connects supply and demand while removing third parties (which add to complexity and expense of development).  The infrastructure they are building is a three-tiered platform that will include a decentralized Mechanical Turk which will help to train AI programs in an easier to use and cheaper environment, an AI marketplace and a decentralized AI platform to facilitate operability.

My questions: Workers will get paid in the AIX coin, correct? How will you manage your token such that the price (and thus the workers' income) is not that volatile? There's quite limited information about the technology behind your platform. Can you be more specific on how you integrate your platform on NEO's blockchain? Why did you choose NEO over, for example, the Ethereum blockchain? Where is your roadmap? Just mentioning the phases is not sufficient. What are the expected dates/months to start/finish? How much money is involved per milestone/phase and for what? Around 22% of your tokens go to the advisors and your team. Sorry, but I think that is ridiculously high. What's the reason for this amount? You guys give so less information about the distribution of the proceeds, that it is unclear for my why you need around 15 million. Can you clarify?
