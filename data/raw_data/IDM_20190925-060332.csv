IDM service provides a decentralized distributed cloud data storage system where the security of data both, from loss and theft, is provided by the unique SIZE algorithm. To procure the distributed data storage, the service will rent a free memory from miners for a reward. The miners all over the world would be able to lease a memory on their devices, including devices morally and technically obsolete (old smartphones, dated hard disks) and receive a continuous remuneration. Our patented algorithm SIZE supports an excellent protection of a file from loss (corruption) and can guarantee a file recovery from only 2% of the remaining data. Administration of the service will be managed by blockchain technology. The properties of SIZE, in information recovery, favorably differ from traditional and widespread methods, like 3 or 4-fold Backup or replication, embedded in Hadoop, ZFS file systems from Google, Luster, etc. The SIZE encoding algorithm can provide the same level of safety with much less redundancy.  The use of SIZE technology can significantly reduce the gap between the amount of generated digital information and the amount of available storage. If we are talking about safety, i can tell that in the security of storage SIZE technology has parameters incomparably better than all existing crypto algorithms.
