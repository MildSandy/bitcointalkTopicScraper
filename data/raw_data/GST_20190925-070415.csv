Dear friends! Many of you have probably thought of launching your own tournament on Game Stars platform. This is why today we will tell you how to do it. Game Stars platform tends to solve eSports market problems. One of these problems is a difficulty of own tournaments organization. It means both financial spendings and physical efforts.  The goal of Game Stars is to provide growth opportunities for beginner and proficient cyber sportsmen.  How to launch your tournament in 3 simple steps?  1) Click on the start!  Any Game Stars platform user can launch own tournament, select its name, date, and other settings.  For example, it’s up to the organizer whether the tournament will be held in accordance with the Olympic or circular system. The organizer also defines the rate of the entrance fee, number of participants, conditions that allow participating in competitions (open/closed tournament for certain people), the way of distributing the winnings, etc.  2) Select entrance fee  All terms of the tournament are registered in a smart-contract issued by the platform. Thanks to the hash conditions can be checked if there is any disagreement between participants.  After that, each participant pays the entrance fee in GST tokens. Each of them can grant different amount. If the number of interested does not reach the required minimum, the smart contract will automatically return entrance fees.  3) ...Get a reward!  At the end of the tournament, the platform records its results in a smart contract that automatically transfers prize money to the winners. At the same time, 3% of the prize fund is credited to Game Stars platform as a service fee.  If players have contributed different amounts of the entrance fee, the distribution of the winnings depends on shares of each participant.  Please note: the tournament can only be launched if there are GST tokens on the balance. It’s another reason to buy tokens right now! Token Sale will last until June 9th. After the end of sales, all tokens will be burned and there will be a possibility to purchase them only on exchanges at a higher price Immediately after its completion, all tokens will be burned, and they can be purchased only on the exchange, at a much higher price.",False

In 2015 Russian-based news portal Dota2.net has published a list of top-10 mistakes made by eSports organizations while looking for a sponsor. Nothing really has changed since then. That’s why Game Stars platform is made for solving existing problems of eSports. Let’s have a look at some of them:  Lack of official contracts  Too many cyber athletes want so bad to get a sponsorship support that they simply forget about keeping their rights safe. An official contract is a must in any business relations. Game Stars protects rights of platform’s users with the help of a smart contract. More information about the smart contract is available in the White Paper.  Lack of platforms that unite gamers and sponsors  It’s not that easy to find a sponsor, especially when there are not that many online spaces that connect cyber sportsmen and potential investors. Game Stars provides a common platform for all eSports market participants. Gamers can now find a sponsor and raise funding for their professional development. Sponsors can support promising cyber athletes and get a share of their income. It’s a win-win situation.  Follow the news and participate in Game Stars Token Sale. Only 1 day left!",False

Yobit is popular for its friendly user interface and enhanced security features.  - Game Stars incorporates the VReS  Virtual Reality platform Virtual Reality adds some adrenaline to gaming, and Game Stars appreciates the important role that VR plays in the gaming industry. That's why they are partnering with VReS, one of the world's largest VR platforms that boasts of having over 15 million gamers. VReS is used by over 3000 stores worldwide.  VReS is revolutionary because it allows gamers to perform multi-device matchmaking, earning tokens as a prize. VReS also allows spectators to watch and place bets on teams and players.  - Organizing a joint tournament with FLUX Blockchain is popular because it's a decentralized technology that keeps a traceable record of all transactions. GameStars and FLUX will organize a joint tournament where GameStars' smart contract will be used to comply with the rules of the tournament and to distribute the prizes among its winners.  - Game Stars is minimizing fraud There's no denying that fraud is the bane of the gaming industry.

According to statistics there are more than 1.8 billion gamers in the world today. The number is really impressive, so every 4 inhabitant of Earth is a player. And we talk not only about fans of online games, but also players on mobile devices, consoles and PC.  Game Stars is an eSports platform based on the blockchain system. We are developing and attracting more and more gamers all over the world. We have already received more than 14,285 applications for smart contracts and this number is increasing every day. We placed vacancies for gamers on the appropriate resources to find a job to make sure of the interest from the gaming community. More than 100 people have responded to our vacancy, which is an absolute record and confirms the interest of gamers to the Game Stars platform.  Today we offer our readers to get acquainted with the gamer Rikirino, who agreed to talk with us and share his story of success in the field of gaming.  “I am Rikirino and I have more than 4000 hours in Counter Strike. Well, to be honest, I think I spent much more time in this game. I'm 21 years old and my employment allows me to move from anywhere, to do anything I like.  My achievements:  - Rank G (esea) and level 10 Faceit. I have a lot of experience with teams in tournaments and cups on the Internet. - I won several faceit cups, Esl and PvPro cups and gained a lot of experience in the leagues on esea/cevo and others”.  When did you decide to be a professional player?  It all started when I was about 10 years old. I did not have a PC at home, so I went to play in an Internet café. I remember myself playing Warcraft III, I also decided to try myself in CS 1.6 and just fell in love. In those days I had no idea about eSports. When I was growing up, this area was not as huge as it is today. So I played Warcraft III The frozen throne (dota) and lots, lots of CS more than 7-8 years Then the long hours of staying in CS:Go began. I started to spend a lot of time and effort to learn more things about this game. Unexpectedly I got an offer from the team to join their roster. After the start of our cooperation, they said: ""You have a lot of potential, friend.""  Tell us about the time when you realized that this is more than a game?  I was streaming and fans started showing up. They watched how I play, wrote nice comments, admiring my skill, and asked questions about improving their skills in CS:GO. They inspired me to practice more, and the moment came when I realized that games were more than just fun after work.  Why do gamers retire so early? Is it due to professional burnout or age?  To my opinion, this is due to professional burnout and the pressure they get from everyone (organizers, fans, sponsors and others). Age is not a problem, I guess.  How many hours per day do you spend on training?  It is much less now. I have other work to do while I used to practice CS:GO every day. Now everything depends on my mood and desire. If I'm tired I can spend some CS:GO demos/matches.  Is there a chance for an ordinary player to find sponsorship and reach the highest level?  Usually the player has no chance to find any sponsorship, but they have a good chance to get into the organization/community and start from there. It is a good background for their launching to the top level. I got acquainted with Game Stars project and realized that you solve such kind of problems.  A lot of brands want to get into this area with the growing interest in e-sports. Can they succeed on this platform and become more than just sponsors?  Brands can do much more than act as sponsors. They have the opportunity to influence the eSports. They can create their own teams and idk leagues. Just think about the Nike or Audi League with decent marketing they can have a huge impact on our cyber aren. For example, as a League of Mountain Dew.  What innovations do you want to see in the eSports world in the future? Can the blockchain become the solution to all cyber challenges?  Well, the innovation that I hope to see in the eSports world is the interest of mass media to our tournaments, because people can find information about eSports apart from the Internet. I think all the media (newspapers, radio, television) should promote our ideas and cover the cyber competition. You say blockchain… Well! If blockchain can be the solution to all eSports problems, then it will definitely help eSports, am I right? That’s why, I sincerely hope that Game Stars platform will be able to implement all its plans.   We are grateful to Rikirino for an honest interview and hope that it will inspire thousands of  begginers not to give up and go to their goal. Game Stars platform is ready to help gamers solve their problems and offer new opportunities for development in the eSports field.  4 days left before the end of the token sale.

As you know, there is a problem of wages delays to cyber sportsmen in the eSports world. Many successful players gave up working with cyber game companies due to this reason.  Popular eSports players Alexey Bakumenko, Nikolay Velichko, Alexey Barsukov and Vladislav Sinotov terminated contracts with their former employer and started to play for Team Spirit. The reason was that they didn’t get a salary for 4 months.  Game Stars solves this problem with the help of smart contract:  - Smart contract is based on blockchain technology and protects gamers from non-payment of rewards.  - Cyber sportsmen can start the Cyberathlete Initial Coin Offering (CICO) process and sell personal cyberathlete tokens. This procedure simplifies players’ search for funds which they can spend on their professional development. All details are recorded in smart contract.  -Smart contract is reliable: every transaction is logical and transparent.  -Players rights are protected by the contract: they have stable payment guarantees.  Start your career in the eSports with Game Stars platform!",False

If you still didn’t get your GST, it’s about time.  Game Stars platform not only solves eSports market problems but is also taking care of its token to grow in value.  There are at least 5 reasons for that:  1. GST is in great demand. The pre-sale stage had a complete sold-out. 2. The emission is limited to 500 million tokens. There won’t be enough GST for everyone willing to buy them. 3. Only 14.285 profi-users need to register on the platform to cause a shortage of tokens. Over 10000 requests from gamers have been already received! 4. Tokens that get to the platform will be frozen for 2 years. 5. Cryptocurrency exchanges YoBit and WEX have already supported the token. GST will be listed on the exchanges as soon as the Token Sale is over. New users will buy tokens from GST-holders at a higher price.  Don’t hesitate!

You're not the only one with this case. It happened because you didn't read the important information while purchasing tokens via ETH.  So the rule says: Make sure the wallet you have indicated supports operations with ERC 20 tokens. To prevent any loss of transferred funds, do not use exchange wallets for transfers.  You paid for GST tokens with your Exchange wallet. And here's the problem.  If you pay by BTC, GST is shown in your GST account, BUT if you pay by ETH, system automatically sends them to user's wallet.  But your wallet was an exchange wallet. GST tokens were send exactly to exchange, because of the rules of smart-contract.  Every person can see warning to not pay from exchange wallet to not lose his investments, so now only your exchange has access to GST that you have bought, so please contact them - only exchange support can help you at the moment!
