Our resources on Earth are not as abundant as it once was. It may be true to many that we go about our daily lives not thinking about it as it might not affect our lives directly. Yet. There is however clear evidence showing that if we do not act and do something about our water consumption the world will suffer a severe water deficit. According to UNESCO, 90% of all wastewater in developing countries is dumped, untreated straight into the ecosystem causing major environmental and health risks. We invested heavily in award winning technologies that enable communities to treat their water and have done so with pride. Unfortunately, having award winning technologies is not enough these days. To receive financing for projects of this sort is very challenging nowadays due to several factors like political pressures, centralised banking structures and potential geographical risks. Even though the market has massive potential, the knowledge regarding the existence of these technologies seem to pass relatively unseen by local communities. This usually stems from the fact that politicians and other public in stitutions are tied financially due to low budgets and little knowledge.  This is where we believe in the Blockchain technology and its community. We believe that in such cases where a centralised system interferes with the greater good of the people, people should have the chance to take matters into their own hands. A decentralised system can give us all the power to change the way in which water is treated and  distributed, in all areas of the world and in all walks of life. Most importantly it’s all about doing so in an affordable and environmentally friendly way.   What are Aqua Tokens  The utility token acts as a frictionless tool to give the right people access to clean water from Sansox’s solutions. The utility tokens purpose for municipalities, housing associations and private real estate owners is to get cheaper, clean water. 1 Aqua Token = 1m³/ 1,000L/ 264 Gallon of clean treated water.  ICO: Dates and Pricing Pre-ICO is live:   1 Token = USD 0.10 ICO starts on 10.09.2018:   1 Token = USD 0.15   How to get Aqua Tokens  Via Waves Platform. The Aqua Token can be found on the WAVES Platform on DEX (WAVES' own decentralised exchange). https://www.sansoxico.com/payment-platform To be able to purchase the token you need to own a WAVES Wallet.

There is a clear benefit of using Sansox products when comparing to the existing conventional technologies.  1.   10 times cheaper than the conventional methods 2.   Using the Sansox Oxtube solution is 5 times more energy efficient 3.   Sansox’s technologies yield a 25% higher saturation than other brands 4.   Easier to remove unwanted particles and chemicals form water 5.   Works for potable, process and waste water treatment   The OxTube  The OxTube provides a competitive alternative to traditional aeration methods, especially towards the end of the treatment process. With the help of the Oxtube, the mixing of chemical agents can be achieved effectively. The aeration process is guaranteed to minimise the problems that arise at municipal wastewater treatment plants. The OxTube can be used throughout the process, as aeration should be at a consistent level throughout. Instead of utilizing liquefied oxygen to keep oxygen levels high throughout the whole cleaning process, the OxTube can aerate the process several times, whilst also reacting to rapid increases in oxygen demand. At the same time, odor problems can be minimised as the need for open tanks is reduced. In different industries, the OxTube can be used to dissolve gases such as air, pure oxygen, ozone and Carbon dioxide into water sources to enable the extraction of dissolved iron, mangania etc. The PH of the process can also be controlled by dissolving chemicals such as H2O2 and CO2 into the water source. The OxTube can also dissolve other chemicals in liquefied or gas form into the process. This will help mineral collection in the OX-Flotation tank.    The SaoxFuge  The SaoxFuge separates solids of different sizes. 0-fibers are a good example of solids that can be collected from wastewater, simultaneously increasing overall efficiency through their reuse and lowering the cleaning demand at the end of the process. With the usage of a separator, a solid content of 0,45 % can be increased to 25-30 % for subsequent reuse in the process. A spiral separator, which separates liquids and solids of the liquid to different layers based on gravity or density of the materials. The separation is based in spiral flow of the liquid, which provides sufficient centrifugal force to a sediment organization of the components in the tube. Heavy components are separated by the centrifugal force of the spiral flow towards outer surface of the spiral pipe, and further to the final destination, which is an extension of the spiral and the outlet pipe. The outlet tube skims away the desired heavier material layer and leads it to the desired location or further processing.     VOX-flotation  VOX-flotation provides a new way of separating unwanted solids from water. Compared to conventional flotation system, VOX-Flotation does not need any dispersion water, as all cleaned water goes through the aeration process. The system is able to double flocks and solids collection with roughly halved energy consumption when compared to present advanced systems. It can be utilized also for difficult concentrate waters, produced e.g. by pulp and paper mills. This concept allows also getting rid of large waste water container pools with their energy consuming equipment.

In reality it is not hard to deliver the solution in terms of demand.  The big challenge is to get financing in FIAT for this kinds of projects.  Some challenges could be for example. Political pressures, Centralised Banking and potential geographical risks and the list goes on and on..  With a decentralised system and own currency supported by the Blockchain we are certain we can move in the right direction and that is delivering water to the people that needs it most.
