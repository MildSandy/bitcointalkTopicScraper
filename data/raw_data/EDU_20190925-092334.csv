At least until the token is not attractive enough for the top tier exchanges.

Thank you fo this question, people are asking it from time to time.  So here's the fun fact - there's no heavy competition (yet!). Why? Because companies such as Sony Global Education prefer to build corporate software, private blockchain integrations that is paying out faster. They go from institution to institution to implement their blockchain credentialing solutions as-a-service, instead of building an open, end user-oriented platform. It is understandable why - you can build one open platform for all or get a contract from 1000 institutions one-by-one to work on substituting their current databases with smart ledgers (which will give you some pretty good income if you are a services company). The competitors prefer the latter. We stick to what matters and therefore we remain unique - we help learners claim and advance their academic and professional identity beyond institutional and national borders by providing them with a global competence passport on the immutable blockchain.

But on the other hand, according to my personal point of view - I understand the initial WINGS's idea and its basics in another way. It was supposed to be a community work of research, due diligence of the projects listed in order to outline the best ICOs and help other investors recognise them. Please correct me if I am wrong.  We all know that the community feedback is the most valuable in terms of validation the idea, vision, team and so on. And the reward was given to incentivise them to work more on that but it shouldn't be the only purpose for them to do it. What is the impression I remained with? Well, no one looked into our project, discuss it - just a few people were interested to read in order to prove their reward is included in the smart contract. Very few people discussed the idea behind our project. Even our Project lead was irritated when people started flagging our project the previous time... with the only reason - the reward may not have been given to the community! Our more than 3 years of work meant nothing - all the research that was performed, all the events we've attended, all the efforts we've put into were gone for seconds because of the reward of 3%...  Well, talking as a member from the OS.University team - we actually decided to use more than one similar to Wings platforms and we've allocated part of our budget for those platforms. We highly appreciate the WINGS community therefore we took your feedback seriously. But we'd like to receive valuable feedback as well. Having said that, please have a look at your community Telegram chat - isn't it the same talk again  From our side everything is okay! Our platform really needs exposure but most of all we need to have valuable feedback from the community - that's what we are looking for. What are you looking for? The best projects on the market or else...?  I am still available to answer all your questions Peace!  Best, Teddy",False

Open Source University helps learners claim & advance their educational identity beyond borders by providing world's first immutable educational passport as a service on the blockchain. We are providing Universities and MOOC's with the opportunity to store, validate and verify their learners certificates on the Blockchain without the need of a third party. There fore our business is not related to education content creation, we are not educational platform in the meaning of content provider but rather the missing part to bridge the gap between Businesses and Academia.  The EDU token is the motor of this platform and allows you to store your certificates on the blockchain with zero fees. Thus you could have all your diplomas, certificates and achievements immutably stored and available worldwide. More about the tokenomics you could find in our Pitch deck - https://os.university/static/pitch-deck.pdf  I am available if you need more information!  Cheers, Teddy",False

There are more than 5 reasons why we are using Blockchain to build Open Source University platform. Some of them are authenticity, decentralising trust, less bureaucracy, direct interaction, security.  But let's us first get back to the meaning of the word ""plagiarism"". A simple example would be the case of me having a diploma from Boston University and you pretending to be me and having the same paper, right? We solve this problem by providing certification rights to the Boston University which means that they are the only authority to validate and verify my diploma on the blockchain. Once the transaction for initiating a new diploma (meaning mine, as it is the first one in our example) is been processed on the Blockchain, this action can not be undone - that's what we call immutable storage. If you pretend to have the same diploma like mine, first you need to convince Boston University as certification authority that basically You are Me, and that's the first thing and even if you succeed they have to try to rewrite the document and release a second one - which is impossible thanks to the technology.  Talking about identity in general. That's not a thing we are working on. But if you mean educational identity then we have the same case as the plagiarism but this time we include all the skills and achievements of a person. In this case you have to convince everybody that You are ME and also to try to change the ""blocks"" in the blockchain which is practically impossible.  To read more on the topic of why we use Blockchain in Open Source University, read the following blog post by our CTO (https://medium.com/the-os-university-blog/5-reasons-why-blockchain-is-the-right-technology-for-edtech-6164d3ee676f) or download the book of our Project lead, Hristian - ""Academia 4.0: University on the Blockchain"" for free from here - https://os.university/book  I hope to have answered your question  Teddy",False

Thank you for this question, actually a lot of people want to know the answer  The amount of tokens to be sold on both private and public pre-sale before the main tokensale was 3700 ETH. This is occasionally labeled as a soft-cap on different listing platforms, considering that it is a target for the pre-sale. However, as we have always communicated, we do not have a set milestone of minimum ETH to be raised, because we are a dedicated R&D team of academicians and software developers that is executing this project for the good part of the last 3 years, with co-financing by the European Commission. We have a mix of financing instruments to back the project, therefore no real soft caps, but clear set of targets to achieve.

We are not a University and the content in the platform is provided by MOOC's and Universities. Their courses and Programs could be online and traditional. What is more important is the easy transaction of achievements and skills - certifications and diplomas. OS.University helps learners claim and advance their academic and professional identity beyond borders by providing them a learning and development passport as a service on the immutable blockchain.  Our certified users are the Universities and the MOOC's - the institutions that provide those certificates. OS.University is not a Certification Authority. Therefore you could see your diplomas validated and verified by the University you've graduated and it is going to be accessible any time in the Open Source University platform.  Businesses on the other side will be able to see, upon request of course, your educational stored value and provide you with better career opportunities.  Let me know if you need more information!
