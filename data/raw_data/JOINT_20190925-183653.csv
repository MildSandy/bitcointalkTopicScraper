Starting from the day one, we are completely focused on developing our first product, Joint Comments. We will be announcing our first publishers during ICO period, that will enable our product to reach millions of people.  Regarding listing our token on exchanges, we are about to shake hands with two reliable international exchanges, ranking in the top 25 and top 100 respectively according to the market volume. We will also list our token in Turkey as well with a very well known exchange.  Working with the right team is essential for ICO marketing to reach the top-line audience. We are very well aware of that fact and therefore we will go for a paid marketing process for our ICO period, token sale.  Private Sale and 25% Bonus  Our team is working hard to stay focused on the project and that leverages us upon agreements with exchanges to comply with their standards.  These agreements are necessary for Joint Ventures to succeed but of course they require funding. We are aiming for reaching 500 Ethereum on our private sale to list our token on these exchanges.  As we mentioned on our website the price of Joint token was arranged as 1 ETH = 8.000 Joint. For the private sale period it will be set as 1 ETH = 10.000 Joint, corresponds to a 25% bonus.  ICO sale period is in between 7 April — 7 May & Pre-sale period will end on 6th of April.  Join our private sale to take advantage of your early contribution!

Our aim is to create an economy that rewards every participant of the network, including publishers, authors, commenters, advertisers, and moderators, while minimizing third-party commissions.  ▄▄▄▄▄ JOINT PRODUCTS  Our first product is designed as a commenting solution, created for the benefits of both publishers and commenters. Joint commenting solution will run on websites with millions of monthly visitors, enabling a new token economy where publishers will be gaining Joint tokens based on the quality of the content.  This will be followed with our other in-line products; Ad Exchange, Content Discovery and Affiliate Platform. All of these products will run on Joint token which is an erc-20 based token that will be tradeable on multiple cryptocurrency exchanges.  Our goal is to use the proceeds of token sales for creating a global content ecosystem that follows the principle of collective growth. In line with this goal, here is the roadmap we will follow;    ▄▄▄▄▄ CONTENT ECONOMY and DIGITAL ADVERTISING AT THE PRESENT  Digital advertising is mainly controlled by Google and Facebook. These giant companies are increasing their profit margin every year since they have exclusive access for users’ data. Likewise, they get the biggest share on the advertisement budget as 60 cent out of 1 dollar remains in their platform, which should be distributed among publishers, authors and commenters.  Additionally, typical commenting solutions are obsolete in terms of distribution of money. Money flows from advertisers to publishers but not before the commenting systems like Disqus takes its own cut. Joint will take advantages of Blockchain to calculate the contribution of each participant including the commenters, publishers and advertisers and reward them by minimizing third party commissions.    ▄▄▄▄▄ BLOCKCHAIN ECONOMY FOR ONLINE PUBLISHERS  Blockchain technology has seen a massive adoption in the past couple of years. Joint content economy is leveraging the power of blockchain technology to create a transparent and secure ecosystem.  We are aware of that commenters play a crucial role with online publishers by actively participating in the discussion and spreading content on the internet. Until now, very few platforms reward them for their contribution, which seems unfair. Joint is ready to fill this gap with its commenting solution that rewards network participants for their valuable contributions.  The next addition to our content economy will be a platform that puts both publishers and advertisers on the same page. It will allow publishers to monetize their online content inside the commenting areas. For advertisers, our platform will allow them to choose their placements and time periods for which the ad is to be shown.  ▄▄▄▄▄ TEAM  The team behind Joint has a strong experience in the online advertising industry which allowed them to understand the primary challenges faced by both publishers and advertisers.     You can view Linkedin profiles of our team members by clicking here  ▄▄▄▄▄ MARKET COMPARISON  We have a firm belief that our content ecosystem will gain mass adoption in the forthcoming years.  Disqus is one of our primary competitors in the commenting solution segment. It has gained vast popularity over the past couple of years, reporting over 50 million monthly comments as of January 2018. It allows monetization of content through native ads for publishers through working on 260,000 different sites according to Datanyze.    Joint ensures every single detail related to the revenue generation on our blockchain, which isn’t the case with Disqus. Publishers can generate consistent income with our advertising component, and at the same time, monitor payout distributions on the blockchain. Similarly, advertisers can access detailed reports of their advertising spending, with information drilled down to a single ad placement level.  On top of it, our model rewards commenters for their valuable contributions, something unique to Joint only. It does not only rewards the commenters for participation but makes it easier for publishers to build a community.  ▄▄▄▄▄ TOKEN USAGE  Every transaction in our content economy requires Joint token. They will be used for both publishers, advertisers and commenters.  Use Cases of Joint Tokens  ● Launch advertising campaigns across Joint network publishers ● Boost your comments to get more visibility ● Send tips and donations to publishers and authors ● Acquire new visitors for your contents ● Unlock paid subscriptions to exclusive contents  ▄▄▄▄▄ TOKEN LAUNCH/SALE  We’ll organize a token sale in order to raise funds for creating a fair content economy. A detailed list of token sale instructions will be provided prior to the token Launch.  ● Hard Cap for Token Sale: 12,500 ETH ● 1 ETH = 8000 Joint ● Launch Date & Time: April 7, 2018 ● Token Sale Period: 30 Days ● Token Launch Completion: Token launch will end when the maximum number of ETH are raised.
