If you ask me what is better, to invest in Bitcoin, Waves or ecopole? I'll answer of course invest to Bitcoin and Waves! Because this currencys will grow faster then ecopole. And I'm investing in Waves now too! I have Antminer and I change mined btc to waves and believe that Waves will be grow.  I think that Ecopole it is not about only cryptocurrencys. It is about our life, our food, our ecology, our children and our future. And for community it is opportunities to invest directly in the local farming without any borders. It can be not only our project. It can be any good project. And I ask you, what is your own opinion about it? Should you invest in usual people or not? Maybe should you invest in own project first? But what Your Project is?  Still now I had very small advertisement, only on the bitcointalk. So, we are still newbies and looking around, thinking, reading, speaking with community. Our capitalisation still is not so big.  https://wavesdesk.com/account/3PBWK2RVELHb3Qcd6XtWUjgZ653UTffSEss  I'm working right now to add some cryptocurrency from my side, because I think I understand the profit for me, for society and for investors.  Ok. It was lyric above.  The agriculture usualy it is about 20% percent of profit per year. And profit of bitcoin or waves is 400-800% per year, is not it? I would like to combine both profits and do the half of bitcoin|waves's profit for investors. Maybe more.  But if somebody happens and, oh no, bitcoin will be crushed by somebody our farm will be alive and will produce food and 20% profit per year every year . I think it is good investment to have some profit every year and save money in real property. Of course I beleive that with cryptocurrency all will be ok and our 20% profit will be grow because we will buy Waves on all profite. 20% * 400% - it is good money $). What do you think?  We are real, you can see our videos and we will do more videos and proof our reality. I guess now is good point to invest because I did big discount (45%) and I am working now to add more Waves to project.  Next step: airdrop on waves.

From 1999 to 2004 - 5 years worked in South Korea in construction, where from the handyman he studied up to the master of the construction site. In Korea he took part in the construction of plants, created several plants a year. He worked in different brigades in Korea, as a reinforcer, concrete worker, welder, installer.  On his return from South Korea in 2005, he organized an enterprise with a staff of up to 200 people. And until 2012 he successfully managed the enterprise, until he sold in the SU-155 (business wife Luzhkov). This was one of the first in Ivanovo contract organizations involved in monolithic construction.  For 7 years the company built about 1600000 sq.m.  With money from the sale of the enterprise in 2013, he bought land about 163 hectares in the Ivanovo region and began to study farming. For 4 years he developed an apiary to 20 bee colonies. In 2015, I purchased equipment for mowing grass (paid off in 2 years). The complex is organized: honey, hay, milk.  The capitalization of the economy at the moment is 10 million rubles.  Eugene about himself: ""Anton, you know. I do not rip off my head. I know the process organization formula. I have an organization in my blood. And in the head. I can organize almost any enterprise. I just know what to do! ""  You can contact Evgeny here EvgeniyPolenov or in the telegram @EvgenyPolenov",False
