Our first product QUGO was launched in 2015, it was a messenger with our avatar technology. With QUGO, we realized that it’s hard for users to adapt one more messenger. At the same time, QUGO users wanted to share their animated avatars to friends in other chat platforms. We realised that users should be able to experience the animations on any platform of their choice and not be tied to one central platform. This was our first step towards decentralization.  We then created XPRESSO, our expression app, where user could create his avatar, personalize his animations with themes & text (in any language). These user personalized animations could then be shared over any digital communication. Xpresso currently has more that 580K+ users, with more than 12 Million customized GIFS shared monthly. To push the limits of personalization we are working on a new beta technology using AI , Compute Vision which will turn a user into a 3D Avatar with just a selfie.  To decentralize further, we wrapped the XPRESSO API’s into easy to use WEB API, android & iOS SDKs. The idea behind this strategy was to allow any developer big/small to use XPRESSO API  to add the personalizable expression on his existing or new apps. This has in turn helped us in identifying new use cases for this technology.",True
