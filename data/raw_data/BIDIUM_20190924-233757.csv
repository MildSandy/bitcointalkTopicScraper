Agreed, there are lots of platforms out there that failed to provide a user friendly interface and yet was successful because the interface facilitated what they needed and because it was enforced to be used with no other alternative. But then again, functionality and being user-friendly is something that varies from user to user.  I'd say it's always the functionality of the interface that matters most rather the eye candies, simply put, automatic is for the democratic and manual is for the romantic.

Such amount of deduction on Coins or Tokens was one of the problems why people hold coins, sometimes deduction on exchanging are more to pay than the money to cash out.

As a teenager I'm not on that age required to get that IDs and documents like Driver's License and and Governmental ID, until  now I'm not verified. If ever Bidium will make its own wallet without any required documents, teenagers will now can access wallet and be verified without hassle on getting that required IDs.
