They have delisted what 50% of the coins that were previously trading in the last several months?  That's ridiculous! It has caused me days of frustration trying to figure out where I can store the coins out of the exchange.  50% of the coins I could not either find a place, their exchange would not allow withdraws, the fee was too high, or thankfully Yobit carried some of them but sometimes the deposit address says no free address.  A few of them I lost $100s of dollars such as Kangaroo Bits, Tattoocoin and Fire Rooster Coin if I could have withdrew and sold them on another exchange.  And this the worst time to be getting rid of coins when pretty much all altcoins are down like 80 to 99% from all time highs yet exchanges like Cryptopia are forcing it.   Anyone want to trade ATH DA$ or IQT for a buck or two.  I can't even withdraw those coins because their fee is too high.  I have 0.02 ATH, 54 DA$, 60 IQT ",False

This is same as other ""argon2"" coins.

I don't know why blocks submitted by stratum daemon are rejected. LEMON block submission code is exactly same as Dogecoin 1.10. Maybe there are some differences in block format. Other argon2 coins use really old codebase, so looking at code diff is not useful, most lines are different.  I am willing to make changes to LEMON to make this situation better.",False

It took some time, because I'm not familiar with cpuminer code (and it wasn't written with code clarity as goal), but here it is.  This problem was caused by implementation of BIP 34 in Bitcoin. When BIP 34 was implemented, block height was already quite high, so nobody noticed this bug that affects only blocks in range 32767-65536. Wallet would like the signature to be 3 bytes long, even when 2 bytes would be enough. But since we are using getblocktemplate in LemonCoin since start, this bug affected us.

Goal is to reduce it to 1,500,000 MMXVI as original planned. Also another reduction in block reward will be taken place. The current 5 MMXVI will be reduced to 1 MMXVI. 50% of the coins that will be bought back will be destroyed.  The main goal is to have a stable price above 1000sats as it was trading around those values before the bug was creating a extra 1,300,000 coins.  Main goals:  1. Reduce number of coins to 1,500,000 2. 50% of the buyback will be destoyed (5 BTC is available for buying back some of the coins - marketvalue is around 5 BTC) 3. New team members to put MMXVI back in the picture 4. Reducing block rewards to 1 MMXVI per block       Great. Waiting to find out who will be the new team members. Vegasguy? Cheesy  Placebo, really?

I noticed that many coins are lacking in several aspects. Either they are created by inexperienced developers, they use algorithm which makes mining uninteresting for most people or they lack the funds and people. While there are many algorithms on scene, most are ""overcrowded"". I decided to use algorithm Argon2 which is winner of Pasword Hashing Competition and is one of the most secure algorithms available today. Other Argon2 coins suffer from bad design choices during implementation and are terribly slow. LemonCoin is using latest uᴉoɔʇᴉq Core base and uses expensive hash only in PoW hash itself. Other hashing is done using fast hashing algorithms. As result, syncing is fast and it will be possible to use LemonCoin in mobile environment, saving battery-power and not frying user's hands.  To get LemonCoin in the spotlight and to provide funds for further development and marketing, 10M coins will be sold in ICO. In total, 31M LEMON will mined during whole mining period.
