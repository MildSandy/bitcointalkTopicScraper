Skye Properties team are are thankful for all the investors and new friends that believes with us that digital currencies will change the investment markets, especially Real Estate Investment (REI). There are a number of safeguards (for example regulations) that protects investors, making it a daunting challenge for any new real estate investor. The Skye Properties team believes we have the ability and proven record to overcome these challenges today - and the  team can address each new regulatory requirement thrown at us...  Our legal advisors recently advised us that to satisfy the legacy regulatory combined with the emerging digital token markets requirements, we should consider allowing more time for all the regulatory pieces to come together. Having worked in the investment and financial markets for years have taught us at least this - the regulatory processes takes time.  For this reason we decided to move the pre-sale launch date to early 2018 to ensure we fulfill a number of US regulatory requirements. This will ensure that the necessary safeguards are in place for investors to invest, and also assist the Skye Properties team to buy, manage and grow the SKYE token ecosystem successfully.  We are disappointed and frustrated as we wanted to be ready in early 2018 for the US real estate market opportunities. Moving the pre-sale date later provides Skye Properties with the opportunity to reach more investors, finalizing the SKYE token contract audit, keep on building the Skye Properties platform and enabling our legal team to get the necessary sign-offs for all requirements!  As usual, leave a comment or reach out on any of our social channels to learn more about Skye Properties and the upcoming SKYE token sales.

Understandably so, since Ether went from $220 to nearly $900 since we started this journey, and the total cryptocurrency market cap reached over $600 billion, while Bitcoin Futures was launched on CME (a week before on CBOE and next year on NYME & Deutsche BÃ¶rse, possibly Tokyo too in 2018).  In light of the SEC's decision to call all non-utility ICO issuing tokens a security, we have decided to pause the Skye Properties ICO until such time we have a better understanding of the regulatory landscape and impact on ICO's. This can only happen once the SEC and other regulatory departments provides clearer guidelines.  Putting the Skye Properties ICO on hold was not an easy decision after so much effort, time and money were invested. We trust it was not in vain and we can learn from this and come back stronger next year when a clearer regulatory and legal framework is established by the authorities.
