Users are those who want to rent computing power for transcription and pay for that. Miners, on the other side, lease their power and get paid for it. User app detects suitable miner automatically through DHT and sends a request using the p2p link. After setting up the connection, user app forms the smart contract between User and Miner. When all confirmations received, payment goes to the miner and the second Smart Contract responsible for the commission of the system gets it. This contract accumulates transaction of the 24h period and then calculates the amount of the reward for each wallet based on the proportion of tokens held. These calculations are expensive and can not be used for each simple transaction in the system. While user uploads the file to the plugin, he receives the cost of transcription based on the duration of the audio and current price. In order to find the miner, the program would connect to DHT node or be that node and detects the suitable option (based on apparent capacities criteria). After that, it will send requests via p2p connection to the miner and receive confirmation of the readiness. For more details, you can refer to the white paper from tokensale.anryze.com",False
