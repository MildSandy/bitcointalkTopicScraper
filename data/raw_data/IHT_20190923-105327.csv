In combination with the advantages of blockchain and the global development trend, blockchain real estate investment model will likely cover the future global real estate investment at a sweeping rate, and eliminate the traditional real estate investment model. IHT, based on this development inflection point, has fragmented the property right via smart contract referring to the property securitization approach of REITs, and has pioneered a blockchain + smart contract + REITs business model. It will reverse the global circulation of real estate, thereby affecting the global economic development.  Quote from: GREENch on December 13, 2017, 07:14:47 PM Hi Dev!

We are the first property / real estate / asset project that target to link with regulated financial institution in Asia. We have already talked to finance institution in China, Hong Kong , and Singapore, and the feedback is positive  2. Mcafee’s blockchain incubator Mcafeecoin.com is our strategic partner and they have posted this in both their whitepaper and also telegram group, you can check it out on their telegram group.  3. Both Whitepaper and website are Version 1.0 now, we are updating a new version with my application case and also legal advisory next couple of weeks    Hope all these answer your questions.  Quote from: WillingnessCrypto on December 12, 2017, 10:43:21 PM I always keep my eyes in the new startups. But I have some questions: where will your group do the really business at? It seems that you are a Chinese group, so I suppose that you will host your business there. But the ico has been forbidden there. If no Chinese citizens can join the ico, so they should buy it in the exchange to get the coins, and send to your platform to join your business?  I saw you have founded your business long time ago, it’s already better than a lot of other projects. Hope you will go well. Hope to get your reply.   The funding raising will be carried out in a few rounds. It will be opened to the public for investment. The fund will be collected and used for business development.  Like you have mentioned, due to regulations and restriction by the China government, there will be unmet demand by the Chinese and they can only buy the token from the exchange, which can be a good sign for investors.",True
