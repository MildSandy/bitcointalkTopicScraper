Below is a communication that Christoph sent out.  Nothing anymore about the initial concept of Blockpay and Echo. There is only vague blabla about Bitshares Munich and some wallet for Q2 2018 (same that existed even before the Blockpay crowdsale).  That's how he plays on time and scams.   ===========================   News About BlockPay Dear valued supporters,  We are happy to hereby inform you exclusively about several new developments that started within our company and communicate the aspired goals for our common future.  BitShares Munich (BlockPay) seeks a new company set up in terms of branding, marketing, and online presence. Our mission will be to create FinTech products, customer solutions and development platforms based upon Blockchain technologies by using the BitShares platform and the Graphene framework. Accordingly, our software development for BitShares based solutions is already ramping up in Q2 2018.  Whilst an agreement with Ken Code has been settled https://blockpay.ch/news, Christoph Hering will from now on be the sole CEO and shareholder of our company. In line with these new developments, we also decided that it’s time for a new name, which will be announced to you soon. Why did we do this? Our old name gave the impression of our company being a locally orientated project.  This is not the case – we aim to appear as an internationally positioned partner for our international B2B target groups. We feel confident to achieve this goal by establishing a new name in line with a fresh start.  In the context of our new alignment, we will start to advise companies on all aspects of the digital transformation process while dealing with financial transactions, digital currencies and introducing Smart Contracts. This will enable businesses to operate Blockchain technologies by delivering products, services and development tools.  Therefore, our company is working with dedicated research and development teams as well as our highly active BitShares coding community to bring the blockchain revolution into the customers daily business operations.  With the help of our new Pan-European development team, we are also happy to announce the rollout of a new digital currency web wallet. The multi-currency web wallet will constitute the future central hub of our payment platform and will enable easy to use secure transactions with digital currencies. Any progress concerning this development will be communicated to you in this newsletter. Additionally, we work on an update for the Smartcoins Wallet app. Both Software releases are scheduled to be delivered in Q2 2018 – keep updated to join our beta testing team!  In the future, we plan to publish newsletters in this manner once a month to always keep you updated on every development. We are looking forward to keeping in touch with you.  Best, Christoph     I am happy to answer your questions, please send an email to christoph@blockpay.ch.",False

Building a trusted and easy to remember brand is my main goal now. I already got the new name, next is the logo and our new brand colors. I am very excited to introduce the name to you.  More updates about our progress will be regularly published here in Bitcointalk and on our website too.   Hi Chris,  Good to read all that, and thanks for taking your time to update us a bit. I'm sure you can understand that Blockpay investors have (probably just like you) gone through a rather difficult time with all this, so regular, detailed updates from now on would be absolutely essential to re-establish the trust in your team and the whole project.  One question regarding the re-branding: Will the Blockpay tokens be swapped then? I just want to make sure they'll still be an essential feature of the project after the change.  Thanks, Tony  Hi Tony, Until further notice, the BlockPay tokens will stay the same since they are an essential element of our project and our products and services. The token will not lose its purpose through our rebranding.  Regarding all questions about the remaining pre-ico funds. The company has sufficient funding and I am 100% committed to delivering BlockPay, Echo and the other products as described in our announcement. You can see our reserves publicly at our company BitShares accounts: http://cryptofresh.com/u/bitshares-munich http://cryptofresh.com/u/bitshares-munich-wallet http://cryptofresh.com/u/echocold1 http://cryptofresh.com/u/ico.blockpayreserves Plus 110 BTC and 110 BCH which are in cold storage.   Please sign up for our newsletter at https://blockpay.ch and get our next updates on time. You can also meet me in person at the next Steemfest 2.0 in Lisbon where I will join the event as a speaker.",False

BlockPay is still listed with Coinmarketcap and other sites as you can see here https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/blockpay/ .  As I told you in Telegram already I started working with a new marketing team. We are right now working on new content, articles and development reports for you.  Ken left the BlockPay team so that he can focus on his work on the Stealth Transaction feature. It was his own decision to sell his BlockPay tokens. I strongly believe in BlockPay and our new products and therefore I see no reason to sell them.  BlockPay is a great name but it also has its limitations. We are now going to introduce a catchier and more international brand that matches our B2B target groups in the financial service industry. Building a trusted and easy to remember brand is my main goal now. I already got the new name, next is the logo and our new brand colors. I am very excited to introduce the name to you.

Ken will make his own announcements regarding his new roadmap and plans to develop and deliver a simpler implementation of the stealth feature for the BitShares platform.

BlockPay, as well as all our other products, Echo and Stealth Transactions, are built on top of the BitShares Blockchain. The Blockchain itself is almost finished so that you don´t see any platform developed anymore. There is also no core dev team that extends the blockchain itself.  However, there are a growing amount of business building on top of the bitshares blockchain thanks to its powerful technology. Please see my latest reddit post regarding this topic. https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/5ms9sh/is_bitshares_essentially_dead_where_is_it_going/dc707kd/   Yes, many assets can be transferred to Ethereum, so can Ethereum be assets added to BitShares. And they might should consider it.  - The transaction fees on the BitShares Blockchain are far lower, below 0.01 USD per tx fix, - speed is higher, up to 100,000 txs (new speed test is planned , check  here https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/5i5k9p/what_we_know_about_steemgraphenedpos_now/dc70qum/ ), the record is +3500 transactions per seconds = +10,000 transactions per block - companies have multi ways to charge fees for their assets - white and black listing features (perfect for compliance and AML / KYC) - 6 different digital assets to create (UIA, MPA, FBA, PMPA, and more) - Decentralized Exchange to trade all digital asset token with each other for almost no fees - with the new stealth feature developed by us, BitShares will compete for head on with Monero, Dash, and Z-Cash. (with all BitShares benefits in the back)  These among many other reasons are attractive for a financial service business like us. We need a blockchain that is stable and works, is fast, secure and can also adopt to world affairs if needed through a sophisticated blockchain governance system.  No other Blockchain on the market can provide us these features yet. I am happy to learn more about other chains that can reach up.",False

Kind regards, Christoph Hering, Founder & CEO        BlockPay Announcements here      ECHO Announcements here    Connecting different merchants, whales, bankers, traders and individuals together on one public ledger raises privacy concerns. How can you, as a business, prevent blockchain espionage of your competitors? A lot of companies are afraid their competitors could analyze their daily sales volume, metadata, consumer behavior or daily turnover in every store. This would be an extremely competitive advantage! They now have to choose between a public ledger or a private ledger. We would prefer to offer them the third option, a public ledger that keeps their accounts and amounts undetectable.  Stealth Transactions gives anybody 100% privacy on a public ledger. Every balance and transaction is verified by the Blockchain but not traceable with a Blockchain Explorer.   Read the official announcement about Stealth transactions.. You will love the ultimate in privacy.     BlockPay is a FinTech / Blockchain development company specializing in digital payment services.

Here is the latest update:  https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php/topic,22576.120.html Quote TONS of work done this week: https://github.com/kenCode-de?tab=repositories   C-IPFS and BlockPay related:   Work continued on the development of c-ipfs, in the area of data storage. Blocks are now written to both the lightningdb database, and the /blocks directory. We also wrote tests to cover more code, and adjusted existing code to clean up memory leaks. Valgrind now runs fairly clean over our tests of c-ipfs.   The difference between what is stored in the /blocks directory and what is stored in the database is not totally clear yet, but this week will hopefully uncover the rest of it. While successfully writing to block storage is a big accomplishment, block retrieval isn't finished yet. This task is minor in complexity though. Also, block storage must now be leveraged to take on the MerkleDAG and the unixfs code that runs on top of it. This will allow for files to be placed in namespaces (aka: directories), be broken into pieces, and read/found by local and remote BlockPay or mobile wallet clients.

By letting the client do more of the work, it has sped the app up a bit and greatly reduced bandwidth utilization. BIP39 support has been added too (real words, instead of brainkey ""weird"" words). During the security audit, we have also made some other improvements this week: Improved Websocket communication Create Account Activity Debugging Python server-side components Encrypt/Decrypt AES Compress/Decompress LZMA library Export / Import Bin File Library, compatible with old bin files now Export bin file Activity Import bin file Activity (in progress) A bug with the transfer transaction was fixed. The problem happened randomly and because of that was not caught initially. The reason has to do with the strictness of the graphene network on its approval of signatures. Sadly the bitcoinj doesn't provide support for non-deterministic signature generation, so we had to be creative when coming up with a solution. A valid compromise was deemed to slightly change the expiration time of the transaction in order to generate a valid signature. It is important to note however that this has no visible impact whatsoever for the user and the transaction gets processed super fast as always.   Improvements were made to the QR-code generation mechanism. The reliance on a server for the QR generation, encoding and compression of the eReceipt data has been dropped. This has had a dramatic improvement in the speed of the generation of a QR-code. And of course to be able to generate the QR-code while off-line is also a major advantage in speed and bandwidth utilization. The corresponding change in the procedure of decompression and decoding the data when reading a QR-code with the camera also had to be adjusted, since a server was being used there too.   graphenej in progress, BIP39 support added and now being tested.   Stealth related:   Libsnark is now fully integrated, replaced libsodium crypto primitives, finished notes encryption/decryption and fully tested. UI now being worked on, will upload more screenshots soon.  BlockPay and our other products are growing rapidly and we make amazing progress with IPFS in C! Due to security reasons are our main developers in no chat channels. We only work with the best and we don´t want to distract them from their work.  Cheers Chris",False

I'm not a criminal. thanks.   Stealth transactions (in my opinion) are imperative to the survival of Liberty. February is my goal for the formal Stealth launch, but this has to be perfect, via the cryptography that we have to work with right now. Zero Knowledge (""zk"") transactions are the holy grail of financial privacy, and I want this to be impenetrable. Besides completion of the UI for Stealth, there was one final issue with Stealth that we had to tackle, called ""trusted setup"".   What is trusted setup?  zkSNARK allows us to implement the perfect anonymity, the only issue is the fact that verification of the proof requires some interaction among Prover and Verifier. They should generate some kind of “shared secret”,  after that the Prover can prove something without disclosing any additional info. But this way is not acceptable in cryptocurrencies for transaction verification,  because it's impossible to interact with the transaction issuer every time somebody verifies the transaction. The workaround for this issue is pre-generation of this “shared secret” (usually it is called public parameters, or ""pp"") for all transactions and Verifiers at the very beginning. Very roughly speaking this pp is the constant value in the zkSNARK library code. The problem is that if somebody knows some data (let’s call it “toxic waste”) that was used during this pp generation, he can counterfeit any proof that was generated with using this pp. Library authors didn’t include this pp in the original zkSNARK implementation code because it is difficult to prove that they didn’t know this toxic waste for this predefined pp. So every zkSNARK client app should invent the way to generate this pp and prove to the community the fact that they are not storing the toxic waste for this pp. If they can do that, then it is safe to use the same pp in every other app that uses zkSNARK in the future. Zcash was the first client app with the zkSNARK library and that’s why they should generate this pp. If this pp generation is safe, then we can use the same pp value. If we think this generation is not safe, then we can generate it one more time in another, safer way. If zkSNARK has the pp generated one time in a safe manner, then all the other apps that use it don’t need any trusted setup or something like this anymore.   What is wrong with Zcash trusted setup?   The only weak place in Zcash cryptography is in the pp generation, usually called the trusted setup. They found the way to generate it in a safe enough manner, but were criticized because it's still the weakest place in their system (but it’s still safer than many other cryptocurrency weak places are). They can generate this pp by several participants so that if at least one of the participants will not save his part of the toxic waste and share it with other trusted setup participants, pp generation will be safe and nobody can counterfeit the generated proofs. Their error was that they use a predefined small number of participants, so it's possible that the 6 participants weren’t honest and modified the pp generator code and saved their toxic waste parts. All other procedures were safe; there are several participants, if only one of the participants is honest then the generation is safe, and there are participants that are not associated with Zcash.   How can we improve upon their trusted setup?   Our main idea is to allow anyone/everyone to participate in the trusted setup who's interested in security. These participants should not only be the members of the Bitshares community, but there are at least several Zcash forks that need zkSNARK pp too. So we are preparing a generator (open source of course), that every web user can install and start it on a predefined date, and the network of these generators will generate safe pp for zkSNARK. If only one of these users will be honest and will not save his part of the toxic waste, the pp is safe and can be used (not only by Bitshares, but by any other zkSNARK client too (Zcash forks, for example)). So if you don’t want to trust anybody in trusted setup you can just participate in this setup and be sure it was honest by destroying your part of the toxic waste (you don’t need to do something special for this, just build the source code without modification and start up the generator).   The main risk in this case is performance (the more participants, the more generation rounds), so in the worst case we should limit the number of participants. We think it’s ok however, because Bitshares already has a set of trusted members (thanx to DPOS). It can be any number of Committee members, Witnesses, or Stakeholders, for example. We hope to create the algo without any participation limits and should be finished with it very soon.   We have kept the new algo (more or less) the same in our libsnark implementation (github.com/kenCode-de/libsnark), and mainly edited the build scripts to facilitate this “trustless” setup redesign. This procedure should be started only once and after that, its result will be hardcoded into the code. Stealth transactions will not require any additional actions from any Bitshares system participants.   BlockPay of course, will soon include this extra layer of privacy via Stealth transactions as an option in the Settings screen. edit: ps: I will post my normal weekly update in just a few hours...

The CLI was released right before Christmas, and we now have Pre-Releases ready for Linux and Mac here: https://github.com/kenCode-de/c-ipfs/releases   We should also have a Windows, and first formal Release for all platforms ready by next week at the link above.   Android Smartcoins Wallet and security audits:   We found a very rare bug that was preventing the storage of newly created keys to persistent storage. The previous procedure was storing them in memory and just promoting them to the shared preferences once we got the response back from the network and the account update procedure was deemed successful. This of course leaves a small breach that would happen if something were to happen in case the account update was successful, but the network response failed to reach the user. The situation described before never actually happened, but it could be emulated by purposely crashing the thread at a very specific point. Most users are not going to try to crash a thread on purpose.   The code written to treat this very rare situation also took special care of checking if the stored key actually does match the public address of the ""active"" role of the account, and only then it proceeds to replace it. The described changes can be inspected in this commit (https://github.com/kenCode-de/smartcoins-wallet/commit/4ea07e741223680363225c5a038769988927a95f).   After having added support for the 'get_market_history' API call in our new graphenej library (https://github.com/kenCode-de/graphenej), this was introduced in the Smartcoins Wallet and used to obtain the historical market data, which in turn is useful to calculate the equivalent fiat values of past transactions. This was previously being done on-demand every time the app was restarted, a solution which was very inefficient and actually wrong, because the equivalent values were being calculated with current values, not past ones.   With the new changes introduced, after a batch of transactions is loaded and stored into the database, the app will perform a query looking for historical transactions that don't have an equivalent fiat value. With this in hand, the aforementioned 'get_market_history' API call is used to obtain historical market data and calculate the equivalent value.   Because not every token might have a very active market with the user desired Smartcoin, we make a 2-step equivalent value calculation. First calculating the historical relationship of the token with the BTS, and then in turn finding out how much that amount of BTS would have been in bitUSD or bitEUR (or the desired Smartcoin) at that point in time.   If the transaction was already made in BTS the first step was avoided, and if it was already a Smartcoin no conversion is needed of course. Every one of these special cases was treated and upgraded.   Also a mapping was created to match the location of the user with a set of Smartcoins. If no Smartcoin exists for a specific country (a situation that applies for most countries actually) then bitUSD is now used as a default.   The relevant commits for this work are: https://github.com/kenCode-de/smartcoins-wallet/commit/0decd87e1f8160d98e7d77b458cae698072b67d0 https://github.com/kenCode-de/smartcoins-wallet/commit/ee7ac88eb45dd21fb19353d44f9e8f92bc029a51 https://github.com/kenCode-de/smartcoins-wallet/commit/39b581d17a36e230b779bd7e9451f5018bb1c060   And a more detailed description of the specific details about this procedure:   Transactions loading (on the home screen) - The procedure to load the database with historical transfers is somewhat complex due to the fact that what we want to display and what the API gives us is slightly different. Namely time and equivalent value information is missing. There is of course ways to obtain this data, but more on the specifics of this later. Let us first focus on obtaining the list of transactions and display whatever it already gives us.   The list of historical transactions is obtained by using the ‘get_relative_account_history’ API call. And even though this call has a hard limit on 100 operations per request, we can easily schedule a new request in case we note the user might have more than 100 transactions already. It is not really a problem to chain operations like this, since this procedure is only performed once upon installation to initially fill the database with operations performed prior to the apps' (Smartcoins Wallet and BlockPay both) install.   With this in place, we can already display information about what was sent, and if it was an incoming or outgoing transaction. A quick search to this newly loaded database can also give us the list of assets used and that information is used to obtain more information about each one of them. Specifically we would like to know each asset’s symbol and precision, in order to properly format them to the user. So that we can display USD 1.00 to the user instead of its raw value of 1000 for instance.   The first complication arises from the fact that the list of operations retrieved by this API call doesn’t explicitly have the time information in it. Instead each operation does indicate the block number in which it was included in the blockchain.   By taking the block number information however, we can then use the ‘get_block_header’ API call to get the UTC time for that specific block. The downside of this API call is that it doesn’t support batched calls. That is, a request has to be made specifically for every missing block header. This can be time-consuming, especially if we decide to load all historical transfer’s time information and then proceed to calculate equivalent values.   Since the user is more likely to be interested in the most recent transactions first, and recalling that this operation is only performed ONCE upon app install, it was decided to split the timestamp query and equivalent value calculations into batches. So this way the app will load all transactions first, and display the information about every transfer without any date and time or equivalent value first.   Then we’ll proceed to load date time information from top to bottom, but not going all the way down the list. But instead stopping at a specific batch size, and then proceed with the equivalent value calculation. In other words, don't annoy the user.   Please note that the equivalent value calculation depends on us having the specific date and time for every operation, since we’re using the ‘get_market_history’ API call, which takes a timestamp information instead of block number.   The timestamp query and the equivalent values thus are performed going from most recent to older transactions, which will appear low in the list anyways. Once this operation is finished, the app will just query the local database.   This initial database loading operation can take a while to conclude, but since it is done in the background by threads filling in the database the user doesn’t have to wait for it to conclude and is free to use the app. He can even interrupt the procedure by pressing the home button, and it will just resume from where it left when the app is reopened.   With the information about historical equivalent values in the databse, it was now possible to re-enable the ""export to PDF/CSV"" and ""eReceipt"" functionalities (which will be included in v1.5.6). This was done here: https://github.com/kenCode-de/smartcoins-wallet/commit/a341882bb4e96c567be545be5c8641b2eb73b116 https://github.com/kenCode-de/smartcoins-wallet/commit/6e4325bfd6a51bc912a70b80879946e10c9e7c28   More features updated: Caching for getAssets (more speed improvements) Changing BalanceFragment Structure (Separating the view from the logic for the future c-ipfs integration) As always, never keep more money in your wallet than you can afford to lose.

Thank you for your good question. We have weekly reports on our social media channels and a tec update every Friday. We are making good progress with the new BlockPay Core engine. Since all our products work with the same code libraries we had to temporarily shut down the BlockPay DE and FR server until we fixed some security update. In that task, we also improved the QR-code generation, increased the encryption, and made the sign-up process easier.  We are very careful with our security standards and rather take a bit longer for an update then deliver an insecure product. I expect to have the BlockPay servers up and running within the next few weeks.  Meanwhile, we are acquiring new customers around the world. We have +10 integration request for BlockPay, 3-5 custom wallet inquiries, and weekly request for the BlockPay API.  I will keep you up to date in this forum thread about our latest developments and improvements. You will be all surprised about the awesome products that we are building right now for the whole Blockchain Community The Token prices will display our work soon enough.",False

We had to fire our old marketing partners because they did not perform the way we wanted. We now added 2 more people to the core team who will be in charge of all social media channels and keep reporting about our journey. One of the first articles is out already, check out https://steemit.com/blockpay/@bitshares-munich/the-faces-behind-blockpay-christoph-and-rodrigo .  For direct updates please also follow us on Twitter https://twitter.com/BlockPay_ch and on Facebook https://facebook.com/blockpayde and on Steemit https://steemit.com/@bitshares-munich  Latest Development Let us take a look at the current software development. We are making great process in the IPFS in C development and further decentralizing the BlockPay core and building up the BlockPay engine. This new DAP structure allows us to install BlockPay on any kind of hardware! Not only on Android and iOS but also on a raspberry pi´s and other mainframes. Imagine you could pay with your Bitcoin at vending machines, petrol stations, power sockets, doors, etc. We are already talking with industry partners for upcoming integration.  On the other side, we are working on a redesign of the current UI/UX to increase merchant adoption. The onboarding process gets redesigned as well as the settings cleaned out. I will soon share some first design mockups to the community.  Meanwhile, we are ramping up development work with stealth transaction on the Bitshares blockchain. We are now able to hide (sender,receiver,amount,memo field, meta data) from blockchain explorers. Only a timestamp will be left. Stealth is a highly requested feature for all merchants who want to move corporate funds on a blockchain. With this feature, we actually build a hybrid between a public and a private blockchain and give the whole industry a new option to store and move funds on a blockchain. Together with a scalable blockchain, stealth transactions gonna be faster, more secure, more private and easier to use than ZCash or Monero. More exciting news about our development here in the following weeks.  cheers chris4210",False

We are working on the last BlockPay tokens, some people typed in the wrong Wallet address so we have to figure out what happend there. I will let you know asap!!  Quote from: cryptoba on September 09, 2016, 02:24:55 PM Hi Chris,  All my Blockpay Tokens have arrived safely on my OpenLedger account. Thank you for that  I have 2 questions:  - Are they safe on the OpenLedger plateform? Where would you keep yours?  - A part of my tokens are for a friend, he could not fully complete the OpenLedger Integration on his iOS device, what would be the best way to transfer the Blockpay Tokens?  Best Regards, Charles   Hi cryptoba,   - Yes, your BlockPay tokens are safe on the OpenLedger platform. Why? Because on OpenLedger or most other BitShares based Exchanges, you yourself hold the private keys to your account. The exchange has no control over your funds. That is a totally different to Poloniex, Bitfinex or other exchanges.   The most important thing is to make your own backups of the wallet .bin file, passwords, and the private key of your account. I personally prefer the light client to store my accounts and multiple wallets. I can also set up my own 2/3 multisig to protect the most important accounts.   - In this case you should help your friend to create an OpenLedger account, or install the BitShares Exchange light client, make all necessary backups and then just simply transfer the BlockPay tokens to his account. On the BitShares platform your account name is your wallet address. So just type in ""homeshopping24"" to send funds to the Homeshopping Account.    Quote from: Crypto_MERC on September 09, 2016, 03:52:51 PM Will blockpay eventually be on its own, or will it always be part of graphene/bitshares 2.0?   Will you have your own wallet?  Are other exchanges in the works?  Will dividends be paid to token holders on the bitshares network?  What is next for the ico investors?  Thanks in advance for your time.   BlockPay is a multi chain approach and connects to all major Blockchains. The main functions will stay on graphene/ BitShares 2.0 due to their great scalability, speed and security features. Most other chains would be to slow and insecure for us. I do not see a good reason right now to fire up our own Blockchain and bother with setting up hundreds of own nodes, security over the total Network, etc. I prefer to build on stable Blockchain Network. I also want to avoid to get caught with a 51% attack by the ""51 crew"" ( I think that is how they call themselves)  Yes, I am currently reaching out to other exchanges and I am trying to work out the best solution for BlockPay holders. We are more interested in a long-term approach and value increase of  the Tokens.  We are currently preparing the next steps for BlockPay ""S"" and BlockPay for Odoo and will update all BlockPay ico investors about our progress. We are also setting up the Beergardens around the Munich Oktoberfest during the next days. The Oktoberfest starts 17.09. this year and we want to get ready for all international guest so that they can buy their fresh cold beer with Bitcoins asap!! We will share locations of the BlockPay terminals asap.   As a side note, we just released the latest Smartcoins Wallet v1.0.6! https://steemit.com/crypto-news/@kencode/ann-smartcoins-wallet-v1-0-6-released  This is our own mobile wallet that works perfectly with all BlockPay versions.

In the next version v1.0.7 we will fully integrate the Bitcoin and Steem Blockchain too! More Blockchains are on the list too.",False

Underlying businesses should prosper. (You should focus on this, and then broadcast the successes and milestones in order to generate interest & excitement.) B. Issue a token with a finite issue. (You have too many tokens on the shelf - look for excuses to burn them, in a verifiable burn account.) C. Have the token intrinsic to the function of your product, or have them share in profits in a predictable, contractual way - this is what you are enquiring about.  My initial thought is that, at this early stage you really need all cashflow to continue to grow, so frankly you don't have cash to give back to token holders. I would like to see you focus thus:  A: Grow the underlying business, and brag/publish your success milestones in order to facilitate token price appreciation. B: Burn excess tokens as aggressively as you dare - and tie the burn rate to Blockpay++ expansion, if you like.  My 2.",False

Let us tackle the numbers.  First, the 15%, of the 0.5% transaction fees, are the sales commission for our BlockPay Ambassadors. If you sign up a bar in your town, you will get (0.5%*15%) in sales commission for each transaction running through that BlockPay. (0.08% of the total transaction, that is not bad.)  Second, we need far less to be profitable. According to my numbers we break even with around 3,500,000 USD transaction volume or 17,500 USD in transaction fees per month. 15% sales commission 2,625 USD for BlockPay Ambassadors. You take the rest 14,875 USD - deduct our startup expenses and taxes and end up with the net profits per month. These will be distributed according to stake. As you can see 3,5 mio USD per month on a global scale is not that much.  We have over 60 BlockPay Ambassadors today, and when each Ambassador can sign up 5 new stores per month we will have a good network by spring 2017.  Yes at the end we also need the consumer site. If the Blockchain community is not starting to use their coins on the market, then we will not reach our goals too. So we are bootstrapping as much as we can today to get a BlockPay in every store our there.  Gosh when we make a 1 billion USD in transaction volume then we reached true mass adoption for crypto currencies. That should be our new national day    Quote from: mr-whitekey on August 27, 2016, 11:33:47 PM  The company suggested that the tokenholders would get up to 15% of the commission of 0,5% that is charged to consumers for every transaction.      My knowledge is that the 15% is only for Ambassadors whom actively sign merchants with blockpay. It comes from the small fee of only those people whom use the blockpay app at that specific location that the ambassador signed up, not the total set of transaction fees and not to coin holders. There is an undefined, unenforceable promise to profit share with blockpay token holders.  Also, blockpay is not the only project this team is up to. The funds raised here will go to fund other projects as well. as I understand it. Any other project could add value which would alter the value of the coins should the team share this value as promised.   https://blockpay.ch/community/blockpay-ambassador/  Yes right mr-whitekey. BlockPay is just one side of the coin. Echo on the other end is a powerful social chat messenger with a blockchain wallet baked it. PayPal and Whatsapp are looking how to integrate Bitcoin already but they are not private and anonym. I think you can already send Bitcoin with Viber too right? Anyways, Echo will combine the best of WhatsApp and PayPal in one app. Imagine we just get 10 million users who can send Bitcoin over the chat messenger and pay at a BlockPay in seconds. There is a lot of potential up. And WhatsApp has around 1 billion users. Skype 800, WeChat 700 and so on. It is a giant market that we want to tackle with smarter and better technologies.

BlockPay is a piece of software for all of us. I really can´t wait to drop my plastic and use my phone for payments instead. So much easier and faster.  Here is a nice interview that I gave to Jamie Redman https://news.bitcoin.com/blockpay-businesses-zero-cost/  In comparison to the past big ICO´s Wave and LISK, that are asking to fund an idea, we are asking to fund the continued improvement and instant roll out of BlockPay so that you can use it at a place near you by the end of September 2016. Once we proved our product, we proved our business skills, we proved that we can streamline cryptocurrency adoption in the common markets, then we are ready to ask for the growth booster.  If the market is not ready for our products and cryptocurrencies, even 20 million in funding will not help us. 21, Coinbase, BitPay, and several other companies raised multi-millions but are doing little for mass adoption. They focus on a specific need within the Blockchain community. We are focusing on building easy tools that are based on Blockchain Technology and can be used by Crypto and regular people.  Andreas Antonopoulos already summarized it brilliantly. Bitcoin has been designed by geeks in the past, it is the time that crypto gets the fashion treatment. Next generation UI /UX design and marketing will hide all ""scary"" hashcodes, brainkey, mining, decentralization, terminologies and focus on easy to understand interfaces instead. The Circle wallet and the GetGem Chat are great steps forward in terms of design and user interface for Blockchain wallets.",False

I want a return of 3% per year.  25 million euro x 3% = 750.000,- euros  The company suggested that the tokenholders would get up to 15% of the commission of 0,5% that is charged to consumers for every transaction.  For the tokenholders to get a return on investment of 3% the company has to realize a transaction volume of 1.000.000.000 (1 billion) euro's per year. (1.000.000.000 x 0,5% commission x 15% payout tokenholders = 750.000 euro)   1 billion euro of transaction volume! how much is that? Visa has around 50% of total global transaction volume for debit and credit card worth 3,3 trillion USD. So with a transaction volume of 1 billion, blockpay would be small compared to Visacard which is 3300x bigger. But the cryptospace has a marketcapitalisation of around 10 billion Euro.  So the succes of blockpay is hugely depended on the growth of the cryptocoin consumer.  If it reaches 1 billion transaction volume, i would say blockpay is very succesful. But even then the return on this high risk investment for tokenholders is a lousy 3%.  I am enthusiastic about this project and would love to participate. Because i think the cryptoscene could and should manage to become successful without Venture Capitalist from the 'real' world. But under these conditions it is more a donation then an investment. Don't get me wrong, i want you to become succesfull, but i will wait to invest in this coin when it hits the exchanges (at much lower prices).  Cheers!   ",False

This means any return on investment is up to the personal discretion of the management team, and they and everyone else get paid first. Tokens are not needed to power any app so their value is at the mercy of discretionary dev spending and 'rewards'. I don't see why an investor would make an investment in such a blind pledge without anything written or coded to offer any assurance of getting their money back plus. Titan20 has repeatedly asked for clarification on this and so far just a lot of 'trust us', it's a great idea. I don't dispute that your idea is great and your concepts might work, but I greatly question the risk/reward offered to token buyers with zero hard figures detailing the value proposition to token holders.

If the prevailing market is .0004 btc per, and you absolutely must raise cash, likely the new tokens will be offered at a significant discount to 0.0004. IF the prevailing market is closer to 0.01 btc per, your offer price will be much different, but again likely at some discount to market.

On your earlier post, you said BlockPay does not charge any fees. Was this meant to be a distinction from Plutus or just a feature?  Quote 2.2.1 Plutus App Fee Optimization Bitcoin conversion has a fee of between 1-4% (TBD). The fee is deducted from the users’ fiat deposit balance before the money is released to their VDC account on the Plutus Mobile App. There are no other fees for using the app and no fee to deposit Plutons on the app obtained from another user externally. Plutus pays all transaction costs associated with using the Ethereum network (See Section 2.4.2). Merchants pay their normal debit card payment processing fees.  - Plutus.it-White-Paper-v1.0.pdf Page 4  Yes, it is actually a distinction. Please correct me if I am wrong, Plutus allows you to charge up an NFC card with Bitcoin and pay at every store, however, the merchant has to pay the standard visa and MasterCard fee with Plutus. This makes it easy for Plutus to give its users a tool to spend their crypto at every store, however, it does not solve the merchant problems and their high fees. Plutus is using the MasterCard network after all. It is a win-lose for crypto users and business. The store loses. At the end Plutos charges a 1-4% fee to the user in terms of a Bitcoin price mark up.  BlockPay on the other end is free for merchant and charges a small flat fee of 0.5% to the consumer, but allows them to directly pay the merchant with digital, and the merchant receives digital at zero cost. The merchant does not pay the mastercard fees and has solved fraud, chargebacks, counterfeit etc because he gets real crypto! That is a giant difference. So with BlockPay we have a win win situation for the user, he pays less, and the business, he pays zero.    Good question. Very good answer. I'm getting more and more familiar with Blockpay and really like the approach! Clean and simple to use. Best I've seen so far in this market segment.

The merchants do not need to worry about the market volatility since all incoming crypto funds are exchanged immediately to their local currency. The merchant will not keep his Dogecoin unless he really wants to. He has the choice. Most merchants, however, want to get the money paid out to their bank account directly.  Another important aspect is that we don´t focus our marketing on ""Blockchain"", we talk about ""digital money"" and ""mobile payment"".

Hi Titan20,  that is a very good point. I have a very strong opinion about founders who just found to sell. I really dislike this ideology. What kind of value do you create if you just write up a business plan, seek some funding and hustle 2-3 years only to sell to a big corporation who cannot run the company without the founders? I am seeing that a lot with young business students who come to my monthly Startup meetups. They are founding companies with the clear goal in mind to sell to Google within 3 years... What kind of business man are that?  I like sustainable businesses and do not plan to sell anytime soon. Why sell a good running business? You can hire a good executive team and let them run the show. Rodrigo and I are here on the same page. Short, we don´t sell. To calm your mind, in the unlikely scenario, I will do my best to compensate all BlockPay token holders in the best possible way. A percentage of the selling price should be the minimum.  I think we have to be clear here, ICO and Blockchain-based crowdfunding are new tools for startups like us to grow. We are all exploring the best strategies and methods to make it right. I am open to further discussions how to set better ICO standards and processes for many other great Blockchain ideas yet to come. I am promoting Blockchain technologies at every meetup I go, at every event I organize. That is 3 events a month plus big events like the Bits & Pretzels. I want to see more Blockchain-based Startups on the market.  Quote from: titan20 on August 22, 2016, 07:51:42 PM And why do you sell coins instead of assets/shares like the OPENPOS shares on bitshares?   BlockPay tokens work like OPENPOS tokens. Just that OPENPOS is limited to all revenues from BlockPay for Odoo, BLOCKPAY token itself is open to all revenue streams of our company. Before we create a token for each product we build we decided it is better to set up a company-wide tokens and to let everybody participate.",False

Crypto needs more people like you! Now to your questions. Plutus.it is an interesting concept, we meet the founder in Berlin at the GTEC Blockchain Innovation Awards 2016. Rodrigo and I where pitching next to Plutus. Here is the link to our pitch of Echo at the GTEC Event in May. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGXRzTvrZSY  There are many good reasons to take a closer look at BlockPay and the other products we built. First we support all leading Blockchain currencies and give senior currencies like Peercoin a new tool to use their coin. Dash is already very excited about BlockPay. Second we do not charge fees to the merchant. The business owner gets 100% of the funds he requested within a few seconds. In some cases even in 3 sec, P2P. Since its crypto money, the business can immediately pay it forward. Third BlockPay is available for all kinds of platforms, today for Android and in Odoo, tomorrow for iOS and as open API for your business.  We have several working proof of concepts and several stores with BlockPay here in Munich and are fully incorporated in Denmark (see details in previous posts). We are also talking to major supermarkets, hotels, travel agencies, restaurants etc. for upcoming integrations. Stay tuned on that.

Can the shopowner skip this process, so that it automatically gets out of the digital version and receives the fiat euros in his bankaccount?  Another question i have is the following:  you say the payout to blockpaytokenholders will be (up to) 15%. The OPENPOS tokenholders are receiving 50%. 3. How much did you guys pay out until now to the OPENPOS tokenholders and is it possible to see this in a bitshares explorer (Just to get a feeling about how much the rate of return on investment was for the OPENPOS tokenholders)?  The Blockpaytokens have no function in your platform. There is nothing legally binding for your company to pay out anything to tokenholders. So the tokenholders have a weak legal position. You have a promising project. And i want to invest in it. Although nothing is legally binding, i think it is important that you announce what the percentage is that tokenholders will be receiving, so that there is some kind of agreement between tokeninvestors and company.

Lets get to the juice details.  1. Yes, the merchant gets a BitEUR, BitUSD etc. which is a Smart contract token on the Graphene Blockchain. They work like the Steem Dollar. So in an example MC Donalds gets 1,000 BitUSD in their Blockchain Wallet, the value is 1:1 to Fiat USD. Now MC Donalds can set up auto settle and send the BitUSD to a Gateway like Kraken, Coinbase, Coinsbank, etc. The funds will be sold automatically and the merchant receives his 1,000 USD - Fiat Gateway fee at his Bank account the next day. (We are talking about a few exchanges about the direct conversion already, an own gateway service is also planned to cut costs and time.)  2.  The Merchant has a couple of options that we want to encourage a) He converts into Fiat and leaves the Blockchain wonderland b) He keeps the crypto and pays his salaries to employees c) He keeps the crypto and pays in supplier in China in a few seconds d) He keeps the crypto and purchases marketing, consultancy, or other services  You see the power? Where we want to go  Of course, we want to make the conversion from Digital to Fiat as smooth as possible, but on the other side, we want to make the Digital Blockchain world as attractive as possible so that Business keep their funds digital and pay it forward. New Digital Cash.  3. You have to split the fees into different sections.  a) We have a flat fee of 0.5% added as ""tax"" on each transaction b) From this turnover, we pay up to 15% sales commission to our BlockPay Ambassadors, for each store a BlockPay Ambassador adds to the Network. We have +50 Ambassadors in +28 countries already. The application is still open. c) OPENPOS token holders will get 0.5%*50% of all transactions fees generated from an Odoo POS - Terminal. If an Ambassador sales a BlockPay in Odoo system to a store or chain, his commission will apply. The rest of the fees will be added to the general distribution pool. d) All other fees will be pooled and distributed after all company expenses are covert.   e) BlockPay in Odoo is going live Q4 2016, so we don´t have any transaction fees to share yet. However, our early OPENPOS supporters gained a 3-4x ROI with our current buyback. We collected around 25,000 USD last year and buyback OPENPOS with BlockPay tokens in the value of 100,000 USD in phase 1 of our Pre-ICO. This is a special event to thank our early supports because our company would not exist without their support.   Quote from: dx5 on August 21, 2016, 07:17:57 AM So how much in Bitcoins are you guys planning on raising?  We can raise in this Pre-ICO a total value of 1,483.20 BTC.

The fee is deducted from the users’ fiat deposit balance before the money is released to their VDC account on the Plutus Mobile App. There are no other fees for using the app and no fee to deposit Plutons on the app obtained from another user externally. Plutus pays all transaction costs associated with using the Ethereum network (See Section 2.4.2). Merchants pay their normal debit card payment processing fees.  - Plutus.it-White-Paper-v1.0.pdf Page 4  Yes, it is actually a distinction. Please correct me if I am wrong, Plutus allows you to charge up an NFC card with Bitcoin and pay at every store, however, the merchant has to pay the standard visa and MasterCard fee with Plutus. This makes it easy for Plutus to give its users a tool to spend their crypto at every store, however, it does not solve the merchant problems and their high fees. Plutus is using the MasterCard network after all. It is a win-lose for crypto users and business. The store loses. At the end Plutos charges a 1-4% fee to the user in terms of a Bitcoin price mark up.  BlockPay on the other end is free for merchant and charges a small flat fee of 0.5% to the consumer, but allows them to directly pay the merchant with digital, and the merchant receives digital at zero cost. The merchant does not pay the mastercard fees and has solved fraud, chargebacks, counterfeit etc because he gets real crypto! That is a giant difference. So with BlockPay we have a win win situation for the user, he pays less, and the business, he pays zero.",False

CCEDK will be crowdfunding development and marketing for BlockPay’s Echo app, a really slick piece of technology that will enable customers to pay easily in any of a dozen or more crypto coins, and merchants to accept crypto payments at no extra cost! CCEDK has accepted as well to act as the escrow for this pre-ICO, issuing the asset as well as doing the distributon.    You can invest in two ways:  1. The ICO page on the BlockPay.ch website and 2. The ICO LIVE button on the CCEDK.com website. You may as well also simply send payments directly to the dedicated BlockPay escrow account on OpenLedger named ico.blockpay, as the registration on the blockchain will be all the proof you need to receive tokens at the end of the crowdsale.

Throwing underpriced BlockPay on the market would harm every previous supporter and I want to avoid that at all costs.  Quote from: titan20 on August 17, 2016, 10:39:26 PM I do have a few questions: - do these tokens have a function on your platform? or is it just to decide who has what stake in the revenue stream of your services? - What percentage of the revenue are you planning to give to the token holders?  100.000.000 Blockpay tokens x 0,000288 btc = 28.800 btc So if tokenholders would like to get a return of say 10% per year. Then you should at least realize an income stream of 2.880 btc. Which you have to pay out 100% to tokenholders, which is not a realistic assumption. So the income stream will have to be much higher.  - What are your expectations about the total income stream per year in a bad, average and good scenario?  - We are thinking about additional use cases for the BlockPay tokens. I really like the Dash Masternode idea, that you need an amount X vesting to get the feature Y. I could think about extra BlockPay fee discounts for consumers, cash back, additional stealth features if you have X amount of BlockPay etc. I am open for an inspiring discussion. - Today the tokens claim the stake in the revenue streams of our product and services. - I don´t have a clear percentage yet, however, I plan to share a fix amount before tax with BlockPay holders. For example, we pay up to 15% in sales commission to our BlockPay Ambassadors. Every BlockPay Ambassador earns a direct share in the transaction for each Store, Restaurant etc. he signs up. We have  +60 BockPay Ambassadors today in more than 25 countries.  Right, the point of sale business and mobile payment is all about transaction volume. We need a good amount per month to be profitable, however, if you consider the total amount we could get...

So blockpay is a company right?  And you develop different products as i understand it. The OP says: ""By ordering BlockPay tokens you support the development and continued growth of BlockPay, Echo and Stealth.""  So are 'echo' and 'stealth' different companies with whom you collaborate or are these products of blockpay itself?  And if echo or stealth produce revenues will these revenues be in- or excluded in the pay out to blockpay token holders? I ask this because the OP says:  ""Holding BlockPay tokens allows you to share in the rewards from BlockPay transactions as well as value increases from products built by the Company.""  It seems that tokenholders only get a share from the blockpay transactions and not from revenue from echo and stealth or other/future products. Only a share in the value increase of echo and stealth (=no share in the revenue generated).  Don't know what that means 'value increase' can you eleborate or give an example? And what is the difference between rewards and revenue? rewards sounds like you only share in the tips customers leave to blockpay.

We also offer a white label Blockchain wallet and other services regarding digital payment infrastructure which will be added too. Fiat Gateway services are planned too.  Most ICO tokens see high volatility and in the best cases a steady increase in value due to the value added from the company. We want to add as much value to the Token and their holders as possible.  Hope that helps.",False

I have to correct you but Odoo is not the biggest POS Software provider on the market. Odoo is more a niche player in terms of POS Systems. Odoo has over 60,000 Business Partners who use their software to manage their business and some business has hundreds of stores all over the country. In comparison to the big players with +200,000 Business Partners the Odoo market will be limited. We already started to talk to more POS System provider for future integration, including Shopify and more. BlockPay tokens give you the chance to participate with our global business. We want to provide more than a simple gold mine, we provide marketready blockchain tools reaching for mainstream consumer adoption.  Quote from: Tradingriver on August 19, 2016, 05:13:12 AM Quote What do you gain from buying BlockPay tokens? By ordering BlockPay tokens you support the development and continued growth of BlockPay, Echo and Stealth. With your help, we can expand the global digital payments network where you can earn, hold, and spend multiple digital currencies. Getting BlockPay to every grocery chain, retail, restaurant, vending machine or gas station isn’t cheap, but with your support, we can build this network together.   Holding BlockPay tokens allows you to share in the rewards from BlockPay transactions as well as value increases from products built by the Company.  If i remember it correct your company tried to get VC funding. Did you get it or do you do this ICO because you couldn't get a investment?  Your ICO is different, because your coin is not needed to use your services, so you should state clearly what investors get and what not. Legally this ICO seems like a nightmare, you are offering something for what exactly?  - no equity in your company - no token for a network  - seems just a revenue sharing feature?  b) How will you use the funds?  thanks  We have talked with many Investors, Angels and VC over the last months and realized over time that we cannot give back as much as we want with a big VC eating up all our power to guide our ship. Inspired by the recent Blockchain ICO´s we decided to follow their success.  Yes we offer a special ICO because we also offer three very unique products and platforms. Each is unique and solves many burning pains that are still open on the market. For example a universal point of sale platform for merchants that does not cost the anything. Finally communites can use Peercoin, Dash or Litecoin to buy products in stores. Echo on the other end combines highest encryption, IPFS decentralization and the most powerful blockchains in one WeChat killer app. WeChat has over +700 million users, with 80% using the app for daily mobile p2p payments... But only CNY, no USD, no BTC, no Gold, Silver... Echo will be a universal chat platform where users can add their own curreny and exchange it with their friends in a chat window... BlockPay and Echo are two foundational systems for the whole Blockchain industry.  Since Christmas 2015 we were able to build:  - Smartcoins Wallet for Android - BlockPay “S” - BlockPay for Odoo  We are now starting our Pre-ICO with “BLOCKPAY” tokens and will use the funds for the following: 1. Launch of BlockPay “S” in Google Play and BlockPay for Odoo 2. Additional BlockPay integrations into leading Point Of Sale systems 3. Development of BlockPay API 4. Adding more Fiat Gateways, Exchanges and Escrow Services 5. Development and introduction of Stealth transfers 6. Development and launch of ECHO for Android and iOS 7. Development of native iOS BlockPay “S” 8. Adding new features to BlockPay and ECHO 9. Building Digital Payment Infrastructure for the Future",False

Just one thing at the beginning, your faces are all over our websites and products. We are running a weekly VBlog on our Youtube channel and Steemi.com to share the latest updates with all of you. See here https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb78hNwIPH_44DnpvFrA-NQ/videos and here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjbx3qSmDe7T2kDfVS3av-qcCHt_i_mJm . I am looking forward to meeting you all in person on a Bitcoin Meetup, the Blockchain Week in Shanghai or the upcoming Bits&Pretzels Start-up Festival in Munich. We will be also at the Slush festival this fall to present BlockPay.      Hi BoldNinja,  thanks for your question. We have developed 5 working proof of concepts over the last 10 months which are all documented on our youtube channels, VBlog on Steem and other sources. I am more than happy to demonstrate the working Apps at your local Bitcoin Meetup. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb78hNwIPH_44DnpvFrA-NQ/videos <-- All Videos are here.  BlockPay is finished and is a point-of-sales system that supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Peercoins, Steem, BitShares and many more currencies natively. We are starting with 10 pilot stores and beer gardens here in Munich and are going to expand all over the World in the next months.  We have set up a global BlockPay Ambassador program, 54 Ambassadors in 25 countries who will promote and sell BlockPay to stores, restaurants, bars, retailers, groceries and much more. We are negotiating with top Retailers in Germany, Netherlands, Israel, Argentia and much more. In comparison to most other Blockchain Startups, We have a product ready to ship, that solves a real world problem. We don´t develop a product that maybe can be used for an unknown problem in +10 years future. We develop real life business solutions for Users, Enterprises, Charities, and much more. More info at www.BlockPay.ch and www.My-Echo.com  The Pre-ICO prices seem high, however, if you think about the marketing and developing cost of a true WeChat, WhatsApp and PayPal killer it is rather small. Promoting a new Instant messenger like Echo on a global scale costs millions... Integrating BlockPay in major ERP & POS software solutions from GK Software, SAP, Ingenico, NCS and much more requires high license fees. 5 to 6 diggets per month just to be added in their hardware terminals...  All unsold tokens will be added to the reserve fund. We have no access to the reserve fund and it is locked away by our escrow partner.  Quote from: penniless1 on August 16, 2016, 05:50:57 PM Quote from: Chris4210x on August 16, 2016, 04:06:12 PM   Better than Plutus. BlockPay ""S"" and BlockPay for Odoo is working very smooth already and we are adding the latest features right now before the upcoming release. Please see our demo video from BlockPay ""S"" and our Smartcoins Wallet : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vZ3o662RUw  Here is the Demo video for BlockPay for Odoo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7h2bs-ZWXo   So is Blockpay available in Odoo online demos?  I would like to try it out a bit, see if I can seriously recommend it to small businesses.  Odoo is an open source ERP program like SAP with many modules. We can introduce you as a future partner to Odoo if you are interested. BlockPay for Odoo will be added to the Odoo App store within the next weeks. You can see it working in the youtube video.  Quote from: mazzaneo on August 16, 2016, 09:36:06 PM 'Holding BlockPay tokens allows you to share in the rewards from BlockPay transactions as well as value increases from products built by the Company'  Can you please elaborate on what that means? Do you have any more information you can divulge prior to the IPO, it would be handy to see some kind of formula which will explain roughly what returns we can expect based on certain scenarios.  Thanks    We are a FinTech / Blockchain Start-up from Munich with three major projects under development, BlockPay, Echo and Stealth transfers. Beside that we also offer white label mobile wallets, full integration in our POS System, Loyalty rewards, and-and and. We have many Blockchain-based products we want to kickstart with sufficient funding. They all serve on purpose. To built business-ready tools for the whole Blockchain community!  Quote from: _Django05_ on August 16, 2016, 09:47:39 PM Why set price while most of the ICO's do not? If we do not sell all the tokens on Phase 2 then moving to phase 3 will be impossible, What will happen then? I'm not saying it will happen, im just speculating. And why use CCDEK as escrow, why not just use trusted escrow here?  Sorry for a bunch of questions. Thanks.  We followed the success of the HEAT, Peerplays, Lisk, Wave ICO etc. very closely. I decided to set up a fixed price for this first ICO so that we can ensure we get the minimum amount we need to progress, but don´t get killed by the tax bill after the ICO. In comparison to many other ICO on this platform, we are publicly showing our registered company name, address, Nr etc. and are fully incorporated and will pay the taxes for this crowdfunding. CCEDK has proven to be a solid partner in the ICO space and provides an all-in-one Service for startups like us. They handle, the Token creation & distribution, multisig escrow, marketing, sales of tokens and much more. We are happy to use the CCEDK service since it saves us a lot of time.

Selling your coins at very high price is not the way to do.  I really want to say i would invest in your coin, but i dont like you want to collect +40,000 btc plus you are not showing your face or your team.  This will not happen, open an normal ICO, collect the funds with your project and plans, show your face, nobody want to invest in anonymous guy, what if you ran with all the btc, no way.  Start thinking what to do, you can end with millions of useless coins. You are not to late to do the right thing.
