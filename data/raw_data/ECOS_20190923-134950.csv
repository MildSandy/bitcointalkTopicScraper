We didn’t expect the project to attract such a lot of interest, and so much attention to the preparation stage is very important.  NB: Beware of any possible scam, fraud or fake websites, because the official start of token sales will be on  April 2, 2018.  The project’s official website: www.ecos.ee  As well, all active members of the bounty/advertising campaign will soon receive the earned ECOS tokens.  We thank you in advance for understanding.

The system is aimed at the control of illegal trafficking and appearance in the market of counterfeit goods and fake and life-threatening products based on a public blockchain with a distributed database resistant to theft, substitution, alteration and breach of information contained therein.   Main task ECOS The main task of the ECOS project is combating the global problem of sale of poor-quality, dangerous, counterfeit and illegal products, their sale and distribution in the world industry of food products and drinks, especially alcoholic ones, since they are very liable to adulteration today. Poor-quality and dangerous food products and drinks have always been taken by people as a serious issue. As of today, expired and fake food products are a reason of emergence of various intoxicants and diseases, which is especially relevant for infants and young children, elderly and sickly people. The safety of food products and drinks (including alcoholic ones) is one of the most acute problems on the planet because it relates not only to the national health but also influences the global economy in general. The quality of food products and drinks influences people’s living standard, their social activity and demographic aspect - birthrate and increase in population. Therefore, in order to ensure a high and long-lasting living standard, states have to give a particular emphasis to food safety.   Benefits created by the ECOS project for the global community ECOS? The key advantage of the system is that the ECOS software created is based on a public (transparent and reliable) blockchain helps to protect billions of consumers all over the world (like us) from dangerous, fake and counterfeit products and drinks (including alcoholic ones). The application being built will enable a usual consumer to easily and quickly, just in a single click and 24/7, check whether a particular product complies with the sanitary norms and safety standards using its smartphone or tablet PC.  Every hour, billions of consumers all over the world will be able to quickly and easily trace and check all the categories of a selected product of interest to them, whether raw food products, semi-finished products, ready-to-eat food, soft or alcoholic drinks, themselves with no middlemen. The software will be available as an app in all languages on smartphones and tablet PCs. For example, a shopper selects a particular product with a special QR-code (based on blockchain), puts their smartphone to the product and scans the QR-code of the product. After that the program will provide a public blockchain storage with the product description, after which the consumer can view one of the two tables as their option: Option 1 — Brief, containing information on the product in percentage (it shows: safety, naturalness, healthfulness and quality); Option 2 — Extended, in a form of detailed information with food indices of a selected product (information on the full life cycle of the product, GMO (genetically modified organisms) content, content of pesticides, herbicides, toxic chemicals and artificial fertilizers, presence of aggressive artificial preservatives, colorants, flavorings, etc.).
