Let's start with the first one - starting from September 1, 2018, according to the new style, we switch to the OPEN SORCE mode. That is - our project becomes open source. We will gradually spread out all our developments, and when the development is completed and sent to the plant - put the RTL code on GitHub.  Further - we have concluded a contract with another project, which is engaged in the development of miners. They already have several working prototypes, but no good chips. Thus, the development process is accelerating, since we do not need to think about the development of a printed circuit board, software for them, and assembly of the case. Now we have a complete demarcation of tasks - we develop only chips, and our partners - collect miners. And this accelerates and simplifies everything. You can get acquainted with their project by following the link: https://markscheider.io  Next - September 15-16 this year, we plan to go to the annual hackathon in Kiev, and try to arrange a presentation of our project there. If we have time, we can even bring our prototype to FPGA there. Hakaton - here: http://blockchainua-hackathon.com  Another little news - we applied for a startup competition, which will begin in Moscow, too, sometime in mid-September. If we take at least 40 place there, our project will fall into prize-winning places and we will be able to advertise it in a wide range of investors for free. Competition - here: http://accelerator.decenturion.com/?utm_source=eu  Oh, yes, one more thing - PreSale lasts until October 1st. Discount as before 75%. Since October 1, we pass to 50%. Remained in stock for almost $ 9,000 tokens. Who can help us - do a good deed. We now need to register a legal entity in Belarus, as we want to move to HTP (High Technology Park) within a year or a year and a half and all business will be conducted through Belarus. Registration costs $ 750, if not collected - we will not be able to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the manufacturer. And we will not sign - there will not be an order for tests, either for the shuttle, or for the chips themselves. If suddenly did not speak - negotiations are conducted with the company GUC. It is offered immediately either 12nm or 7nm technology. But for now, without the NDA, we can not even know the prices, because this is a commercial secret. So, if anyone can help the project - finance us. We will make a good miner - everything will be fine.  Vitaliy Monastyrskiy. VenusMINE project.",False

A feature of our architecture is its compactness. It is several times smaller than the architectures on which existing miners are based. This means that on the same area of the microchip crystal, much more computing cores can be accommodated and thus provide greater performance, at the same cost of power and chip prime cost. Taking into account that the possibilities of technology to reduce the technological process have reached their physical limit and to reduce technological norms of less than 3-5 nm is not possible, we believe that the future of the mining industry lies in the optimization of architectural solutions. And this means that our project has great prospects. At the moment, the development of a preliminary kernel version (ver. 0.1) has been completed. In it, we managed to reduce the architecture by 3 times in comparison with the architectures of existing miners. The already existing developments of our project allow us to count on the fact that we will be able to compress our architecture yet by a factor of two, thereby achieving a total reduction of 5-6 times. We also have ideas on how to increase the speed of its work. In the end result, we expect to get chips with a 10-fold increase in the hashreit.  The visual simulation of the work of our architecture in the LogiSim logical simulator is presented in the next video on our official channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwFkRw-9g88&feature=youtu.be  And in this video, we explain the basic concepts, such as: ""chip"", ""crystal"", ""core"", ""transistor"" and ""architecture.""

Ecли Bы, вдpyг, нe знaeтe - вoт pyccкaя вeткa, oнa ecть y нac нa caйтe в pyccкoм paздeлe: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3627206.msg36619612#msg36619612  If you do not mind, read our site. There everything is described in detail. In particular, it is said that the token is executed on the Waves platform. And the Waves platform has no smart contracts yet. At the moment, we need a small amount - 3000 - 4000 USD. It's not such a big sum to worry about honesty. If you do not have enough of those materials that we provide, then we can not give you any other guarantees, except for an honest word. In such circumstances, we recommend making a minimum contribution, one that does not burden you. If you are interested in our project, but you are afraid of fraud on our part, invest as much as you personally are not afraid to lose - 10 USD, 50 USD, 200 USD. Each sum, which he considers insignificant, has its own. This approach will allow us to collect those minimally necessary funds that we need, and at the same time not too burdensome investors. The next stage, after we make a prototype for this money, will be a public presentation of this prototype, which will dispel most of the doubts from investors.  Orders are divided into 4 groups solely for the convenience of investors. Unfortunately, most people, just like you, do not read the site and other information materials, so they do not find our orders on the stock exchange. Having bitkoyny, they are looking for our warrants in a glass with bitokoyany, instead of selling bitkoyny for dollars and buy tokens for dollars. This forced us to divide all the tokens into 4 parts and put each of them against the most popular crypto currency. As the tokens are bought, we will change the orders, adjusting their price and the amount in each section of the currency.",False

We started developing such a coin, but no one began to sponsor its development, because investors invest only in projects where they can earn money. And such a coin does not bring profit. Therefore, we started our project VenusMINE to earn money and finance the VenusGEET project on our own. He is now frozen. Its symbol you can see on a T-shirt, against which background electronic components are photographed. The photo is located above.
