The beta of the Embermine Platform will be released this fall.  For those of you wondering, we have NEVER been very active on BitcoinTalk, as this thread's history shows. There are many reasons for that but the one of the biggest is because of the posts like the last four.  I would politely ask Jane9711, RickJansen, ...vendetta..., maria.may, and bitcoingod100 to send me your ETH addresses of your holdings and we will get you taken care of, I would even buy you out of your Embermine holdings if you like. So contact me and I will:  1) Make sure you got all of your ""money"": (Jane9711: ""they pretended they would give us the money of these airdrops and just kept it themself...James Drake is a charlatan and imposter!!"" Well show me what airdrops you did not receive. You certainly have not informed me personally of this, and exactly how is it a problem that I keep it for myself when it was mine to begin with?) So please DM me with your address that did not receive ""your money"" and I will be sure you get everything you deserve. Until then you are just a copy/paste profile. This is your chance to prove your case and get what is coming to you.  2) Give you a full update personally. First of all, RickJansen, BitcoinTalk is NOT the center of our information universe. Contact me directly or come to our Telegram page: https://t.me/Embermine  Now, for the rest of the world, things are actually very active. We are still set for a beta release of the product and working closely with Akyumen to bring the platform to the dedicated mobile hardware platform. Again, just because there is nothing HERE does not mean nothing is happening. Don't want to get banned on social media? Trying not talking to the team like ...vendetta... and you might make it long enough to prove a point or two. I am more than happy to answer a question if it is posted with the hope of receiving an answer, not to just yell scam and disappear, like you seem to want to do on multiple threads.  So, guys, DM me you addresses and let's get you all worked out or bought out of your MBRS. If you can prove that you are somehow have been cheated, scammed, or not receive the airdrops that you deserve, I will certainly resolve that situation, even publicly and transparently.

It is hard to explain, but its roots are in the hack in October when we had to switch to a completely new account to manage our core files. We finally got it sorted out just in time for these drops to coincide with the announcements that are yet to come.  There were considerable issues with many users because of problems with both Cryptopia and EtheerDelta holding funds or preventing the withdrawal of the tokens in time for the snapshots. Now, additionally, the AURA network has grown significantly during that time and many people asked for another chance at the snapshots. What I am about to propose makes more sense once you all know what else is in store, but my suggestion is that we retake the snapshots. ALL of them. At the same time. But I will not dispose of the old snapshots, I will use them too.  I will give each address the benefit of the doubt and use the HIGHEST total from either date to determine the amount of each token to receive.  Yes, I know that means that some people will get tokens that they ""did not earn"" depending upon your perspective. But seeing as I am giving away about $20 million in tokens over the next five days to the Embermine Community, I hope that some of you will forgive me.  The snapshot will take place on Wednesday at Noon Central USA Time (it is 5:00pm Central USA Time on Sunday now)  I will also take this opportunity to tell you that the token distribution rations have been updated to reflect the proper final distribution totals and network size  All in favor of the Users.  Update #2 Token Balances:  Between now and Wednesday, we will be working furiously to get ensure that everyone has the MBRS and other Ecosystem tokens that they deserve and earned from giveaways, contests, and other agreements that have not been completed. The idea is that on Wednesday at Noon CST, the maximum number of possible users for MBRS will be realized and all of them will be captured on the snapshot of the MBRS holders.  Update #3 AURA Airdrop Ratios  Due to some changes in the original anticipated supply and size of the AURA community and tokens, I have updated the ratio that will be dropped on everyone for all tokens to better reflect the ratios between each network and maximize all of the drops for all users. Before we required a minimum of 1000, and that led to some people partioning into 1000 unit addresses. That showed me that people, regardless of what you do, will always angle for advantage if they can. Given the fact that I am going to use the other snapshots to compare information, and give the benefit to the highest total at each address, I figure that those who pushed 1000 tokens into a bunch of addresses either have not moved them, continue to use them, or they are gone entirely, so I have changed the AURA tokens ratio:  AURA Tokens delivered to holders: (Always rounding down) Snapshots taken of MBRS, TOV, DOM, IDEA, SLIP, and KNOW on Wednesday, February 14th, 2018 at 12:00pm Central USA Time. Do NOT wait until the last minute and do not try to move the tokens out at 12:01pm PLEASE because those extra two or three minutes should not make any difference if it means that you may get lost or miss out entirely.  MBRS 100:1 TOV 200:1 SLIP 200:1 IDEA 200:1 KNOW 400:1 DOM 10,000:1  So if you have 54,132 MBRS you will receive 541 AURA tokens. If you have 213,456 KNOW tokens, you will receive 533 AURA tokens. If you have 4,234,094 DOM you will receive 423 AURA tokens.  The delivery of all Aura tokens to MBRS holders will commence immediately after the snapshots are completed.  Update #4: COBU Drop  The COBU drop will happen using the same snapshots as the AURA tokens and using the same methodology and timing but with these ratios:  MBRS: 1:1 TOV: 2:1 SLIP: 2:1 IDEA 2:1 KNOW 4:1 DOM 100:1  So if you have 1,237,452 MBRS you will receive 1,237,452 COBU tokens If you have 1,623,400 KNOW tokens you will receive 405,850 COBU  The delivery of COBU will commence immediately after the AURA drop is completed.  Update #5: Upcoming partnership: Manatt Digital  We have received, and intend to accept, an offer letter for representation from Manatt Digtial, a law firm in Los Angeles:  https://www.manatt.com/Manatt-Digital  They will assist our lead counsel, Mike Ecternacht, in the design, development, and execution of our ongoing realtionships with various creative content developers, content providers, and of course, the creation and development of our smart contract engine, which is the heart of the Techne protocol.  This is a huge thing for us because they have not only the experience, but also the connections throughout the areas of industry that we require to be not only competitive in this marketplace, but also to assist us in building relationships with the wide variety of organizations we will need to partner with in the future. We are wading into shark-infested waters and we need experienced shark wranglers. We will not need a bigger boat with these guys on our side! We are very excited about this relationship.  Update #6: Akyumen Technologies: Our own dedicated hardware platform  We have reached an agreement of terms on a royalty-free software license agreement with innovative mobile platform: Akyumen Technologies. After several years of development and overcoming a slew of individual technological challenges, Akyumen's Hawk is finally ready for manufacture and distribution.  https://www.akyumen.com/default-item/hawk/  There are several unique pieces to this mobile technology that makes it not only amazing, but also uniquely suited to host the Embermine Platform, along with each User's Personal Data Chain (PDC), which is the means by which individuals can maintain and access your own data relative to the Techne Distributed Ledger. (more details regarding PDCs and Techne coming)  Here are just some of the features:  1) Projector. The most apparent and obvious element that is different on this phone is the embedded 35 lumen projector that completely changes the game when it comes to sharing and showing information or content on your phone. No more crowding around a small screen, instead, you can project an high definition image up to 100"" wide onto any screen, wall, or even the ceiling. I have HELD this tech in my hands myself and have used it myself. No heat, pixelzation, slowdown, or interference.     2) Dedicated encrypted storage. The unit has native dual-boot capability and seperate dedicated storage areas to keep your PDC and your standard phone systems in seperate encrypted areas for added security.  3) Android-based: The Akyumen Hawk is Android-based for ultimate development flexibility.  4) Secure Hardware Wallet. The Akyumen Hawk upon the release of the Embermine Platform upon it, will also function as a secure hardware wallet, with native compatibility with all Embermine Ecosystem tokens, as well as balance query, P2P secure transfers (using DomainToken) and more.  5) Native Embermine integration. All of Embermine's products, apps, and tokens will operate natively upon the phone. For example, DomainToken can be used in its natural form, enabling direct, secure connectivity to all of your data, communication, financial, and social network channels. And with DomainToken, one can easily switch ""Entities"" while using the phone, enabling it to be the Nexus of all your buisiness and networking channels. This level of integration is only possible because of the unique features of the phone and their decision to build their phone to suit our unique requirements.  6) Free phones? That is right. Akyumen is launching their own token (AKYU) tonight (details coming). One token is required to ""register"" your phone to the network. But Akyumen hardware can only be purchased with AKYU tokens. And you can earn AKYU tokens simply from conducting various activities and using your phone as you normally would. the rate earned on average over 2 years would be enough to upgrade to the newest version of a phone. The amount of the phone is still being finalized, but our current estimates are in the 500-700 AKYU per phone, the final amount will be announced sometime in the next couple of weeks.  7) Content Networks. A deal is currently being finalized to bring various content networks to the phone natively, The addition of the projector makes movies and other video events a group event and a snap to do.  There is so much more to tell, including their table and Holophone products, but so much more will be discussed about this directly. Much of the website and the other content is still being prepared with the latest information, as it has been a project that has been in development for several years.  There is a small beta release (without the Embermine Platform) in April, and a worldwide release (without the full Embermine Platform) on July 1st.  that brings me to: #7: The Embermine Timeline  this is not the FULL exhaustive timeline, but the one that we will offer for the time being. We will provide more details as we move along but here is the current development/release timeline for Embermine:  February 12th: Akyumen (AKYU) token release. Will be dropped to MBRS holders using the Wednesday snapshot. These drops will occur along with the AURA and COBU drops and ONLY to MBRS holders. Ratio: 20:1 (Total of 2.5 million dropped) March 1st, 2018: Full scale development begins on the Embermine Platform, Techne, and Akyumen Integration June 7th - 10th: The 1st Annual Embermine Users Conference in Lincoln, NE (more on this in a bit) July 1, 2018: Worldwide launch and release of Akyumen Hawk without the full Embermine Platform August 1st, 2018: Target release of the Embermine Platform beta and testnet for Techne. Initial integration with Hawk and basic functionality completed. October 15th, 2018: Target release of Embermine Platform MVP and Techne Mainnet. Full intergration with Akyumen Hawk complete.  More details to come!  So that is right, everyone is getting Akyumen tokens.  Many after the airdrop will have enough to get their first phone for free. We are counting on this as the way that everyone will be able to get used to using the phone and the stress test the hardware long before the system itself is fully on the platform. All updates for Embermine and its associated applications will happen as they are released.  Update #8: Lampix  As many of you know, I have been working as an advisor for Lampix since the company's inception and I have waited a long time for that to come full circle. Now, almost a year later, I am happy to say that we are negotiating the final terms with Lampix for them to work on developing their technology for the Akyumen Corp line of products, enabling such cool elements such as interactivtivty with the projector display for everything from games to presentations.  https://www.lampix.com/#/device  The initial integration of Lampix will allow the phone, when it is in the cradle in presentation mode, to project a custom typing/mousing interface ""behind"" the phone, allowing the user to work and navigate on the phone without holding it, jarring the image, or interfere with the ongoing presentation.  But the ultimate idea is that with a small portable FOLDABLE screen that can fit in you pocket, you have a monitor that does not require power, with Lampix intergration to make it a touch screen and with a programable type and mousing interface that is custom to the application being used on the phone.  All of it running just off the power of the phone and its power source.  Before I move on to the next big update, I would like to openly address a couple of things:  1) This is a software license for Akyumen Corp to have full access to our technology and us, theirs for testing and development purposes. This does not mean that it is dedicated to ONLY that platfrom.  2) We will launch on all platforms simultaneously, although the Hawk users will likely get most updates the fastest due to the system's integration with our product.  3) We are VERY aware of some of the ""bad press"" that exists out there about Aasim, the CEO of Akyumen. In fact the only reason why we have not announced this arrangement a couple of weeks ago was to allow a full due diligence on the technology and these ""claims"" from a former disgruntled employee, and others trying to discredit their tech. But it is an amazing thing to hold something in your hands that actually works, and then see your own tech rip the demo apart and actually look at the chipset, and the unique nano tech involved to make it work.  Okay, moving on!  Update #9: Establishment of the Firestarter Initiative with The Art of Elysium  During the Sundance Film Festival, we sponsored the ChefDance dinner supporting The Art of Elysium, and philanthropy project in Los Angeles. Their mission: ""We believe in using art as a catalyst for social change. Our “full circle” approach engages emerging artists in inspiring acts of service that forge opportunities for them to share their creativity in diverse and meaningful ways with individuals of need. We support and acknowledge our volunteer artists by providing platforms to showcase their art within the community.""  The synergy between  projects is not only obvious, but also important. Not only will we be involved in helping them use the Embermine Platform to manage and empower their mission, but we have also provided the seed funds for what we hope will be the single largest endowment for the arts and creativty ever created. The Firestarter Initiative is the philanthropic arm of Embermine, engaged in helping use the power of creativity to engage in everything from projects like The Art of Elysium to urban or building revitalization projects, like the ones we are currently evaluating in Lincoln, Minneapolis, and Detroit.  Our first Firestarter Grant has been given to The Art of Elysium: 2,000,000 MBRS, 4,000,000 TOV, and 4,000,000 SLIP. These were funds that we were able to secure through a combination of our partners, top holders, and most of all, Ryan Colby of TokenFest, the original founder of DomainToken. Those tokens will also benefit from the token drops that will happen to those systems, ensuring growth and funding for many many years to come.  Update #10: Sanyika Street  We have worked out an agreement with the amazing Sanyika Street to be the ""voice"" of the Embermine project. He has agreed to use ""If you are an Artist"" as a piece for introducing the world to Embermine and our projects, especially the Art of Elysium. Here is a live cut of what he did for us at Sundance: https://youtu.be/sWz-0ckXgow?t=464  and finally Update #11: NIO and AURA drops:  So the end result of all of this is that our collective networks are going to be growing. Once the drops to our networks are finished, we will be taking a snapshot fo the Aura and NIO holders on Wednesday, February 21st, 2018 at Noon Central Standard Time.  Immediately afterward, we will conduct drops of the following tokens to those networks:  AURA holders will receive:  MBRS: 1 per 1000 AURA TOV: 2 per 1000 AURA IDEA: 2 per 1000 AURA SLIP: 2 per 1000 AURA KNOW: 4 per 1000 AURA DOM: 100 per 1000 AURA COBU: 2 per 1000 AURA AKYU: 2 per 1000 AURA  NIO Holders will receive:  AURA: 1 per 1000 NIO COBU: 1 per 1 NIO AKYU: 2 per 1000 NIO  These distributions will begin immediately after the snapshot has been taken and will follow the same guidelines and requirements of all of the other token drops. These are not HUGE drops, but there will help bring some more people into the fold, and seeing as our networks will already be mingled at that point, it will give a few MBRS holders a nice little bonus.  So there you have it. All of us have been working so hard collectively for the past month to bring you all of this. It was hard to keep most of this under our hats until we had the time to properly vet or check out information and much of what was discussed here is even just the first stages, but they bode well for us long term as we continue to work toward defining and devleoping all of these elements. Now we can speak directly to the efforts that we are marking on all levels of the project from the hardware to software and all of the content inbetween. We are extremely excited about all of these partnerships and relationships that we are developing and we cannot wait until we can dive directly into the development angles we are taking.  From all of this, I hope that you can all take away from this on how hard and how much sacrifice has already gone into this project, not just from me, but the whole team. This past month has been a real challenge and taxing both physically and metally, but these challenges are the crucible from which we are forging something truly special. If you get a chance, please make sure to tell the team members you stuble across on here ""Thank you"", especially those you may not see often on here, like the developers. They are sacrificing more than you know every day to help make this a reality.   In the end though, it is all of you who really deserve praise. The Community. A little over a year ago, when Garrison and I started this company, we had big dreams and goals for the company, but I never imagined that I would be writing updates like this. What gets me out of bed every day is not the pursuit of wealth or attract a cult of personality, but rather to help people not only find each other, but themselves inside their creative opportunities. We have an amazing Community of users here, and the amazing thing is that we are just now getting started. I cannot wait to see what happens in the next year. Carry the fire!",False

Huh, being the developer and the fact that I have GIVEN AWAY my tokens to the entire network, sure does not seem like a likely statement that I am ""dumping"". I am one of the most visible and accessible altcoin developers in the world. Must be nice to just talk about what it ""feels"" like to you, and make it out to be truth. Who are you to say anything about this project, much less my intentions with it? You want to have an opinion, fine, but do not start talking truth unless you are willing to back it up with some hard knowledge or proof.  First of all, I am not ""dumping"" my coins. I cannot. I own less than 1% of the total market and have for several months. Why? Because I have been airdropping them on various networks, including the Autonio platform, where for one month I paid for the first 1,000 subscriptions by BURNING NIO tokens with a current value of over $250,000. I have also dropped (NOT SOLD, TRADED, or SWAPPED) a total of nearly 6 billion tokens and have spent my OWN money promoting, supporting, and developing these projects.  Second of all, anyone who looks at your account history knows what you are all about. You are the scam, my friend. So kindly move along before I make a nice lesson out of you. I have devoted my efforts and my very life to fighting for the very technologies that YOU make sound bad to the world to drop their price and give you a few more pennies in YOUR pocket, or because you have nothing better to do with your life than try to FUD people out of existence. Well you are barking up the wrong tree here, go on to the REAL scam coins.  Now, if you would like to go fully public with me, head to head, live on YouTube or some other social media site, I would love to. I have nothing to hide. We have been on local and regional news testifying at the Nebraska State Legislature in support of proper supportive legal protections and structures for these new technologies. Where have you been? What effort have YOU made to make this technology actually work for people. You stand in the shadows and pretend to be working for the people, and accusing others of falsehood, while operating under it yourself.  The simple fact that you are so completely unoriginal that you have literally copy/pasted your arguments to other, random cryptos tells me, honestly, everything a person needs to know about you, and your motivations. And the fact that you will never, ever allow yourself to face me publicly, much less actually utilize logic or evidence to prove your claims, helps me deduce even more about your character.  You sir, need to perhaps actually do some research before you try to attack any crypto. You made a big mistake. Now it is your choice to decide how you are going to use this information to remedy this mistake. Or you can make a bigger mistake and try to justify your actions.  Good luck to you.  ",False

Here's the response I was writing before it was removed:  Well, Harsh. You literally asked to be perma-banned. Not in a ""you were asking for it"" way, but that was quite literally your request, which Justin proceeded to do. I believe you used the phrase ""I am too greedy."" Of course if you buy at ATH, you're not going to have a good time in the short term. The market can be a cruel mistress. Several members of this community scorned us when they bought at peak and then it went down. Well, shit happens.  I personally detest the ""moon"" and ""bags"" talk as that is not where I want the discourse of our community to go and ultimately not what the Embermine Platform is about. I want to build tools for maximizing human potential, not cater to wannabe day traders waiting for moon. I don't care about riches and glory, I simply want to make a difference with tools that actual creatives will use, not people obsessively checking portfolios and their gains. That's actually a reason I really like Autonio, is that their tech has the potential to be used in a variety of contexts with end-users interacting with the market without making it a part-time job.  There may have been assumptions as to when and how the hack would be resolved. Modifying a timeline when trusted third parties are involved is risky when it comes to expectations. Everything is in flux, in constant motion.  No one is ""conning newbies,"" the whole bags talk, which I am not fond of, is simply familiar parlance amongst enthusiastic traders and supporters of this space. I prefer talk of blockchain's merits as a technology rather using price as the sole metric of success (which it is not). Is Bitcoin being used as P2P digital cash or a viable medium of exchange in commerce in any significant way since its inception nine years ago? No. But people are enamored by the price.   Eventually, I want the majority of the active members of the community to be creatives interested in using the platform. Because those people are why we are doing this in the first place.  ------------------  Bottom line. Patience is a virtue in this space. Posting a huge block of ALL CAPS text in a community forum denouncing the project and the team when you appeared enthusiastic and excited about the project a week ago is not a great way to approach things.

These musicians and many others will be accepting the Monero cryptocurrency (XMR) as payment in their online stores.  Monero is a cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin, that is optimized for better security and privacy of transactions. While Bitcoin is often considered anonymous, the transactions can actually be tracked using analytics tools and in some cases identify the users. As many developers and users in the blockchain and cryptocurrency sphere value anonymity as a basic human right in a networked society, endeavors like Monero and ZCash have made it a particular focus to secure those properties. The double-edged sword here seems to be that strong anonymous properties are also desired features in various criminal activities such as money-laundering.  Project Coral Reef, led by Monero developer Riccardo Spagni and entrepreneur Naveen Jain, aims to bring Monero into the public consciousness and give it utility in more commercial spaces. The project was funded through Monero’s Forum Funding System, in which anonymous contributors can support proposed initiatives that can make a positive impact on the Monero ecosystem and its widespread adoption by developers, merchants, and consumers.  Select stores will also feature a 15% discount if Monero is used as the payment method.  http://www.tokenverse.com/news/privacy-centric-cryptocurrency-monero-will-be-accepted-in-select-online-stores-during-the-holidays-45-musician-sites-including-weezer-mariah-carey-and-slayer/",False

Smart contracts can help eliminate the unnecessary frictions in the creative/collaborative process. The origins of Embermine are directly tied to the failure of an independent publishing company that used Amazon as its enterprise backbone. This means 30% cut on every sale, monthly checks (from each region; US, UK, etc), at a two-month latency. This is not only incredibly inefficient for the author, but also the publisher, with the latter being a central point of vulnerability and human error. We originally tried to think of a way to do automated distributed payments that honor royalty agreements with traditional payment gateways like PayPal, Stripe, or Square, but ran into a wall. That wasn't a solution; that granularity of control was missing. Then I discovered Ethereum, after which my partner James Drake and I promptly fell into the winding rabbit hole that is blockchain.  Agreements between parties are the backbone of commerce, usually enforced by a legalese prose document. Unfortunately, these documents can lead to ambiguity and are subject to ""whim"". Smart contracts are just automated processing scripts--code--that doesn't have any legal binding to them, but they can be an operable form of an agreement, namely how assets (or some unit of value) are moved about. Who, what, when, how, why? Code is law is code. Both software and law are modular, with a lot of boilerplate information (text). By isolating the parameters and creating a What You See is What You Sign user experience, we can allow creatives to leverage this technology for their own business endeavors and agreements.  Now you can introduce the element of the Ricardian contract (Ian Grigg), in which the paramaters of the smart contract are matched with the ""params"" of a no-nonsense natural language document. This allows one to clarify intent behind the programmed agreements to eliminate ambiguity; this can also serve as a necessary mechanism for arbitration in the event of a dispute.  We are bringing digital scarcity to creative works. This not only allows a digital secondary market, but transaction fees as these assets change hands go back to the project of their origin and are then processed by the Compact, the nexus of code and prose contracts the govern a particular project and enforce ownership and compensation.  There are other projects working to make the creative space fairer for the actual creatives: Decent, CreativeChain, SingularDTV, Opus, Resonate, Token FM, Mycelia, and many others. It is encouraging that others are trying to solve the same problems. To go into detail on why our approach is different from each of these projects would be tedious. That being said...  We are about to release a revised whitepaper that details the design of the platform. We are also in the midst of updating our website.  If you want to stay tuned into our development and interact with our community, please join https://t.me/embermine. This is where the community developed organically and where a lot of the dialogue happens (more so than Bitcoin Talk). We're working on making sure this thread is updated along with the rest.

ION is the transactional unit of value on the Embermine Platform used to purchase goods and services. Distributing it in the same manner as the other tokens would go against its purpose. Sparks (HEAT) also has its own unique role in the platform that a distribution would immediately negate. The previous tokens are Project tokens, similar to that which Projects on the Embermine platform will be able to release. ION is the transactional unit that circulates throughout the ecosystem. Sparks (HEAT) have their own mechanism, so putting them on the open market would create a severe imbalance.  I think at some point someone was asking about other tokens in the Embermine ecosystem and the latter two were lumped in with the other distributed tokens.

I've read the WP and scanned through much of the Telegram Embermine Updates, Steemit....etc. I'm still somewhat confused on a few areas:  1. MBRS are the Base tokens that are used for PoS to secure the Blockchain & provide access to the Embermine Platform for users. New UserID sign-up only requires 1 MBRS to open an account.  - Are there any other use cases for MBRS beyond PoS & Acct registration?  2. This is where I get really confused. The WP lists HEAT & SPARKS as the Transactional Tokens on the platform. HEAT can not be purchased but only earned through consistent community participation in the Embermine platform.  Then in Telegram I read that the names have been changed from HEAT to SPARKS, & SPARKS to ION. Also there is TBD release dates for ION & SPARKS.  - Are SPARKS & ION being released to MBRS holders sometime in the future (TBD)?     - Will users still acquire SPARKS through their community participation on the platform?     - Once the platform is operational, how will people acquire ION (the token of value used to conduct Embermine transactions including purchases of digital goods, smart contracts & other applications).     - It appears to me that the main token of value will be ION and not MBRS? What is going to drive demand/value for the MBRS token?  3. Approach to the Mass Market and how to grow the Embermine user base. From the WP it states: ""with our payment capture technology, revenues that occur on other market places, such Amazon, Google Play, or iTunes can be intercepted and processed by the Project Compact within Embermine, we can bring some of the novel functionality to Users' products in existing marketplaces.""  - What exactly does this mean? How do you/will you intercept these revenue streams?      - I actually found this Steemit article while researching and I'm curious if her explanation about the MBRS Revenue Sharing mechanics is accurate?  https://steemit.com/embermine/@coincravings/why-putting-usd100-in-embermine-coins-today-will-set-you-up-for-life   4. My final point is an observation rather than a question. After doing my research, I can see that Embermine has a unique and disruptive business model and my gut tells me that this is something worth exploring/investing in. The team is also to be commended on all their hard work thus far. I've been in crypto for only 1.5 years and I am the first to admit that I am not technically inclined (I'm an investor), but these were my initial thoughts when I reached the Embermien website. I think I am the typical audience that will be looking at Embermine:  - There's not really any information on the website that tells me what the project does. What problem is Embermine solving?       - After reading the WP, I didn't gain a lot of clarity. There's many moving parts to the project. Will the average person take the time to try and understand all these moving parts (ION, SPARKS, MBRS)? Might be helpful to refine the message/information on the website to grab potential 'drive-by' users/investors.     - If the Revenue model from the Steemit article IS accurate, then that's the kind of information that you need to have front and centre throughout all your media avenues     (Website; BTCT; Twitter....etc) . That's a significant and strong selling point for people to want to obtain MBRS!!!   5. I've also seen a couple comments/references to the EOS platform. Given that Embermine is using bitUSD (BTS) for some of its asset pegging, and BTS is a Larimer project, is there going to be some form of affiliation/use of the EOS platform with Embermine?  Sorry for my lonnnng post but as I said, my gut tells me that Embermine is a solid project and I want to be invested. Just gotta do my DD first. Thanks!  ",False

Please be a few more days patient. James Drake and the Team behind Embermine is working hard this days, because they will go to the https://mergeshow.com/ in Orlando Florida from 14.-18.10.  The Merge will bring public attention to Embermine and the Concept will be explained to the mass. Embermine is one sponsor of the Merge and there will be a lot of marketing done for all Embermine Tokens like TOV, IDEA, DOM and of course MBRS.  The next coming airdrop for MBRS holders is after the https://auton.io/  ICO has finished. All Holders will get for every 10 MBRS > 1 NIO, so if you have 100 MBRS you will get 10 NIO.  Then on the 15th Oct will be a snapshot of all TOV http://www.tokenverse.com/ done and all TOV Holders will get 2 KNOW for every 1 TOV.    Here is the last update from the CEO James Drake out of the Telegram Channel.  James Drake, [10.10.17 08:44] Just wanted everyone to know that we appreciate everyone’s patience as we work toward our big week at MERGE!  The next 10 days will see a number of new things:  1) The updated, and expanded white paper 2) Updated website’s for all of our properties. 3) Updated and detailed road map 4) Reveal and Launch of Embermine’s Firestarter program 5) Reveal of DomainToken’s application, including a full use case analysis and development road. 6) Embermine website User Account creation, for the purposes of accessing the additional information and communications available only to Users!  More on this tomorrow. 7) TokenVerse’s Sales page to allow ordering or ads and other services and paying with TOV KNOW Token Snapshot/Distribution on the TOV rail 9) IDEAToken beta site launched 10) Embermine HQ office buildout completed (no more dust!)

Ratio is 2:1 KNOW:TOV  Not sure if there are any more airdrops planned for MBRS holders? The Dev's said, ""Other airdrops using MBRS as the rail may arise, but they will not be facilitated by the Embermine team.""   Sure, that is the whole concept behind Embermine.  In the future there will be constantly new airdrops from the new projects which are build on the platform.  Quote from Embermine Update Channel https://t.me/embermine_updates  Here's a use case. On Embermine, Projects will produce various goods or services. Our focus has been on digital goods from the beginning (although branching into the physical realm is not impossible, it does increase the complexity quite a bit because of the the difficulties with distribution, manufacturing, etc.). In the same way that holders of MBRS have been receiving other crypto-assets like TOV, IDEA, or DOM, Projects can issue tokens for accessing certain goods and services. For example, a writer can distribute a token that grants access to her new book. This distribution can focus on holders of specific tokens or issue to ALL MBRS holders. Naturally, if you are a part of the network, you will accumulate a lot of excess assets. You could then input the settings on an AI trading bot that can then sell select assets on an open market, based on certain parameters you set (as in Autonio). This potentially results in global passive income for everyone on the Embermine network. The Algosharing allows people to trade and share tried and true strategies, algorithms, for achieving optimal results in the markets. And that only touches upon the synergy between the two. Hope that helps  Embermine is a sleeping giant and i love this concept and the community realy.  If anybody has more questions, please come to our Telegram Channel https://t.me/embermine  Happy trading ...",False

And since these assets are issued at a particular point in time, then users who join the network may want to buy these works and can do so in a sort of exchange context although optimized and configured for non-traders. The UI could be like any other online storefront.   And the Project Compacts which are the living documents that govern and facilitate the development and allocation of value within a Project, a transaction fee can be set for post-publication trading and selling, allowing for the first time (that I am aware) a secondary market that actually feeds value back to the Creators instead of us or any company. There's more granular control within a digital environment. We're just bringing in the benefits of physical goods into a distributed, online context.  When we are ready, there will be a lot of outreach to the creative community. We have people within our circle of acquaitances that are very interested in using the platform, including ourselves. The fall of an independent publishing company is what started all of this.  Also, one thing I want to clarify. A creative entrepreneur can choose to distribute their new release on a ""rail"" other than MBRS. This can allow for creatives to piggyback off of each others userbase or their own body of work.  Realistically, creators will implement a hybrid strategy, a combination of direct retail sales and rail distribution. For example, Stephen King could sell his novels as only retail but distribute short stories or novellas for free to people who hold certain novels. This allows one to experiment with different strategies for reaching a broad readership while staying connected to the value generated. Users are incentivized to participate in the distributed patronage to return value back to the creators as well as make some passive income on the side.  Distributing to MBRS holders would maximize the spread, but I'm more interested in creatives working in tandem, playing off of each other's market presences to reach their target audiences. 😁   This system is not limited to books, but any digital asset. These tokens are digital bearer certificates for a good or service. Software licenses for scarce objects. Zoom back a bit and look at the model. The basket of assets you accumulate could consist of books, comics, music, movies, video games, applications. Down the line, if we can figure out the best way to interface with the world of physical distribution and assets, that will introduce a whole new dimension. Creating a scarce object architecture and making it accessible to mainstream use is key.    I think a secondary marketplace that doesn't act like a black hole or wood chipper will appeal to MANY people.",False

When it comes to the distribution and management of one's tokens, there is a certain granularity of control that is lacking. For example, if you have multiple wallets, it can be difficult to keep track and manage your crypto-assets.  In the long view, when the Embermine Platform is live there will be the secondary marketplace of creative assets that have either been purchased directly or distributed for free to certain tokens. Slipstream will have features specific to Projects and Customers. Projects can utilize it to distribute and keep track of their issued assets. Customers can use it to keep track of an expansive, constantly changing portfolio (since virtually any project can tokenize their works). Users will be able to relay tokens from distributions to other users, a useful feature for a variety of instances.  Granularity of control. Simple management. Variety of distribution methods.  Right now, the early iteration we've been working on is a smart contract that can do these distributions automatically. Ready, set, go.

For example, one distribution method a writer can use to release his or her new book is to distribute the tokenized creative asset, for free, to holders of Embers (Embers being the ""rail"" for the distribution). This is similar to our approach in releasing TOV, IDEA, and DOM for MBRS holders. The Project Compact that the writer used as the living document of the collaboration can set transaction fees for the secondary market, which go back to them. The users who sell these assets can do so directly or automatically with an AI trading bot, providing them with a passive income as new users enter the platform and buy content post-distribution.  So Embers are open seats of a creative commerce platform, required to create a User ID and participate, and will eventually be a popular distribution rail for new content, which you can either enjoy or sell on an open market. And MBRS holders will be able to sell them at a retail rate directly to new Users.",False

On Embermine, Projects will produce various goods or services. Our focus has been on digital goods from the beginning (although branching into the physical realm is not impossible, it does increase the complexity quite a bit because of the the difficulties with distribution, manufacturing, etc.). In the same way that holders of MBRS have been receiving other crypto-assets like TOV, IDEA, or DOM, Projects can issue tokens for accessing certain goods and services. For example, a writer can distribute a token that grants access to her new book. This distribution can focus on holders of specific tokens or issue to ALL MBRS holders. Naturally, if you are a part of the network, you will accumulate a lot of excess assets. You could then input the settings on an AI trading bot that can then sell select assets on an open market, based on certain parameters you set (as in Autonio). This potentially results in global passive income for everyone on the Embermine network. The Algosharing allows people to trade and share tried and true strategies, algorithms, for achieving optimal results in the markets. And that only touches upon the synergy between the two.

Instead of not developing the project due to the low amount of funds, they have continued. Further, they have decided to add value for the holders of the coins - the people that have supported them. This is great. This is how crypto projects should be. I see that project too often focus on one side - the betterment of the devs. This project has focused on both sides in an interesting way. The team even explains the value that some of the dropped coins provide. For example, TOV will provide ""short term utility to ember.

Qoute about being listed on Cryptopia from James:  James Drake, [Aug 17, 2017, 2:36 AM]: Okay folks, Cryptopia agrees to host all of our tokens but we still need to pay for the registration fee of 400,000 DOT coins. Getting DOT takes forever unless you want to break the bank, so I would appreciate it if people can snag a few of those at a time, when they can and send them to our Embermine Main DOT wallet, I will repay them in the crypto of their choice at a rate of .000002 BTC/each. I just do not have the time to mess with it and with 6 tokens and marketing to boot, I will need at least three million DOT. At the rate that they sell at now, and keep the price reasonable, it would take forever to accumulate that many tokens and I do not have the time to collect them. So, if you are a Cryptopia user, please collect as many DOT coins as you can and are willing to buy and contact me. I will buy all I can get up to 3 million DOT for .000002 BTC (6 BTC total). This will allow us to register all of our tokens and pay for one month of token spotlight for each coin.  Here is out DOT address on Cryptopia: 14HcejCNcrwwfzNJE8yEzJ5Av9oNnHd1RM  So that explains the sell wall.",False

So even though this thread is not updated, the community is very active on Telegram. As www.tokenverse.com was launched a few days ago, embermine will go hand in hand and grow both platforms. I'll post some info that James shared with the community in the Telegram chat:  ""James Drake, [Jul 13, 2017, 10:38 PM]: ...Simply because with the launch of TokenVerse and the relaunch of Embermine, THOSE two location will become the news and media nerve centers for everything happening with Embermine and TokenVerse. Because of this, and because of our dedication to delivering these two sites and their respective products to market, we have to remain committed to them as we move forward. This will require both Garrison and myself to take a less active, moment-to-moment role in the ongoing communication on the Telegram feed.  Of course, we will still be around to participate and discuss topics often, especially when there are new details or products to report upon, but our community will do well to be headed BY the community, and have them have the opportunity to make it to THEIR liking, not ours.  Our role should be to report and tell you what WE are doing, not tell YOU what to do, and I am afraid that our Telegram is starting to appear too much like that. Embermine GUIDING their community. Rather, we should be guided, in part by what YOU require. In the end, our efforts are to head us toward decentralization, and the first step in doing that is taking us out of the driver's seat.  So all public channels: Telegram, Slack, TokenVerse App, Reddit, etc should be moderated by, and primarily managed by the community, with Embermine and TokenVerse employees acting more as guests to the channel rather than the main event. Our visits should be compact and full of pertinent information to maximize the time we spend doing so, and allow us to provide equal (or as best can be expected) coverage of all of the sites with visits and information sharing.  With that said, I have been watching with great pride, this Telegram develop, and I am proud to say that I am not concerned at all with this channel's vibrancy and engagement. But I would like there to be a couple of volunteers from each channel whose job specifically is to report what the other channels are discussing that their current one is not, or asking for a different take on their conversations. This will also ensure that our networks are connected and redundant, ensuring the ubiquity of our message.  And finally, TokenVerse. TokenVerse is where, ultimately, everything will end up, one way or another. Individual site might have a story a few moments before TokenVerse publishes it, but that is only because the member site has to publish their article first in order for us to republish it.  But we will be using both the site (and the TokenVerse app that is in development) to share our message not only to Embermine or TokenVerse direct, but also to the entire TokenVerse Syndication network, currently with 27 existing or planned websites prepared to join the network once it launches ""officially"" on August 1st.""   And more....   ""James Drake, [Jul 13, 2017, 10:39 PM]:  So what ""is"" the TokenVerse Syndication network? Allow me to explain:  1) It all starts with TokenVerse itself. The site will not only have a number of feature columnists like Lam Hoang and Conner Gibson, but we will also have all of the daily submissions from the   individual Network sites which are fed to TokenVerse via the Incoming Syndication Feed, and then all is redistributed and served BACK to the network sites and appropriate content is redelivered according to the network site's feed parameters (hash tags, columnists, origin site, and more) to help create a dynamic and constantly updated set of content sourced from hundreds, or even potentially thousands of websites.  James Drake, [Jul 13, 2017, 11:17 PM]: 2) Once the Syndication NEWS feed is complete and running, we will also create an INFORMATION feed. This will be TokenVerse acting as a defacto registrar for all cryptos, tokens, coins, and their clones. We will provide verified User Accounts to all companies, agencies, individuals, or decentralized teams for the purpose of registering their token and all of its pertinent information for FREE with our site. All of this information will always be verified, but it will also allow people to go to ONE site, not an exchange, or a list, but a registered, vetted list that has ALL of the current information for all cryp[tocurrencies, assets, markets, and exchanges and we will also provide this network feed of live information for FREE to all network sites who request it. This means no longer hunting for a list of ALL the ICOs, or making sure that the information is correct, but having complete faith in the knowledge that the information is as accurate as the company is dedicated to making sure that it is.  And WE provide this service to ICOs, tokens, markets, exchanges, and such for FREE. No more ""Pay to Play""  At least not to just get your information out on the site with all of the information the PUBLIC deserves.  Pay to play information only serves those with deep pockets. I refused to spend $20,000 or even $10,000 just to have my information available to people. Advertising is one thing. Pay for professional services is another, but paying just to be able to list yourself on what should be (and many claim to be) a website dedicated to educating the public, and giving the site the very hard to find information that makes their site valuble to advertise on, seems to me to be  excessive and unecessary.  IT also means that the public will not have the capability to know what is ""paid for information"" and what is freely given with no strings.  TokenVerse will change all of that. We will collect and deliver the information ALWAYS. For free. To anyone who comes. From anywhere. For any legal reason.  Now, that is NOT to say that we do not have places where we can, and deserve, to earn some money.  In addition to the NEWS and INFORMATION feeds, we will also have the AD Feed.  James Drake, [Jul 13, 2017, 11:37 PM]: The Ad feed will be a feed of ad content (think much like Ad Words) that is delivered to all Network sites. Just like the other feeds, these are composed of many different ads, allowing the Network sites to accept a single Ad for display on their site, a rotating series of ads currently being delivered on the feed, or a combination of both. TokenVerse's Sales Team will be selling these advertising packages for ALL network locations, as well as the Network Feed packages, and TokenVerse's own ad/highlight inventory. So the network sites can just run the ""Network Ad Feed"" by default, they can allow the TokenVerse Sales to sell their product for them, or they can take it upon themselves to sell their own ads (alone or by hiring a team), keeping both the sales commission and the Network royalty for themselves. ""   continued......  ""James Drake, [Jul 13, 2017, 11:44 PM]: All Ads for all customers are produced in house or by one of our outsource teams from our growing network of graphic designers, digital production teams, and even traditional and web-based advertising companies, and is included in the price of the advertising campaign purchased by the TokenVerse customer. Due to the very specific development and design parameters for these ads and the feed that will eventually deliver them, we will, at least in the beginning, require only our own developed content be used on our network. This also ensures quality control for the look and feel of the ads, especially when they are on ""themed"" sites.  James Drake, [Jul 13, 2017, 11:59 PM (7/13/17, 11:59:52 PM)]: We are launching TokenVerse on Saturday July 15th @ Noon CST. Network sites will be joining on a regular basis starting as soon as Monday.  James Drake, [Jul 14, 2017, 1:12 AM]: I expect to have at least 10 Network sites running and active on Syndication by August 1st, after that, we should be able to get the other sites on in increasing volume as we gain followers and visitors. Here is what we will be charging for the ads on TokenVerse:  Single Site Ad - Full Package: USD: $1000/per week $3750/month ETH: (#of ETH @ USD market price) currently ~4.5/week 17/month BTC:  (#of BTC @ USD market price) currently ~.43/week 1.63/month MBRS: 1000/week 3750/month  Network Syndication Ad - Full Package (includes one Feature Site Choice) USD: $4000/per week $15,000/month ETH: 18.2/week 68/month BTC: 1.74/week 6.5/month MBRS: 4000/week 15000/month  So if right now you are thinking: ""Hey, so someone could go on EtherDelta right NOW and get 15000 Embers for about 4.2 ETH, or $924 dollars! "" That is right, they can. So starting as soon as tomorrow, we are going to be sending our customers to EtherDelta who are going to be looking to buy 1000, 3750, 4000, or 15000 MBRS to pay for their advertising because it is currently trading at 6% of the USD price. OR we will gladly accept their USD, ETH, or BTC payment for the highest amount possible. So while we do not mind, at all, that they use MBRS to maximize their value when buying products and services from us, I just want all of those who have Embers to be mindful of the price they are selling at for their own benefit. ANYTHING less than a dollar would be still a value to most customers to get them, especially at these quantities.  SO how do AD revenues get divided?  Single Site Sales: (Including TokenVerse.com)  20% Sales Commission (15% individual, 5% Mangement/Bonus Pools/Team Benefits) 20% Production Team (15% Company, 5% Management/Bonus Pools/Team Benefits) 20% TokenVerse Syndication Royalty (split evenly among all Network sites) 40% Host Site Royalty  Network Sales:  20% Sales Commission (15% individual, 5% Mangement/Bonus Pools/Team Benefits) 20% Production Team Royalty Split (split evenly amonst all teams contributing to the Network feed) 20% TokenVerse Syndication Royalty (split evenly among all Network sites) 40% TokenVerse  The splits will be completed with existing database and accounting software, but to be transitioned into the Embermine Project once the platform is completed.  All splits will be completed in the currency in which it was delivered, automatically upon receipt, and delivered directly to the the accounts of the required individuals within 24 hours. So if we receive MBRS, you get paid in MBRS. If we receive ETH, you shall be paid in ETH, and so on...  Okay, I am about to leave the office to run home and I will continue from there. But this is a pretty fair rundown of TokenVerse and the dynamics that will be at play here beginning tomorrow.  IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST IN WRITING or SELLING FOR TOKENVERSE, or being a NETWORK SITE (we also have over 100 ""ready to host sites"" available for 400 MBRS/month that will allow someone to start a fully hosted Cryptocurrency/Blockchain blog plugged into the TokenVerse network and earning network ad royalties and contributing to the news and information feeds), please contact us!!! ASAP!!  Specifically, if you are interested in being a writer on the TokenVerse network, please send an email to Garrison Breckenridge, Managing Editor - TokenVerse: garrison@embermine.com Please include any examples of your work (does not have to be crypto-related, but preferred), relevent experience, and what intended ""angle"" will your column take?  If you are interested in being part of the TokenVerse Sales Team, please send an email to me, James Drake (james@embermine.com), indicating your interest, past sales experience, and your top three favorite blockchain/cryptocurrency projects currently.  If you are interested in becoming a Network Site, please contact me, James Drake (james@embermine.com), with the domain name of your site, your experience in managing websites/advertising, and if you intend on just caretaking the site (managing non-network content and applications), using it as an anchor site for your blog while supported with additional curated content, or even running it as part of your own advertising and marketing team and platform.  James Drake, [Jul 14, 2017, 1:56 AM]: We look forward to hearing back from everyone in the coming days and answering your questions!""   Alot of momentum going on with embers.

I also heard from Cryptopia that the token is ready to go, but I had them move  the release of the MBRS on their exchange to Monday, July 10th.  So we will be announcing the TokenVerse project officially tomorrow, with website Beta launch on July 10th.  Momentum is important right now for Embers. We want the opening price to be as high as possible so that it can raise to a higher level without needing incrementally more buying support to start in trading. It will also help prevent dumpers who do not know the price dynamics from making huge mistakes in selling fast, slowing down the value growth of the token at lower levels  Important note about the pricing of MBRS: the $1 or $5 price point is enforced, partly because of acceptance of MBRS as a payment type for TokenVerse and the optical equivalency with USD In the same capacity. And also partly because of the price charged for one Ember on the Embermine site will be $1 to start.",False

We have had to manually create batches of token transfers for a total of 400 transactions, covering everything from personal orders and bounty rewards to employee allocations and future bounty pools. Because of how important it is to be accurate and not make mistakes, we did them all by hand. Additionally, we received over 50 requests that were NOT real, meaning that each request from an unverified source had to be investigated before processing to ensure no one steals another person's tokens, or takes something that they have not earned.  This whole situation only exists because the ICO did not hit the minimum. TokenMarket, our original ICO administrator, who would have been doing all this work, was going to require too much compensation compared to the value of the network to manage this process, so to retain as much value for the network, our team is doing it ourselves and only the management team, because the rest of us are work hard to get TokenVerse prepared for revelation and launch.  I just wanted to make sure everyone knows that short of us making this effort, there would be no token distribution, bounty awards, or employee pools. We are making this effort for all of you so we all have a chance to help make this come to fruition. All of your continued dedication to our platform has created an amazing opportunity for us all to benefit. Thank you for your dedication and patience. But we are always going to do the best we can to do it the right way, no matter what, even if it take a little while longer to accomplish.  Also, it looks like we will be in a couple of exchanges before the end of the month, highlighted by Bittrex. Thank you to everyone for their ongoing support and excitement for this project.

Plus there is the rush factor, we have been told to expect the rush at the end. So that is what we are expecting. We are simply saying that IF there is not and we do not cover, we have made real efforts to give us options in case something like that were to occur.  The funding from the ICO was going to help us instantly qualify for the matching technology research and development grants that would allow us to hire and acquire all of the proper people and tools for the job, without having to go through the time and expense of funding round trips and convention/event appearances to meet with everyone. The token sale seemed to be the preferred method of not only funding, but also marketing. Most people learn about new blockchain projects from watching information about ICOs, especially platform or consumer-facing applications that have a group of blockchain industry outsiders like us.  Finally, the biggest reason for the ICO is because it was the easiest, most decentralized way to ensure a wide geographical distribution of coins, even at low numbers. A platform such as Embermine needs a significant, geographically distributed User population in order to operate efficiently, and this is BY FAR the easiest way to do that, funding or no.",False

Because we intend upon launching the token anyway to honor all of our token obligations to all of the Employee, Marketing, and Code Bounty Pools, we have received notice from the vast majority of participants to get remain part of the token release. Since we have to close the original sale to process the refunds per the Escrow service, we will be holding a one day token sale ""buy-in"" for those participants who wish to remain part of the Embermine token distribution.  All purchase refunds will be happening on Monday automatically to the Bitcoin addresses provided by each buyer during the crowdsale. As we are processing the refunds, we will also be notifying everyone of the exact particulars regarding the sale, the timing, cost, and procedures to follow.  Thank you to everyone for their support. Here are the preliminary details regarding the sale:  Essentially, we are selling the tokens now at .0000004 BTC each, or 100X original value. The original minimum purchase was .005 BTC which got the buyer 125 Embers. That same user now gets 12,500 Embers This looks to be the token goals:  Target number of Embers to be produced: 58,823,530 Distributed to Token Sale buyers: 50,000,000 Total Distributed Outside Of Token Sale: 8,823,530 Distributed to Employee Pool: 3,529,413 Distributed to Marketing Pool: 2,941,176 Distributed to Code Bounty Pool: 2,352,941 Cost per Ember: .0000004 BTC each  All existing buyers will be guaranteed at least their initial commitment. We will guarantee that at least 50,000,000 tokens will be funded through this process, to ensure that all Employee, Marketing Bounty, and Code Bounty pools are properly vested as intended. This is not intended to be a replacement of the original token sale. Rather, this is the method of release we are doing in order to get our initial token created as we begin development and allowing those who want to see this project succeed to still be involved.  Because of the format the sale will take, this will be an invite-only event where someone must receive the link from Embermine or a current participant in the token sale. Each participant will receive a special link that they use in order to participate. There, they can claim their original tokens or participate at some other level. Once someone participates, they will receive an email confirmation of their order and a referral link that they can send out to another who may wish to participate. This process is to ensure that those who originally participated will still have the earliest opportunity to participate in the sale.  NOTE: These are just the preliminaries. We are working the details out with our Token Administrators and our Escrow partners and will let everyone know as soon as the details are all finalized. Some of these elements will change, but we are hoping to run the special token sale on June 6th.  Thank you to everyone for their support!  ",False

Okay folks all of the transactions are verified and in hannd finally, which means that I can begin the process of refunding the transactions. Now, after careful discusssion with the Token Administrators and the Escrow signators, the problem with using account numbers from Exchanges is that many exchanges can only accept certain tokens or coin types, so if you are submitting a NEW coin to an Exchange wallet address, it will fail, and often get stuck in linmbo. BUT for returning funds, they would operate exactly as if you are making a deposit into your Exchange account as normal. There should be no issues. I am saying this because I know that some participants were nervous for this process because of they used a bitcoin exchange address to contribute. For those of you that I have already spoken to about this, I will make sure the transaction is handled properly. For those of you who may be concerned, we will are doing all transactions manually, so we will be sure all transactions are processed properly to the addresses provided. With all the activity on the Bitcoin blockchain, some transactions may be delayed, but we will be sure that everyone has their refunds processed on our end in the next few hours. I will be sending email confirmations of the transactions by email along with more information regarding getting involved in the rebuy process. I am simply awaiting the funds to be released by the Escrow into the refunding account. Thank you for your patience! Also, if you participated but did not processed the payment for the transaction, you will also get an email from us that will show the unfulfilled transaction, in case there is any question on those and also provide information for participating in the final buy-in.   Everyone should have their refunds and emails by 12 Noon Central Standard time tomorrow.

Just a quick announcement! I received the approval from our legal team to announce a special feature the Embermine platform will have for Users: Seat License Pool Contracts!  Since every Ember token represents a User seat in the Embermine Platform, and we always want single users to have quick and easy access to Embers for seat licenses, we are creating a Seat License Pool. This will allow the Platform to issue single Ember tokens to visitors wishing to create their unique User Account.  To begin, the Platform will issue a Seat License Smart Contract requesting Ember (EMB) token commitments from existing Users to the Seat License Pool. The amount of total tokens requested is determined by the average number of tokens removed from circulation each day. Once the contract is fulfilled, it will submit the tokens to the License Pool for purchase. The cost of these EMBs will be 1 Spark during the Open Beta beginning in October, and 5 Sparks after the full product release.  When the existing Contracts get depleted to a certain point, a new one is issued by the Platform, and more can be dedicated to the Pool. When the existing contract is filled, Embermine subtracts 5% of the total number Sparks collected, paid to the Identity Services Provider and then distributes the remaining Sparks to all Contract participants in proportion to the percentage of the total Embers they contributed.  Although there will be a minimum and a maximum amount of EMB committed by each User, Users can participate in as many contracts as they like. This will provide not only an easy, low maintenance method of selling EMBs, but it will also ensure a steady, guaranteed method for prospective Users to acquire a seat license for the Platform.  So there you go! For those of you wondering, or do not know yet, 1 Spark will be equal to 1 bitUSD.  More information on this to come!",False

The full token sale information can be found here: https://embermine.com/crowdsale  The ICO has already launched and is going until 12:00 Noon Central Standard Time June 2, 2017. We are selling the coin at .00004 BTC per EMB. Because it is an escrow token sale and all coins are returned to the owners directly, there is no loss in value to market while ICO is running. The moment the sale ends and the coin is minted, the link to the parent currency is broken and they begin having different values. So there is no risk to investments that do not meet the minimum. Bitcoin rising fast while the sale is running is a good thing. Because even now, virtually, every EMB has doubled in value because of the double in BTC value. So whatever the price BTC is at moment when the coins are minted, that determines the opening value of the newly created coin. I have been told that the best thing to happen for a token sale like ours would be if Bitcoin rushed to the great heights and everyone bought in quick, maxing out the token sale and starting the clock until the new coin is created, establishing its value separate from Bitcoin. Then Bitcoin drops through the floor and then EMB rise a little bit. Once EMB is on the Exchanges (Kraken, bitfinex, etc.) your use it to buy BTC direct and profit in BTC!

Not that I am necessarily saying anything, but rather just to point out this:  Our original token sale had to be stopped 48 hours after it began because the sale widget at first was inaccessible to a majority of users due to a small code error by the third party, then the smart contract (it was an ETH-based sale at that time) was not accepting valid transactions toward the sale. After having that experience, and then literally rebuilding the sale from the ground up and using Bitcoin as the only method of payment (a requirement from one of our large investment groups) we relaunched the token sale on May 5th. We had advertised to a large extent and sent updated information to all of the ICO sites to get them to update the info  so that people would know when the sale changed. Of course a vast majority of these sites never bothered to change the information, or changed it much later, after the sale had already launched.  Because of the vary nature of these sort of things, suddenly, perception is fact. The perception is that this is a sale that has been shunned or ignored by investors and enthusiasts. When the reality is that many did not know of the sale's move, or change in features, or even that it was still running. This really dented the early sales of the project, which in this ""demand economy"" is a potential death sentence. Except I know a few things that many others do not:  1) We do not need the token sale to be successful to create the product. Regardless of the token sale, Embermine is going to proceed and continue with the development of the platform. Our platform, especially now that we have committed to EOS and the backbone development platform for utilizing Graphene, the BitShares DEX, and their integrated Smart Contract development platform, is going to be developed. The token sale was important as a funding vehicle for Embermine, but there are plenty of other options that we are working on acquiring, including matching grants, personal loans, business loans, and other financing options. All of these are already being developed and were always intended on being pursued, in an effort to provide the most efficient management and caretaking of the company's funding capital. In a highly volatile and developing marketplace such as blockchain technology, it is important that you are not a ""one trick pony"". Flexibility and efficiency are critical to long term success and having the capital and mindset to enable a dexterous business plan that can flex to meet new developments in the areas of compliance and data collection requirements. So why did we do a token sale at all? There are many pathways for funding development, but the biggest advantage for token sales is the combination of marketing as well as geographical distribution. Because of the  immense effort that is undergone to promote token sales and all of the interest and websites dedicated to these sales, advertising and getting recognition for your project is one of the most under appreciated results of a token sale. Add to that the vast geographical diversity of those who will participate in events like these, your market diversity and spread is almost unattainable in any other way. By literally placing the very key to entering our site in the hands and computers of thousands of people worldwide, token sales also become a great source of your first group of potential Users and marks the beginning the viral spread of Embermine's platform and advantages. It is this last purpose that truly attracted us to the token sale over typical VC models which would have us primarily focused upon investors and NOT the actual Users.  2) We are not running and creating Embermine for investors Some blockchain projects are created with the purpose of appealing to investors, specifically the token sale and bounty programs. Development objectives with only the funding or crowdsale dynamics in mind is not only, in my opinion, questionable in terms of intent, but also distract from what is ""supposed"" to be the real reason why anyone should be interested in the project at all. FBecause of all of the reasons mentioned above, the ultimate result is that we are first and foremost, concerned about finding and appealing to the eventual end users. Those users are not only going to want a token for themselves, but also for anyone that they potentially would want to collaborate with on a current or future project. By being able to get a number of Seat Licenses at a very cheap rate (approx $0.10 each at current BTC prices) and with a low minimum BTC cost (~$12.00) and a low minimum for the token sale (200 BTC), we tell people, go get the minimum (125 licenses) and now you have ""invested"" $12.00 to get 125 licenses that you can either sell, use for yourself, or give them to your collaboration network to bring them with you to Embermine. So the very thing that distracts from the token sale aspects of Embermine, actually helps to develop the value statement for owning the coins in the first place. Most people in the crypto space do not know what to think about a company that is intended on being a mainstream, direct to end user product. Where the token is never going to be $1000. Or that the value to be found in owning the token is that ANYONE can use it. Hand be a bitcoin, and I may have a lot of ""potential"" money, but I only ever truly enjoy the actual value of owning the coin once I use it to buy something. Embermine is different. Regardless of the the coin's market value, the access the coin provides never changes, and you can enjoy the advantages of the network, or holding coins to participate in the DPoS protocol. Either way, the actual token has value just like bitcoin in trade, but it also has value in it's specific use.  3) Bitcoins invested do not lose value against the market if it does not hit the minimum There have been a number of individuals who have said that they are holding off on purchasing until the bull run on BTC ends, or as they get closer to the end of the sale to eliminate various ""opportunity costs"". I can appreciate the fact that people know that they can wait because the crowdsale is not in imminent danger of closing without them. For some traders, having access to every one of their coins provides them the flexibility to react to changing market conditions. But if the only reason to not purchasing is because it may not reach the minimum is like saying you do not want to deposit money in a savings account because the money may be less valuable when you take it out. It is possible that Bitcoin's price could drop drastically at any time and for some people, having the flexibility to maneuver in those moments are good, but that is not the reason people are giving. Many are worried because the price is increasing. This is actually a desired thing. Until the sale ends and the tokens are minted, the price (value) of the EMB is virtually tied to BTC. For example, when we started this crowdsale, the cost of BTC was $1125. that means that at full token distribution, each EMB would have an initial market value of $0.045. Now, because of the raise in price of BTC, each coin now has a virtual value of 0.086, or almost double.  4) The sale will hit the minimum Aside from a million pieces of evidence or logic that I can apply to show that the sale WILL go through, I will instead just say this: ICOs are the holders and multipliers of the crypto world. Regardless of the ICO, the product, or level of funding required, I have been made aware that we should easily hit our minimum as an investor's group intends on using our token sale as a large ""value battery"" against Bitcoin's possible tumble in value. Even without that, the trick for ICOs and their value multiplier, is that all investors in single currency ICOs are making a bet. They are not betting that tokens like Embers are going to be worth MORE than Ethereum or Bitcoin, but rather, that the new token MULTIPLIES in value against the founding coin. If Embers open at a value of $0.10/each, and you paid for those coins in Bitcoin, you are not ""betting"" that Embers will be worth $2500, but rather that the value ratio between EMB and BTC will increase in EMB's favor. To put it another way, you could set any arbitrary percentage of increase for the two tokens, EMB and BTC, say 100% and purchase with the intent to leverage THAT relationship, meaning that once EMBs reaches a 100% increase in value compared to BTC, you can sell up to 50% of your EMBs to get back your entire investment of BTC, PLUS still have EMB left over. So when evaluating that proposal, someone is betting that Embers will hit $0.20/each before BTC hits $5000, which allows them to essentially own Embers for free.  Allow me to try to explain what I have learned. (Which if you are in this to make money, it is time to pay attention.) I received a DM from a twitter user name @Crypt0Leviathan that laid out the entire value proposition for Embermine's ICO and the results were stunning. I have since worked out the math myself, and found it to be 100% correct. The fact that is was so easy for me to understand makes me wonder why everyone does not already know this, or for that matter, why EVERY non-scam ICO does not fund out. I do not know for sure the Crypt)Leviathan's intent in sending me this info, but in the end, I am sure it is because of money. Here is what they sent to me:  For the purposes of this illustration, we are assuming that the current USD price of Bitcoin is $2500, making Ember value at $0.10/each ICO Minimum: 200 BTC ($500,000) ICO Maximum: 4000 BTC (10 million) ICO Ending Date: June 2nd  So let's say that someone invests 100 BTC into Embermine tokens. They would receive 2,500,000 EMB when the sale concludes. Making their current ""value chart"" look like this:  EMB value: $0.10 BTC Value: $2500 Total BTC: 0 Total BTC Value: $0 Total EMB: 2,500,000 EMB Total EMB Value: $250,000 Total Value: $250,000  As long as the price of Embers either is increasing or stays roughly the same while the sale is accumulating, your perceived value in the ICO is still increasing because the BTC are being held, but at not being converted into the EMBs yet. So their value stays equal with the market until that happens. Then the two coins will not only have separate relationships to the other currencies and independent values, but they will also establish a price ratio between the two. In crypto, most people equate value directly to the USD value, but there are potential trading pairs for any currency. Unlike just about any other market, you can directly trade any crypto for any other crypto. This fundamental difference is the power that makes the rest of this possible.  The #1 rule in crypto. Once your value is IN crypto, taking it out in fiat penalizes you. So unless you are going to actually use that fiat value for a purchase, removing it from crypto is eliminating this multiplier factor and also costs money and time in the effort to pass through the ""membrane"" that exists between these two financial markets. Much like the stock market. The only reason why you take the money out of the market is to use it or protect it. Since stocks and securities require tremendous amounts of effort to move value from one stock and security to another, and almost never directly, and with all of the regulatory framework and friction that exists in transferring this value during IPOs and other stock offerings, there are few, if any opportunities in investment potential that quite match ICOs.  Since the key to evaluating an ICO is found in the potential for the new coin to generate more value over any period of time proportional to the source coin, it ultimately does not matter if that token increases in value against USD or not to gain or retain value. It just has to gain or maintain value relative to the source coin. Take this example:  EMB Value $0.20 BTC Value: $2500 Total BTC: 100 Total BTC Value: $250,000 Total EMB: 1,250,000 Total EMB Value: $250,000 Total Value: $500,000  In this case, this user saw the value of the token hit $.20 each while BTC stayed even. Because Embers simply increased by $0.10 each, this allows the user, if so inclined, to sell Embers for Bitcoin at half the original price, because the price is expressed in terms of BTC, not USD. So this User sold 1/2 of their EMB to return the original investment back to BTC. Now, not only do they have the original BTC amount back, but they still have plenty of EMB too, and an increase in personal net worth. Of course, this works at any percentage, and interestingly enough, in both directions. But it is this essential element that crypto whales use to multiply their stake while at the same time diversifying their holdings and opportunities.  Now that we have established how the value multiplier works, we can also evaluate how certain scenarios, either engineered or natural, can create enormous opportunities for holders. Consider this example:  EMB Value: $0.10 BTC Value $1250 Total BTC: 100 Total BTC Value: $125,000 Total EMB: 1,250,000 Total EMB Value: $125,000 Total Value: $250,000  In this example, every thing is done just like the last example, but in this case, the opportunity existed because of the value multiplier between EMB and BTC moved, even while neither coin gained value relative to USD. And because we will always continue to evaluate value in terms of our fiat currency, that is only done because that is what we use to pay for things. Again, the goal on this is to diversify and increase opportunities for value. These two examples show some obvious mechanics, but the real shocker comes when BOTH occur. Consider this final example:  EMB Value: $0.20 BTC Value: $1250 Total BTC: 300 Total BTC Value: $375,000 Total EMB: 625,000 Total EMB Value: $125,000 Total Value: $500,000  Now, even though that does not LOOK impressive, taking a longer examination of it reveals some pretty amazing things. For example, now you have TRIPLED your original Bitcoin total, and still have a very significant number of EMBs. Of course, the user could have SOLD the 1,875,000 EMBs for USD and made $375,000, and that is an option, but here, to take advantage of the Bitcoin drop (and likely recovery), the User used the multiplier to increase their holding in BTC and generate a market position that is very strong after a market down turn. And they were able to do it without investing a single additional dollar of fiat. They are able to do this because they were able to store the value in the ICO and its tokens it produced.  So if you know that Bitcoin is going to fall, or that demand for the crypto will cause EMB to rise, or especially BOTH, one can use a token sale like Embermine to leverage that information to generate not only a ton of value, but avoid losing their accumulated value in the process.  So why did someone tell me all of this? I cannot say for sure, but what I can say is that I have many people looking at this project. Our investment group has said that they will invest as a group, close to the end. Of course they are, as if the sale does not close quickly, a severe drop in Bitcoin before it generate tokens does not evoke the multiplier, but rather, lowers the value of EMB when it does get minted.  So, if I KNEW Bitcoin was going to tank, regardless of what anything else does, and I have a large number of BTC value for my group or myself to protect. I start looking at new/uncompleted ICOs as options for retaining value and once I have marked a candidate or two, I organize my efforts so that everyone is buying at the same time. This not only allows them to get the maximum number of coins possible as there is little competition, but it gives them clear targets they need to meet to either hit the minimum or to close out the sale entirely. Because as long as that sale is open, EMB are pegged in value to BTC, and if the drop is coming, they want the sale to end, or maximum total reached so that the sale ends and the clock can begin ticking toward the minting of the new coin. So they will try to organize that it will get bought out as quickly as possible.  So that is the ""cliff notes"" version of what I was sent. In short, If you think that Bitcoin is going to fall in value, or you think that EMBs will rise in proportional value quicker than Bitcoin, you should buy some Embers.  Soon. Because it is only a matter of time before EVERYONE figures this out, or the investor group starts everything, and the sale with sell out, or end.  So take this for what it is. Math. Will this happen? I cannot say for sure. But there is no doubting the math. The only question is what are people going to do with this information?",False

We did not start this thread, a member of this forum, GolumDeMort, who came on to our Telegram Channel and requested to do so. In fact, the reason why we never had an ANN until a few days ago was because none of the core members of the team had any experience with the community until a couple of months before the token sale was to begin. We did not want to enter the forum as newbies simply for the very idea you were suggesting. We figured that we would ""deserve"" to have a post on this site if and when someone from the community reaches out to ask us if they can post it. We have had several conversations on our public Slack and Telegram about this very topic and we always maintained that when someone wanted to build an ANN page for us, we would participate and support it as much as we could, and asking the members of the community with a little patience as we learn the rules, both written and unwritten, about this community and its various sub-communities.  ""No escrow."" Sorry, but this is completely incorrect. It was at this point when I really started to wonder if you had even researched our information, because right at the bottom of the token sale information it tells everyone that the Escrow is being administrated by Coinfirm.io. You may have heard of these guys. Maybe you did not see that, but if you did not, or did not look at our social media, where we have a number of posts pertaining to Coinfirm.io and their agreement to provide our Escrow services along with TokenMarket and ourselves as the key holders for the account. We have a full return of all received BTC (less tx fees) to all users unless we meet our minimum.  ""Doesn't even make sense....Newbie account doing money up front ICO."" This whole section could honestly be a subjective opinion, except the ""no actual USE"" part, which is amazing because of all the crypto projects to claim has no use, I cannot believe someone would select Embermine as one of them. But hey, everyone is allowed an opinion.  As far as our Embermine Manifesto is concerned, you missed the whole point of why we wrote it to begin with. It was a public statement of the level of accountability and standards of conduct we will hold ourselves to as a company, and as individuals.    Bottom line is that we know that we are outsiders. We come from the application development world and have never pretended to be otherwise.  Now, if you, or anyone else has any real questions regarding the Embermine Platform, please ask.

We also are looking for a wider message audience than just the crypto/blockchain world. We want to hit various vectors of the creator communities and freelance economies, because our product has a larger draw than other typical ICO/Token Sale offerings.

We are coming at this world from the application development, Fintech, and Creative Management perspective, and collaborating with the companies who are on the leading edge of these technologies. So when we learned about BitcoinTalk, none of us had any practical experience with this community, its forms, it rules (both written and unwritten), and the traps and quagmires that can form within it. For us to come here as unbidden novices would have been only for the obvious reason of courting your money and intrigue.  Now, there is nothing wrong with wanting to do that, if you are a member of the community and you have paid your dues. We hadn't, as is likely obvious by my low score next to my name. Next to all Embermine names. So we decided not to post here on all spanking new accounts and try to pretend we deserve your attention and interest, since we had applied none before this. I do wish that we had learned of this place sooner, to have provided us an opportunity to learn more from this community and its members. All of this is important, because everyone in this community now is a walking, living, breathing ambassador to the ""cryptoworld"" for the many thousands of ordinary people who will be introduced to it for the first time by Embermine.  THIS is why we at Embermine need this community. Because as legions of folks who have never before heard of ""bitcoin"" or ""blockchain"" will now be delving into these worlds, and will, inevitably, come into contact with you. So please remember that when products and services finally reach the mainstream, the whole game goes supersonic. So we wanted to learn. To know more about this community before we selfishly approach you with Embermine. I can now see that it would have been fine and I apologize for the loss of time to those of you who exclusively get their ICO/Token Sale news from this source.  So, to extend a moment of gratitude to this community for welcoming us in, and in some form of compensation for having missed the opportunity, I would like to offer the members of this forum a special bonus:  Receive 5% EMB Bonus for participating in Embermine's Token Sale between now and Sunday, May 14, 2017  5:00pm UTC (12 Noon Sunday Central Standard Time)  Award Source: The Embermine Marketing Pool (5%).

It is a digital rights management system. It helps define our individual roles in the fully digital world. Add all that up and you get Embermine, the Operating System for the Creative Lifestyle.  The reality? Embermine is the demystification gateway to blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrency for the mainstream.  By doing ONE thing better than anyone (enable simple creation of smart contracts by common people), we throw open the doors to the entire technology tree in the crypto-world for the world to discover.  In order for blockchain to take the next step in its evolution, it needs to stop being theoretical and begin being practical to the mainstream. Not everyone has interest in market speculation. Not everyone has a desire to understand the science or technical details or advancements. And fewer still want to make their lives more complicated by introducing philosophical debates about block size and transaction latency. They want to create. They want to accomplish a dream. They want to get paid. They want to eat. They want to live.  Embermine is an attempt to show people how these technologies can help them to LIVE better. To live in a world where the technology that surrounds them can be individually accessed, controlled, and utilized to provide them with direct, personal advantages.
