We are pleased to introduce our solution, Stampify.  Tallinn, Estonia – November 13th, 2017 – We are glad to introduce our Stampify software and the creation of the STAMP, a utility token spent by organisations to fuel the Stampify system and services. Stampify is paving the way to the business of tomorrow by providing entrepreneurs, startups and companies with new-generation corporate governance tools using the most out of advanced technology, including blockchain and distributed ledgers. We will launch our token sale on December 1st, 2017.  The Stampify solution  Stampify’s mission is to build a frictionless business world where connected organisations work together with transparency, flexibility and trust, leveraging the latest advances in distributed ledgers, decentralised storage and artificial intelligence that aims at supporting entrepreneurs and companies jump into this century and step in modern, dynamic and rethought corporate governance models. Stampify will become a system that will quickly prove itself essential in day-to-day corporate governance matters thanks to unique features, from cap table management to resolutions management and on-the-fly authentication.  Our company is established in Tallinn, Estonia. This choice is driven by the strong connection between our objectives and the Estonian national strategy, aiming at facilitating business incorporation and management thanks to the e-residency program. Estonia is the most suitable location for a company like ours because we both follow the same objectives.  Laurent Kinet, co-founder of Stampify said: “Business organisations are the fuel of our economy and the most fruitful wealth creators of our times. Despite legislations and industry regulations, trade relationships involve formed entities that each has their own rules, corporate culture, documentation principles and methodologies. Yet, in almost every country of the world, the fundamental principles of corporate governance — the way business organisations are created, run and liquidated — are a remainder of a pre-technology era, deeply misaligned with today’s world.“  The market potential  Corporate governance concerns any form of worldwide organisation, no matter the size, industry, or location. Non-profit organisations and NGOs also fall under governance requirement, for example. The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor11 specifies that by the end of last year, there was nearly 500 million entrepreneurs worldwide, launching 100 million companies each year (among which 1.35 million are tech startups). This would mean that every day, up to 275.000 companies are created all around the globe – that’s three every second.  In several emerging countries, forming a company is close to impossible because of inextricable administration and rampant corruption. Business runs with no official deeds; in other words there is a lot of business but few companies. For example, Africa is a huge market in high demand for governance and will develop a 2-digit growth rate. The estimation is that credit providers will need to increase their lending by 135 billion USD in order to meet the African SME’s demand.  The Stampify token (STAMP)  Since the project is built upon the blockchain and leverage its native characteristics, the option to issue a dedicated utility token to fuel the service came quickly. We call it the STAMP. We can compare this utility token to notary fees or fiscal stamps, but for a fraction of the price and without all those intermediaries.  The Stampify token will be available for purchase during the Crowd Sale period starting on December 1st, 2017.  Most of proceeds will be used to develop the platform globally and run business development operations. We dedicate a fraction of funds raised to social responsibility. Team and early contributors compensation will be vested for 12 months (see whitepaper for details).
