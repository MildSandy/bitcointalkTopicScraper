The events leading up to today: Exactly a week ago we received an email from an employee at Bittrex who requested us to fill out a large backfill document. She also request us to share and provide a number of other more exotic legal files. Some of which we have, some of which we do possess yet and would need to be drafted. She wanted it all within 5 working days. Drafting legal documents takes time and should not be done lightly. Besides interacting with lawyers can sometimes be a lengthy process. The employee explicitly requested a director of the business to fill it all out. Which would be either me or David. As it happens, by the time I received the email I was already en-route to the US to attend several meetings and events across the country. Including, but not limited too, meeting Wachsman PR, Consensus Invest and the WSJ at their HQ. I only just return from Seattle where I'd visited the New Alchemy team. Point being, my schedule was planned out and packed to the brim. To expect to get a prompt response for such a large request is unreasonable. Legal matters take time and require a coordinated effort, they also are often a part of company strategy this is why my finance and compliance team had made the decision to discuss matter in-person once I got back. I return to the UK and to my surprise read the same as everyone else this morning. I have reached out to Bill Shihara directly to ask for his oversight in the process, specifically I requested them to afford us an appropriate amount of time to get this all done. This is the situation so far. Looking back, I recall that at the start of this year we spent hours on calls with Bill and both of our legal teams. In discussions regarding our token listing and other legal/business matters the amount of time, professionalism and dedication shown has always been upstanding. To have all that work rolled back in a few days, due to backfill issues, is unexpected and I'd like to think that Bittrex still strives to maintain it's original high standards. Consider however that there might be external factors at play here that we are currently not aware of. I like Bittrex it's founding team a lot, their focus on architecture and scaliblilty is industry leading. It would be a blow if TKN were to get delisted on Bittrex. I'll be working towards getting the decisions repealed. If it does happen however it is by no means the end of the world. New and greater listings will come with time: the space is always evolving. Our project and roadmap remain unchanged.

But with Tokencard you are uploading your fund into your smart contract, so this way you are fully 100% controlling your fund, because you hold your private keys with you....so you are your own bank, because Tokencard is the only decentralized debit card out there.  And in term of investment, Tokencard is also more profitable, because all those fee collecting from the cards usage are making Tokencard more valuable everyday....so it more smart to invest into Tokencard, in my opinion.

This project is going to need way more volume for fee incentive to really be enticing.  I'm actually also somewhat surprised the projection of payments made with TKN is only ~10%...If anything, at least at current standing, I envision the value of this coin being more tied to the buy pressure of TKN than the smart contract fees.  Unless it's not marketed well, I'd assume the avg token card owner knows that they can freely spend money with no fees using TKN.  That should theoretically drive more people to buy more TKN just to circumvent fees, and they'll have even more incentive to do that if TKN price steadily increases.",False

The investment will depend on the accumulation of fees as well of the value of the fund.  If the future is dark and nobody uses the card then conceivably TKN investment is zero b/c not much fees. If on the other hand, the card becomes popular we might see TKN investment grow due to accumulation of fees alone.    Presumably TKN will be traded over the market based on expected future value of the fund and a base value being corresponding share of the token to the fund.     I read earlier about a warning to stay away from the investment because it is unclear how the company (Monolith studios?) operating the token will finance itself for the long term.  Giving the benefit of the doubt,  I am thinking they will do so by having a substantial share of TKNs to sell as well as collecting some small fees on top of the transaction.

It all depends on people using the card. Monolith studios does own some tokens, and they do charge some fees, so financing for their operation also depends on people using their card.  One of their main issues at the moment as I see it, is their poor comunication. I am guessing it will pick up once their product is live.

Oh, and they probably damaged any chance of a relationship with VISA by attempting to profit off their back. I wouldn't be surprised if VISA are taking them to court for damages.  Frickin' wild west. I'm surprised the regulators haven't come down on these ICO scams already. Don't worry it will probably 10x in price regardless.",False

Most of us bought in to what we thought was an Elon Musk type revolution for liquidating ethereum tokens, but in reality got a bunch of 20+ gamers in charge that have not yet proven to have any business instinct at all...  Just to be clear this is no FUD just to troll.. I have followed the team since day 1 of the ICO and have been present in Slack all the time... So far this Team lacks a business instinct and this might be futile for this project in my honest opinion.. Please prove me wrong and good luck!",False

On top of it if all their card options require normal KYC, their market is a lot smaller too. Not due to money laundering/other but because in low GDP countries, which are also home to some of the fastest growing consumer markets, KYC is often the biggest hurdle to accessing the traditional financial system.

Please tell us about your past achievements and why do you think that I can trust you with my money?  A.Past achievements? I’ve set up an algae biofuel company at a young age and did very well with that. I’ve worked in East-Asia (mostly Taiwan) for several banks and software companies, including DTCO and the CTBC (China trust bank). I’ve worked on several engineering projects: a food processor in the Netherlands Innotec Systems, and at a Geothermal Powerplant in Taiwan (Yankee) where I was designing an Ethereum powered back end.If you want to learn more about me personally I suggest you listen to this (older) interview: https://cointelegraph.com/news/podcast-mel-gelderman-venturing-into-the-web3  On the subject of trusting money. Please realize that when you use a service like the many exchanges or all other card services in the space you are trusting them entirely with your money. We’re building TokenCard exactly so you don’t have to do any of that. Your contract wallet of choice: Ethereum Foundation, Parity, Consensys or our own optimized Token wallet will work.  Q.   Is Poloniex coming anytime soon?  A. I don’t quite remember who, but someone from another large project told me from experience that once we launch this would be the nr. 1 question in the slack. They were right; and I think we’d do good to at some point silence this question   Q.   Explain that VISA situation.  A.We removed mentions of the payment network after some mainstream media posts misunderstood how our platform works and misrepresented our project implying that we are directly partnered with the payment network. Crypto is still a touchy subject with payment networks and so at the recommendation of our Issuing Bank we have removed these mentions. We are working with a brilliant authorised Issuing Bank in Gibraltar; they are the pioneers of RHA (Remote Host Authorisation) technology and are the only ones our next-gen TokenCard platform could work with. On this front please await a large announcement post early next week. Again, just to reiterate, nothing material has changed about TokenCard. We just don’t want to take unnecessary risks.   Q.   What is your relationship with www.cryptoassets.io? Why this relationship hasn't been publicly mentioned?  A.The TokenCard team is very product focussed (myself included) so we reached out to Jake Vartanian (founder of cryptodex.io) to aid in managing the community and biz dev. He was recommended to us by another large project in the Eth space. This is great as it allows the core team to focus on the product for now to get it out the door as soon as possible. For partnerships that we would consider formally announcing we would want it to directly relate to the product itself. Ie. Digix, Singular, Bancor or SwarmCity. That being said Jake and Dwight (and a whole bunch of others!) have received us very well in this small, but thriving, crypto space.  Q.   Why Monolith Studio website is redirected to Token Card & there is no dedicated section to your team?  A.We created Monolith website when we originally announced TokenCard last year. Since then the TokenCard product has seen a lot of major refinements and improvements. The tokencard.io site gives a much better picture of this. The Monolith Site was not updated accordingly as we’ve been the subject of a competitor spying (both inside and out of crypto). Right now the monolith website redirects to tokencard.io. It was causing some confusion. Once we’ve finished slimming down the Monolith website it will go back up. That being said I am fully aware that people want to see the team, partnerships and press exposure and we will update the tokencard.io site to include this soon.  Q.   Why do you have just 7 connections on LinkedIn? A    I’ve never had the need or time to set LinkedIn up properly; I also think LinkedIn could do with some improvement and am looking forward to using decentralized alternatives like Akasha. I do believe I have a hundred or so pending invites though!  Q.   What is the connection with Bancor?  A.The guys at Bancor are brilliant and our projects have natural synergies. We are looking forward to piloting their platform with TokenCard. They recently did a great presentation at CoinFest that I suggest you watch.  Q.   How do you make money exactly?  A.There are a whole number of ways for TokenCard the company to also do well. Just to name one or two things we will have in-app token-to-token exchange functionality and be a massive harbour of valuable liquidity. There are also some fantastic additional services we’ll be offering (announcement soon).  Q.   Will it be possible to use non-ETH based coins in the future?  A.There is a chance… but the the Ethereum Economy is the focal point of our Monolith Master Plan. I’d encourage all non-turing complete platforms to issue meta-token on Ethereum so they naturally work with our system. Just to clarify why this is: the foundation for TokenCard is that you hold your tokens in a smart contract wallet that you control. Consequently only ETH and Ethereum based tokens are compatible. If other projects choose to create their own network that is their choice but we think the Ethereum Economy is a winning formula, and we’ll stick with that. braces for impact.  Q.   Will there be a way to set up recurring payments?  A.As long as you have enough ETH or tokens in the contract wallet once the transaction processes and the allowance you have set is sufficient recurring payments will certainly work. If you mean to autopay a bill, then it is not planned in v1, but in the roadmap. Pre-auths are also possible, but require some back-end tricks.  Q. What is the difference between Token Card & Mycelium Card?  A.The Mycelium card is focused on BTC and colored coins, while TokenCard is focused on ERC-20 assets. And much more... please read the whitepaper!   Q. When is a vlog update coming out?  A.Interesting. I’ll consider it.    Q. How can your card compete with TenX, which charges no fees (they say they are paid from merchant fees), vs Tokencard's 1.5% on top of your purchase? In your materials I see that you are also charging a 3% foreign exchange fee vs. TenX 0% - this seems unsupportable given that the source of funds is borderless cryptocurrency. Plus, their card is out in beta now while Tokencard will be another 3-4 months.  A. I'm not entirely aware of what tenx actually do or what they are trying to improve upon. Maybe you can explain. In general from a fee standpoint I am rather confident we will outperform almost all other crypto debit card competitors. Fees listed on websites are often entirely misleading; for example they might claim to have no 'fee' but then take a very poor exchange rate to exchange your BTC for fiat. I'm confident we will kick ass in this department. Additionally you can drop your fee to .5% if you use TKN itself. That being said, we are not trying to compete with them. We are here to build a banking replacement for the general public. The Ethereum Ecosystem is a first step and I wish competitors all the best. I implore them to realize the true market is the rest of the world not this subreddit.  Q.   Won't the currencies held by tokenholders end up as a collection of the worst tokens as people seek to hold their best crypto and spend away their worst. I can't see spending ETH when I could get rid of some token I bought as a FOMO mistake but can't bother to sell on an exchange.?  A. Perhaps. I personally am not of the opinion it will work like that. And there are likely a few orders of magnitude more users that hold ETH than any particular shitty token. That being said we have standards token projects need to meet before we will work to integrate their token with our backend. So for example, TenX may act like the ""0% commission"" currency exchanges you see in every tourist city that are exchanging currency at a 15-20% worse rate than the official exchange rate.Assuming TokenCard does a good job filtering the outright scams, I could see tokenholders doing quite well. They could end up with a collection of tokens acquired at the bottoms of their respective bear markets, when nobody likes them but it's actually the perfect time to buy.   Q.   As the face of a new project with a successful capital raise, it seems like you now embody something of a contradiction, which is to say you have the investor relations demands of a post IPO CEO, while actually running a brand new startup. This seems like a difficult balance, one which I get the impression you are trying in earnest to navigate to with transparency and enthusiasm. I know this is all new, but it is more complex than you had imagined? Do you have advice for future project leads on how soon or how late to raise money?   A.Great observation. And, I really appreciate you looking at it from the other perspective. Truly. Indeed it is an interesting scenario. Short of financial reports, people expect the same level of investor interaction as a matured publicly trading company would have. But indeed we are literally still building the core platform. Support from other projects that have undergone similar stages is heart-warming (Digix, Singular and FirstBlood in particular come to mind). Indeed I only ask people to give us a little time to collect ourselves and get this thing running. The questions will keep coming in regardless of how much you try to answer them. The only thing that will help is actual progress (MVP). I must say though, I have learnt a lot. And I think the experience of setting up a project like this is very enriching and is unlike anything I've ever done before; I highly recommend it as long as you have the energy and nerve. I think we had already foreseen how much energy it would cost to engage with the community. Hence crazy 2 week crowdsale announcement to start timeframe. Doing this for months would have killed me. As long as you have a good product, engage people with transparency and a slight relaxed/satirical attitude you'll be fine.   Q.   Realizing that a project like this is extremely dependent on ease of use and consumer satisfaction with the initial release how ready will the MVP be when issued and also how long between MVP and Public release?  A.As stated in the whitepaper, we plan to release the MVP by early September. However the UI is literally the contract wallet in your Ethereum browser of choice. Quite cool! The general public release will only follow with the V1 launch towards the end of the year.  Q.   Will you be targeting cryptocurrency enthusiasts or the actual public (people who have minimal knowledge of crypto assets) for the adoption of your product?  A.Both. Initially we will be working to monopolize the existing market in a very short amount of time with a fantastic next-gen product, before moving on to our real market; the rest of the world. More details will become available post MVP.  Q.   Finally, being aware of the possible regulatory hurdles in the US Market (I.e Taxation issues) are you thinking ahead on marketing in less restricted areas?  A.   Yes cards will not be available in the US or India at first. We advise all our users to seek out the relevant local tax regulations. We’ll give you simple to use tools to help you with that at some point.  Q.   TKNs retain their value by the tokens it holds and that are being added for every transaction with the TokenCard. These tokens are freed up when holders burn their tokens. They are unlikely to burn them, unless there is an arbitrage opportunity. This would mean that (potentially) alot of ETH and other tokens are locked up. Will TokenCard stake the locked up ETH when Ethereum switches to PoS?  A.Fantastic question. Simple answer: not any time soon as staking takes on certain risks and would involve entrusting some party to make staking decisions on your behalf.  Q.   Also, if the return on staking exceeds the return on TKN (i.e. possible future inflow of future revenue due to transactions on the TokenCard) and TokenCard doesn't stake the locked up ETH, won't people just start burning their TKN in order to recieve ETH and stake that?  A.Potentially, but these scenarios will only play out in the distant future at which point ETH might not be the largest part of the Asset Pool. And you can always sell your TKN for ETH on the exchange instead. But indeed you are correct, it is possible. In fiat money systems I can spend without a fee. At least no fee which becomes visible to me, only to the seller. I would not be interested in a card which has an additional 1% fee for me (on top of the usual fees for the seller). Why should anybody want to use that?  A.I know I'm not Mel but inflation in the fiat money system is a 'hidden' fee.In the United Kingdom inflation was 1.2% for the year. https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/consumerpriceinflation/nov2016 - ""The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 1.2%"", ""The CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between November 2015 and November 2016 stood at 1.2%"". Using crypto = no inflation unless programmed into the coin. In the fiat system quantitative easing gets you REKT. No such thing in crypto, and if there is, you can tell it to fuck off and use another coin...like Doge.  A.That 1.5% is basically a convienece fee for on the fly cashing you out of a commodity into fiat... Coinbase charges you fees to deposit back into fiat and that takes a week to clear you bank. This clears instantly for roughly the same fee or less than coinbase. Also consider the opportunity loss. I strongly believe that ""investing"" is something all people should be doing, not just the elite fringe. TokenCard is working towards a future where money itself is redundant as your assets themselves will become the means of pay. This shift will prove vastly more beneficial and far outweigh any service fees we charged.    Q.   When you convert TKN to fiat, is this considered a taxable event? Or is the tax somehow baked into the transaction fee of using the card? If it is a taxable event, it would be a huge inconvenience (on behalf of the user) to have to keep all of this information available for tax purposes and might limit adoption (in tax faggy countries at least).  A.Taxes are up to you in each respective country. TKN to fiat is just like any other coin to fiat. There will be tax help built in to Tokencard app down the road.  Q.   how much personal information will you have to submit in order to get a card?  A. Normal KYC/AML information like any credit/debit card   Q.   how can you make sure that exchanges rates are correct when using a tokencard?  A.We take the actual exchange rate on the exchange the token is most liquid on.  Q.   how do make sure that tokencard is not used for money laundering purposes; if I used it, how do You / I know that I am not being accused for money laundering.  A.We perform industry standard KYC and AML. Don't use your TokenCard for illegal activities or fraud. If we detect anything suspicious we will cancel your card. Any detected attempt to game our system will also result in a one way trip to Deactivated TokenCard Land.   Q.   will the MVP card look different? Will those that got the MVP card receive some slightly different looking card when release is ready? Or will the 500 largest backers only get the same card, just earlier?  A. Fantastic question! This is also something I personally care a lot about, so you're good with us. You won't believe the lengths we have gone to make sure we will have the sickest card design in the industry.  Q.   Many of these other ""card companies"" such as Xapo for example have this great looking card on their website, however the actual card that you get is plain gray, no logo or nothing. Will the tokencard card look good irl? Will it be like the one displayed on the website?  A.Yes we know. All will be fine. I will refrain from talking explicitly about any competitors. But part of the reason for this is that Payment Networks require the entity issuing the cards to be a European Entity before allowing them to offer comprehensive designs on the card. Naturally most bitcoin debit card services are not registers in an EU country and thus are not allowed any designs. We are working very closely with the Issuing Bank to make our design kick ass! I promise!  Q.   Will the MVP card look different? Will those that got the MVP card receive some slightly different looking card when release is ready? Or will the 500 largest backers only get the same card, just earlier?  A.Both. MVP users will not only get a special card they will also receive free upgrade cards as we improve the design over time. (Also, I'm dying to tell you something else on this front.... but that will have to wait to the announcement next week)",False

Quote In 2014 the leader was Visa debit cards, which this year grew to $6.239 trillion. https://www.nilsonreport.com/publication_special_feature_article.php  How much of that $6 trillion market share will the leading crypto VISA enabled debit card account for in a few years? Even 1% will be $60 Billion and $600 million in fees per year. Very few if any blockchain projects have the potential to be that profitable within the next 5 years.  However those other companies you mentioned are largely unknown and will pay a fortune in marketing to attract a handful of users. TKN on the other hand already has thousands of crypto-currency shareholders who are all potential/likely customers and promoters. In addition they have constant free marketing exposure to the entire crypto market given that their brand will be traded on the majority of exchanges where their potential customers are present and it is already in the top 50 by market cap.  When they release in 4 months 95% of alt-coin holders will know who TKN are while less than 1% would probably be able to name the competitors you just listed.  In addition one of the key USP's of TKN as far as I can tell vs. existing competitors is the smart contract wallet  Quote 4.1 Smart Contract Wallet Upon a user joining the platform they launch their own Token Contract Wallet, or grant allowances to their existing wallets. This Contract Wallet acts as the equivalent of a bank account that holds funds and enforces security parameters, but, crucially, it is controlled only by the user. Users run through a setup wizard and are prompted to customize settings to fit their preference, including: • Setting daily limits to safeguard assets • Setting up a base currency for example ETH (any fiat deposited into this will automatically convert upon load). Typically digital currency security is a tradeoff between usability and functionality. Users must trade security of their funds for convenience when they decide whether to hold tokens themselves or leave them at an exchange. We think we can do better. By shifting control of user assets back into their own hands and giving them easy to manage fine-grained control of their digital assets safeguarded by the security of smart contracts, users can have better security and substantially improved usability.

I'm also interested to know what the total costs of using the product will be.  For me the real issue here is the FT & how their tech journalist looks to anyone that reads their publication. Clearly a company can have all the Visa access described provided they have a partnership with an authorised issuing bank, which they have. Crypto is really getting a buzz in the City of London & a few more incompetent articles like this will seriously hurt the FT's credibility.  On a positive note TKN's latest medium article says they think there's a decent chance they can beat their current initial MVP timeline.  Quote We are heads down focussed on the product. Looking at our timeline, there is a chance we might be able to ship the MVP TokenCards before our mid September goal. Fingers crossed.

((((Last week, an initial coin offering (ICO) for something* called TokenCard raised** $16.7m in “mere minutes”, according to the PR spin embedded in the emailed correspondence to this reporter following the event.  It was brought to market by an outfit called Monolith Studio, which until recently had offered sparse information about who was behind it, apart from a loose connection to Peter Vessenes, bitcoin investor and founder of something called “New Alchemy” (no less).  As is increasingly common in the promotion of these launches, a proposal pitching exclusive details ahead of the offering was made to the press. This, from April 19, being an example from our own inbox (with Monolith calling itself Monolith Ventures):   Details revealed over the next few weeks showed the project was the brainchild Mel Gelderman and another chap called David Hoggard. Their respective Linkedin bios were either exceptionally thin on the ground or non-existent.  The pitch itself was pretty forthright (please note the emphasis):  Tomorrow, Monolith Ventures will open the ICO for TokenCard, the first debit card powered by smart contracts. When the card launches, holders will be able to use it anywhere that accepts VISA. And the promotional blitz disseminated after the launch on May 4 reiterated the key points:  Monolith Studio’s TokenCard closed its token launch Tuesday, May 2, 2017, after exceeding its crowdsale goal in mere minutes. TokenCard is the first debit card powered by smart contracts incorporating the VISA payments network with Ethereum. It immediately gained attention in the Ethereum community after its announcement and quickly reached and surpassed contribution goals for this one-of-a-kind project. For the first time, token holders will be able to use Ether as well as other ERC20 tokens to purchase items anywhere that accepts VISA debit cards. Suffice to say, the above made a lot of TokenCard’s access to Visa’s payment networks — if not leveraging Visa’s brand rather explicitly for its own purposes.  You’d think Visa — had it truly decided to associate itself with or back a crypto venture this explicitly — would have also communicated the unprecedented cooperation. It didn’t.  To the contrary, a spokesman from Visa Europe told us on Friday that:  At this point I’m unable to establish any business relationship between Visa and this company. Our lawyers are looking into this and I will come back to you if I have any further insight. The accompanying promotional graphics for TokenCard have since gone from this)))))) ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________  https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2017/05/08/2188471/introducing-truly-outlandish-ico-claims-tokencard-edition/   Much ado about nothing, or a real concern?",False

We can see he has participated with his SNGLS tokens in the TokencardICO. https://etherscan.io/token/SNGLS?a=0x003cfe33f034a5ea022efa021d78a95b16170c0b There you can see two transactions to TokenCardICO contract address 0x49edf201c1e139282643d5e7c6fb0c7219ad1db7 1 million SNGLS and 3.5 million SNGLS SNGLS have been trading around $0.096 during the tokensale, so that's $96 000 and $336 000 for a total of $432 000 he deposited to the TokencardICO (with SNGLS). 2) Let's see how much TOKEN our guy ZeroThree has received: https://etherscan.io/token/0x65b9d9b96bcce0b89d807413e4703d2c7451593a?a=0x003cfe33f034a5ea022efa021d78a95b16170c0b His TOKEN balance is now 0 but there are 2 events where he transferred his TOKENS out, there we can see that ZeroThree has received 6 174 000 TOKEN ZeroThree has paid $432k for 6.2 million TOKEN, that is $0.0699 he paid per TOKEN. I checked some other SNGLS users to verify, and they've paid a similar price of $0.0699. Please note, this whale now owns 6.2 million of all TOKENS, while there are only 42 million created. He owns 15 % of the supply 3) In contrast, let's now look to normal investors. We know the initial rate was 150 TOKEN per ETH for the first few investors. ETH was trading at $78. So early investors received 150 TOKEN / $78 so paid $ 0.52. After 10 minutes or so, the rate was 100 TOKEN per ETH, or $0.78 Normal investors have paid $0.52 to $0.78 per token which means our guy ZeroThree has received 750 % to 1100 % bonus due to his $0.0699 price per token.",False

We believe so strongly in the future of the token economy that not only are we the first company to offer to create our tokens in exchange for other tokens, we will give contributions in certain tokens a discount. For full details on the TKN Creation Event, see section 9.2. In brief, the tokens will be sold at a discount to early buyers at a rate sliding from 150 TKN : 1 ETH down to 100 TKN: 1 ETH at the $4.5mm mark. If the cap is reached, we will continue to sell and create TKN for 24 hours – this will protect those who wish to participate in the event if all tokens sell out quickly. Those who purchase with other tokens from our approved list will receive a 2.5% - 5% TKN bonus, depending on the token. If funds are raised to the cap and ETH is priced at $50, about 21 million tokens will be created.",False

Any merchant who accepts visa will accept TokenCard, since it's issued by a licensed Visa partner. If you're worried about using the card outside of China, you should know that it's your bank that sets the conditions on where your card can be used, not Visa. In the case of TokenCard, the issuer is not putting geographic restrictions on it. The TokenCard app will allow users to set up additional security measures for their card, like daily withdrawal and maximum withdrawal limits, among other features.   Need to make sure people aren't getting payment processing and banking confused.  Although many banks offer merchant services (payment processing), they do not control Visa.  Visa is the worldwide payment network that banks, financing companies, and now blockchain projects can plug into.  Visa provides consistency and guarantees for merchants, that's the whole appeal of their company in 2017.    Hope that answers your question.",False
