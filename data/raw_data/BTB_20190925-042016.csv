They simply define a certain number of coins that  they assign to every address they wish BEFORE the coin goes out to the public. They have this way a coin pile without mining and its extremely easy to get rich by simply selling their coins with the first chance (usually after a pump which THEY cause by spreading a bullish rumor for the coin!) and lefting the coin to dump afterwards!  3) Another one is having dev tax (some coins even 20%) so the team behind the coin is continuously gaining more money sanctioning the transactions which blockchain technology was supposed to free from the centralized crows like banks !!  4) The most tricky of all : Hardfork ! Like with the ZCL scandal , some coins may seem fair , without the 3 first flaws of unfairness, but the devs are just making a new coin out of an older (by making a hard fork) which means that they make a new ''updated"" blockchain after certain blocks of the old one ! Those who meet some requirements (like having certain old coins) , take  the new one and this way the rich are becoming richer and the guys who have critical information , know very well if the old coin is going to be abandoned and which time is the right to sell them off .  There are VERY FEW coins which are really FAIR without the 1-2-3 characteristics and EVEN LESS with honest dev teams which have desgned them EXCLUDING ANY hard fork possibility (characteristic 4).  Please be CAREFUL , trust ONLY cryptos without ALL of the 4 characteristics above ! BTCZ is the one I know. No ico, no airdrops, no premine, no taxes , NO HARD FORKS. It's time for all of us to adopt a PURE COMMUNITY DIGITAL COIN , to free the transactions worldwide like Satoshi had dreamed , but without the flaws of the BTC (like its low speed, its hard forks ,its centralized mining by sharks , its poor privacy options and its low max supply inflicting long non integer numbers 0.0000023 etc ) Btcz is called ""BTC2"" because it is perfectly designed in order to fullfill the vision of SATOSHI , delivering everything btc was meant to offer to the world in a completely FAIR WAY.

And since theres no regulations on icos or altcoins...or even bitcoin as a whole right now in the US. Im not entirely sure theres anything the FBI can really do about this anyways. Im not an attorney and really dont have a full understand of exactly what kind or crimes the FBI can and cant pursue. So this is really just my opinion on the matter. Investing in ICOs is and always has been an ""at your own risk"" investment platform and until there are stricter regulations it will continue to be this way and there will continue to be scam after scam. It is up to us to do better background investigations into these icos to better inform ourselves and make smarter investments. Regulating icos would be great for preventing scams...but would likely make it worse in a lot of other ways.",False

We are can do it .so many people so happy 😍🏆https://www.coinexchange.io/market/BTBc/BTC  I. You can buy / sell with a piece of mind, you won't lose clients because they won't have to worry about being scammed.    II. 5x faster than smart contacting.    III. Simple and easy to use system with detailed explanation to accept the coin with the current payment gateway you are already using.    1)Traditional concept   Traditionally, Person A sends the funds to Person B, and in turn Person B sends item to Person A to complete the trade. In a smart contract; there is an additional level of protection, unfortunately it protects the buyer only. When conducting a trade with a smart contract, Person A sends coins via Escrow feature (smart contract) where both parties must agree to release the coins to complete the transaction. However if the buyer does not agree, the funds or coins are returned to the buyer after a time limit. There is a huge flaw in today’s blockchain smart contracts, because they only protect the buyers.     In fact today’s smart contracts may very well promote fraud on the part of the buyers. If a seller has shipped a product or item, and the smart contract keeps the coins held in escrow until both parties agree to release them, but what if the buyer decides not to release or confirm the transaction, despite the fact that they received the goods? Any buyer can easily take advantage of this huge flaw in the so called smart contracts. If confirmation is not received by both sides, the coins are eventually returned to the buyer, after a predetermined time limit. In this case the seller losses the product and eventually will be out of business. We can clearly see that today’s blockchain smart contracts are in fact far from being smart.    2) Our Difference. The Concept:   In our system, let's assume: we have a group chat. Person A and Person B are trading. Both ask Person C to send them an escrow identifier, Person C generates one (through his wallet) and pastes it in the chat, Person C also gets a unique hash password to control the outcome of the transaction. Once both parties are happy, Person C releases the money. If either one of the parties is not happy, then the transaction is held in escrow during the dispute process, until such time that a resolution has been determined. E.G: like Paypal dispute & resolution center. Person A binds the transaction (coin-cli generate payment [amount] [recipient’s address] [escrow ID]) to the escrow identifier and gives them the payment hash which can be seen at the blockchain explorer. Person B sends the item to Person A.     3) Case: Both parties are happy   Both parties ask the escrow to release the funds. Escrow executes the command: coin-cli release funds [escrow ID] [escrow PASSWORD]    4) Case: Parties are not happy   In case of dispute, escrow decides in favor of Person A, then he/she can execute coin-cli return funds [escrow ID] [escrow PASSWORD], otherwise if Escrow sides with Person B, then coin-cli release funds [escrow ID] [escrow PASSWORD]     5) Normal Send/Receive Transactions:   If user wants to send a transaction as a normal payment, user can choose to do so, and it will just be broadcasted to the network just like bitcoin, but if they want to send via escrow the concept above should take place this can be done with the existing bitcoin code. You can find several links and Bitcoin commands at the bottom of this page that will make more sense to developers.    6) Case Studies:   A programmatically API will help you extend the functionalities of the BITBASE coin! 1. For companies like Escrow.com and PayPal, they can act as the direct escrow with the assistance of our programmable node. They will be able to generate escrow ID, process transactions, release funds all programmatically. This could integrate well with their buyer/seller protection feature.    2. Similarly for companies like eBay, Amazon, our smart contract BITBASE technology will allow any company, business or online website to use the node to generate escrow requests on the go. They can decide to release the funds after X days after buyer expresses their satisfaction. They could relatively depend upon the seller's reputation. Good reputation, less time to release funds.",False

As previously mentioned our register provides details of the firms we regulate and you should check they are listed before dealing with them. You should also use the contact details we provide on the register as this will make sure you only deal with the genuine authorised firm.  I refer you back to Andrew's response regarding your next steps and reporting this to Action Fraud. I'll pass the details you've provided to the relevant team for consideration.

So instead of transferring them out, I bought an equal amount on coinexchange and the sold what I had on the site. I then tried to withdraw the BTC and ETH from the site but they were stuck in pending and then the site went down. What happens in my situation?  Will the pending withdraws be released or will I have the BTC and ETH on the new site?  What happens to the BTB I'm holding now? I bought an equal amount during the ICO, but sold and re-bought to move them off the site. I'm sure you can understand how, even though I support the project, I would feel more comfortable holding outside the site until things smoothed out. Would I be able exchange an equal amount of BTB to what I purchased during the ICO at 1:1?",False

I have already begun to think that you are Yakov with a fake account. When Yakov forced everyone to lend at 1.30 it was because at that time $ 1.30 was the minimum price of the token in the internal exchange. The tokens had started to go out to coinexchange because there their value was much higher. After he made the bad decision to make Lock in lending to everybody in the bitbase platform. The investors that had tokens in  coinexchange, when they heard this news got scared and started to sell quickly, what made the price fall completely. Then, when he saw that he would have to pay lending to all the users for a value of 1.30 and in the exchange the coin was already at $ 0.25, he freed all the accounts that he had locked in his way and so he did not have to pay anything.

The price of BTBc in the very first big sales was 0.02 USD. The price actually hasn't dropped below that price to begin with so none of those investors lost anything. If you purchased very early in the ICO you paid 20c per Btbc so you have already lost because of the mine and the early bonus buys. Now if the Bitbase site was not accepting deposits and you wanted to protect your position the only way to do so was to buy on coinexchange. The fact that there were miners and that was not told to investors before our funds were unlocked. The only people who have lost are the ones that purchased during ICO after the bonus packages which was me for one. Any of those investors should get 1 to 1 swap for any coins they have purchased regardless of where they purchased them because they were A. Protecting their investment which had taken a massive dip B. Having faith in the devs and the system that the coin would come back. C. Waiting on the Bitbase website to give them a wallet address to transfer the coins to.  They then left us a message with a windows wallet to download so I have transferred all the coins I have outside the system into that wallet ready for the fork / coin transfer.  I'm not sure if you are in support of BitBase / Laser or not but the solution is not to rip off some investors and not others. Controlling through an internal exchange is much easier. Even if you swap all the coins your not looking for the people that have 20k coins because people got that many at ICO anyway. You find the accounts that want to swap millions of coins!,False

He has already said that he will restore the 50 free btbc to all those who won them by registering. (as was initially promised by signup reward) I also think that if Yahov want to start doing things right, he will make a 1:1 swap, since those who bought at ICO at low prices and those who bought at exchange at low prices are investors too. In coinexchange many people sold their coins in lost and others took advantage and bought them, that's not bad, that's how the coin market works.  Many of the investors at the beginning also took advantage and ran out to sell their coins to the coinexchange for values of $ 1, $ 2, $ 3, $ 4 and up to $ 5 and they returned to Bitbase exchange to buy cheap and so they repeated that operation several times. Those who bought in conexchange have the same coin that were sold at some time in the ICO. They say that some miners mined and took advantage ... but that should be within the plans, since it was a minable coin and would eventually be mined .. Yakov should not allow more deposits in coinexchange and the miners could not continue sending coins. An exchange 1 BTBc = 1 Laser would be the best solution and it would start with all the investors happy and talking well about the project. This would solve all the problems and give a clean start.

I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt and it seems to me that they are reacting to a bad situation and that no decision will make everyone happy.  The whole point of giving away coins is to attract people to the site and if lots of people are fraudulently registering multiple times using fake email accounts, its reasonable to react by adding additional controls such as the requirement to invest a bit more or to lend on the platform in order to utilize the tokens.  A scam is where someone takes the money and disappears (bitpetite) and if they are responding to posts here and intending to launch a new coin that is more secure, then I think the community needs to appreciate the situation they are in and let them do what needs to be done to set things right.   Spamming this newsgroup with hate messages in bold, caps, emojis and big red lettering is not helpful, especially if the main complaint is about not receiving 50 coins that was a gift anyway.  The people that invested in this platform, whether during the ICO or by buying the coins off the exchange, are the customers that have been impacted and things need to be set right by them.  This is a bad situation and I appreciate that the investors are not simply being abandoned, and also appreciate that a new platform is being established that will satisfy the mission that the project was initially set out to achieve.

I think this will bring the coin back in business. I wouldn't worry about bashers. They will always be there.  Here are few suggestions from me on how to do this:  1. ICO closed on 31st Oct. All the coins purchased by that day should get converted to new coin. Also with 50 coins bonus that was offered to 200 coins investors. 2. Send out email to all bitbase.io coin purchasers to invite them to a closed group. This can be used to give daily updates without worrying about hundreds of junk posts. 3. Send out email to all bitbase.io coin purchasers to provide proof of coins they bought on coinexchange. Bonus coins should be offered to compensate these coins. I have purchased lot of coins cheap on coinexchange. It will suck just to lose these. 4. Announce realistic lending plans that will make profit to all sides. 5. Offer better customer support than posting messages on facebook.   Regards and good luck.,False

If he only swaps few coins and does not swap ALL EXISTING COINS, leaving out people who bought the coin in exchanges or who bought it on their platform and sent it to exchanges.. (that legally is the same thing where people buy it, since he enabled the door to coinexchange and the people paid for it) Leaving those people out would be a big scam. That would be a scam on a large scale that the FBI would surely take very seriously... it would end up as the owner of MT Gox. That is why I believe that he will do the right thing this time and swap all the existing coins.",False

According to the announcement on www.bitbase.io this guy is creating a totally new website, the old coin will be abandoned and all the investors that contributed in the ICO will receive an equal amount of new tokens in their wallets?

How does this solution compensate all the investors who set up the buywalls for the tanking price?  #2: I have heard of investors who were able to withdraw money from the Bitbase platform to sell it on coinexchange.io  So these kind of lucky fellas will have booked their profits and will still receive the new coins?  #3: In his announcement he is stating that there will be a Pre-ICO to ""buy some time"" - in the same run he says no new tokens are gonna be sold.  Should this be a sort of coin swap on the website for all the tokens that are already in circulation on the exchanges and wallets, but not an ICO (for BTC/ETH) in the traditional sense?

Traders taking a chance on making profit, that's who buys. but with a crash like that, buyers become sellers and stay that way. I bought $100 of BtBc at 0.00001200 and sold at .000056xx took a nice little profit then waited for the price to tank and bought $100 at .000005xx. Took nice profit and still have coins just in case, scam or not.  Source code is to show the wallet isn't set to steal from you, and show trust, and have it scrutinized that's the whole point. Value is what people are willing to pay for it. BTC itself if no one is willing to buy can crash to $0.01 in 5 min, with an value evaporation of 99.9999999% with under 1% of BTC coins traded.  Value is what someone is willing to pay, and unfortunately a minority of traders holding a majority of goods with just a few trades can destroy value of anything. I have a tree outside and there is a leaf on the tree, If I pick it there is no other leaf exactly like it, if I can sell it to someone for 1 million dollars that leaf is worth 1 million dollars, if that person cant sell it for $0.01.... its worth nothing. Also If the leaf does sell at a higher price to the next seller and I pick another leaf similar to the first and someone likes it and I could sell this leaf for 2 million the first would also be worth 2 million. however if I can only sell the second for $0.01 that would make the valuation of the first $0.01 as well although the purchase price was 1 million, unless the holder of the first or second leaf could sell theirs for a higher price. That's the whole premise of exchanges, one second you have value, the next you have more... or less... and often based on nothing but fact less conjecture.    People are buying the coins.... there is 18 BTC buy orders at .00000437 at time of typing this. the highest buying point I personally saw was 38BTC.... not as high now but people are still willing to take a risk. And the world is full of stupid people, there is no shortage of stupidity in this world.",False

FIRSTLY, the coin was around $2 when the scammer sent some illiterate email about dumping. Everyone can do what they want with the coin and it doesn't matter if the coin value goes down in a normal way from people wanting to sell (most was locked away in BTB anyway). For lenders it doesn't matter how much the coin is worth. They buy it at whatever price and then still get the same interest on the dollar amount.  This isn't what has happened, though. SECONDLY, the scammer who started this site (are you sure it's regulated by FSA as shown in the footer?) decided to release 15% of the BTB balance for reasons he gave which wasn't the original plan. He then didn't process some (most?) withdrawals to exchanges (they stay as pending for days). Another nonsensical email followed about dumping when the vast majority were in the BTB balance still (not BTBc) and only the scammer could dump his coins (which is just greed considering the ICO money he has).  He then changes it for a THIRD time in as many days it seemed. This time he puts all the BTB balance into a lending scheme at a rate of over $1 each BTB.  This is where the REAL SCAM happens. The FOURTH thing he did was create massive volume (even greater than REGAL COIN) 24 hours ago on coinexchange. REMEMBER EVERYONE HAD SOLD BY THEN AND ALL THEIR REMAINING BTB WAS FORCIBLY PUT IN A LENDING PLAN A WHOLE DAY PREVIOUSLY. Nobody else but the scammer could have been selling all these coins (they were near $2 still). THE VOLUME WAS RIDICULOUSLY HIGH.  How the scammer could then say it was the users dumping the coins is beyond belief when everyone's coins were locked up!  Just to prove this, about 15 hours ago, the price on Coinexchange was not much more than 20cents!! It was nearly $2 just hours earlier. At that time I was querying this on a discord channel. I looked in my account and noticed that my well over 24hours coinexchange withdrawal was STILL PENDING (this was the withdrawal of the 15% plus 50 bonus). I also noticed I had OVER $1000 IN THE LENDING which was the automatic thing. Remeber this was probably EIGHT HOURS after the coin had already mostly collapsed and nobody had access to their coins as it was all in the lending.  SO AFTER THE SCAMMER DUMPS ALL HIS COIN THROUGH PURE GREED (HE ALREADY HAS THE ICO FUNDS) he tries to blame it all on everyone else! He sends another illiterate email reversing his previous loan. So now he doesn't even have to pay any interest any more! Also the $1000 loan can now only be a $200 loan due to the fall in price if anyone wants to lend the returned balance. Who now is going to lend after a 80% fall? Nobody would want the loan cancelled in these circumstances but he still says this was for our benefit and due to us etc!  FINALLY (FIFTH), the pending withdrawal NOW TOTALLY DISAPPEARS from the transaction list. It isn't on coinexchange either (my 200 pending). The previous BTB loan amount is now in the BTBc balance but he doesn't convert the dollar amount but uses the much lower exchange value from the scammer dumping the coin. He doesn't even return the full $1000 loan value, but just the same amount of BTB coins which are NOW WORTH EIGHTY PERCENT LESS (I can now only loan $200 instead of $1000 so who would want that to be the case and what else can anyone do but sell if the scammer doesn't reinstate the loan from before with the much higher value). A capital release from the loan should have been the exact same dollar value, obviously. Nobody would want it returned if the price was dumped on.  In his email he is trying to say that the loan was returned before the huge dump BUT IT IS A MASSIVE LIE!!! Even many hours after the price collapsed everyone's money was in the lending (so nobody else could have sold any coins). I was checking it myself and didn't understand why the price was so low on coinexchange when everyone's BTB was locked in the lending (mine definitely was many hours after the dump as proven in the discord chat at the time).  So basically, the scammer didn't even want to pay the interest on the loans after selling millions of $ worth of coins in a matter of hours so cancelled the loans many hours AFTER the price went so low. Nobody else dumped, as it was impossible. Also, withdrawals that weren't processed and were pending (to exchanges) totally disappeared at that point too.  He then pretended he sent the email before the dump instead of after he dumped!!  0.01$/BTBc ... Lol  SCAM BULLSHITS",False

Transfers from coinexchange.io to BtB account and visa versa were not possible... as addresses to the on site accounts were never made available and the button for transferring coins out were greyed out and not accessible, so the site was not affected, however coins were allowed to be transferred from miners to get dumped due to the lack of trading on the BtB site causing the crash. And since there was little to no trading on the BtB site exchange... the real issue seems to be that the $0.02 ICO price is what destroyed the platform, by allowing millions of available coins to be dumped at ridiculously low prices for massive profit on site.  Mistake count #1: Price spread, $0.02 ICO, $0.20-$1.00 for everyone else  #2: They realized the $0.02 ICO mistake and massive coin quantity will cause a dump so they restricted 15% per day coins available at beginning of platform lending, allowing only major holders to       dump larger quantities.  #3: Realizing major holders dumping their 15% of coins is still crashing the on site price they lock all investors coins in a loan without permission at about $1.20 per token, to prevent dumping.  #4: Telling everyone that they have massive capital to rocket the price so don't dump the coin. (read on)  #5: Realizing that they just pissed off every investor they have by locking the coins in a loan, they release the coins out of loans after the price tanked to around $0.30 which caused more dumping, as        that's all you could do as no one is stupid enough to loan the coins at $0.30 when they were just locked at $1.20.  #6: Allowing miners to deposit to exchanges directly while Investors were locked out of transfers, that's what miners do, dump, dump, dump. BTC, BTC, BTC. Miners don't care about any coin but BTC!  #7: Not buying back their coins at a reduced rate when they had the chance, all those coins they sold at $0.30-$1.00 could have been bought back at under $0.20+/- on site or $0.10 on CE.IO reducing        market availability, and leaving them with around 65-70%+ of the ICO funding, while rocketing the price like they said.  #8: Realizing every move or non-move they make is making things worse, they apparently decided to allow tokens from the site to be transferred to a wallet which seemingly only worked for select        people (large investors) so they could transfer to coinexchange.io to dump the coin in the hopes that people would start to trade onsite raising the price, or kill the coin outright since it is dying        already, screwing everyone else, blaming mining.  (there...#8... that's my conspiracy theory... and #9)  #9: It's too unbelievable! Nobody could be this stupid, Yakov Fabrizio probably orchestrated this whole thing to capitalize and scam out.  #9: Where is my BtB visa card?? (seriously though)  #10: Yakov Fabrizio has not explained the plan for the coins on coinexchange.io? or coins transferred into the wallets. Anyone unlucky enough to trade is going to get burned I bet. That would be        mistake #11, no one will trade the next coin if they screw over the coin holders at coinexchange.io. Unless they want to kill the next coin as well.... if it happens...  #12, if there were so many miners.... why was their no difficulty adjustment?!?! That's what makes this so unbelievable, NOTHING was thought through with intelligence if this guy is legit.   Holy Yakov Fabrizio banana coin split, Batman! Is this Joker going to get away?!?",False

Bitbase haven't even settled my ETH deposit since more than 2 weeks ago.. How can we trust your ""new"" domain? Rather than shifting the blame to the dumper why not look into what caused this whole saga?  1. 50 BTBc tokens as registration gift -> Gone not because we did not participate in ICO, rather your validation taking ages 2. As mentioned in point 1, I deposited my ETH more than 2 weeks ago yet gotten nothing. 3. Giving 15% of tokens to the token holders when there is a lot of uncertainty surrounding point 1 and 2 4. Suddenly locking withdrawals from BitBase.io  With the above points do you see who is the cause of the issue? Is that solely the fault of the participants?  What I can suggest to you dev, since the price is so low and that you have gotten quite some capital off ICO, do this to regain trust else your new domain will suffer the same fate, not cursing you but doing up a new domain the trust is lost  1. Buy back tokens from coinexchange and have them stored away into your contract (This lowers the current circulating supply) 2. Temporary stop mining to prevent further devaluation of token price 3. Rather than working on a new domain and downplaying the same strategy in your new domain, work on getting people's deposit that are still outstanding settled.  Tokens prices are way below $0.10 now which is grossly cheaper for a buyback from what BitBase sold them for, you will earn anyway. I believe Fudders who want to sell them below 1000 sats ain't worthy of holding onto BTBc. Just my 2 cents..",False

FIRSTLY, the coin was around $2 when the scammer sent some illiterate email about dumping. Everyone can do what they want with the coin and it doesn't matter if the coin value goes down in a normal way from people wanting to sell (most was locked away in BTB anyway). For lenders it doesn't matter how much the coin is worth. They buy it at whatever price and then still get the same interest on the dollar amount.  This isn't what has happened, though. SECONDLY, the scammer who started this site (are you sure it's regulated by FSA as shown in the footer?) decided to release 15% of the BTB balance for reasons he gave which wasn't the original plan. He then didn't process some (most?) withdrawals to exchanges (they stay as pending for days). Another nonsensical email followed about dumping when the vast majority were in the BTB balance still (not BTBc) and only the scammer could dump his coins (which is just greed considering the ICO money he has).  He then changes it for a THIRD time in as many days it seemed. This time he puts all the BTB balance into a lending scheme at a rate of over $1 each BTB.  This is where the REAL SCAM happens. The FOURTH thing he did was create massive volume (even greater than REGAL COIN) 24 hours ago on coinexchange. REMEMBER EVERYONE HAD SOLD BY THEN AND ALL THEIR REMAINING BTB WAS FORCIBLY PUT IN A LENDING PLAN A WHOLE DAY PREVIOUSLY. Nobody else but the scammer could have been selling all these coins (they were near $2 still). THE VOLUME WAS RIDICULOUSLY HIGH.  How the scammer could then say it was the users dumping the coins is beyond belief when everyone's coins were locked up!  Just to prove this, about 15 hours ago, the price on Coinexchange was not much more than 20cents!! It was nearly $2 just hours earlier. At that time I was querying this on a discord channel. I looked in my account and noticed that my well over 24hours coinexchange withdrawal was STILL PENDING (this was the withdrawal of the 15% plus 50 bonus). I also noticed I had OVER $1000 IN THE LENDING which was the automatic thing. Remeber this was probably EIGHT HOURS after the coin had already mostly collapsed and nobody had access to their coins as it was all in the lending.  SO AFTER THE SCAMMER DUMPS ALL HIS COIN THROUGH PURE GREED (HE ALREADY HAS THE ICO FUNDS) he tries to blame it all on everyone else! He sends another illiterate email reversing his previous loan. So now he doesn't even have to pay any interest any more! Also the $1000 loan can now only be a $200 loan due to the fall in price if anyone wants to lend the returned balance. Who now is going to lend after a 80% fall? Nobody would want the loan cancelled in these circumstances but he still says this was for our benefit and due to us etc!  FINALLY (FIFTH), the pending withdrawal NOW TOTALLY DISAPPEARS from the transaction list. It isn't on coinexchange either (my 200 pending). The previous BTB loan amount is now in the BTBc balance but he doesn't convert the dollar amount but uses the much lower exchange value from the scammer dumping the coin. He doesn't even return the full $1000 loan value, but just the same amount of BTB coins which are NOW WORTH EIGHTY PERCENT LESS (I can now only loan $200 instead of $1000 so who would want that to be the case and what else can anyone do but sell if the scammer doesn't reinstate the loan from before with the much higher value). A capital release from the loan should have been the exact same dollar value, obviously. Nobody would want it returned if the price was dumped on.  In his email he is trying to say that the loan was returned before the huge dump BUT IT IS A MASSIVE LIE!!! Even many hours after the price collapsed everyone's money was in the lending (so nobody else could have sold any coins). I was checking it myself and didn't understand why the price was so low on coinexchange when everyone's BTB was locked in the lending (mine definitely was many hours after the dump as proven in the discord chat at the time).  So basically, the scammer didn't even want to pay the interest on the loans after selling millions of $ worth of coins in a matter of hours so cancelled the loans many hours AFTER the price went so low. Nobody else dumped, as it was impossible. Also, withdrawals that weren't processed and were pending (to exchanges) totally disappeared at that point too.  He then pretended he sent the email before the dump instead of after he dumped!!   SCAM BULLSHITS",False

And this is the reason. and the next project. there will be new trading floors for investors to keep prices on the moon Dear Users,  Some of you starting to talk negative on social media or forums about us that we are scam, mostly regarding that the free 50 BTBc were removed from accounts that didn't purchased at least 200 worth of Tokens or BTBc from exchanger, the rule for that was since the start and the lending starting plan caused the free BTBc to be removed so people that purchasing low amounts of BTBc can also sell as before they couldn't because they wouldn't have at least 200 bought.  Regarding the tokens release we released 15% of that to your account in form of BTBc, but as a lot of people dumping the coin and causing high downfall in the coin price, we are taking a different approach, starting from tommorow all tokens will be transformed into a lending plan at the current BTBc price calculated and no lower than $1 as that was the final price you bought it for. So higher or not everyone will still make some profit on the long run and i think that is way better then some taking all the credits and some don't.  Wallets should be available soon including the mining one, as currently some of you wanted to send to exchangers directly we added that feature temporarly until we finish the actual wallets.  We are doing our best but without your support BitBase Coin will never reach it's true potential, so let's work together so everyone can benefit out of it.

Regarding the tokens release we released 15% of that to your account in form of BTBc, but as a lot of people dumping the coin and causing high downfall in the coin price, we are taking a different approach, starting from tommorow all tokens will be transformed into a lending plan at the current BTBc price calculated and no lower than $1 as that was the final price you bought it for. So higher or not everyone will still make some profit on the long run and i think that is way better then some taking all the credits and some don't.  Wallets should be available soon including the mining one, as currently some of you wanted to send to exchangers directly we added that feature temporarly until we finish the actual wallets.  We are doing our best but without your support BitBase Coin will never reach it's true potential, so let's work together so everyone can benefit out of it.

I'm just newbie in this forum and I have some personal opinion about bitbase project! 1. About scam! Why Yakov just not just shut down the website and enjoy his ICO fund? Why did he have to do hard work to put it on coinmartketcap? even coinexchange.io? ********************************** What is the criteria for a cryptocurrency to be listed on CoinMarketCap?  The criteria for a cryptocurrency to be listed is the following:  - Must be a cryptocurrency or a crypto token. - Must be on a public exchange with an API that reports the last traded price and the last 24 hour trading volume. - Must have a non-zero trading volume on at least one supported exchange so a price can be determined. - For market cap ranking, an accurate circulating supply figure is required.  If you'd like to have a cryptocurrency listed and it meets all of the criteria, please fill out the request form. ********************************** At CoinExchange.io we endeavour to list coins that: Have a high community demand. Which are innovations in crypto-currency technology. That contribution to science, humanity and the environment.  At CoinExchange.io we also believe in letting the free market sort out which coins should thrive and survive, as a result we have a policy of giving a chance to new coins. We also accept paid listings. We encourage buyers to do their own research on any new coins that are listed.  CoinExchange.io reserves the right to keep or remove any coin / market from our exchange.  Markets / Coins which are eligible for removal include but are not limited to:  Coins which don’t have a working block explorer. Coins with no developer support or public developments (abandoned coins). Coins without working blockchains. Coins which do not adhere to their target block times. Coins which violate our policies. Markets with less than 2 BTC (or equivalent) of volume over a 30 day period and have been on CoinExchange.io for 4 weeks or more. Markets that consistency dip below the minimum volume requirement. Markets with 0 daily volume or that have not been traded for many months  If a market is removed, you will have 30 days to remove your coins from our wallets.  Removals  All coin removals from CoinExchange.io will be advertised in the News section of the website and on Twitter. It is the responsibility of the user to check regularly what coins are set to be delisted. We will give 30 days notice on all coin removals. All coins must be removed from customers accounts before the 30 day period is over. Once we close the wallet no more withdrawals will be possible under any circumstances. In the case of coins without a working blockchain, or with wallet problems that prevent us from sending transactions out we willl have no choice but to simply close the wallet. We will take all steps possible to make sure this does not happen but sometimes is unavoidable unfortunately. *************************** These two conditions are not simple to implement, whether a scammer needs to do it? Assuming he is a scammer, the amount of money he earns from the ICO is not small, even if he only needs one-third of the target set at the ICO (100M token), it is at least $ 2,000,000. Why is not he just running away? Someone will say that he is greedy and wants more money! I agree, but back to the issue of he put btbc into the market, the money he needs to spend will not be small, that is not to mention the margin trading in the market, insurance costs ... etc?  About the btbc prices crash: If you already a trader, and my little experience all token when list to market will pump to the moon and then dump like hell (not even earth) haha, that very normal! so someone says where these coin come from when almost investor btbc stuck on the website? yes that Yakov's btbc and some of the investor who successful transfer it (you could find them on their facebook). OK let the show begin: when the market starts: trader and house(Yakov) fighting together on the very first day you can see prices up to 6$, don't tell me just only Yakov could pump it, That free market, nobody can control it that the game of whale and shark so Who will be worried when btbc get more attraction, is it order lending coin? What are they afraid of? Will their customers choose a better coin? easy to get the answer! so they even buy the coin at high prices and use it to drowned their competitor to death (conspiracy theories what we usually see in the stock market) but we can see Yakov never give up check back requirement to stay on market (Markets with less than 2 BTC (or equivalent) of volume over a 30 day period and have been on CoinExchange.io for 4 weeks or more) if he want scam we cant see the volume these days (rank 42) wtf he spends his blood guys I feel touched.  And now about these guys who called btbc scam! My God, you guys even have time to be a hero to warning people? bravo did you guys do it for charity? why many newbies warning about that? I see some Jr.member already say Yakov scam and now hard to find their comment (I remember a guy named Gleb, you can read his reply from the first page, he also created waring theard with just 3 page).  So after this post, someone will call me Yakov's fake member. Haha My name is Lee Phi Qing and I'm already invested 118,000 btbc! just google my name Thank you and best Regard  ",False

Why only let 15% go per day, and then eventually freeze our accounts and force lending?  Why did he just put out a wallet today?  Why is he still posting on the forums about our ranking?  Why?  Because he is not scamming us, he is trying to make this company and coin work!  The only people that are hurting this company and investors, are the trash on this forum spreading FEAR and DOUBT.  Anyone talking shit about this coin on this forum page, (you know who im talking about) they are complaining about their 50 coins that they lost, or they just want your attention because they are lonely at home, do not listen to these FUDDERS, because thats all they are good for, spreading FUD.  If you don't believe in this company, please keep dumping the coin, the true investors on this site would love to purchase your coins at pennys on the dollar, this is why purchases are happening as we speak.  Keep listening to the fudders, get scared, cry a little, then dump your coins, and watch them rise to over $1 before the end of the year.",False

FIRSTLY, the coin was around $2 when the scammer sent some illiterate email about dumping. Everyone can do what they want with the coin and it doesn't matter if the coin value goes down in a normal way from people wanting to sell (most was locked away in BTB anyway). For lenders it doesn't matter how much the coin is worth. They buy it at whatever price and then still get the same interest on the dollar amount.  This isn't what has happened, though. SECONDLY, the scammer who started this site (are you sure it's regulated by FSA as shown in the footer?) decided to release 15% of the BTB balance for reasons he gave which wasn't the original plan. He then didn't process some (most?) withdrawals to exchanges (they stay as pending for days). Another nonsensical email followed about dumping when the vast majority were in the BTB balance still (not BTBc) and only the scammer could dump his coins (which is just greed considering the ICO money he has).  He then changes it for a THIRD time in as many days it seemed. This time he puts all the BTB balance into a lending scheme at a rate of over $1 each BTB.  This is where the REAL SCAM happens. The FOURTH thing he did was create massive volume (even greater than REGAL COIN) 24 hours ago on coinexchange. REMEMBER EVERYONE HAD SOLD BY THEN AND ALL THEIR REMAINING BTB WAS FORCIBLY PUT IN A LENDING PLAN A WHOLE DAY PREVIOUSLY. Nobody else but the scammer could have been selling all these coins (they were near $2 still). THE VOLUME WAS RIDICULOUSLY HIGH.  How the scammer could then say it was the users dumping the coins is beyond belief when everyone's coins were locked up!  Just to prove this, about 15 hours ago, the price on Coinexchange was not much more than 20cents!! It was nearly $2 just hours earlier. At that time I was querying this on a discord channel. I looked in my account and noticed that my well over 24hours coinexchange withdrawal was STILL PENDING (this was the withdrawal of the 15% plus 50 bonus). I also noticed I had OVER $1000 IN THE LENDING which was the automatic thing. Remeber this was probably EIGHT HOURS after the coin had already mostly collapsed and nobody had access to their coins as it was all in the lending.  SO AFTER THE SCAMMER DUMPS ALL HIS COIN THROUGH PURE GREED (HE ALREADY HAS THE ICO FUNDS) he tries to blame it all on everyone else! He sends another illiterate email reversing his previous loan. So now he doesn't even have to pay any interest any more! Also the $1000 loan can now only be a $200 loan due to the fall in price if anyone wants to lend the returned balance. Who now is going to lend after a 80% fall? Nobody would want the loan cancelled in these circumstances but he still says this was for our benefit and due to us etc!  FINALLY (FIFTH), the pending withdrawal NOW TOTALLY DISAPPEARS from the transaction list. It isn't on coinexchange either (my 200 pending). The previous BTB loan amount is now in the BTBc balance but he doesn't convert the dollar amount but uses the much lower exchange value from the scammer dumping the coin. He doesn't even return the full $1000 loan value, but just the same amount of BTB coins which are NOW WORTH EIGHTY PERCENT LESS (I can now only loan $200 instead of $1000 so who would want that to be the case and what else can anyone do but sell if the scammer doesn't reinstate the loan from before with the much higher value). A capital release from the loan should have been the exact same dollar value, obviously. Nobody would want it returned if the price was dumped on.  In his email he is trying to say that the loan was returned before the huge dump BUT IT IS A MASSIVE LIE!!! Even many hours after the price collapsed everyone's money was in the lending (so nobody else could have sold any coins). I was checking it myself and didn't understand why the price was so low on coinexchange when everyone's BTB was locked in the lending (mine definitely was many hours after the dump as proven in the discord chat at the time).  So basically, the scammer didn't even want to pay the interest on the loans after selling millions of $ worth of coins in a matter of hours so cancelled the loans many hours AFTER the price went so low. Nobody else dumped, as it was impossible. Also, withdrawals that weren't processed and were pending (to exchanges) totally disappeared at that point too.  He then pretended he sent the email before the dump instead of after he dumped!!",False

Create an internal coin, BitBase Platinum, to be airdropped into everyone's wallet based on  a snapshot on a certain day, say 12/31/17 at 11:59pm.  Give something similar to what Hextracoin did maybe 1 BitBase Platinum coin for every 4 or 5 BTBc that is in your wallet.  The BitBase Platinum coin is worth $20 (Hextracoin Gold's value) or something substantial like that. The airdrop will happen a week after the snapshot.  The BitBase Platinum coin is only for lending and must be used in 15 days.  It is for a short loan like 30-60 days and at a special interest rate.  It would be best to say the rate ahead of time to create the buzz so that everyone would know exactly what is going to happen.  Then the at the end of the 30-60 days, the $ amount of the BitBase Platinum is released to the lending wallet or you could make it role over into a normal loan (that way the $ stays in BitBase for another 120 days or something).  This would immediately increase the value of the BTBc and give a reason for people to hold the BTBc for a couple of months and let BitBase get established.  Also, if you give a better ratio to the BTBc that is in loans at the time(1 Platinum for every 2 or 3 BTBc in loans), then everyone would make loans which gives the BTBc back to BitBase and allows BitBase to sell the coin at a higher price than the loan was made.  This would work and allow BitBase to increase the value of the BTBc and restore the credibility of the platform.  It would also be ok to give me a tip for suggesting it.",False

Dear Users,  Some of you starting to talk negative on social media or forums about us that we are scam, mostly regarding that the free 50 BTBc were removed from accounts that didn't purchased at least 200 worth of Tokens or BTBc from exchanger, the rule for that was since the start and the lending starting plan caused the free BTBc to be removed so people that purchasing low amounts of BTBc can also sell as before they couldn't because they wouldn't have at least 200 bought.  Regarding the tokens release we released 15% of that to your account in form of BTBc, but as a lot of people dumping the coin and causing high downfall in the coin price, we are taking a different approach, starting from tommorow all tokens will be transformed into a lending plan at the current BTBc price calculated and no lower than $1 as that was the final price you bought it for. So higher or not everyone will still make some profit on the long run and i think that is way better then some taking all the credits and some don't.  Wallets should be available soon including the mining one, as currently some of you wanted to send to exchangers directly we added that feature temporarly until we finish the actual wallets.

Two things can be done to resolve this problem, I think:  1) If there is a clear perception that people were entitled to 50BTBs than they should be given them. This deal with unhappy customers who are loudmouthed and can undermine even the best projects. The worst case result is that those shortsighted /short-term profit takers will dump their tokens/coins causing short term losses for those who sell in panicked response. The smart money medium/long term investor will vacuum these cheaper BTBs   [""a fool and his money are quickly parted""]  2) Unlike shares where companies can continue to indefinitely dilute the share price by issuing new shares, cryptocurrencies have more often then not elected to fix forever their total supply. Look at the samples in the table below. Etherium is the only one without a stated fixed supply which should be is very big worry for those who hold Etherium, the potential for massive dilutions is left wide open. The fact that Bitcoin set such a low max supply was one of the key reasons why it was very attractive to smart money and its price is soared much higher. Checkout the https://coinmarketcap.com/ and you will see the direct relationship with those who have supplies in billions and their corresponding very low prices often in $cents.  Keepcool assessment is this: BTB has a max supply of 100,000,000. Dump as much as people want there is only a fixed supply which will be purchased and locked away by smart long term investors inevitably forcing up prices over time through supply shortage.  So Yakov....Give them the 50BTB and let the smart money soak them all up....end of the short term manipulators and stay on your long term plans....for the really cool progress and the PROFITS!!!!

The price will not be less than a $. I'm very dev  Hello Bitbase Valued Member   Your user id username is: 7339333762-8389393-89577634930   Dear Users,  Some of you starting to talk negative on social media or forums about us that we are scam, mostly regarding that the free 50 BTBc were removed from accounts that didn't purchased at least 200 worth of Tokens or BTBc from exchanger, the rule for that was since the start and the lending starting plan caused the free BTBc to be removed so people that purchasing low amounts of BTBc can also sell as before they couldn't because they wouldn't have at least 200 bought.  Regarding the tokens release we released 15% of that to your account in form of BTBc, but as a lot of people dumping the coin and causing high downfall in the coin price, we are taking a different approach, starting from tommorow all tokens will be transformed into a lending plan at the current BTBc price calculated and no lower than $1 as that was the final price you bought it for. So higher or not everyone will still make some profit on the long run and i think that is way better then some taking all the credits and some don't.  Wallets should be available soon including the mining one, as currently some of you wanted to send to exchangers directly we added that feature temporarly until we finish the actual wallets.  We are doing our best but without your support BitBase Coin will never reach it's true potential, so let's work together so everyone can benefit out of it.  Level Referral Bonus From Lending Investments % Matching Bonus From Lending Investments %  1 8% 4% 2 4% 2% 3 2% 1% 4 2% 1% 5 1% 0.5% 6 0.5% 0.25% 7 0.3% 0.15% 8 0.2% 0.1% 9 0.1% 0.05% 10 0.05% 0.025% 11 Infinity 0.01%  And finally just to let you know we have enough funds to pump in alot of money to make btbc value sky rocket high. We are working on mining btbc. We see many try to take advantage on dumping.. Give it some days bitbase will be all in good form.  Best Regards  BitBase.io",False

This is really bad for the project and its credibility. Also the people behind it has not exposed themselves. But even though i trusted this project and bought 92 coins because of the idea.  Dumping is very bad for the project and if the price starts to decline as soon as  it is launched; The project is assumed to have failed and new investors will not bother to even look into the project. I also see the movement of price before researching into the project. So if all the freeloaders have dumped their coins then the price would have probably declined below $1 and the project would have assumed to be failed.  But even though what they did is not good for the project. Their credibility have declined but they have managed to control the price. the price would have declined far below. Also they lowered the circulating supply which will surely raise the price of the coins.

Yakov took the 50 coins from People away that didnt purchase 200 token - and thats 100% right - if not the System would Crash right away.

Regarding the tokens release we released 15% of that to your account in form of BTBc, but as a lot of people dumping the coin and causing high downfall in the coin price, we are taking a different approach, starting from tommorow all tokens will be transformed into a lending plan at the current BTBc price calculated and no lower than $1 as that was the final price you bought it for.

If you do not comply, you will be in trouble ... And let me tell you something, it is good to make complaints to the FTC, they will open a case and  investigate whether or not there really was false advertising, as it is also good to make the complaint to the FBI so they can investigate a possible Ponzi or pyramid scheme ... I want to tell everyone that it is very easy to make a report in cases of fraud, they will investigate and do what they have to do and find those responsible ... It will not be the first time that those who make fraud online go to jail.    And obviously you care about what I say, that's why you are writing in all caps and bold laters.

SECOND - If you came into this ICO thinking your gonna sign up for free and get 50 BTBc, GET OVER IT AND WAKE UP, you have to buy 200 more BTBc to withdraw the rest of your 50, this is a promotion to get idiots like you to sign up and pay up for something you thought was for FREE, nothing in life is free (maybe just ketchup).  THIRD - NOT EVEN REGAL COIN OR WESTERNCOIN has a BTC & a Ethereum inner exchange, yea thats right, Bitbase has two functional INNER Exchanges, and they are listed on coinmarketcap and coinexchange.io, Bitbase is one of the few websites to accomplish all of that coming out of the gate, thats better then REGAL COIN where they lock your account and have a crappy exchange.  FOURTH - Of course Yakov is not going t o release all your coins at once, look what happened when he released just 15%, everyone tried dumping, let the idiots keep dumping and selling, I bought mine at $.30, I will hold and sell mine when BTBc goes over $5.  You are all scared sheep who do not know what investing is about, if you really are scared, sell off your BTB just don't cry and complain when the price goes back up.  FIFTH - People are now selling the BTB, and getting Bitcoin sent to them as we speak, so dont say this is a scam, you are just hating, people are getting PAID AS YOU READ THIS!  SIXTH - Did you check their lending program that is offered now?  It's more similar to Bitconnect and less like a HYIP, so in my opinion they are going with a more realistic lending program that is more stable and which will actually work.  Yakov in my opinion is doing everything he said he did and more!  Everything on the site is working and progressing fine, we are on coinmarketcap and coinexchange, the inner exchanges are WORKING, the Bitcoin payouts are WORKING, just because you can't get your free 50 BTB or just because you can only take 15%, its people Yakov has to put these restrictions in place because you scared sheep will dump the BTB as soon as you get it, you guys dont give a crap about Bitbase but Yakov obviously does, and he's taking care of the investors.  The investors are the people who put REAL money into this ICO, and really care about this company.  So stop talking shit and spreading FUD, just scroll up and everything you've said and complaing about has been said many times before, you know nothing about investing, go sell your BTB at pennies on the dollar, and cry to your Mom when the prices goes back over $5!

Users that received referral commissions during the BTB Mega Sale will only be able to use our old exchanger for the amount received then. The difference can be traded on the actual exchanger normally.  Due to small issues and confusion we are creating a new separate website that will act like a BTBc online wallet similar to blockchain. Here will also be implement the escrow feature of the coin to also be able to use it online too.  The reward plans will also start when ICO ends, and users that want to earn will be able to choose from either % (in $ value) or % (in BTBc value), the lending reward will require users to buy BTBc from the new exchanger and then set the lending rate.  As we promised so far we delivered every word we said so far and we are trying to develop and grow as fast as possible.  We also working on a BTB Token Exchanger where you will be able to sell / buy BTB Tokens from or to other users, as BTB tokens will give you % in BTBc commissions based on the company profits daily for unlimited time, so take advantage now as the ICO will soon come to and end.  As a request from many of you, we added extra security layer on the login page using PIN, and also a bruteforce protection that will request you a Captcha if you fail to enter your details too many times.

Answer the above!. I cannot predict the value of bitbase what it will be but its positive for investors and once the monster is leashed into the market we will see how the value will increase..Bitbase has a purpose its not not just a coin.

I have referred some of my family to the ICO.  My aunt decides to purchase more than 50,000 coins and asks me to help her with the transaction since she is not very computer savvy.  There was an error with one of the big purchases (before anyone asks, I followed directions..sent from her coinbase to my metamask wallet and entered the CORRECT amount to send to the CORRECT address).  The transaction errored out and the page reloaded..I emailed support with all the transaction information and got a response asking me for proof when I already sent it over, I never heard from ""support"" again.  Disappointing experience.  OVer 8 hours later, to my relief, the coins appeared with no proper ""From"" address. Strike 1.  Since I did refer her, I was waiting for my referral bonus to kick in.  I received referral bonuses from her previous two transactions but I am still missing 5,000 coins. This was the address that the coins were sent to. 0xF817FA0c1f386B2F9eFacB9Af32Aba4b892f0D84 I have sent over 4 messages - not one was answered. Strike 2.  While I understand the need to triple check IPs from individuals from gaining referrals, but I'd rather you guys check out who is signing up for it and ask for proof and see if the user can show you IDs if necessary.  I have gotten 3 of my family members to sign up, and we all live together.  My dad wants to invest but now with the delay in support, he no longer wants to because it doesn't seem ""trustworthy""  We did not invest over this much money to gain 50BTB.  Please let me know when someone is going to at least answer one of my messages.  It would be greatly appreciated.",False

What happens to a coin value when its being dumped? why does bitconnect encourage users to keep coins and receive profits every month? did you predict bitcoin will be worth $5800? per coin did you ever predict bitconnect will be worth $197.36 per coin? did you know regal will be worth  $31.20 per coin?  Answer the above!. I cannot predict the value of bitbase what it will be but its positive for investors and once the monster is leashed into the market we will see how the value will increase..Bitbase has a purpose its not not just a coin.   It seems like you want to hit and run on bitbase escrow smart contract technology by dumping coins. A user could make 100s of account and try to cashout instantly but we have something in place and will run a 7 level system check suspended duplicates account matching browser matching ip matching password upto 5 characters  - matching emails similarity and emails that also bounce in our system notify us before hand.

Trading will continue to operate as normal during this period. Once the network is stable and the migration is complete, we will enable deposits and withdrawals.

Your esteemed update seems appropriate and relevant, of course the market need to be leveraged correctly to maintain stable growth for long term operations or one side will be weak. Hence decreasing the demand. I figured that this strategy was enforced to avoid the dumping scheme, given the ability to try and equally control the market fairly for everyone.

Which are omisego, request network. What are the similarities and differencies with this project ? It is not certain that such a project will succeed when there are big projects such as omisego.  Such projects have begun to attract a lot of attention. With these scam projects started to come. I do not think it's realistic. People who are trying to take advantage of the people. it's hard for them to struggle with their strong opponents. I don't know what bring inside into their minds why they have to stole others work and use it on unacceptable deeds. Does money really bring the devil out of them?  When did bitbase steal..Bitbase still in prelaunch..3 weeks down the line will ask who stealing? bitbase is here to stay :-)  A good example is regalcoin :-) did any1 expect it to grow so fast? We see many users here who say shit bla dump ect scam coin as no white paper no team :-) in coin industry one need to know a coin is just a coin somtimes with a reason behind it a concept..No coin can replace bitcoin, Ether unique cin ripple again has another good concept followed by many. Know one knows the potential of a coin until its launched. Its a shame bitbase is has good concept and only time will tell on official launch what happens. Look at the concept not me. Its not my loss its a win win situation example regalcoin from nowhere to somwhere and next on the list will be bitbase.

If you are expecting a message from a more veteran member, then this is an imposter !!! Hi  I am one  person behind this project! you should be happy now. My automated system will help other admin to avoid issues with smart contracts and API verifications. We all can work in this together and release my code after launch for further dev on github. Your a good detective and somtimes we have to understand at time there are good projects with somthing new to the industry and cannot expose who is behind certain projects.  I will simply launch my code on Github soon and let others take it and evolve it :-) this for me will be a success. No1 needs to rely on 3rd party payment providers..Bitbase system is flawless with no bugs no issues and with 1 click of a button any top 100 coin nodes can auto install and start accepting payments instantly with IPN/API be your very own bank. I am also preparing somthing even more interesting which will even be mentioned soon  Lets all get together and make this happen not for me atleast for others. I know alot of exchangers and wallet sites will hate me to bits for this but this is life Gleb why trust other when you can have your very own coins on you system in your control without worrying that one will loose all there coins, I want to make it alot more easy for other merchnats and site owners.

One dont need a team to run such a site like bitbase - design - bakend scripting - server managment - marketing - my very own blockchain escrow based - nodes - BTB coin dev - whitepaper - Support service & building my very on btc and eth nodes with my very own API  / IPN automatic payment system and not relying on other 3rd party payment providers like blockchanin and coinpayments. I am willing to share my code with other merchants to accept BTC - ETH and other alt coins with 1 click and start receieving instant payments. You should see what i built with noones help.  Look at those token sale contracts for example poor etherscan nodes almost manual work for admins and i am 100% certain alot of coins disappear and at most times cannot be retrieved read below    Activity: 154   View Profile     ETH not received from poloniex June 22, 2017, 08:42:46 AM  #1 My eth transaction shows complete along with tx id on poloniex , but cant see anything from past 24 hours on the blockchain.  Support reply :  I am sorry to inform the ETH network is under heavy stress at the moment and some withdrawals are not being broadcast correctly.  Rest assured we will rebroadcast your withdrawal as soon as possible, thank you for your patience and I am sorry for the inconvenience.  Best regards,  Adebajo Poloniex Support  Dont merchants like game sites / ico / investment sites  need a system based like mine independed and no need for API bulls*** verification waiting for approval and getting declined. My system will help avoid  all this  smart contracts / blockchain API verification / Coinpayments hold other admin money. I can help the ICO industry and games / casino / investing sites in many ways.. First i need to prove that  bitbase members make money with ease with bitbase very own exchangers followed by others and we all take it from there.",False

BitBase's site was created earlier this month, but the profiles on the dating site were embedded as early as July, evident in the above.  Also, BitBase's profiles consisted mostly of head shoots, so how did the ransom dude gain access to the entire pic so that he can time travel and post the fake profiles on the dating site?  https://icobench.com/ico/bitbase/team   http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:eS3MFsRuwbAJ:www.pof.com/viewprofile.aspx%3Fprofile_id%3D150128420+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us   Quote About Rudy Geetings,  My name is Rudy . I am a professional male that is looking for freindship and long term companiship. I work for a healthcare organziation managing online learning and development for employees. I have less than one year of graduate school left before I get my masters degree.  I enjoy movies, ashtanga yoga, strength training, art galleries, cooking and comedy shows. I am surrounded by the beautiful mountains of Western North Carolina so I try to get out and hike/kayak when I can.  Disclaimer I am not into guys who are self-absorbed, show little empathy, do not listen and who do not show compassion and/or understanding. Willing to admit mistakes, be humble and learn from our experiences is what makes us a better person. I've made mistakes and I tend to think I've grown and learned from mine.  Having clear transparency and communication (not one sided communication), is key to a healthy relationship .  Hopefully I will find someone that I can really connect for the long run.  If you interested then let's talk. I'd like to possibly get to know you. Let's all be kind to each other. We all have one life to live so let's seize the day for the better.  Cheers  Yakov wants you to believe that some ransom dude uploaded Francisco Ignacio's fake bio on a dating prior to July 2017, because BitBase, a new entity formed this month, opted not to pay some ransom. Further, Fransisco is really named Rudy who's not a Senior Crypto Advisor but who works for a healthcare organization managing online learning and development for employees, with less than one year of graduate school left before getting his masters degree.

I am a professional male that is looking for freindship and long term companiship. I work for a healthcare organziation managing online learning and development for employees. I have less than one year of graduate school left before I get my masters degree.  I enjoy movies, ashtanga yoga, strength training, art galleries, cooking and comedy shows. I am surrounded by the beautiful mountains of Western North Carolina so I try to get out and hike/kayak when I can.  Disclaimer I am not into guys who are self-absorbed, show little empathy, do not listen and who do not show compassion and/or understanding. Willing to admit mistakes, be humble and learn from our experiences is what makes us a better person. I've made mistakes and I tend to think I've grown and learned from mine.  Having clear transparency and communication (not one sided communication), is key to a healthy relationship .  Hopefully I will find someone that I can really connect for the long run.  If you interested then let's talk. I'd like to possibly get to know you. Let's all be kind to each other. We all have one life to live so let's seize the day for the better.  Cheers  Yakov wants you to believe that some ransom dude uploaded Francisco Ignacio's fake bio on a dating prior to July 2017, because BitBase, a new entity formed this month, opted not to pay some ransom. Further, Fransisco is really named Rudy who's not a Senior Crypto Advisor but who works for a healthcare organization managing online learning and development for employees, with less than one year of graduate school left before getting his masters degree.

Besides, the more you attack the project the more you help the project more popular and become the most talk about.     PS : What will happen next to this?

This could be useful in many ways, along with that companies like www.escrow.com , www.ebay.com , www.paypal.com and many more can implement it, Why should these companies integrate BITBASE, BITBASE coin could easily be integrated with their buyer/seller protection feature.   BITBASE is not just a coin it’s an advancement to the blockchain technology as a whole it doesn't just end there. BITBASE also offers a unique VISA card that allows users to shop online with ease and no hassle.   Why we invented BITBASE, in the Crypto industry there are many scammers about with the current crypto technology, due to that the crypto technology is rising very slowly with BITBASE technology in place the calculations show that the crypto technology market will attract more people everyday, since people will not fear losing their coins. BITBASE team, you will find all the information about the BITBASE team below on this WHITE PAPER and also on the homepage of www.btibase.io BITBASE the future of cryptocurrency. Now let's see some advantages of BITBASE     I. You can buy / sell with a piece of mind, you won't lose clients because they won't have to worry about being scammed.    II. 5x faster than smart contacting.    III. Simple and easy to use system with detailed explanation to accept the coin with the current payment gateway you are already using.    1)Traditional concept   Traditionally, Person A sends the funds to Person B, and in turn Person B sends item to Person A to complete the trade. In a smart contract; there is an additional level of protection, unfortunately it protects the buyer only. When conducting a trade with a smart contract, Person A sends coins via Escrow feature (smart contract) where both parties must agree to release the coins to complete the transaction. However if the buyer does not agree, the funds or coins are returned to the buyer after a time limit. There is a huge flaw in today’s blockchain smart contracts, because they only protect the buyers.     In fact today’s smart contracts may very well promote fraud on the part of the buyers. If a seller has shipped a product or item, and the smart contract keeps the coins held in escrow until both parties agree to release them, but what if the buyer decides not to release or confirm the transaction, despite the fact that they received the goods? Any buyer can easily take advantage of this huge flaw in the so called smart contracts. If confirmation is not received by both sides, the coins are eventually returned to the buyer, after a predetermined time limit. In this case the seller losses the product and eventually will be out of business. We can clearly see that today’s blockchain smart contracts are in fact far from being smart.    2) Our Difference. The Concept:   In our system, let's assume: we have a group chat. Person A and Person B are trading. Both ask Person C to send them an escrow identifier, Person C generates one (through his wallet) and pastes it in the chat, Person C also gets a unique hash password to control the outcome of the transaction. Once both parties are happy, Person C releases the money. If either one of the parties is not happy, then the transaction is held in escrow during the dispute process, until such time that a resolution has been determined. E.G: like Paypal dispute & resolution center. Person A binds the transaction (coin-cli generate payment [amount] [recipient’s address] [escrow ID]) to the escrow identifier and gives them the payment hash which can be seen at the blockchain explorer. Person B sends the item to Person A.     3) Case: Both parties are happy   Both parties ask the escrow to release the funds. Escrow executes the command: coin-cli release funds [escrow ID] [escrow PASSWORD]    4) Case: Parties are not happy   In case of dispute, escrow decides in favor of Person A, then he/she can execute coin-cli return funds [escrow ID] [escrow PASSWORD], otherwise if Escrow sides with Person B, then coin-cli release funds [escrow ID] [escrow PASSWORD]     5) Normal Send/Receive Transactions:   If user wants to send a transaction as a normal payment, user can choose to do so, and it will just be broadcasted to the network just like bitcoin, but if they want to send via escrow the concept above should take place this can be done with the existing bitcoin code. You can find several links and Bitcoin commands at the bottom of this page that will make more sense to developers.    6) Case Studies:   A programmatically API will help you extend the functionalities of the BITBASE coin! 1. For companies like Escrow.com and PayPal, they can act as the direct escrow with the assistance of our programmable node. They will be able to generate escrow ID, process transactions, release funds all programmatically. This could integrate well with their buyer/seller protection feature.    2. Similarly for companies like eBay, Amazon, our smart contract BITBASE technology will allow any company, business or online website to use the node to generate escrow requests on the go. They can decide to release the funds after X days after buyer expresses their satisfaction. They could relatively depend upon the seller's reputation. Good reputation, less time to release funds.  ============  We are hiring developers for the bitbase escrow technology, Use the contact form here to apply https://bitbase.io/contact-us  https://bitbase.io",False
