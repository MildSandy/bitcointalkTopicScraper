Many firms would immediately drastically reduce the number of accountants employed in reconciliation departments. Auditing time required will be reduced drastically due to the fact that audit tests performed would no longer need to check the validity of the triple entry transactions. These are being confirmed by the other company on the opposing spectrum, which is an independent 3rd party. Auditors will start placing reliance on Triple Entries as they are cemented in the Blockchain. Throughout the consultation stage, AB encountered many businesses explaining how rogue employees within their organisation used creative accounting and manipulation of data to defraud their employer. This in the past has been as easy as changing the supplier invoice bank details in order to channel the funds their way. Currently to deter this type of fraud and other fraud risks, companies undertake to implement flimsy, costly and time consuming systems of internal control, including multiple checking and re-checking. AB’s Fingertips Triple Entry Suite will serve as a shield against fraud as invoice details as well as the suppliers’ bank details as well as all invoice data would be recorded in the Blockchain and can never be manipulated.

Invoice factoring (the kind offerred by paypie) also stands to gain from this type of connections between businesses that do not necessarily use the same accounting software.

Similarly, all accounting data is based on ledgers. At accounting blockchain, we will be using Blockchain technology in order to link business accounting together and drive away inefficiencies which currently clutter the system.  Quote Blockchain has the potential to enhance the accounting profession by reducing the costs of maintaining and reconciling ledgers, and providing absolute certainty over the ownership and history of assets. Blockchain could help accountants gain clarity over the available resources and obligations of their organisations, and also free up resources to concentrate on planning and valuation, rather than recordkeeping.  Blockchain is a replacement for bookkeeping and reconciliation work. This could threaten the work of accountants in those areas, while adding strength to those focused on providing value elsewhere.- ICAEW  Here's the direct link to the ICAEW article written independently from Accounting Blockchain",False

THE ACCOUNTING BLOCKCHAIN  The Problem Accounting data is very sensitive and needs to be stored in a secure, trustworthy place. More so when this data involves multiple parties, the data needs to be stored in a secure place that is trusted by all parties. Mutability, malicious attacks, transactions costs, scams, lack of assurance of authenticity have all been barriers in providing a trusted common ground to store B2B entries that can be trusted by all parties. Thus the status quo prevails, and companies remain operating in relative isolation accounting-wise spending billions in reconciliation costs.  The Solution A trusted, secure common ground where to store triple entry information is the key to connecting businesses though triple entries. The Accounting Blockchain - a tailor made blockchain infrastructure built specifically for accounting and for triple entries. A platform available for everyone to be able to use without having to pay hefty subscription fees to any particular software company. A distributed, trustworthy, fast, secure common ground where businesses feel confident to connect with. This is only possible with the advancements in Blockchain technology.  2. AB FINGERTIPS SUITE  The Problem Reconciliation of transactions between companies is a multibillion dollar problem. A small to medium sized company has hundreds/thousands of transactions between its suppliers and its customers, let alone large corporations. Each company must reconcile each and every transaction and the balances due have to be agreed upon. For a small company it’s a nuisance and a waste of valuable time, for a medium sized enterprise its about employing a few accountants for reconciliations with costs running into hundreds of thousands, and for a large corporation it’s about having huge reconciliation departments with hundreds of employees and millions in expenses.  The Solution Introducing a viable way to have triple entries that automatically connect businesses in their transactions. An accounting software platform built around the triple entry concept. A user friendly, really easy to use accounting platform that drastically reduces the costs of reconciliations by using the power and trustworthiness of blockchain to store triple entries. A catalyst in connecting businesses together and in incorporating the much needed blockchain technology into the accounting world.[/color]   AB TAXAVANCE  The Problem Being proactive in tax decisions when making crypto investments is of the utmost importance to any sensible investor. Regulation and enforcement in this sector is gathering pace. Investments and trades are global and subject to a myriad of tax frameworks globally. The tricky part in this is finding all the information needed in one place to make wise decisions fast. Regulations are changing quickly, and it is imperative to have the correct knowledge while and after doing trades. Preparing tax reports and gathering all the information from exchanges is time consuming and very expensive when done manually by a tax accountant.  The Solution A really easy to use platform that keeps track of your trades and their tax implications. A platform with tax parameters fed by a global network of tax experts that is able to work out in real time the tax exposure of your crypto trades and investments. A global network of tax experts and collaborators at your fingertips. Pre-trading information including trade simulations to make proactive decisions. Keeping record of your trades and their current tax exposure should you buy more, hold, or sell. Issuing end-term tax reports of your trades and investments. AI assisted report input that may read reports from exchanges and setting up a common protocol to interface with exchanges. A true global 247 tax assistant.",False

At large companies, this process takes anywhere from a couple of business days to a week or longer. - Eric Rosenberg  The Solution and what 3rd parties have to say to accounting records kept on blockchain technology  The blockchain technology has the potential to shapeshift the nature of today's accounting. It may constitute a way to vastly automate accounting processes in compliance with the regulatory requirements.- Deloitte Direct Link to Deloitte Article   Blockchain has the potential to enhance the accounting profession by reducing the costs of maintaining and reconciling ledgers, and providing absolute certainty over the ownership and history of assets. Blockchain could help accountants gain clarity over the available resources and obligations of their organisations, and also free up resources to concentrate on planning and valuation, rather than recordkeeping.  Blockchain is a replacement for bookkeeping and reconciliation work. This could threaten the work of accountants in those areas, while adding strength to those focused on providing value elsewhere.- ICAEW Direct link to ICAEW   With the distributed Blockchain ledger, there is no need for transactions to sit in limbo. There is no need for a delay in processing while systems catch up and run overnight processes. In a world of instant transactions, many month end close processes will be cut down or eliminated completely. Thanks to to speed transactions will be completed, accountants will spend a lot less time worrying about ensuing transactions are reported in the correct month, as they will already be reported when the month closes. And, once transactions are completed, they are locked in and recorded forever. There is no going back to tinker or adjust past transactions in a blockchain - Eric Rosenberg. Eric Rosenberg   Of all recent innovations that have or will profoundly change the world as we know it, one will be more disruptive than all others: the Blockchain. With the potential to redefine the economic fabric of contemporary society, the Blockchain is an innovation that no business executive can afford to ignore. - Steve Tendon Steve Tendon   And everyone will be wondering, why didn’t I see that coming? I wish I got in back then when everyone was missing the forest for the trees.  Imagine buying shares in the United States when the first settlers got here and swindled the Native Americans out of Manhattan.  What would those shares be worth today? Why Everyone Missed the Most Important Invention in the Last 500 Years  3 Products requiring AB Tokens = 3 times the demand for AB Tokens  1. The Accounting Blockchain (TAB) 2. AB Fingertips Suite 3. AB Taxavance  1. The Accounting Blockchain (TAB)  https://i.imgur.com/7noGnpgl.jpg  Market Size:  - Trillions of B2B and B2C of global transactions yearly. Multiplied by 2, as most of these are currently duplicated due to isolated accounting systems — TAB is about to solve this.  Market Penetration:  - Gradual at first due to cultural shift in the way things are done. Exponential increase as more people connect as the solution provides savings for all parties involved.  - Widespread token offering is part of the strategy to catalyze and incentivize the use of the blockchain due to significantly reduced price of tokens.  - The widespread adoption of TAB is aided by first mover advantage as it is essentially the first to provide a trusted common ground whereby all parties are saving money by using it.  - APIs aided by artificial intelligence that connect the different existing accounting packages seamlessly to TAB making life easy for both the existing accounting software firms and businesses, thus making TAB the place to go to connect to the future rather than to remain in isolation.  https://i.imgur.com/6YWnoA5.png  Strengths and Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats:  - A one-time opportunity provided by a widespread token offering which will propel the adoption and use of TAB. The dire need for real world blockchain accounting connection and the absence of a trusted common ground between accounting software platforms is a gap in the market that TAB fills in perfectly.  - TAB is not competing with competitors but rather connecting them and saving them money, providing a fast and easy way into blockchain adoption.  - Threats include the transitory period whereby businesses need to learn about the advantages that blockchain accounting offers, advocating the need for a global educational campaign. AB has a clear business plan that makes this period as short as possible and includes the widespread discounted token offering as part of this strategy and the introduction of two other platforms that boost the adoption and demand for the AB token during this period.  - Once TAB goes through the early adoption phase and into the following stages of general adoption by medium sized businesses and large corporations, the demand and load on TAB is expected to increase exponentially in the same pattern of adoption of social media due to intrinsic nature of connecting businesses.  - How will TAB be able to handle such growth? How scalable is it? And the answer to this intrinsic in the very way TAB is designed with a ground-breaking Hyperledger fabric solution that enables TAB to scale up unlimitedly and handle the growth needed for the trillions of transactions that link the global supply chain.  Unique Proposition at the right timing, and barriers to entry  - The blockchain being developed by Accounting Blockchain will be the first ever blockchain dedicated for triple entry accounting and to solve this multibillion-dollar problem.  - Being the early introducers in this class is a unique advantage. Why? Businesses would only join a blockchain if they will be able to be connected with their customers and suppliers. Any other blockchain which will come after Accounting Blockchain will need to convince businesses to get disconnected from a global network and join a network with limited connections. Which business would decide to join a different blockchain only to be disconnected and lose all the benefits of being connected in The Accounting Blockchain?  Studies show that adoption of such a game changing technology follows an exponential pattern. This means that the use and demand of TAB may be, perhaps in an over simplistic manner, be classified into three stages:  1. Early adoption  2. Market penetration  3. Widespread adoption  AB have decided to base projections on conservative values based on small fractions of the market size of global B2B and B2C transactions (less than 1%), especially for the first few years, as an educational global marketing campaign will kick in to show traditional and ongoing businesses the advantages TAB will provide when it is integrated into their accounting systems. Having said this, once the benefits are known to a user and starts saving his and his supplier’s money, the growth of the use of TAB would take an exponential form.  https://i.imgur.com/tACrViTl.jpg  2. AB Fingertips Suite  https://i.imgur.com/GmDEXmAl.jpg  Market Size:  - Millions of businesses globally are looking or will be looking for a solution to integrate their current business operations to blockchain and be able to integrate cryptocurrency in their day to day operations, benefit from the use of blockchain smart contracts, and be able to record their sensitive data into the security and immutability of blockchain. Businesses are starting and will increasingly look to turn their accounting system from an isolated record keeping software to a platform that handles their smart contracts, invoices, triple entry accounting, and payments in real time. This is the future of accounting and AB Fingertips Suite is ushering in just that.  Market Penetration:  - The gap in the market for a platform that integrates blockchain advantages into day to day running of business provides AB Fingertips Suite a unique opportunity.  - AB Fingertips Suite has the major advantage of having its architecture built with blockchain accounting in mind and is not like any other existing accounting software that has to adapt to blockchain through changes in the software but will never be intrinsically a blockchain focused software.  Strengths and Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats:  - AB Fingertips Suite is uniquely positioned to provide a simple and easy access to the much needed blockchain advantages to everyday businesses. It is being built around blockchain and triple entry accounting, not adapting to it.  https://i.imgur.com/ikZfHnTl.jpg  - The adoption of blockchain accounting into everyday business is still in its early stages. Some have argued in AB focus groups that introduction of such a software is a bit to early. However, AB believes that being at a very early stage in the market gives AB Fingertips Suite the opportunity to grow with the market and be right there when wide spread adoption of blockchain in accounting takes place.  Token Demand:  - Considering we are still in the early adoption phase of blockchain into traditional businesses, AB has forecast a conservative but steady growth for 2019–2021 and a faster market penetration for the years after, which is forecasted to see a widespread adoption of blockchain accounting.  https://i.imgur.com/yuotr9Fl.jpg  3. AB Taxavance  https://i.imgur.com/UwiLiinl.jpg  Market Size:  - Number of crypto traders who have active wallets are growing exponentially. From 2013 to 2017 the number of active wallets has grown from 1.6m to 8.7m users!*. The rate of growth of the market is bigger every year. At the same time, regulations and enforcement on the taxation implications of using cryptocurrency pose a major headache to the cryptocurrency wallet users and traders. The large number of trades and exchanges involved makes the task of giving an accountant the job of filing taxes on crypto tedious and thus very expensive.  *Market data from: Hileman, G. and Rauchs, M. (2017). University of Cambridge. 2017 Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study. SSRN Electronic Journal.  https://i.imgur.com/WNVHgBtl.jpg  Market Penetration:  - A 1% market penetration is already 87,000 customers (2017 data) and AB envisages conservatively a growth of market share from 0.5% to 6% from late 2018 to 2022. Active wallets are mostly in North America and Europe, with a 30% and 31% share of the total market respectively, with Asia-Pacific trailing at 3rd place with a 20% market share. Latin America and Africa — Middle East have 13% and 6% market share respectively.  - Accounting Blockchain's strategy will be to start from Europe and expand to the rest of the world in stages. Tax accountants to do the job of compiling such transactions can prove to be super expensive, and online platforms charge from 49 USD to over 1,000 USD yearly depending on number of transactions. AB token holders will gain a well-discounted access to such service which will be possible for AB to deliver due to the large community of users gained by the initial token offering process.  Strengths and Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats:  - Global system, through a growing network. This is necessary due to the fast-changing regulations globally in the sector which is a major challenge for crypto traders worldwide.  - Again, some might argue introduction of this service might be too early, but feedback from the community shows that such a service is needed now more than ever, and in the mid to long term future the use of AB Taxavance will be a life saver and a way out from the super expensive accountant and tax advisor bills.  Token Demand  - AB Taxavance has the advantage of being one of the first introducers of such a complete global crypto taxation service, and the timing of its introduction is spot on due to increasing regulation in the cryptocurrency world. Basically, any serious user of crypto currency needs such a service which means that the demand grows as the widespread adoption of crypto assets grows. AB is being conservative in forecasting market share in this sector, even though these forecasts verge on being too conservative, this still generates a great demand for AB Token.  https://i.imgur.com/eliIdVYl.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/GJtrkDDl.jpg  Total Token Demand and Supply for AB Tokens  Due to the limited supply of AB Tokens, the value of AB Tokens will be determined by supply and demand forces.  AB Tokenomics have been designed in collaboration with E&S, a renowned accounting firm specialising in ICOs and tokenomics with the aim of creating a self sustainable efficient token ecosystem that gives the best value to the initial token offering contributors. This goes in line with our policy of having the AB Token spread as much as possible in the initial token offering in order to kick-start the platforms and place AB as a leader within this sector.  Securing AB Tokens during ICO stage puts the token holder in a unique position to be the first to hold tokens in the future of Accounting and to benefit from the potential that AB Tokens provides.  The tokenomics in place mean that when the demand for AB Tokens is bigger than the supply, the value increases. The bigger the distance between the demand and the supply, the bigger the movement in the value of AB Tokens.  With 3 separate demands for AB Token from different types of users rather than relying on the success of just one product, the value of AB Token can move at a faster rate.  https://i.imgur.com/juHRVUvl.jpg  TokenEco System Flow  Decentralised blockchain capable of securely and privately storing accounting transactions applicable to all businesses, irrespective of their size or location and linking business accounting in one common trusted blockchain.  https://i.imgur.com/IQJWHwRl.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/t04ZJM4l.jpg  Token Sale - Emissions and Distributions Token Name: AB Token Token Ticker: TAB Token Token Standard: ERC20 Exchange Rate: 1 AB Token = $0.01 at the end of the ICO Total number of Tokens: 22bn Soft Cap: $4m Hard Cap: $64.4m Founder Vesting: Vesting ensures a long-term commitment from the founders towards the success of the project.

Businesses who start using blockchain technology in their accounting send the message that they want to be as transparent as possible in order to boost investor confidence. Additional to that, businesses would also benefit from the following: -  1. They would drastically reduce their accountancy fees due to the fact that a large proportion of their accounting records would be automated and recorded on blockchain;  2. Save on audit fees. Auditors spend most of their time obtaining 3rd party supporting evidence to verify the transactions recorded by businesses. With blockchain technology, they will have smart contracts immediately available which come from the 3rd parties and would be able to verify the data immediately;  3. For large businesses, they can easily save money as they would no longer require to employ such a large accounting division since the work is automated;  4. Fraud and creative accounting as was with Enron would become a thing of the past as fraud would be much more difficult;  5. Taxation authorities would know which businesses to trust, those that keep their records on the blockchain as there won't be room for manipulation of records;  6. Small businesses would save their time. Rather than having to record their transactions, the majority would be automated and they would be able to focus more on their business and on their family.
