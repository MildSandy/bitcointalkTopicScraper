It provides its users with complete anonymity and privacy and protects chats and coin transfers from interception ‚Äì all this is no idle boast. The development team regularly studies the flaws of popular messengers and strives to exclude them from ADAMANT.  This very article is a summary of hard work and its results, so be all eyes and ears!  Anonymity  The messenger requires neither phone numbers nor first or last names. It does not even register a user under a specific nickname. As soon as an account is created, users will get a unique passphrase and an account‚Äôs ID number. This data is more than enough to start chatting and make transactions. Indeed, such a registration process is more convenient than the regular ones ‚Äì it is quick, as it does not require any verifications or specific information about users.  What‚Äôs more, ADAMANT will never reveal a user‚Äôs IP address because all messages are a part of the blockchain system. This works the same for Tor Browser, for instance.  Correspondence security  Only a sender and a recipient can see the chats‚Äô content and this is a 100% guaranty, which ADAMANT is happy to provide. To that end, several features make this possible.  Blockchain is on guard  In fact, all the messages sent and received via ADAMANT are recognized as transactions, which are made and stored in the messenger‚Äôs decentralized registry. The blockchain system protects the content, too. Indeed, this kind of storage is safer than any other, as it is impossible to break into the blockchain‚Äôs repository and retrieve information from a decentralized server.  No one can edit or delete messages and their content. Indeed, data stored in the blockchain system is unchangeable, so no third parties can ascribe anything to users.  E2EE  Now, blockchain enthusiasts may object saying that all the blockchain data is ¬´transparent¬ª so that everyone can get access to it. However, ADAMANT uses E2EE (End-to-End encryption) that is based on two keys: public and private. To keep it short, encryption requires a sender‚Äôs private key and a recipient‚Äôs public key. Consequently, a message is encrypted on a sender‚Äôs device and then is  decrypted on a recipient‚Äôs device. Besides, a private key is never transferred into the network. If you want to learn more on the matter, have a look at this article.  Privacy as a native feature  ADAMANT accounts cannot be influenced by anyone externally. Indeed, even developers cannot ban or block the messenger‚Äôs users and delete their messages. There are neither administrators nor moderators so that each person in the messenger‚Äôs system is equal to another.  Corporations and governments do not sponsor ADAMANT. As a matter of fact, node holders support its system and receive the project‚Äôs tokens in exchange for their aid. Therefore, the app does not need to sell out its users' data to survive.  New functions ‚Äî more safety  Back in February, the development team updated ADAMANT Blockchain Explorer that is a web service for researching the blockchain system. The latest update allows hiding both transactions and their fees. To that end, no third parties can determine who and when is in correspondence and the messages‚Äô content is safe, too. However, these transactions and their metadata can still be compromised with the aid of API.  Mixer is another innovation made by the ADAMANT team. This technology covers up all the tracks and traces of any transaction, which makes it impossible to detect the chatters. Mixer distributes transactions between several wallets and sends tokens at different times, piece by piece. Senders can use public Mixer or set one on their own.  The source code of ADAMANT is fully public and this is a great opportunity to make sure that all of the aforesaid is completely true. Furthermore, it helps the ADAMANT team to work better as any enthusiast or developer can make their suggestions on the messenger‚Äôs performance and try finding possible flaws.",False

If you have heard of that consensus before but thought it was complicated, this article can make it clear for you.    Forging: what to do?  1. Install an ADAMANT node (cloud service, 5$ per month), 2. Register a delegate (3000 ADM fee), 3. Support the delegate (200 000 ADM fee).  Top 101  Fair dPoS has a delegate ranking system, which depends on Vote Weight and Productivity. Only the first 101 delegates can forge and get a reward for supporting the network. Those delegates below the line cannot forge, even if their nodes function nonstop. The Vote Weight equals the sum of ADM in the voters‚Äô wallets.    Getting on the 101 list  1. Maintain your node‚Äôs activity 24/7, 2. Get other users‚Äô votes (they should have a sufficient amount of ADM).  If your node is down for half an hour or longer, you will not be on the list anymore. Additionally, you can lose your rank, if there are delegates with the greater Vote Weight.  Winning votes  Unfortunately, people do not have much motivation to vote for delegates right now. They do not get any reward for voting unless they came to terms with a delegate. However, it is still highly profitable to join a pool, as it distributes all the earnings automatically.  Consequently, many delegates vote for themselves (if they have 200 000 ADM). As the participants exploit ADM volatility and thus, make a solid profit, this support fee is constantly growing.  If you do not have that much ADM, do not worry. You can launch your own pool and invite participants at any time. Doing so will provide you with only a part of the earnings. Nevertheless, you will need just 3000 ADM to register a delegate. Technically, pools and delegates are the same things. If you want to learn more, have a look at this article.    Giving votes  If you want to vote for a pool or your delegate, open ADAMANT PWA. Go the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù section and find the ‚ÄúVote for delegate‚Äù option. After that, you will have to look for a delegate or a pool in the list, tick the checkbox and push the ‚ÄúVote‚Äù button. Mind that voting costs 50 ADM.  Consequently, you can convert ADM to fiat currency. Please mind that as soon as you run out of tokens, you will not get profit anymore.    Voting for more than just one pool or delegate will result in getting only a half of the potential profit, as your votes are distributed equally between everyone you give votes for. Consequently, joining two pools at once will not double your income.  Downvoting: pros and cons  Downvoting costs 50 ADM, too. This is a specific feature of the blockchain system: both of the actions are equal to it. Indeed, if you give a vote mistakenly or decide to leave a pool, you may want to take back your vote.  However, there is a way to save these tokens. You can move your ADM to a new wallet and use it to downvote.  Forging pool: your bread and butter  Each payment schedule is unique. You can always check yours on a pool‚Äôs page. Moreover, we post an up-to-date pool catalog via ADAMANT social media every month.  Presently, the majority of payments and payroll management are accounted via a custom ADAMANT Tech Labs LP software. This software makes a transaction automatically, as soon as the minimum amount of earnings is gained. You can see this sum on a pool‚Äôs page. Additionally, a table below the pool‚Äôs page contains information on your deposit.",False

The development team employed storing and sending functions, which made interactions with Dogecoin possible. From now on, iOS users can join in the DOGE community due to recent ADAMANT updates.  Dogecoin came to the peak and made a handsome fortune worth $330 million in 2019. Its formula of success consists of various advantages such as low-cost transactions, lucrative emission, and great mining opportunities. At this very moment, $119 trillion are circulating in both the DOGE system and global net. Though contemplated as a Litecoin fork, Dogecoin made its own name thanks to efficient marketing and great functionality. Do not let the Internet meme dog confuse you; if anything, it is much more than just a cute puppy. DOGE provides people with a unique charity tool and has already built a tight-knit community. There are many people who support DOGE and ADAMANT is happy to contribute to this project, too. ADAMANT Messenger 1.5 for iOS allows sending and storing Dogecoin as well as tracking its balance in the ‚ÄúAcountt‚Äù section. What‚Äôs more, iOS users can now check on their transaction history regularly.   Dogecoin is the fourth cryptocurrency that was integrated into the ADAMANT iOS version. Speaking of, the first three currencies that became available for Apple users are ADM (the project‚Äôs token), ETH (Ethereum) and LSK (Lisk). At the moment, PWA ADAMANT represents six tokens. ADAMANT‚Äôs priorities are data safety and anonymity. To that end, the ADAMANT team employed DOGE support with these concepts in mind. An access key is not transferred over the network so that a wallet holder has total control over their account.",False

Therefore the first ADM forging pool happened to be an unofficial one, created by messenger users at the end of last year. The adm_official_pool appeared in a few weeks later. While more and more people are taking interest in the project, let us recap how it all began.  The cost of creating a delegate in the ADAMANT ecosystem is 3000 ADM, but it is also necessary to pay a sufficient number of votes for it: to earn income from forging the delegate must not fall below 101 first positions in the overall rating. Currently the ‚Äústarting capital‚Äù is about 5000 ADM.  The first pool was founded by two enthusiasts who had enough tokens for the delegate creation but did not have enough votes. They decided to team up with other ADM owners in order to earn money by forging.  Having received the project developers‚Äô consent, the activists started their Telegram chat ADAMANT FORGING (https://t.me/adamant_forging). There they were discussing forging issues and gathering new people. The price for delegate creation was paid by the two founders themselves: this increased the trust of other participants. That way the risk of joining the pool was minimal because the participants gave only their own votes. At first only people with small amounts of ADM were coming (mind that the total number of tokens amongst all voters affects the forging efficiency). Then larger capitals appeared and the pool was complete in just two days.  Note that there are no technical restrictions on the number of participants, and we welcome everyone to the official pool. However, the founders of the first community decided to close the pool on a certain number of participants for ease of management.  ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt even have enough time to find a hosting,‚Äù recalls Stas Kuznetsov, one of the enthusiasts. ‚ÄúWe thought we had a week so it was necessary to speed up and find it as soon as possible‚Äù.  Now several ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù ADAMANT pools are up paying their members in manual or automatic mode. And there is the official pool which automatically distributes the reward every 10 days.  Want to found your own pool? This is easy to do with a free reward calculation program from ADAMANT Tech Labs LP! You can ask questions to the developers in the comments section there.",False

Notably, this software reduces the pool‚Äôs holder involvement and makes the process of registration of a new group delegate much easier.  Moreover, we developed a friendly interface that collects and displays pools‚Äô statistics. ‚ÄúPay in Coins‚Äù and ‚ÄúDutch Pool‚Äù, our partners, have already tested this brand new software, launched their forging pools and web pages to display statistics:  http://142.93.36.183:36668 and http://adamant_dutchpool.thamar.net:36668. Comparing to the ADAMANT official forging pool, these two distribute tokens between the voters more frequently. Moreover, their rate of interest differs from the official pool. That is to say, supporting the ‚ÄúDutch Pool‚Äù delegate costs about 10% of total ADM income. If you wish to support the ‚ÄúPay in Coins‚Äù delegate, you will have to give 15% of earned ADM (payincoins_admpool). To give an illustration, the official ADAMANT delegate requires about 20% of forged tokens (adm_official_pool). Consequently, we may say that this is a good example of the decentralized system, which encourages competition and functions for the sake of a more convenient and secure environment. Due to initiative ground support, we welcome a public range of influence that functions within the Fair dPoS consensus algorithm.  In conclusion, we must point out that this phenomenon prevents network monopolization and encourages the crypto community to express their opinions effectively and share the experience.",False

Check out our pool dashboard (made by the amazing Adamant team!) @ http://adamant_dutchpool.thamar.net (yes, now without the :36668!)  Why you should vote Dutch_pool?  From an investor perspective: a 90% share is currently the highest pay-out in the Adamant eco-system. From a delegate perspective: We supports the DPoS eco-system and build free DPoS tools for Adamant delegates! You need to keep an eye on your nodes and the Dutch_pool team has build tools just for that! Check these out: the DPoS Dashboard (https://github.com/dutchpool/cdashboard) to keep track of all your DPoS delegate status', and also DPoS Monitoring to check and get notified about the behavior of your nodes (missing blocks etc) (https://github.com/dutchpool/dpos-monitor).

To vote for a pool, you can vote directly through the messenger, including the Web app or iOS app. You can upvote or downvote up to 30 delegates at a time for just 50 ADM.

In fact, two-factor authentication or 2FA means any way of enhancing security using not only passwords but other methods as well. The main goal of 2FA is adding extra protection to your account.  If you enter both a password and an OTP to log in your online bank account, this is 2FA. Other widespread examples such as fingerprint scans and screen patterns on smartphones, passwords and encryption keys for crypto marketing, are probably familiar to you as well.  2FA: look before you leap  In theory, all the mentioned above ways of securing sensitive information are quite solid. However, our expectations often differ from reality. That is to say, many up-to-date 2FA solutions have serious flaws.  The first flaw is the inconvenience. The more inputs the user makes to log in, the more cumbersome 2FA becomes. If there is a possibility to use an app or service without 2FA, people will likely do so. For instance, Google launched 2FA in 2011. However, less than 10% of consumers use it today. Forcing users to adopt the 2FA system is not an option, as they will probably just switch to a different and more convenient service.  The second flaw is the vulnerability. Many so-called ‚Äúsecond factors‚Äù can be phished. 2FA often inspires a certain trust in its methods, which makes people set weak passwords. In this case, cybercriminals can easily take over an account.  One of the most vulnerable second factors existing is an SMS verification code. NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) states that this security method is unsafe due to serious flaws in SS7 (Signaling System 7).  Many popular second factors have other disadvantages. It often takes time to receive an SMS or email with a verification code and sometimes you do not get one at all. If you lose your phone, you will not get access to your account (e.q. Google Authenticator system). Moreover, these second factors are often costly and unreliable. Not mentioning that some of them can be used on certain devices only.  Blockchain is the answer  The ADAMANT team develops an exceptional 2FA solution based on blockchain. It is a cheaper, safer and more solid option any other known security methods. ADAMANT messenger is an alternative to regular second factors.  With ADAMANT 2FA, you can use existing and well-tested libraries. The system works just the way you got used to it in other services, except that you will receive codes via ADAMANT messenger rather than SMS or emails.  The messages are encrypted, so that no third parties can take over, read or implement them. Code‚Äôs delivery is always verified in blockchain. Each code request is rated as a regular ADAMANT message and costs only 0.001 ADM (approx. 0.00025 USD). Moreover, you can receive a code via PC, tab, smartphone or laptop ‚Äì just make sure you are connected to the Internet (your service needs it anyway).  Have a look at the comparison chart below:    How it works  ADAMANT 2FA is suited for any Internet-related service, such as crypto exchanges, online-banks, and email. In order to activate 2FA, you need neither your phone number nor your personal information but an account‚Äôs identifier. As soon as you enter your identifier, you will receive a message in ADAMANT, containing a verification code. This will activate 2FA. Hereafter, you will get a verification code via ADAMANT messenger every time you wish to sign in this service.  In a while, ADAMANT 2FA‚Äôs components will be available in popular 2FA libraries on GitHub.  Get 2FA for free  If you are interested in the ADAMANT 2FA solution, we will be glad to help you and compensate tokens spent on sending verification codes.

ADAMANT is not just a messenger ‚Äî we strive to create a multifunctional system for personal and business communication. One of our goals is to implement means for instant exchange of cryptocurrencies and tokens in chats, and we successfully implemented it in the latest versions of our apps. We present you an update of ADAMANT Messenger for iOS: the app now works approximately 33 times faster and users can send ADM and ETH to each other.  Fast, convenient, accurate  We‚Äôve already implemented the sending of our own tokens (ADM) in the progressive web app (PWA) as well as ETH and Binance Coin (BNB). You can send all three of them wallet-to-wallet as well as right in chats. This feature successfully passed all tests and received a positive feedback.  Now Apple device users can also send tokens via ADAMANT Messenger as we added sending of ADM and ETH in chats in the latest update for iOS.  The main advantage of this feature is its simplicity: you just use a regular messenger‚Äôs interface to send and receive transactions. In the Wallet section, you can withdraw your tokens to an external wallet. Since you can rename your contacts and have your own ‚Äúaddress book‚Äù, you are safe from mistakes when typing a receiver‚Äôs address.  Therefore this feature allows you to pay for goods and services in one click as well as instantly send tokens and currencies to your friends and partners. The fee for transactions in ADAMANT is 100 lower than in banks; sending ETH to any place on the planet costs 0.0004 ETH (~6 cents at the time of this writing).  New code ‚Äî new speed  Besides new types of transactions, this iOS update has another important feat. Our development team has rewritten JavaScript code to native Swift, and this allowed ~33 times faster loading and decrypting speed. We worked hard during these three months to release this update, and now proudly present the results.  You can download ADAMANT Messenger for iOS in App Store.  People trust ADAMANT because the source code is completely public.  What‚Äôs next?  We plan to expand the messenger‚Äôs features further: implement new tokens and cryptocurrencies transfers and other options. The updated will be focused on sending and receiving Lisk tokens in chats.  Subscribe to our Medium to keep up with updates.",False

For now, while the message itself is encrypted, it is very visible which addresses interact with each other. Are there plans to change this in the future?  It could be possible to have a type of ""super-stealth message"", where it is visible that a message was sent, but not to whom.  The system would be quite simple: omit the receiving address completely. The receive will download all new blocks and just go through all transaction, trying to decrypt them. If they have the private key, they will be able to successfully decrypt the message addressed at them, if not, nothing happens.  This would solve quite a few problems:  - Someone watching traffic and the blockchain can only see that an address sent a message, but not to whom.  - Since the receiving party is forced to download complete blocks*, a spy cannot conclusively link sender and receiver together.  *Of course, this has it's holes as well. For example, if I watch an entity downloading blocks and they suddenly stop, I can safely assume that the message directed at them was in the last few blocks. This problem is amplified by Adamants extremely short block times, especially when few people are using the system. One solution would be to have the clients always sync completely, no matter what, but this could still make correlations visible. Another solution could be to have dedicated ""super-stealth blocks"", meaning, ""super-stealth-messages"" are collected over a certain time and are written in a block that occurs every few hours, or maybe even only once a day. After all, the bigger the pool of messages, the harder it is to link two entities. This solution would obviously hve the problem, that an attacker could fill the super-stealth blocks in a way, that all but a few messages in the block belong to them. The few remaining can be correlated to the receiver, if they only download up to a certain block height.  Still, I think decoupling theye parts, somewhat making the metadate as inconclusive as possible is important for a good privacy focussed messenger.",False

However, if you purchase cryptocurrencies anonymously, or purchase them from a monitored exchange and then trade them for a coin that has absolute privacy (Monero, Zcash, PIVX, etc), then the link with your identity is broken, as long as you stay off exchanges that can track your identity (after that point).  For example: If you purchase 1 ETH on CoinBase, your details are monitored everywhere you send that ETH. If you send your 1 ETH to a decentralized exchange (such as: Gate.io), and swap your ETH for Monero. You can now send your Monero anonymously to another exchange or website (that does not monitor details) and your identity cannot be known (depending on the website/exchange). If the ADM token could be exchanged directly for Monero (XMR), then there is no possible way to track your identity, and thus you can purchase ADM tokens anonymously in this way. A good strategy for the ADAMANT team would be to get the ADM token listed on as many decentralized exchanges as possible, or to create a decentralized token-swapping feature. Lead Devs might know more on this.  Quote from: vlom on May 14, 2018, 04:59:02 PM how to become a delegate? its a lisk clone?  https://github.com/Adamant-im/adamant only show the installation.  setting up a delegate is not explained. voting?  thanks for the help.  Yes, the ADAMANT platform is built on a forked-Lisk codebase. The delegate feature should be available shortly, I believe the question on whether staking and voting will be introduced was answered in the English Telegram group about 2 weeks ago, with a rough estimation being 2-3 weeks (1 more week from now).

Is this Dpos blockchain, if so how look the inflation and for how long? The ADAMANT Blockchain is based on DPoS.

Please see the following post:  Quote from: Azza1070 on April 28, 2018, 09:55:49 AM A lot of users here are asking what the need for the ADAMANT Messenger is when there are so many free messaging applications such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Viber, etc.  To give you some perspective, the main purpose of the ADAMANT Messenger is to provide security, anonymity, and privacy. If these traits are not important to you, then they cannot be compared to free applications that do not provide these features. Many instant free messaging softwares provide some form of verification (usually a phone number or email address), but ADAMANT requires none.  When you use a ""free"" messenger, you're paying in other ways. Your email address, phone number, public connections, location, IP, device information, interests, images, and other sensitive information is transferred to these centralized companies that decide how to use it. Your information can be sold to any government, coorporation, or conglomerate that they choose. We can see this happening around the world with the use cases of ""Big Data"".  With ADAMANT, you know exactly what price you're paying. There is nothing hidden, it's an open-source project. You can view a full list of comparisons in the following table: https://image.ibb.co/cPa4gx/ADAMANT_vs_the_rest.png  There are many countries around the world where these features are desperately needed, places that restrict the access of many online applications such as Telegram, WhatsApp, etc. Countries that are run by oppresive regimes and governments that would imprison civilians based on their opposition to ideas of the state. Privacy and freedom is simply a human right, and cannot be denied.  Perhaps some of the users here may be looking at things the wrong way, by comparing ADAMANT to these free messaging applications, thus invalidating the need for any use cases of the ADAMANT Messenger. This is simply not the scenario for every human being in the world. Value from the ADAMANT Messenger will be provided to the individuals that require and use it, regardless of their location around the world.",False

The number of available messengers is counted by hundreds and the amount of people who use at least one messenger is close to 100% of all smartphone and PC owners. However, the percentage of security-oriented and anonymous messengers which are independent from a centralized server (or a group of) is distinctively low. Since ADAMANT‚Äôs main features are security and anonymity, there are only proper alternatives considered within our comparison (this is why we don‚Äôt review such messengers like Kik Messenger, Skype, Google Hangout etc). With respect to the fact that security, anonymity and usability often contradict each other, we do value the messenger‚Äôs accordance to security and anonymity criterias as an advantage in our comparison. For example ‚Äî if the messenger is making a notification about message ‚ÄúRead‚Äù status ‚Äî this kind of behavior is a loss of anonymity for ‚Äúpleasing the usability‚Äù. We had also excluded from our comparison all messengers which does not have a functional prototype: like Echo, Status, Crypviser; and all messengers that are available only for the desktop environments (and do not operate on smartphones): like RetroShare, Tox, Bitmessage, Ricochet.  https://image.ibb.co/cPa4gx/ADAMANT_vs_the_rest.png  Thus ADAMANT is made to solve the confidentiality and security issues.

As far as ADM is an Utility-token which is used to maintain the network infrastructure, the ADAMANT Grows system is only aimed to protect the conceptual system aspect and not suitable for gaining profits. This distribution will be eventually stopped with the ICO wallet depletion. Therefore, the earlier you‚Äôll support ADAMANT, and the longer you‚Äôll hold your tokens, the more ‚Äúgrow‚Äù-bonuses you‚Äôll get. ‚óè Distribution beginning: 04/11/2018 ‚óè Distribution period: monthly ‚óè Growth percent: 5% ‚óè Distribution closure: eventually with ICO wallet depletion. These wallets do not participate in token distribution campaign: 1. All initial system wallets (ICO, investors rewards, Adoption, reserve wallets); 2. Wallets with their balance being less than 10 ADM tokens. The information about each distribution round details is open (hence will be published on an official website) and all growth transactions are visible through the ADAMANT Explorer.  From the ADAMANT Whitepaper (Page 14):  Quote Infrastructure maintaining and ADM token forging (mining) ADAMANT infrastructure is handled by a system of distributed servers that are running full nodes (blockchain). All servers‚Äô support expenses are covered by ADM tokens forging: 1. Transaction fees 2. Rewards for blocks forging. To participate in forging process, a node should be registered as a network delegate and afterwards receive enough votes from ADAMANT users. Delegate registration fee is 3000 ADM. An ADAMANT user voting for another delegate is required to pay 50 ADM. DPoS scheme functioning algorithm is based on a voting process that proceed in real-time mode (with the use of the reputation level of the network members) which is aimed to create a list of trusted nodes (delegates). After being elected, delegates have the legitimate right to create and verify blocks for adding them to the blockchain and also prevent invasion into the process. These nodes forge (create) blocks one after another in an order that randomly changes after each round. Delegates do forge (obtain or earn) themselves ADM tokens when creating new blocks. The amount of tokens being produced this way is constantly increasing. With the system inception it was to be 0.5 ADM per 1 block, but each 6 307 200 blocks (approximately a year in real time) this number decreases by 0.05 ADM till fit 0.1 ADM. This forging reward increase is going to motivate all delegates to manage the increasing network loads. Regarding the calculations, the delegates will gain these rewards approximately for 140 years, after which the infrastructure will be fully supported by transaction commissions only. The number of active delegates participating in blocks forging is 101. In case when their number is lower than that, these 101 votes will be allocated among the existing members which operate as a full node. The minimum amount of such nodes is 3. The whole system becomes more stable and reliable with the amount of nodes increasing. To create (or forge) new blocks using DPoS, an election do take place in which 101 delegate members are chosen from the delegate pool in order to make all ongoing 101 blocks. The voting is executed by nods (all wallet owners) automatically, based on the trust in particular delegates and their online uptime. After all delegates are being chosen, they are given an order in which new blocks should be formed. Creating a que of 101 blocks approximately takes 8 minutes. Important to note however, that the payment for block forging starts only after the sequence of 2,000,000 first blocks is being created. This measure guarantees that the initial network participants won‚Äôt get their tokens with the minimum amount of effort.  Other than these two incentives, you can sell your tokens when they're listed on exchanges.

If these traits are not important to you, then they cannot be compared to free applications that do not provide these features. Many instant free messaging softwares provide some form of verification (usually a phone number or email address), but ADAMANT requires none.  When you use a ""free"" messenger, you're paying in other ways. Your email address, phone number, public connections, location, IP, device information, interests, images, and other sensitive information is transferred to these centralized companies that decide how to use it. Your information can be sold to any government, corporation, or conglomerate that they choose. We can see this happening around the world with the use cases of ""Big Data"".  With ADAMANT, you know exactly what price you're paying. There is nothing hidden, it's an open-source project. You can view a full list of comparisons in the following table: https://image.ibb.co/cPa4gx/ADAMANT_vs_the_rest.png  There are many countries around the world where these features are desperately needed, places that restrict the access of many online applications such as Telegram, WhatsApp, etc. Countries that are run by oppresive regimes and governments that would imprison civilians based on their opposition to ideas of the state. Privacy and freedom is simply a human right, and cannot be denied.  Perhaps some of the users here may be looking at things the wrong way, by comparing ADAMANT to these free messaging applications, thus invalidating the need for any use cases of the ADAMANT Messenger. This is simply not the scenario for every human being in the world. Value from the ADAMANT Messenger will be provided to the individuals that require and use it, regardless of their location around the world.",False

KVS (key-value store) is a way to store information. For each key (for example, the contact name U324242353425354) a certain value can be stored (""John"", for example). KVS is planned to be used to store the address book, user settings and anti-spam, but the real scope of application is bigger. Thus, we have built this mechanism for the future uses. KVS transactions are stored in the blockchain along with transactions of other types and are only available to their owners since transaction's content is encrypted with a private key.

The technologies used in messengers have been being developed for a long time, and the creation of a similar product is an ordinary thing now. However, when the time comes for a paradigm shift, every small improvement requires research, design, development, testing ‚Äî this is just about ADAMANT. We are pleased to announce that the ADAMANT team implemented a mechanism for storing contact data (KVS) in blockchain and the new transaction type. KVS (key-value store) is a way to store information. For each key (for example, the contact name U324242353425354) a certain value can be stored (""John"", for example). The process of storing contact information in case of common client-server technology is simple and clear. ADAMANT is built on blockchain unlike classic messengers, and each operation requires the generation of a transaction on the client side, the transfer of the signed transaction to a node and the distribution to other nodes with agreement and consensus. KVS is currently used to store the address book, user settings and anti-spam, but the real scope of application is bigger. Thus, we have built this mechanism for the future uses. KVS transactions are stored in the blockchain along with transactions of other types and are only available to their owners since transaction's content is encrypted with a private key. ADAMANT provides incremental data storage so the client application only transmits the address book changes, not the entire address book. This is very important for blockchain data storage. KVS and the new transaction type are now implemented in ADAMANT test network and in the console. As soon as the testing is complete they will be released to the live network within 10 days. What to expect? Soon you will finally be able to save contact names (the address book) and settings, including anti-spam settings.",False

You say you store messages on the blockchain. Yeah, DPoS, improved speed compared to PoW, but: have you ever considered the amounts of data the full nodes will have to store if your messenger will become popular? Wouldn't it lead to centralization, because only a small amount of nodes will be able to process large amounts of data?  upd: Ok, I've looked through the WP.  I think that the assumption of 300 bytes per message is not very precise, because you also have to store sender and receiver addresses, the signature, probably some additional metadata. If sender can read sent messages, they should be encrypted and stored twice (encrypted with receiver's private key and sender's private key). Transactions of other types will also consume hard disk space.  Telling that your messenger is ""secure"" and ""anonymous"" is not very correct too. 1) Assuming that one user has his private key compromised, the stealer gains access to the full message history. 2) As I understand the concept, the fact of conversation between two pseudonymous users can be easily proven. It is possible to build a graph on user's connections. 3) At the moment, browser version of the messenger connects to the public server. The client requests transactions belonging to him with his public key. So at the server (full-node) side it is possible to correlate IP-address with the public key. I'd strongly recommend to use this app only via proxy/tor/vpn.",False

I'll post a reply here also.  Aleksei Lebedev [11 minutes ago] Hello! Thanks for your deep interest in ADAMANT.   Aleksei Lebedev [7 minutes ago] Yeah, we store messages in blockchain, as well as other transaction types. But as ADAMANT do not plan to replace Facebook, we'll have limited, but specified users auditory. As all of transactions need few disk space, and disk space is cheap enough, that will be not a problem we think.   Aleksei Lebedev [7 minutes ago] As I know all the database sized about 200 MB.   Aleksei Lebedev [6 minutes ago] 1) Yes. We plan to have a possiblity for changing keys within chats.   Aleksei Lebedev [4 minutes ago] 2) You are right again. First thing user can understand there is no way to hide if there is no deep IT knowledge. ADAMANT provide anonymous ID, but it still can be revealed. Later we plan to hide chat transactions in blockchain, like Monero does.   Aleksei Lebedev [2 minutes ago] 3) Yes, but later client will be connected to random node. If there will be many nodes, it will be hard to get IP-public key link. And Tor can be used for sure.

We remind you that the delegates are the main nodes of the network. It is the delegate who forges blocks being constantly on the network, and gets paid for it. In order to become a delegate the node owner pays the comission of 300 ADM and encourages users to vote for him (one vote costs 10 ADM to the user). Users with the larger balance have a stronger vote. The delegates raise their rank by receiving these votes, and the rank determines the block forging queue.  So far we have tested the Console and the voting mechanism on the test network, both these features will be on the live network soon.

The ADM token did not suite a number of demands for listing of the major crypto markets. A number of users are not able to buy ADM tokens because of incorrect Whitepaper limitations for the US and China citizens. The Messenger app does not fit the minimum requirements for every day usage.  The project team along with internal and external advisors made a decision that a major changes on the project are needed. These decisions are somewhat forced measures aimed to secure investors‚Äô interests and future product development.  These changes include:  A concept and Whitepaper redesign in accordance with understanding ADM is a Utility-token, intended to be used inside the system for supporting network infrastructure, allowing to buy tokens for US and China citizens  The ADAMANT Tech Labs jurisdiction change from Malta to Ireland. This change is connected with lower tax load and loyal views for crypto projects and anonymous messengers.  Concentration on product development and mobile applications for iOS and Android. Android app development will start in April, ahead of the Roadmap.  ICO prolongation for 3 months, till 06/30/2018. Such a decision is necessary to prepare for listing on crypto markets with significant volumes. While we do not exclude that ADM token will be listed before ICO ends. ADM token price is fixed at 0.004 price until the ICO ends.

Yes, to send a message, you shoud pay a small fee of about 0.005 ADM per 255 characters. That amount goes to support Messenger's nodes and infrastructure.  First, REMEMBER there are no free messengers. No company will pay for servers and team and more for charity. When you use a ""free"" messenger, you actually don't know how much you pay. Your email, phone number, public connections, location, IP and device info, interests, images and much more are not yours anymore, they belong to industry companies, and they decide how to use it. Moreover, you can't be sure messages are not read by these companies, as application and protocol source codes are closed. Think about it. ADAMANT is clear ‚Äî you do know how much you pay.  Second, ADAMANT fee is adjustable to ADM token price. Now we gather some feedback from users to decide what is convenient fee. It can be close to zero when the network become stable.  Third, ADAMANT do not target to replace other messengers. Don't need anonymity and security? Use those whatsapps.",False

We want to have right, to chose what to share with some unknown third parties and what not.  So this is one of the reasons we use adamant.
