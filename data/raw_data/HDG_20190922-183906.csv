Only if 2008 was remembered by the financial crisis, then 2017 will be remembered by the phenomenon of ICOs and the blossoming of cryptocurrencies.  The key question that interests market participants is how the factors that influence the success of the ICO have changed. And it would be nice to understand what a successful ICO is.  Success for an ICO is raising a lot of money. Of course, this is only the first step towards creating a cool product and satisfying the investor’s interest. However, there can be no future for even a successful project without proper security in the form of hedging as the proverbial “business sharks” are coming to the market and do not care about the viability of products, only pumping and dumping tactics for their own enrichment. DeHedge is a project designed specifically and endowed with official US regulations for hedging viable project tokens.  ICOs currently have a lot of issues attributed to them — legal issues, regulations, financing, scams, and many more. With every year the issues will snowball as the market grows. It is impossible to securitize the entire market or industry just reduce the risks through proper hedging.  The market is growing, but the growth has slowed to November rates and has been growing by a couple of per cent per month since. The number of projects continued to grow at a tremendous pace, though. December saw a spike in the collected sums, possible reasons of which are the desire of most projects to complete their ICOs by the end of the year and abnormal charges for Hdac (258M) and Sirin Labs (158M) projects, which accounted for 25% of all funds collected in December  In January there was a seasonal decline as the majority of teams rested and celebrated, and who really wanted to work held their token sale back in December. In general, the situation on the market resembles a sale on a Black Friday with a huge number of projects, all wanting investments. As a result, the average amount of fees for an ICO dropped almost threefold in mid-summer.  The number of projects on the market is growing rapidly, but the amount of money is not. The importance of small investors has declined, large investors and crypto funds have grown and their significance has also changed under the pressure of external factors.  https://medium.com/@DeHedge/icos-and-their-future-b8f1f838fd54",False

Currency Corruption and Security. The exclusion will be executed as soon as possible in accordance with Rulebook Chapter 7. Index Events leading to Index Adjustments.    Regarding BitConnect: BitConnect is presenting itself as crypto lending platform, where investors are able to lend cryptocurrencies to BitConnect’s proprietary trading bot in exchange for the promise of returns that are above the market norm and usual market rates. There are strong indications that BitConnect is operating a Ponzi scheme, fulfilling sufficient requirements including, but not limited to, promises of above market usual returns that are positively correlated with the lending period, lock-up periods of lent funds and pyramid structure of referral bonification. On top of that, it is currently unknown who is running or owning BitConnect. The UK Registrar of Companies is in the process of shutting down their administrative facilities such as their British mailboxes. Due to unreliable API, BitConnect has currently never been included in any Buchman index anyway, however, as per the governing rulebooks, this could have happened if BitConnect had been listed on a reliable exchange that passes our rigorous exchange requirements. Nonetheless, acting under Rulebook Chapter 10. Currency Corruption and Security, BitConnect will precautionarily be excluded from any and all future indexing procedures.    Regarding Tether: Tether is supposedly a USD-pegged token used to facilitate trading on non-conventional exchanges only. Tether is issued and operated by Tether Ltd., however, it is currently unknown who is running or owning Tether Ltd., where it is domiciled, who, if any, is regulating it, which banks Tether Ltd. is using to deposit USD and whether these banks have the claimed USD to back the Tether tokens in circulation.   The banks claimed to have USD deposited are kept secret purposefully. Due to precedents concerning the issuing of private money and counterfeiting (e.g. United States of America vs. Bernard von Nothaus), the banks are expected to refuse revealing their names and amounts of USD deposited because they would risk losing their US corresponding banks that are necessary for clearing USD. Buchman has not been able to independently verify Tether’s bank statements. Tether could be in violation of title 18 of the United States Code §2, §371 and §485. On top of that, Buchman deems the exclusion of Tether from the indexing procedure will not only be necessary but also no stress to the index itself since Tether carried a weight of below 1%, and as USD-pegged token, the best case scenario would have been including a constant within the index yielding no extra volatility but containing the legal risk described herein. Also, the issue whether a token that is fully backed by fiat currency falls under the definition of a cryptocurrency is questionable and will be put on the agenda of the next scheduled Index Committee Congress. Acting under Rulebook Chapter 10. Currency Corruption and Security, Tether will be excluded from any current and future indexing procedure. This mainly concerns the Buchman Tether Index, Buchman Crypto 30 Index, all weighting variations thereof, as well as indices with more constituents and indices that use those as constituents.  https://medium.com/hedge-token/announcement-of-index-event-and-index-adjustment-f9a2d13d934d",False

Our platform will enable crypto investors to manage the risk exposure they have on the market confidently. Furthermore, Hedge Project is in process of launching set of professionally designed indices for crypto market – first such indices to serve as a base for construction of cryptocurrencies baskets.  ▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ About the Problem: Cryptomania  The development of Cryptocurrency markets is experiencing and exhibiting a quite tremendous growth. There are already more than 1000 cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets available on the market and new projects are being introduced and commissioned on a daily basis.  Year-to-date various startups raised over USD 1.3 bn through initial coin offerings. The lack of transparency in some projects, limited regulatory oversight and investor protection, and limited investor due diligence have created an environment, where some valuations are fueled by the fear of missing out rather than careful consideration of the project’s merits and market potential.  The return correlation between the crypto currencies used to be very high, but now investors are starting to differentiate between the assets and correlations are decreasing, implying the need for diversification.  Consistently picking “winners” has proven to be impossible in the long run, making the market wide diversification an optimal solution for an investor.    Hedge Project will establish the platform for crypto instruments that will enable long and short exposure and identification of the true value of the projects.  ▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ The pattern of every technological revolution  Comparison of the internet bubble and cryptomania.     The beneficial part of this pattern is that the initial over inflated injection of money enables research and development in the industry. As such, it is crucial for the growth phase and transferal of the infrastructure to the next phase. However, 90% of companies follow the destiny of many regular start-ups – failure.  ▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ About the solution: Hedge Project  Hedge Project Platform will enable everyone to participate in the crypto markets in efficient and accessible way. The Crypto Traded Indices will change the way of investing for all participants. Furthermore, instruments that include the possibility of long exposure and short selling will help identify true value of the projects and unlock the hedge value for investors.  ▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ The Roadmap     ▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ Hedgetoken Platform Preview   Link to Hedge Platform        Hedge Token Activity",False
