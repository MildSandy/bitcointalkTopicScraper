You can argue a lot about its historical reality, but here we will not do it. Let us dwell on the fact that the world of our game is already being built on the basis of this map, without the need to prove its realism.  So, from today we start cooperation with Public Foundation named ""Tartaria"". The project is quite young (April 2018), but ambitious. What will grow out of it will be shown by time. More information can be obtained from the topic on Bitcointalk (link above) or on official resources:  Website- https://tartaria.org VK - https://vk.com/oftartaria Twitter - https://twitter.com/oftartaria  In what form will the cooperation of our game and the project ""Tartaria""? A good question, and the answer depends on you, investors and future players, tell us about your vision of such cooperation. From myself I can throw some information for thought: it will be possible to realize the use of the coin of the Tartariya project in the territories of Tartaria in our gaming world as a local currency (on certain mutually beneficial terms and, for example, with a security fund that can be provided by their administration, for example, in exchange for LDM), the project ""Tartaria"" administration can also participate in the development of the territories of this state in our gaming universe (consultations, specialists or in any other form).

A little about the project in general and LDM in particular: 1. Privateers.Life is the game we are creating (survival in the pirate environment of the 17th century) with the game economy based on Blockchain 2. At the moment we have released the early alpha version of the game for Win 7-8 and Linux, which you can play with at least 100 LDM on your ETH-account (you do not need to send anywhere, the system will simply check if they are present at registration and authorization) 3. LDM is the in-game currency of Privateers.Life, a kind of gold that will participate in the gaming economy of the multiplayer version of the game 4. LDM is traded on Yobit.net and EtherDelta.com at an average rate of 16-17 cents per 1 LDM (5 times higher than the ICO price).  Anyone can participate in Airdrop and get some LDM on their ETH-wallet. To do this, it is sufficient to fulfill a few simple conditions and fill in form. Fulfillment of each condition adds 1 stake to your share in distribution.  To get LDM on your wallet, you need to fulfill at least one of these conditions: - be a subscriber of our page in FB (https://www.facebook.com/ThePrivateerIsland/) and make a repost on your page of any record from there - to be a subscriber of our group in VK.com (https://vk.com/theislandgame) and make a repost on your page of any record from there - be our follower on Twitter (https://twitter.com/alienter2) and retweet any of our messages - write any constructive message in any of our topics on Bitcointalk - join our Discord channel (https://discord.gg/mxaNdzc) - have on your wallet any quantity of LDM or tokens of our partners (Brother (BRAT))  If you fulfill all of the above conditions, then your share in the distribution of LDM will be maximum.

Currently, we are actively developing the game for the release of the first alpha version and in connection with this we declare the readiness number one for the first large-scale event connected with the appearance of a playable version of our game .  After the release of the alpha version of The Island, which is a demonstration of the Privateers Life world we are developing, we will hold the first Survival Contest , which will identify the coolest survivor that can live on the island the longest. But unlike other games of this kind, a lot of prizes are planned in our Contest.  Preliminary information briefly: - Alpha version of the game for the preparation for participation in the Survivors Competition will be given to everyone who will have at least 100 LDM coins on their wallet (you will not have to pay for the game at this stage - the first contest will be conducted for testing and popularization, moreover - these LDM after the end of the Competition can be freely sold, along with the received prize coins) - Coins (100 LDM) must be on the purse during the entire Competition (you can buy more and use freely, but the minimum balance must be 100 LDM for the entire duration of the Contest - before it is completed and the prize money is paid out - For participation in the Competition (just for compliance and fulfillment of its terms) LDM will be credited (the amount is specified) - For prize-winning places LDM will be credited in a much larger amount than simply for participation.  More details on the first Survivors Contest from Privateers Life appeared after the release of the alpha version of the game.  Useful links: EtherDelta (the exchange where you can buy LDM relatively inexpensively, closer to the release of the alpha version of the game and the beginning of the Competition, the price will be much higher), if, due to the antiDDos check, you throw it on the main page of the exchange - just select LDM in the list of traded coins Instructions for working with the EtherDelta exchange for beginners: https://youtu.be/65c78JClJSU?t=348 The development of the game is live [url = https: //youtube.com/c/alientergames] on the YouTube channel [/ url], subscribe and come to the stream to be up-to-date with the latest news",False

(FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS)  The issue of burning tokens, which will not be sold under the ICO. I will answer in detail: - we do not have a premined tokens, tokens are created when they are purchased by the investor (including tokens intended for bounty payment, developers and operating expenses - all of them are created only when purchased by the investor, according to the scheme presented in the infographics) - so we will not and can not have ""extra"" tokens on the basis of ICO results, which could put pressure on the course - all tokens will be covered by ETH received within ICO - so there is nothing to burn, that part of the tokens that can not be bought within the ICO, simply will not be created  Why developers needs tokens? As for the tokens, everything is quite simple - they can pay current expenses (by arrangement with advertising platforms, designers and other specialists), increasing the number of token holders, and hence the stability of the entire emerging economic system. The more people have coins, the more interested in its stable growth.  Game bonuses will be calculated by the ""base"" of purchased coins, or by actually received coins? That is, if on the first day I contribute 1 ether and receive 15,000 coins, I will get a legendary item and 15% of the store discount, or still an epic thing and a 10% discount? It will be calculated on the basis, since the bonus part will decrease with time, and the base remains unchanged, which allows investors at any stage to be on an equal footing with the funds spent  Btw, will legendary items be so legendary that only 1 item of this type be in game? They are legendary, to be in a single copy. So far, so to speak, the working gradation by the number of copies is as follows: a legendary object is unique in its kind, epic objects are 2-3 units with similar parameters, rare items - about a dozen, ""unique"" items can be a pair of dozens, but each will necessarily have unique property  Why should I participate in ICO of PrivateersLife? 1. Privateers.life - a full-fledged 3D online game with real money economy (earn tokens in the game - spend tokens in real life), built on the basis of Blockchain technology 2. The earlier participated, the higher the bonus (up to + 50% of tokens in the first 24 hours and 10-30% during the first 2 weeks of the ICO) and the more significant lifetime discount in the gaming shop was received 3. Actual and trending theme: survival in the pirate environment of the 17th century 4. A limited number of coins (only those that will be issued under the ICO in exchange for ETH received), no unsecured amounts 5. After the completion of the ICO, the issuance of new coins is impossible - the capitalization will be formed by the actual volume of coins sold within ICO 6. The infrastructure surrounding the game is planned (own exchange and donation services, there are preliminary agreements with projects and services of third parties on the acceptance of LDM tokens as a means of payment) 7. Successful examples of other game currencies: https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/rustbits/ (coin of the game Spacepirates, within the ICO is collected about 400000 USD, now the capitalization is 2700000 USD (about 3 weeks after ICO) https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/nexium/ (coin of the game Beyond the Void, within the ICO collected about 1,000,000 USD, now the capitalization exceeds 15000000+ USD, about 8 months after ICO)  How will the investor's addresses be linked to accounts in the game? We are now working on the technical point of organizing in-game transactions directly between the purses of counterparties, that is, without converting to any additional currency, namely the transfer of LDM tokens between players directly in the game. That is, the answer is likely to be: the purse is indicated in the player's profile and the account is associated with the purse specified in the profile.  How to see the tokens in my wallet?
