I was right. They was moving btc to bittrex to buy eth to buy ctx.    So now they even admit doing so for btc contributors. So 50% cheaper tokens flying towards people who invested in their ico more expensive and change stays with them. Very sneaky.  Link to telegram chat about btc movement of btc: https://imgur.com/OQqa44h   I would like to remind SOFTCAP pre-ico was only 150k$ so not that a lot as cartaxi thinks, also discount wasn't 50% as now we see even bigger drop in price. i was digging to find it and they confirmed every single bit. As i said before, dividends as far as this goes could be paid from contributors also. But i wont dig for this. Someone else can do eth work. I seriously lost faith in this and these people.  Extending ico - ""so everyone can join"", "" so not one is late"". After sale take funds and move to ED to buy cheaper CTX to give to btc contributors. Change stays in pocket.

This kind of project (with working products) should be completely subscribed. And to do that they need around 216000 ETH in 30 days of ICO.

Do not also believe new accounts as they might be shill for any Op in this forum. Better to do homework yourself. There is plenty of information in google and here in forum board. If not, just ask old members or openly in forum. Many people acctually cares about you and your money. And they will at least try to help you not loose any of this hard earned crypto.",False
