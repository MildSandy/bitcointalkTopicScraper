Having checked on your team members I believe you will execute your vision and offer real value for the crypto space by bridging it with derivatives (future trading) as a first-mover. However, when EMX is listed and available for everyone to buy, you cannot decide who is allowed to buy in and in what amount since it will be open for the whole public. As a consequent, there will always be mixed kind of personalities in the community. So it will be on your head to stop “fud” (if it happens). And the best way to stop fud and have a good community is to have an amazing and useful product. If your product is really good, even if dump happens, most people will still support you and your company will steadily rise in value. But if your product does not exceed or meet the expectation, the community will turn bad and as a consequent you will lose the support. So, I think your finished product is the deciding factor to have a supportive and good community.",False

Please drop us an email if you'd like to chat as well.  We've been working through a few legal items, and as mentioned, will be pushing back our public sale to accommodate.  With a mission of democratizing global financial exchanges, our project is fairly complex on the legal and regulatory side, and we've decided to be extra cautious to better serve our platform and its participants in the long run.  We hope to announce public token sale dates and terms in the near future.  We now have a private demo which we've started to show potential purchasers and investors.  It can conduct auctions, incorporate collateral, and record trading on the Rinkeby Testnet (Ethereum).  There's still some work to do before we can open it for the general public, but if you'd like a private demo we can try to address personally if you send us an email.

At a minimum, we would need transaction fees to record trades on the blockchain.  For any extra services, like offering leverage, we'd need to compensate lenders as well (as you would now to, say, a broker).  If fees are a given, we decided that the best way to ensure that these costs are manageable and competitive is to make them a market in and of themselves.  That's what we're looking to do: any service, such as offering leverage or maintain markets, should have low barriers to entry and low switching costs.  They should be as transparent as possible.  That's how you protect against monopoly pricing power.  That's how you keep fees low.  And that's the kind of platform we're building.  Happy to answer any further comments.",False

EMX gives crypto holders the ability to trade global futures contracts on a single platform--all without the need to convert to fiat. Built by a veteran team of traders, technologists and exchange operators, EMX bridges the crypto and traditional markets to deliver an unparalleled experience.  About the market The global futures market has revenues of $20B+, trillions in underlying notional, and is ripe for innovation.   Existing exchanges have high fees, can be difficult to access, and skew markets with price discrimination. Futures volumes have been increasing for the last ten years -- with Asia leading growth -- but there is a dearth of competition.  About our team We are technologists and traders from with 10+ years experience each from companies like Amazon, Microsoft, CME Group, and Citi. Our advisors have built the largest equity dark pools in the world and are managers of notable futures funds. We are not a fly-by-night operation, but are in this for the long haul.  Platform Features Access to more assets: Trade crypto and traditional futures, including commodities, equities and currencies. More opportunities: Don't just buy, sell or hold--go long or short, trade pairs and indexes, or access leverage. With EMX, there's no such thing as a ""bear market."" Crypto in, crypto out: Build a diversified portfolio without ever having to exchange into fiat. With the EMX Token, there's no need to switch between tokens or currencies. Efficient trading: Through the usage of smart contracts, transactions are cleared and settled in just seconds. Secure and transparent: There's no central custody of assets or information, minimizing the risk of theft, downtime, and trading errors. A fair structure, for everyone: EMX creates a level playing field for everyone, using a periodic, auction based matching model to eliminate unfair speed advantages.  Read more in our whitepaper: https://www.emx.com/assets/whitepaper-en.pdf  How we're different The main difference between us and Augur, Gnosis, and other predictive markets is that we are emphasizing liquidity. We are also different from current exchanges like Bitmex and OKex in that we have a hybrid exchange model, and we're also offering traditional asset classes (like commodities and equities) on top of cryptocurrency futures. We also have many connections in the finance world, and will bring these parties as external liquidity providers onto our platform. In short, we believe we have the team needed to drive significant volume onto this platform from the real world.  Our token sale Our public token sale is tentatively scheduled for Q3 2018.  Final terms will be announced in coming weeks. There is a private presale. Please email jim@emx.com for more information.  Why this is a great opportunity Our team is experienced and poised to shake up the global financial markets. We are targeting futures first, but will also look into stocks, options, fx, and more. In short, our long term plan is to revolutionize every equity and derivative exchange in the world. This is a big opportunity.

Basically, instead of continuous order book trading, we will be utilizing periodic pro-rata call auctions instead.  We believe this mechanic will be a significant innovation in the futures space.  In fact, we've spoken to many futures traders in our research, and there's been very strong demand for liquidity and execution alternatives.  (If you have other questions, please feel free to PM, email, or reply.  If it's a common enough question we'll just put something up on the FAQ.  Thanks)",False

Things were a little hectic yesterday since we just announced the project publicly for the first time.  I hope you'll understand.  We had a few investors reach out to us about seed funding, and we've been very close to bringing on board two new team members with valuable skills whom we've been talking with for a while.  That being said, we're going to announce the bounties soon -- most likely within 48 hours.  We're going to have bounties for marketing on different forms of media.  We're going to have translation bounties for 6-10 of the top languages.  I'm meeting with our marketing director Justin later today to hash things out.  We were going to wait on our announcement post until we had all the bounty details straightened out, but my friend-- who's a Staff member at this forum-- was around yesterday to help so we just decided to post then.  Thanks for your patience!  I can PM you too when we announce if you like.",False
