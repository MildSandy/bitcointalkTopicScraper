Chris Butler from URAllowance here to highlight our partnership with Ammeris Foundation! Here is an article that gives a clear overview of this collaboration. I have known Paul for some time now through a few different projects that fate decided we should both be on. We have had many discussions about blockchain, cryptocurrency, financing, boring VC crap, Angel investments, we even talked about construction and flip-flops a few times. We've butted heads, debated, called each other names, maybe even tossed a swear word or two at each other. But at the end of the day there is no denying that we stand on common ground and both of us and our teams have the same goals in mind. I am proud to have Paul and the Ammeris team as partners to URAllowance. We are going to do big things together. Together with Jose Merino and the SID (share internet data) team, who is putting internet access into the hands of millions that were unable to access it before.

And projects launching smart contracts / dApps in our ecosystem, will have the option of creating a side chain - allowing them the ability to customize range, time, consensus protocol, and more, based on project needs.  The technology not only runs off of renewable energy, but also aims to operate with sustainably low amounts of energy requirements through the green nodes. Luckily this type of infrastructure can scale horizontally as we are able to focus on gear with high throughput / IO, as we continue to accommodate more redundancy and RPC.",False
