I would like to know your opinion about how Bityond is aligned with the future of the labour market, where people have different short-term jobs.  That's a key point for Bityond, thank you for asking. I've actually released an article today discussing how companies can actually tackle that problem, simply by incorporating a tokenized model, not only at the infrastructure level, but also at the governance level. This is, if decision making is decentralized we could potentially see a world where companies start to distribute tokens freely, paying for users' time, attention, contents, posts, good values, etc  https://www.ccn.com/whats-next-for-cryptocurrency-distribution-of-power/",False

It's quite a new market in Portugal so the news impact didn't cause a ""spike"" in contributers. More importantly, the news focus the work done between Bityond and the Portuguese Markets Exchange Commission; that's the main reason the ICO did come up in the news a couple times.

Im sure there will be much competition! There's already a lot eheh  I welcome competition. Actually, with tokens users have an incentive to chose all networks. Meaning, if you also get tokens using other platforms why should you stick only to one platform?  Besides we already have a platform released for 1 year, received super important feedback which we've incorporated onto version 2, being released in the Summer.  With this new version and the Bityond tokens, I think we'll crush competition.  Internal databases will disappear, you'll see! The incentive won't be to privatize information, but to make it public. You have my CV in your database? Great, my platform matches your skills, availability, experience, etc with jobs.  That's way better than receiving emails, phone calls, weird messages on linkedin from recruiters desperately trying to find a better match to the position they need to feel.  But again, competition in the cryptocurrency space will be very much welcome!  Thanks!  Give Bityond a try!",False
