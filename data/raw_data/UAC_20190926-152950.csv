During the last months things got worse and worse, UbiatarPlay people just kept lying and lying regarding everything, showing no respect for the investors or the bounty hunters , bounty hunters that have worked for 3 months, I repeat, 3 MONTHS, to get a few dollars, because they distributed a 5-10% of what they promised.  Here’s a quick recap of what happened: - As I said they paid only 5-10% of what they promised; - They said the old spreadsheet was wrong so it took them months to make a new one, or at lest this is what they say, and they can’t publish it because the European Union doesn’t allow them to publish the ETH wallets’ public addresses; - In order to pay less tokens, they started saying that there were more than 20k bounty hunters in the new spreadsheet while in the old one there were less than 2k, also remember that in their Telegram chat there are only 11k people, how is it possible to have more bounty hunters than users, especially considering that to get the bounty you must join the Telegram chat? - The number of users in the Telegram chat is fake, they bought hundreds, or thousands, of profiles, you just have to check the users list and it’s easy to spot them; - Heavy censorship in the Telegram chat, deleted posts and users banned without any warning after they asked stuff they didn’t like; - They manage all the bounty and airdrop problems by e-mail, in this way they think they can hide the truth from the users without posting in public; - Fake reviews in the online stores to increase the rating of their app, one of the reviewers even has an Ubiatar logo as profile picture… - Telegram chat with no real interest from the users, so they thought to change their own profiles and make them look like new users, very enthusiastic about the app, so they ask questions and also answer them, they’re such a losers…   Especially regarding the last point I decided to waste some time to show you how they think to be smart, considering the whole community as poor idiots, I attach you some screenshots:  Here we have 3 posts and we can read 4 different name: Chantal writes, Nina says hello calling her Giulia and Chantal replies calling her Martha!    Jennifer says hello and Chantal calls her Tony, because, in the meantime she changed sex      John Frings says hello and they reply with ""Hello Anna"", again, another one who changed sex…   And then John Frings/Anna becomes AnnaKate... And below you can notice a quoted post from Mirko, and they call him Peter    And now Martha, I love Martha, she’s great! Here she’s answering to Giulia, her colleague, calling her Dory:   Here she plays dumb asking how to be an avatar, and of course Chantal answers calling her Matthew, so once again, new sex…   And I think it’s a bit weird that Martha doesn’t know how to be an avatar, here she answers as Admin…   Now Martha became Danish, after changing sex she decided to change nationality as well:   And it’s weird, here she says she’s Italian,who knows, maybe the hormones confused her…    Who was Danish? From Vejle? Oh yeah, Martha! But wait, now she’s Mirko, she’s a male again?!    Another change of profile, Nina gets called as Moka    In Switzerland must be easy to find a job, one day you don’t even know what you’re talking about…   …and he next day you’re a mode, unbelievable! Congratulations Tony!    Yet another new name, Vladislav becomes Nadine, you know…    And if you still have some doubts, here’s some screenshot from a private conversation with a mod that changed name several times…      This is what they’re doing to make people (and investors) believing that there actually are people interested in this project, when in the reality nobody cares anymore about them, just to give you another number the Telegram chat loses 200 users per week.  As soon as they get quoted (if they get quoted) this token from 2 dollars will dump directly to a few cents.   So remember, these people are SCAMMERS!",False

The problem is that everybody received exactly the 5% of the reward. The FIVE%. There are people who did the signature bounty for 3 months and got like 50, 80 or 100 tokens when with the simple airdrop they gave away 130 tokens per user. So 3 months of signature to get 100-200 dollars when they promised thousands.  Also, the old spreadsheet is still online but they say that the bounty manager has made a lot of mistakes (nobody knows what mistakes btw) so they are fixing the spreadsheets, but they won't make them public because, they say, there are privacy laws that forbid to show these spreadsheets with the ETH address. So, again, nobody has a clue of what they are doing. They are dealing with the people by email, not in public, in this way, again, nobody knows what's going to happen or how many tokens they are going to distribute. This is the first time ever that I read the spreadsheets can't be public because the privacy laws don't allow to share the public address of the ETH wallets. So then, why is it called ""public address""?    Oh, last thing, they say they have something like 12.000 people who took part to the bounty program, I checked the spreadsheets, the real number it's not even 2.000...

We only know that they were supposed to give away 1 mln UAC token (total value $2mln) but they didn't. After the complaining they pretty much said it's bounty manager's fault and they are fixing things. That's all. They never explained why the bounty has been reduced, they never explained what was that 5% people got since they keep saying that ""bounty distribution is going on"" and when you ask more info by email, as they tell you to do because they clearly have something to hide if they don't want to make things public, you get answers such as ""we are evaluating everybody's position"" and updates like this one: We inform you that we are still working at the bounty program campaigns and we are about half of the work done. When the verifications are over we will update you, as soon as we can and with specific information about it.  The 130 UAC were for an airdrop, that has nothing to do with the bounty, those are two separate things.

So it’s easy to see that Ubiatar and their CEO are lying to everybody, probably they think to be very smart and have a very low consideration of other people’s intelligence…  After I took a look at their Telegram subscribers I found this:                     Those of course are just a part of the screenshots, there literally are hundreds or even thousands of deleted accounts and other accounts with Southeast Asia names without profile picture.

Mercoledi 22 Maggio 2018  Abbiamo ricevuto molte critiche riguardo l’iniziativa PowerFriendship, alcune piuttosto pesanti.  Vogliamo ribadire come questa ed altre iniziative siano state prese nell’interesse esclusivo del progetto e dei molti sottoscrittori.  La raccolta della ICO è importante ai fini della promozione di una piattaforma che sarà un marketplace e quindi dipenderà esclusivamente dal recepimento del pubblico.  Quando si offre all’umanità un nuovo potere, occorre far recepire tale possibilità ad un mondo che prima non ne aveva consaoevolezza.  Questo richiede un grosso sforzo di comunicazione.  Le risorse raccolte finora sono sufficienti per queso scopo, ma l’obiettivo prefissato per una rapidissima crescita iniziale non sarà probabilmente raggiunto a causa di procedure troppo complesse per il soddisfacimento di norme di registrazione dei partecipanti imposte dalla legislazione degli ultimi mesi.  Al solo scopo di velocizzare le operazioni e offrire un premio a chi aiutasse suoi amici in questo complicatissimo, ma necessario, processo abbiamo proposto un premio consistente a chi prendesse impegni concreti.  Assistiamo ora ad una levata di scudi da parte di chi ha già sottoscritto la ICO. Costoro credono che il loto impegno venga sminuito e ci si ritrovi con troppi ubiatarcoin in circolazione.  Il numero totale di UAC della ICO è fisso e non verrebbe variato da questa iniziativa.  Il prezzo di vendita è stato molto vantaggioso per tutti e un ulteriore sconto per spingere nuovi sottoscrittori non ne cambierebbe la valutazione minima che ci siamo sempre impegnati a mantenere a due dollari nel marketplace UbiatarPlay.  Tuttavia, il successo del progetto dipende dalla collaborazione e la promozione di tutti è anche piú importante della raccolta fondi.  Se i sottoscrittori non comprendono lo scopo e la portata reale di una iniziativa, riteniamo di doverli ascoltare.  Tutto questo considerato, ho deciso di sospendere l’iniziativa, garantendo comunque ai pochi che hanno già portato a termine le segnalazioni il risultato promesso. Si tratta di pochissime persone per importi modesti.  Ringraziamo comunque tutti i sottoscrittori e assicuriamo che il progetto procederà come descritto puntualmente nel White Paper online, con i fondi che già ora sono sufficienti per la pubblicazione e promozione della piattaforma.  Grazie a tutti",False
