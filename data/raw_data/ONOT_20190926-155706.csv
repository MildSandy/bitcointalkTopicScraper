ONO was crafted by Ke Xu and her team as a way to combine the community building aspects of social networks and blockchain technology. At a time where user data privacy has been mishandled by certain large companies, ONO is designed to ensure the user has full control over their data.  ONO's community will have the option to exercise a vote that acts as a built-in control to preserve the value of ONOT, the ONO token.  ONOT holders will have the freedom to vote on whether the ONOT created is invest in developers that contribute to ONO apps, goes to content producers, or is destroyed to balance market prices.  The ONOT will be distributed to ONO users for small actions like logging in or trying a new app. Most of the ONOT will go to content producers.  ONO places a high value on exceptional content and have appointed special users called Super Partners to operate as moderators do in forums e. flagging bot accounts, hateful posts, or any content that damages the ONO community.  Super Partners will be elected each October and are paid 2% of the daily ONOT released from the blockchain. The remaining daily distribution is paid to content creators on the ONO network.  For more information, please read the ONO Technical White Paper.
