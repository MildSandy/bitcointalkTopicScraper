Other projects focus on one specific type of marketplace (and often not very well). Hazeian is different, our technology is open and customisable so users can create and earn tokens from a huge range of decentralised services; such as online stores, peer-to-peer marketplaces, payment processors and trading platforms.  Our aim is to keep things simple for users while we handle the complexity of decentralisation and smart contracts. Weâ€™ll be targeting business and users that want to create a decentralised service but donâ€™t have the time or skills to create and manage it.  When we launch, youâ€™ll be able to sign up and create a new decentralised service in a few clicks. You can customise it how you like and weâ€™ll set up and manage everything behind the scenes.  Any more questions just let me know.",False
