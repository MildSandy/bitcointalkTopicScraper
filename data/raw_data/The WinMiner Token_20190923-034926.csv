Pleeeeease!!!!  And i explain: If you run GPUs in a pc with a decent cpu (like core i5 or i7) you can also use the cpu to mine. BUT some coins with small dag file can use all cpu cores and this leaves the machine without processing power to send data to the gpus, so they act as if they have a problem and only mine a couple of coins!! And every time such a coin is introduced the gpu miner stops working properly and we have to manually solve the issue and redo the benchmarks... Now i know you can modify the cpu file of the miner and this works fine, but every time you update the miners the same problem appears! It is not good for us to check every now and then if the miner has updated for these 2-3 coins and if there is a problem again. If you add an option for choosing the cpu threads to be used then it will be solved for ever. Please consider it.  Also, it would be great if you could separate the benchmarks for the cpu and the gpu, and the selection of coins for the cpu and gpu, so we can choose which ones will be mined for each one of them.

Just a few minutes of comparison is not drawing any safe conclusions. But i have watched the fluctuations in earnings and they do fluctuate a lot day to day, so it is not safe to run a system for 24 h using nicehash and then run it next day using winminer and compare. prices may go up or down by at least 10-15%. So the best way would be to run two identical cards or systems for one day and compare them. This would draw a safe conclusion. But unfortunately i do not have 2 systems to test.... Maybe someone else curious to find it out could do it.  For the moment i find that Winminer is an easy way for people who have a spare system and they need to mine easy and nice without all the trouble of making accounts, pools, wallets, keeping an eye on exchange rates etc. It is all too easy for you, but it might earn you less. However, if you have a serious system with many gpus then you'll have to try elsewere.  As for the XMR hardfork i am seeing that we are almost back to where it was (a bit higher, but it is diminishing.). Hope that things will get better...",False

For example yesterday UBQ coin went up by 40-60 % and stayed there for a few hours, while at the same time winminer was mining it for almost the same price as the previous day!! And finally my daily earnings were lower than the previous day!! So i am wondering.... is it selling the coins at a suggested or expected price and keep a safe margin for them?

The first thing that is important to understand is that WinMiner is an ambitious project that aims at making the mining experience as efficient and as simple to enjoy as possible. Mining, exchanging and turning to fiat is not that simple at all, there is no manual to it, it does not necessarily work as one can anticipate, exchanges and other partners get hacked or go on long maintenance periods every now and then, to name a few of the hurdles needed to be addressed...  WinMiner seamlessly does all of the following for its users -  - Optimize the mining process on users machines - Operate pools for all the mined coins - Provide a real time estimate for the value of the mined work - Auto hedge mining profits (in USD) for WinMiner users - so that their balance does not shrink when BTC does (which happens quiet alot lately in services that use BTC as balance currency) - Collect the mined coins - Hedge mined coin price for coins that take hours for their maturity e.g. ZEN - Manage multiple accounts with different exchanges and exchange mined coins into BTC - Exchange BTC into USD - Allow for withdrawal at any time (once a very low min balance is achieved) - Support and maintain a wide selection of withdrawal methods  there is more, but you get the drift..  Now on top of all the above lets look at a couple of the things that can go wrong, and they very often do so - (1) Mining an ""uncle"" - sometimes the block reward for mining comes up, according to the coin protocol, considerably smaller than a standard block - that means lower mining return - e.g. ETH, ETC, UBQ etc.. (2) Some coins take a long time to mature - e.g. ZEN, ZEC - it could be several hours until the block is recieved. During that time prices may go up or down and no sale can be made.. (3) Some coins can not be sold for a long period of time - e.g. the leading exchange for ETN was on a very long (weeks) maintenance for that coin which poses a huge price exposure (4) Hacker attacks on our platform (which happen a lot lately..) (5) Artificial manipulation of coin mining difficulty and other attacks such as self mining (this deserves a separate post..) which may create a sharp misfit between estimated reward and value of work and believe us there are much more...  All the above is to say, that we work very hard to make our users' life very easy and to offer a service with features like no other. We are committed to keep on doing that for you all, though we can not do magic - we can not overcome all the hurdles the crypto space throws at miners, hedge balances offer multiple withdrawals in USD and crypto and still match a theoretical number coming from a mining profitability calculator that sometimes uses not the most updated market data and always assume a frictionless perfect world.   A final comments:  When you do comparisons - make sure you compare apples to apples (e.g. is your balance hedged against BTC price drop? is USD withdrawals offered or is it only BTC? can you withdraw anytime? what is the min. withdrawal amount? how many withdrawal options you have, etc.).  We want your feedback winminers, We would really like to know if you be interested in a 100% crypto WinMiner type service (balance in BTC, withdrawals only in crypto) if it offered higher estimated returns (by giving up the hedging and USD withdrawal methods)?

People need to understand that there will always be problems with any kind of product given when it comes to mining. Glad to see that at least the Winminer team is openly accessible and is seeing our issues and working on it.  As for the payment options, I'm trying to think of acceptable compromises for everyone especially since there are a lot who still want the way things are right now and also some that want higher returns thru crypto payments. I agree with eclark5483 with having a choice for USD exchanges or crypto exchanges, however I think it will only raise issues in the long run if it's in two separate apps since one could just download and run both at the same time in the same system and cause problems for themselves and the Team. So I suggest maybe having a tab in the settings to show your current balance in either USD or BTC(or whichever payout currency available) and have them only payout whichever is shown in their balance. USD exchange for those showing USD, and crypto exchange for those showing BTC/ETH/BCH/LTC.  It would be even better if we could choose crypto exchanges and there were still a way to hedge the mined balance to have a mix of the way things are with better returns in the future.",False

It is good for us to know!  However, i still cannot fully understand why my reported earnings have gone up by just 10-20%, while the ubq price has gone up by more than 60%. Mining hashrate is the same for me, so it should have gone up more. Can somebody else compare his earnings for the last few days?  Also, i have noticed that the real earnings are less than the estimation and that is because the miner is restarting too often! If i stare at it it often restarts every now and then and still mines the same coin again. I am using full benchmark mode. Is this normal? If i zoom in the daily earnings the graph is not constant at all and goes up and down a lot! (sorry couldn't find a way to post a picture here...).  Should i use full benchmark mode or the recommended auto mode? Does anyone have experience with this? I noticed that the full benchmark mode may sometimes enable the twin mining operation, but this increases card temperatures a lot...  As a small miner i am only interested in getting Euros, but other people would find it nice to have BTC or litecoin options, so yes, it would be nice!

I tested nicehash for a few minutes and then run winminer and compared the money they both claimed to make. Winminer was slightly less (but in one occasion it was slightly more!), but not as much as 10-20 %. Maybe just a few percent.  In order to be able to test this in real life you have to mine a specific coin and see how many coins you make in one day. This is the only way to test the efficiency! Otherwise if you look at the money made each minute it changes every half an hour or so... Even more, in the last couple of days i see that one coin might go up and down by as much as 20-30%!!! Money making has gone down in the last 2 days by at least 30%, which is crazy. So, if we want to compare, we should look into the coins made, but winminer does not report coins. So another way is to test winminer for a few minutes, and then switch to another miner, like nicehash and compare immediately. Otherwise prices might change and the result is different!  Of course, the best thing to do is to have two identical systems and run one with Winminer and the other with Nicehash and compare the outcome after one day of use. They would run the same time and at the same exchange rates, so the comparison would be fair. Maybe someone with two identical graphics cards can do it for us and report here.  I find that winminer is useful for people who want to hash with small systems and get some money, while it might also be good for larger systems. But for serious mining setups you might be better with keeping the coins and selling them when the price is right.  There is also a fee for selling coins or exchanging them, so we should keep that in mind too.  Finally i believe that if this price plunge is continued, then most people will shut off their machines, because it is unprofitable any more, unless you do not pay for electricity.

Since NiceHash gives you real time profitability relative to the hash rate registered at the exact time you refresh your browser, which ofcourse fluctate a lot during the hours. So testing for few minutes does not give anywhere near the real life earnings you would get.  To get a clear picture you need to mine for at least  24/48 hours and then you get an average of the earnings per day, which is a proper assesment of the performance provided by the different pools or systems. Winminer, come short of at least 20% than mining Nicehash or for example ETN, ETH at Nanopool, which I have done extensively for 6 months by now.  As per exchanging those coins per USD, EURO or else ,it hardly get more expensive than few pennies or 1 dollar in the case of BTC. Winminer is getting a very good ""cut"" for doing those transactions on your behalf. I understand they need to have a wide ""spread"" on order to protect themselves from fluctations, but obviosly they do it on order to protect their earnings and not giving you a fair deal.  I give you an example: I mine ethereum directly to my wallet at Kraken exchange. I mine about 0.3 ethereum per week. Nanopool takes 1% fee then sends the ethereum directly to  my wallet at Kraken for no fee. At that point the value I get form a dedicated pool, averaging the value of the coin for the given day, is roughly 20% higher than WinMiner's. I exchange what ever amount of Ethereum I received from the pool, for exmplto to Euro, for letterally few pennies. Then I can wire Euros to my bank account for 0.15 Euro per transfer. All transaction combined with nanopool fee hardly gose above 2%. Not mentioning that software developer fee that is applied by any of the miner, it is also applyed when you use Winminer mining with Claymore, Stak, Cast etc...  This apply also for ETN mined at Nanopool, although I have to exchange it first to BTC in Cryptopia before sending it over to Kraken. The cost of it is still very minimal and gives me 18/20% more than using Winminer. BTW it takes a few minutes to do all this transactions and you can do it when ever you prefer. I use Kraken, but you can use any reputable exchange of your liking, that has low fees for wiring in the currency you prefer.  take care!",False

There are many steps, multiple entities, time delays, and many other factors and risks that need to be managed in the process.  When there is an issue with a certain coin (and they happen all the time) e.g. The leading exchange for ETN is not allowing ETN deposits due to exchange maintenance, as the case still is, the chain of monetization of that coin is broken which does not allow us to complete the monetization cycle which means that WinMiner can not sell the mined ETNs and therefore can not price correctly the mining of ETN. In such cases we may need to put that coin on temporary hold on the WinMiner platform, which is what we did in the case of ETN until the issue is resolved.  Running the full cycle gives our users unique benefit of preserving the value of their mining work - mining work is priced in REAL US Dollars (not in bitcoin which is multiplied by theoretical USD exchange rate) and user balance is kept in USD as well (and does not shrink when crypto coins take a dive).  On practical terms, our recommendation is to use the default ""All coins"" and ""All miners"" modes which allow you to benefit from the most robust opportunities WinMiner can make in the market, and allows your machine to seamlessly deal with such technical issues that may happen to certain coins, as we experience with ETN.  Hope this clarifies and hope ETN will be live again shortly.

There are many steps, multiple entities, time delays, and many other factors and risks that need to be managed in the process.  When there is an issue with a certain coin (and they happen all the time) the chain of monetization of that coin is broken, not allowing us to complete the monetization cycle and thus WinMiner can not price correctly the mining of such coin. In such cases we may need to put that coin on temporary hold on the WinMiner platform until the issue is resolved.  We will do our best to have it return soon ",False

A mining profit calculator is just a calculator - it is displaying theoretical data (many times based on averages and not fully updated) - it will not get you the amount it displays in return for your hash power.  2. We are not aware of any other service for monetizing hash power, other than WinMiner, that offers:      (1) Easy and quick withdrawals in US Dollars - PayPal, Amazon and iTunes gift cards, Payeer      (2) Multiple coins as payout methods - BTC, ETH, BCH, LTC      (3) Balance in REAL US Dollars      (4) Hedged Balance (which does not shrink when crypto coins take a dive)      (5) Lowest withdrawal minimum amounts starting from $10  3. Some services which operate solely using Bitcoin may choose to show a ""theoretical"" US dollar estimate. Try turning it into real US Dollars and you will see just how theoretical is that estimate.     4. Unlike other vendors WinMiner does the full cycle for you - coast to coast - from mining coins all the way to hard US dollars (mining software management, coin pools and wallets, exchanges, FIAT gateways to name a few). There are many things that go wrong in the crypto mining world, all the time, and WinMiner does the required adjustments in price and if required even by temporarily disabling a coin.  5. Over promising and under delivering - NOT in WinMiner   Having said the above, we also have some cool news -   We are actively working to strengthen and optimize our network, pools and wallets to drive the mining efficiency and profits higher (e.g. reducing uncle blocks rate, and higher block success rate) - while we can not guarantee anything we are expecting an uplift in rewards starting with ETH and ZEN.

Hope you enjoy v1.111a that we have released yesterday   Apart from bug fixes and a new miner software for Lyra2v2 on AMD cards, it also boasts a very important change to the benchmark algo.  Some of you have complained in the past that the benchmark algo is not sufficiently optimized and that it runs too often. We listened and are in total agreement with that observation. We therefore went on to make several important changes (more changes on the way) to the benchmark algorithm that should provide significantly less benchmark test times and more efficient utilization of your hardware.  You should be able to notice that: - We got rid of the once every 24hrs full benchmark session cycle (when on express mode). - Express benchmark mode (default) will benchmark the most profitable coin, based on crowd wisdom, and will not require any further benchmark checks if performance is in line with the crowd wisdom data. It will use crowd wisdom and actual performance data on the specific machine to optimize. - On going optimization looks at both crowd wisdom data and actual machine performance at greater frequency to make the most of the existing hardware.    We are eager to hear any feedback you may have on the performance of the new benchmark algo so we can fine tune it,  for optimal performance.

Not in awhile.  For performance, I can tell you out of Nicehash, Winminer, & Minergate that Winminer is currently the least stable. Let me be clear that Winminer is my favorite of the 3, but it is unfortunately very buggy.  I use Minergate on some of my low end systems with AMD GPU's since it is the most productive with those setups. Many people say that Minergate ""steals"" hashrate from you. I don't know if they are, but it is more productive than Nicehash or Winminer on those particular machines because it uses the GPU that they won't. I can say that Minergate by far is the most stable software though. I have machines that have run Minergate for weeks without a single reboot or crash. Actually I don't think I've seen Minergate crash EVER, and remember I only use it on my most crappy hardware.  I use Nicehash on my more powerful machines that I can't babysit daily. It seems to produce about the same as Winminer after all is said and done, but I have not done a thorough test. But anecdotally I can say they are very close. Like I said I only use it on machines that I can't get to everyday, and it does crash now and then. But it picks up where it left off after a reboot, so I can ""set it and forget it"" and generally not lose more than 12 hours, even after a crash.  As for Winminer, it is my favorite and I am behind them 100%, but man oh man the bugs are frustrating. Across about 30 machines that are about as diverse as they can be Winminer crashes ALLOT. On many of my machines it crashes multiple times daily. And something in the last 4 or 5 updates (that all came out in the last two days) is really messing up my 1070 and 1080 machines. 2 or 3 now won't GPU mine at all since they get an ""ethminer has stopped working"" crash over and over again. Much worse is that after after a crash, Winminer often ""forgets"" all its settings, so even if I have it set to autorun after a reboot, it won't start mining until I re-enter all the setup details. I lost *days* of mining on some of my machines due to this, which is why I had to go back to Nicehash with them. I've seen several other people complain about this same issue on various forums so I am sure their support is aware of it.  Again, Winminer is my favorite, even with the bugs, and I expect they will all get sorted sooner or later.",False

I can say that Minergate by far is the most stable software though. I have machines that have run Minergate for weeks without a single reboot or crash. Actually I don't think I've seen Minergate crash EVER, and remember I only use it on my most crappy hardware.  I use Nicehash on my more powerful machines that I can't babysit daily. It seems to produce about the same as Winminer after all is said and done, but I have not done a thorough test. But anecdotally I can say they are very close. Like I said I only use it on machines that I can't get to everyday, and it does crash now and then. But it picks up where it left off after a reboot, so I can ""set it and forget it"" and generally not lose more than 12 hours, even after a crash.  As for Winminer, it is my favorite and I am behind them 100%, but man oh man the bugs are frustrating. Across about 30 machines that are about as diverse as they can be Winminer crashes ALLOT. On many of my machines it crashes multiple times daily. And something in the last 4 or 5 updates (that all came out in the last two days) is really messing up my 1070 and 1080 machines. 2 or 3 now won't GPU mine at all since they get an ""ethminer has stopped working"" crash over and over again. Much worse is that after after a crash, Winminer often ""forgets"" all its settings, so even if I have it set to autorun after a reboot, it won't start mining until I re-enter all the setup details. I lost *days* of mining on some of my machines due to this, which is why I had to go back to Nicehash with them. I've seen several other people complain about this same issue on various forums so I am sure their support is aware of it.  Again, Winminer is my favorite, even with the bugs, and I expect they will all get sorted sooner or later.  Even I agree with you mate, I've also used both winminer as well as Nicehash, the experience of Nicehash is really good, although there is something about winminer which makes me stick to it. The new update of winminer looks really appealing.",False

I have done direct comparison to NiceHash and WinMiner in terms of hash speeds and yield.  I do not have the crashing problems mentioned by others on either platform.  I'm compiling the details for a video, but will provide the short of my findings.  ** I haven't edited any configs in either miner app, I plan to do so and test again  NiceHash :   - CryptoNight is significantly slower in comparison to Pool mining and Winminer in my experience - NiceHash wouldn't recognize the CPU , where as Pool and Winminer had no issue using certain drivers. The success rate of drivers working was higher on Winminer in my testing.  Most appealing is the NiceHash 0 fee transfer to CoinBase, and then the ability to 0 fee limit sell on CoinBase or Gdax and withdraw to bank with an aprox 3 day wait.   WinMiner  - Likes to default to ETN which in my testing was not the highest profitability coin, I suppose this could be worked around by setting the priority of the miners and device, but in my opinion defeats the purpose of autoswitching at time when ETN is the highest profitability. - CPU and GPU speeds were almost identical to manual mining application I tested against XMR Stak - I find I need to clear benchmark to manually trigger a worker to change currency, even at the lowest switching %  Most appealing is PayPal payouts, the fee is a bit more than I would like, but the ease of use and speed I like, aprox. 5min trip to my Paypal account, and I'm swiping away on purchases.   I would like to see WinMiner partner with a large exchange and offer 0 fee transfers, or mirror NiceHash Coinbase relationship.

The difficulty changes so drastically and so suddenly that WinMiner can be mining something like ETN (Electroneum) all day long and Sumokoin not being as profitable (say you manually set WinMiner to mine it and you only make 3€ a day), and then, Sumokoin suddenly is very profitable and WinMiner starts mining it at 6€ day per card (on a Vega 64).

It shows 0W power consumption when you are not mining, and when you start mining everything seems fine at first, when the cards begin to work the wattage meter slowly and steadily increases, but... I am pretty sure there is a bug with it, because the metrics never go above 100W.  It stays at 100W for extended periods of time, sometimes it drops to 99W and the like, but it never ever goes above 100W.

My company is an MSP provider in Central Arkansas that also hosts a mining co-location facility.  We spent lots of R&D time for our mining rigs to get 12-GPUs running but essentially you are limited to 8 AMD GPUS using the blockchain driver and 8 NVIDIA using their drivers. That means you can have at most 16 cards with those driver sets. If you were to use the latest AMD drivers you could use up to 12 AMD cards in a system followed by 8 NVIDIA cards. We use a mix of Biostart TB250-BTC Pro and ASUS B250 Mining Expert Boards with 12/19 PCI-e slots respectively. Power connectors is the limiting factor TBH since EVGA and a select others have PSUs with connector counts for more than 4 GPUS on a single PSU. Each rig has a 1300 EVGA G2 series powering the AMD cards pulling 1050W max power when dual mining and a 1000w EVGA G2 powering the NVIDIA cards pulling 855w when dual mining. Everything is housed in a custom build 12-slot chassis we have manufactured by a local company.  As for your question about a bug the power WinMiner is reading is the GPU only power draw which is not the total power of the graphics card as well as the system. A reading of 100w GPU only power should see a reading at the wall of approx 130-140w depending on what's being mined so I'd say everything is working normal.",False

Also it offers really nice payment options. It basically made me discover that is really possible to get paid for the use of my PC.  Then after a week I upgraded to 2 Radeon Vega and from there I began exploring the best use for them and stop using Winminer and began pool mining and later on NiceHash. To make a long story short, now I have a new hobby with a few rigs with Vegas and X580 and I exclusively mine on pools with dedicated software and Nicehash, but only when their Criptonight ""coin"" is very high. However Also on Nicehash I mine with my software (Cast miner) to their pool. I do not use their software, bacause like Winminer, their settings need to be generic for working on almost any PC that they are downloaded to, therefore they cannot be tailored for your specific GPU and you loose quite a bit of performance.  Today I tested again Winminer for a couple of hours on one rig with 6 vegas and although I was getting the right hashing for Ethereum of 43Mhs per card, the projected payout was less than 5 usd per card, instead of 6.5 usd that I would have got mining on a Ethereum Pool at the same exact time. Same for Pirl. I had noticed the same mining Monero 2 months back, which was the reason for stop using Winminer. For Ethereum, I use the exact same software (Claymore 10.0) which is also what Winminer uses under the hood. Today the payout should have been very similar. Beside, today I tried to mine the Cryptonight algo with Electroneum or Sumo , but winminer could not even connect to a pool at that moment that I have tested. Electroneum and Sumo are the most profitable coins at the moment of writing, yet winminer could not even get them to work.  Bottom line, if you are new to mining and you have just a PC with one GPU or a couple of old GPUs and want to make a few bucks, Winminer is a good option, especially for the easy set up and check out they allow you to have. Yet if you have anything better than 2 GPU, is worth taking some time of learning how to mine directly to a large mining pool.",False

Today I switched to All Coins mining mode, and surprisingly enough it kept mining ETN.  The system to switch to the most profitable coin is not always the most accurate, though. Sometimes you get to mine Eth and other algo at 4.50€ card, but I change from All Coins to my manually set Cryptonight coins and when it mines Cryptonight it produces the same or more, however the Vegas run better, they dont heat up as much, so it is always the best choice.  On my Ryzen 1500X and RX 570 I have WinMiner set to All Coins and I dont mind, it makes like 3.50€ day, and as for my laptop's GTX 1050Ti I also set it to Cryptonight coins because the GPU stays in the 48ºC - 50ºC range, which is great for a laptop producing 1€ a day.",False

(Currently it looks like $20 cards with a $1 fee are all that is offered. I know that is 5%, but it actually ends up being 10% for me. See, everything I buy at Amazon I normally purchase with their 5% cash back credit card. If I shop with a gift card that cost me 5% to acquire I also lose that 5% discount.

Wall Street are buying up your Bitcoin!  Whilst you buy Shitcoins hoping to make big profits the elites are taking your Bitcoin from you cheap !  Think about it logically.. Since Wall Street got involved the price has fallen as they short the coin.  Meanwhile mainstream media spread fake news fear and doubt.  Their intention is to get more of the 80% of bitcoin that’s already circulating. They know bitcoin is going to be worth 100x it’s current value.  So whilst you panic sell on fake news I’m buying more and holding for the long term. There is so much development going on behind the scenes with Bitcoin including lightning payment channels for low cost instant transactions for mainstream adoption at merchants and smart contracts that will change many industries over the coming years.  95% of all the token coins will die off over time and only the very best technological applications with real world use will survive. Regulation will also start to take effect in the next 5 years that will dramatically reduce the number of ICO’s and scam token launches.  Think long term and think where we will be in the next 5 years and don’t sell your Bitcoin unless you have to.  This is my opinion and I’m holding on to my bitcoin and only investing into other crypto tokens that I believe have real world use and real utility for the masses. The global elites want your bitcoin and they will do whatever they can to get it off you.  They know and understand the power of a totally decentralised one world currency and they also know that the fiat system is irreparably broken.  The debt bubble is closer than ever to exploding and CryptoCurrency is the pin that will inevitably burst their bubble.  Wall Street are fearful and that’s why they have now gotten involved.  This year the US Nasdaq will launch futures trading and the winklevoss Brothers should have their ETF approved bitcoin the SEC.  Mike Novogratz is working on building a CryptoCurrency bank.  The signs are all there and more money will continue to flow from fiat currencies into crypto. Make sure you are holding on to at least one Bitcoin because those that do will be the new generation of wealth holders on the planet.  ❤❤❤,False

WinMiner Portable isn't as convenient as the classic install version because if there is a power cut, when Windows starts up again WinMiner Portable loses its settings. Which means...everything, from the mining mode -even if you had set it to Farm Mode- to the coins you manually set to mine (I usually choose Cryptonight based coins for the Vega cards, sometimes I set it to All Coins, it depends) and even your email settings and password, so you must set those again! -which can be quite the chore-  It happened to me today twice because the weather has been stormy and I lost a bit of time of mining because when I checked the rig it was doing nothing at all.  An additional suggestion, could we please have a setting to manually choose the coins we want to mine based on the algorithm?   It is a chore to manually set the coins you prefer to mine, and sometimes you forget a new coin that might be using the algorithm you prefer to mine.  For instance, my rig has 5 Vega 64 cards and I prefer to use them to mine Cryptonight related coins. Sometimes it's not easy to track which coins are Cryptonight based and which aren't, and I go to Whattomine and filter by algo, but it's not the most efficient way.

Thanks for your greetings and support!  We have a couple of cool announcements for you –  (1)   We have a new version (v1.102) of WinMiner with features you requested that will allow you to customize the performance logic of WinMiner:  a.   Pre-defined one time benchmark option  Now you can set the benchmark values for your machine once, and no further benchmarking will take place. This is a feature for advanced users who know what hash power their machine delivers and want no benchmarking cycles to take place, thus maximizing mining time. This feature is available on an all new “Benchmark” tab    b.   Define the profit improvement threshold that justifies, in your opinion, a switch to a different coin.  This is a feature for advanced users who can set WinMiner to only switch coins if a certain profit performance boost is anticipated of the change (e.g. only switch if the profit boost is greater than 10%).  The default recommended mode operates at a dynamic threshold per coin which takes into account the different switch time, different coins have.  This feature is available on the updated “Coins” tab  (2)   We have fixed the “Auto start” feature bug.  (3)   We have added the Ella coin to our list of mined coins  (4)   We are about to add (currently available only to beta users) the XVG coin  (5)   Withdrawal options:  PayPal - the $50 holiday season limitation will be lifted shortly. Amazon Gift Cards – Adding Amazon.de and Amazon.co.uk shortly More payment options are in the works  (6)   Finally, we have published some thoughts on the issue of performance comparisons – mining profit calculators and hash rate market places, and how not all Dollars are born equal – you are welcome to have a look and tell us what you think - www.winminer.com/blog/  That is all for now folks.  Great things are coming! Stay tuned…",False

I'm currently mining directly because I was losing 40% of profit with WinMiner, but if this is now fixed I would like to return. It works fine but you'll make less than on, say, MiningPoolHub. I recently experimented a bit and concluded that while something like AwesomeMiner that will sometimes tell you you're minding Digibyte-Skein at $9/day is exaggerating by quite a bit, you do make maybe 15-30% more on MPH (hard to tell you exactly how much more because the prices keep fluctuating). As a small-time miner with only one GPU though, I think I'll stay with WinMiner because it's far less hassle and it's much easier just cashing out to PayPal than mucking around with exchanging cryptocurrencies.",False

By doing so, my CPU stopped to mine 'cos the coin can't be mined with a CPU. That's ok. BUT, I decided to add ETN to the list of coins to mine manually, and here is the issue...  WinMiner decided to avoid Musicoin altogether and mined ETN on both the CPU and the GPU, which isn't what I wanted. I wanted to mine whatever random coin on the CPU and Musicoin on the GPU.

For the idle mining can you verify what mining mode you are running under, automatic, manual, farm. Automatic mode will mine as long as it detects that your system is idle for the allotted time, default 5 min. If it's a dedicated rig this in my experience is the worst mode to run in. Manual mode you hit start and it will mine until you hit stop, for mixed use machines this is the ideal mode in my experience. Farm mode is the best for running a dedicated mining rig.  You stated you were getting disconnect messages. Did you have the option to show command screen enabled and received the error there? If yes do you know what coin it was mining? Did you send an email to support at WinMiner.com to alert them of the outage? If/when a pool goes offline the system will retry automatically and move to a new pool after x number of attempts. If you are like me, you are impatient and don't want to wait for the x number to happen. In this scenario it's best to go into the coin tab and choose manual and deselect the coin that is currently offline, don't forget to re-enable it after the pool is back up though. If you sent an email to support they normally respond to let you know the pool is back up and thank you for reporting it.  I can't give you any advice on why you can only mine for 10-15 min as we have many machines that have been running WinMiner for months without issues. I'd see if you can narrow it down to a specific miner, coin, or if it's a process running on your computer.",False

When running the benchmark it reports that I'm getting 12-14GPB per day.  However when it actually starts mining (on the same coins that the benchmark gives that GBP value) it drops to 8-10 GBP per day.

Since version 1.94 it's had a bad rep for choosing the wrong pairing when dual mining. Check your command log and see what miner it's using. If it's the ClaymoreDualEthBlake70 or 100 miner, disable it and the program will choose the other dual miner which will in most cases improve your hashrate and profitability.  The two mentioned miners have the secondary coin option defaulted to -i 70 and -i 100. The other miners have it defaulted to -i 30 which will yield better results in most situations.",False

This results in tons of transactions using all the payment options available which we diligently operate for you. Supporting a large number of BTC withdrawals every day, together with the fact that most users opt for the low fee option and a highly congested network ends up in transactions which wait for the network load to subside in order to get confirmed.  Our BTC payment method is standard, it is the same one we have used since day one and the chain you are referring to, which is caused by the delayed confirmations, is how the blockchain operates. Here is some current information to put things at perspective: - There are over 183000 unconfirmed transactions on the BTC network - see here https://btc.com/stats/unconfirmed-tx - To have a transaction confirmed pretty quickly the current recommended fee amounts to no less than 16$  On a side note, each such unconfirmed transaction holds up not only the amount withdrawn by a user but also another amount that belongs to WinMiner (a BTC requirement), so our interests are aligned with yours in getting this resolved asap.  There are a couple of things that we do to address this BTC network situation: (1) We keep re-broadcasting these transactions to help them get confirmed (2) We have temporarily disabled the low fee BTC option and introduced an Economy fee (together with the High fee) - which appears to be sufficient to get the transactions confirmed (3) Should transactions be abandoned and money returned to WinMiner we will of course restore your balances. (4) We are showing a notice to anyone choosing BTC withdrawal advising of the possible implications and suggest preferring ETH and LTC  Hope this will be resolved shortly...      ",False

I will have to assume that the reported fees collected for the hash rate are accurate for the coins that were being mined (I have no way to determine the ""live value"" of the contract being fulfilled)  When the hash rate is compared to the reported statistics (once again assuming that the $US is being reported correctly) over a 30 minute period where my miners were working on the same currency for the entire time with not breaks of service or re-benchmarking, the live assessed value breaks down to 4.3666 cents US per 10 minute reporting period, while statistics reporting for the same period breaks down to 3.884 cents per 10 minute reporting period (over a 22% difference).  I specifically chose a time period without large fluctuations, limited my mining to 2 currencies, averaged over 3 reporting periods, and verified hash rates and expected pay rates once a minute for 30 minutes starting at the reported start time for a reporting period.  I do not know how to make this any more of a legitimate test of hash integrity than this.  I will also say that the payout amount does match the total amount on the statistics page with obvious rounding to the nearest cent only on the final payout amount (not every reporting period like some organizations do to pad the bottom line).  I will gladly reverse this post and fully support Winminer if there is a reasonable explanation for this, but for now what my log and the live reporting are very close to what my computer is telling me it is doing.  And the idea that the live reporting is in error (even if my computer is telling me that it is doing the work that is being reported) and the numbers on the stats page are correct (even though they don't even come close to what is being done by the rig), and trust them they are doing the right thing for us, I am having a hard time believing that.  Especially after the NiceHash and the MtGox incidents that I have worked through.  I don't begrudge a ring from a little skimming to aid in the founders retirement plan (after all they did provide the services that you are making money on), and I don't bitch about a 3% fee for transfer of funds (the price of doing business).  I do think that 22% skim is going a bit too far to look legitimate to me.  What I believe is the live reporting is reporting the correct mining, but they have not figured out how to add (or subtract in this case) the skim program into the live version, so the discrepancy is being blamed on the live reporting being inaccurate.  I might be paranoid (doesn't mean that they are not out to get you all the time), but I know what my equipment should be doing, I know what work my equipment has done, and I know that the amount being reported is not correct.  Please let me know if you have any questions about this analysis.  If anybody has any reasons that would explain this discrepancy that I have not listed or discussed please let me know.  The truth is the ultimate sanitizer of all theories.",False

This is the hardest piece to scale and we approach it by streamlining and making the data crunching more efficient and by scaling the hardware. Both take time. However no data is lost so balance display should catch up to the right numbers even if delayed. Let us know if you are seeing something odd there.  (2) VTC - We brought it back and it appears there is something wrong with the share data collection. We are monitoring it and fixing it on the go and will update balances for work that we can identify that has not been compensated for.

My payout is lower than the payout chart, the payout chart is lower than the live reporting, and my logs do really agree with any of the numbers. 2)  I was willing to say they are just working out the bugs of doubling their user base in a day, and I do give them credit that they did keep it up and running (with some issues, but nothing that could not be explained), and the payments were uneven due to the large contracts and over use of the network available, but things are just not adding up.  My balance moved up 2.12 today (24hr power on and mining), while my logs show, and the live tracker was showing that I should have mined in the range of 7-8 in the same period.  But I have to ask who is the customer of the contracts that we are mining? 3)  I would also like to see at what rate we are mining, in the coin that we are mining.  That way we could see what the payout actually was.  They kept me mining, and I really appreciate that, but I am seeing some troubling issues.

They should make about $1.75-$2.00 a day each so I'm going to average that to $1.87. So $1.87 x 2 should be about $3.75 per day.  In addition to this I'm also CPU mining using Winminer with a 4770K and I'm going to say that makes about $0.25 per day even though Winminer reports much higher mining SUMO ($0.29-$0.33).  So I've mined about 72 hours now and during that time I should have mined somewhere near 3.75 + $0.25 (Day 1) + 3.75 + $0.25 (Day 2) + 3.75 + $0.25 (Day 3).  Expected results should be somewhere around $12.00 based upon these numbers.  Unfortunately I can report that Winminer's balance on the account is about half that and it currently sits at $6.25.  I'm seeking to understand what's going on here as I know Winminer has been having some issues but a near 50% loss is significant enough for me to move this test rig on to something else. Is this simply an issue with the balance not reporting correctly or does Winminer have some kind of lag on balance reporting? I know others have made similar reports but it seems like something is very wrong here, this isn't even close to expected results.  I hope this information can provide some insight into what is being experienced in the field by users and can be addressed quickly.",False

The huge influx of users growing the system ten times bigger in just 24 hours overloaded various components of the platform, as can be imagined. Ever since then, we have been working around the clock to scale the platform to its new size. We have blocked entrance of new users for the time being and are dealing with piece after piece of the platform so we can restore the quality of service you were all used to on WinMiner as soon as possible.  Users of WinMiner are affected by these changes in several ways -  (1) New users are blocked from the platform at this time.  (2) Balance data:         - Update frequency - Balance data gets continuously recorded on our databases but the display on the WinMiner client and dashboard gets updated once an hour         - Lagging data - We have completed adding of lagging share data to users balances.  (3) Coins/Pools         - Some of the coins and pools have temporarily been taken down (e.g. ETN, VTC) - we intend to getting them back up asap         - New coins/pools we were about to open up are now being delayed  Naturally, these developments take their toll on the performance and the profits you all see but at the same time users are mining and everyone can withdraw in the wide options we offer, whenever they want (and we see lots of withdraws which is great )     We want to assure you again that we are doing everything we can to bring the platform to its full performance and potential asap and we want to thank you all for your patience and trust - we know its not obvious, especially in the crypto environment...we trully appreciate it!!

First and foremost they did payout my $100 withdrawal request within 18 minutes via Litecoin when I opted to proceed with a withdrawal. Yeah!!!!  Second I emailed them about Vertcoin being removed which took about 28 hours for them to respond via a professional and honest written email. (Not bad considering that they are most likely scrambling at this point) and its now back in service. In my opinion Not bad at all.  To the numbers side of things:  My 5 rigs that are using their systems and here is what I am throwing at them....  1. Core I7, 1 X 980TI and 1 1060 3GB (The cheapies 03G-P4-6160-KR) 2. Core I7, 1 X 1060 6GB 3. Core I5, 8 X 1080 (Non TI versions) 4. Core I5, 9 X 1060 3GB  (The cheapies 03G-P4-6160-KR) 5. Core I5, 8 X 1060 3GB  (The cheapies 03G-P4-6160-KR)  So...Within 2 1/2  - 2 1/4 days I have earned $103 and pulled out $100. This would have been about $120-$130 on Nicehash. MUCH BETTER THAN MINERGATE!!!!!  My thoughts are this...  Initially it set off Windows Defender and Sophos antivirus systems badly... It took some noodling to place the files in a non scanned folder to get everything to work as intended.  Winminer .... It does work and its not a bad system at all. The UI isn't bad although it has hickuped a few times what I see is that it is really missing GPU temps and fan speeds.  Winminer's switching between mining pools /algos takes a bit longer than I would prefer. NH would do this rapidly however it seems as if with the WinMiner seems to take an extra minute or so to figure out which algo to work on.  Winminer does struggle with picking the best algo to use / mine. I have watched and noodled throughout the day on trying to figure out what pays best with my hardware. Sometimes its VTC,  other times its ZEN and sometimes HUSH. As said previously the system does not always seem to pick the best algo.  Winminer software has only crashed 1 time on 1 of my 5 machines all of which are using pretty heavy overclocks so I am not seeing their software crash as many others have reported.  I am not getting pixilation or any other issues while running Winminer on any of my 5 rigs although I did have to clear my benchmarks on Day 1 to get my CPU's involved...  Given the influx of new members I am sure that are many trying to join this system they are slammed in all shapes and forms but are trying to keep up.  Overall I am not unhappy with their system or service and I hope they continue to improve on their UI, add more coins and work on their automated coin / profit selection software.

If it actually managed to run for more than an hour or two before crashing, the returns (based on the bench's and predictions it was showing me) would have been considerably less than NH.  NH was always stable. Never had crashing issues with it. Machine is stable. Nothing is OC'd. Pretty much everything non-essential was removed form startup long ago.  So, for now, I'm back to running BOINC (which is also nice and stable) for GRC on all available devices. But I'll need to set up some alternative mining on the GFX card to cover the running costs.

I actually knew these things, but it's always good to refresh.  What I'm saying is that I set it for ""Regular"" benchmark and it did not try all combinations. It only tried one, and stopped trying any further. Likewise, the ""Benchmarking"" message has been stuck on the UI, regardless of whether or not the app was actually benchmarking anything.  I've seen the ""expected"" process on my other machine, so I know what it should look like. Ran them all, message went away, began mining as expected, switching as expected. All is well on that machine.  Now, I didn't know that it would re-check every 24 hours, so I guess I can just let it sit and when jobs return see if it actually does so. Still, I wouldn't be mad at a method to ensure I've cleared it of all benchmarks and try to start from scratch, if it's at all possible. If not, I can afford to wait and see.  Good luck with your growing pains! I know how it goes, I'm sure you'll get it all sorted out soon.  Edit: I'll be damned if I didn't kill both instances this morning, re-launch, and it went and benchmarked everything. Now it's doing precisely what I'd expect.

Like the project, but I've got a bit of an odd issue I'm hoping you can help with.  On my multi-card rig, some sort of error occurred during benchmarking.

Instead, it completely benchmarked the one Nvidia card, but all 4 AMD cards have been on ZEN and ZEN only since I started. Checking the Benchmark history, it just didn't even try to bench anything else for the AMD cards.  Interestingly, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, thinking this would force it to re-benchmark everything, but it seems that once again the AMD cards are straight to mining zen while the Nvidia goes through a series of benchmarks.  Am I nuts? On my other rig, a single AMD card, it benchmarked as expected and has switched here and there as profits moved around.  Is there any way to ensure I have truly knocked out all previous benchmarks and really start from a clean slate on the multi-card rig?",False

Here is a quick explanation about benchmarking on WinMiner - (1) Benchmarking - Target - This metric shows up before benchmarking takes place, and it is based on crowd wisdom logic - it analyzes the performance of very similar hardware by other users on WinMiner and gives out an expected target metric. The idea is that users will have an estimate of what realistically they can expect before the full cycle of benchmarking is completed. (2) Benchmark modes -     (a) Express (default) - in this mode the benchmarking will commence with the combination most likely to provide the best performance for the specific hardware, and then once in a while attempt a different combination to make sure the best combination is indeed the one being mined. This mode gets a user up and running with max performance asap.     (b) Regular Benchmark - in this mode all combinations will be tried out, one by one until the most profitable combination is chosen In addition, once every 24 hours hardware will be examined per each algo for hash poer performance.  Hope this clarifies :-)   ",False

With nicehash you have to wait till they decide to pay you.   With nicehash you run the risk of a bitcoin drop negating any profits for you mining (because they pay in bitcoin you earn a % of bitcoin a day.  If bitcoin drops the value of what you mine drops), this happened to me 4x and I was pretty much done with nicehash.  I would mine for 10 days and lose about 20% of the value because bitcoin went down when they paid me out.  Because Winminer pays you in USD immediately, if I earn 15.00 today, I will have 15.00 in my wallet even if bitcoin drops by 1/2 tomorrow.   You can buy the dips...If you are interested in keeping some bitcoin, eth, ltc, ect.... you aren't stuck at a certain price point.  You can keep the money in your wallet and when a coin drops purchase the coin rather than being stuck at an ""all time high"".  You can wait a few days and get in a coin at a price point you are comfortable with.   Winminer is just better all around....",False

It just works straight out of the box even for a novice like me.. Last week it allowed me to get up and running on a regular PC which I normally use for Photoshop work, within minutes, not knowing anything about this ""Mining Thing"" at all. I have been lurking around sites and miners for the past few days and for somebody novice is rather complicated, and not because it is very complicated... but because generally the documentation is very light, not well written and is not professional, which is going to be a put off for a lot of people. Said that, WinMiner was the easiest of all to get on going, at least for me. The possibility of automatically switching miner and currency on a snap, is what makes this application more interesting of the other popular ones, together with the possibility of taking you payment out in Paypal as well.  I have installed one of those Vegas 56, followed few tutorials and got it to work for XMR at an average 1950Hs reliably at 65C, and 135W, without BIOS hack, using ""cast_vega_xmr"" miner. Unfortunately this miner is not available on WinMiner and I was wondering if you have planned of adopting it in the future. For XMR, WinMiner uses Claymore which run the Vega 56 at a maximum of 1435Hs, that makes at current today exchange a difference of 1.2 USD per day. Also mining ethereum in winminer the Vegas reach only 29Mh max instead of the 43MH that is capable of.  Since I have bought 3 more Vegas and I'll be setting up a rig next week, i was hoping ""cast_vega_xmr"" will be on your plans. People are buying Vegas like there is no tomorrow, they are almost sold out everywhere.  Thank you for your hard work and cheers!",False

While they should be pretty much the same, in reality it is not always the case, especially when it comes to new and volatile coins such as BTG. If you look up the price of BTG at this very moment you will see that the price on Yobit is about $250 whereas on coinmarketcap.com its $158, and this is still only on paper and not a real market selling price Recently, we had the opposite situation with ETH where calculators missed an opportunity to mine ETH that WinMiner users enjoyed. Another recent example was a drop in the block size of EXP from 8 to 4 that was not updated on various calculators for a couple of days.  Our point is that when comparing, you have to compare the commitment behind the numbers - a calculator data has no commitment behind it (The calculator site will not commit to buy your hash power at the rate shown by the calculator) it is an estimated/theoretical number that could be very detached from real life data.  As BTG becomes more stable with greater volume and visibility the discrepancy between calculator estimates and real mining numbers should hopefully diminish.  Hope this clarifies.

I am just holding out a little bit for them to stabilize again and move my rigs over to them.  I am not putting them down.  Just offering my 2 cents.  I honestly think they are doing awesome given the newness.  Just can't afford to loose money on my rigs.  I am experimenting though.  Also, I see people complaining about fees.  I use nicehash with their internal wallet and then transfer out when I have a large amount which is cheaper than going to an external wallet.  I see the profits being about the same with transfer fees including the paypal fees if you do it right.  I think this is very good alternative and hope it keeps improving because it gives people more choice.  Also nicehash all depends on the people buying the hashing power and I have seen dips at times.  With this you are mining the actual coin it seems which gets converted to dollars and if you want bitcoin then they offer an option for it and transferring even with fees comes to about the same with my calculations so far.  Winminer depends on the volatility of the coins not people buying contracts which I think is a plus and more stable in the long run in my opinion.  So all I have to say is great work and please don't take my criticism as trashing the program.  It is only to help you guys improve and I am believing in it already!  Just not convinced enough to move my operation over yet but I am confident that I will very soon after some more testing!  On another note.  The software reads all my 1070 cards and one 1080ti card on my rig.  But when it starts hashing it shows my 1080 ti hashing at the same rate at my 1070s and it shows one of my 1070s hashing at the rate that my 1080ti should be hashing.  So I get the right hash rate but the software is reporting on the wrong card.  Not sure if this is a known issue. ",False

I couldn't send bitcoin 3 days ago because it was about 9.00 to do a transaction, 13.xx to send it priority.  That is simply crazy.  While the fees have dipped down a little, bitcoin is still expensive to send.  Then bitcoin is slow as dirt.  My last transaction took almost 3 days sending it with ""normal"" priority.

I get right about the same for both when I randomly check, maybe .25-.50 a day difference.  Being able to cash out into paypal or bitcoin when ever I want far outweighs any small nuance.  For example, when bitcoin drops, I can cash out into bitcoin.  When bitcoin is up, I just keep my balance in winminer.  I can just keep buying dips.  With nicehash, several times bitcoin dropped when I got paid out which lowered my profit for the period.  You can make quite a bit by just buying the dips, far exceeding any fees charged.

I just went to cash out, and checked your exchange rate.  $10 = .00228387, which is an exchange rate of 4378.532928756891.  However, the current exchange rate is $4260.23, that means your exchange rate is almost 3% higher than the actual current exchange rates.  This means we get less BTC than we are due (lower price = more BTC in the exchange).  At first I thought.. Oh, they must not update the price that often.. except I refreshed the page a few times over a few minutes, and saw the price updating.  So you seem to be updating the price constantly, which means you are deliberately charging a higher exchange rate, which combined with your WinMiner Fee + your flat transaction fee (despite the fact that the actual fee you set the transaction to is much lower) means we're paying something like 7% fees (depending on amount withdrawn).  That's pretty high.   I don't begrudge you making money, but this is a ""hidden"" fee, and deceptive.  If you're going to charge a premium, then you should make that clear.

That means that your balance (in USD) is guaranteed and protected from coins fluctuations. To do so, WinMiner exchanges coins mined into USD. When a user wants to withdraw, we take the balance (in USD) and carry out the user withdrawal order, whether a PayPal transfer (in USD) or BTC or ETH (in which case we purchase the coins for the user and make the transfer). When buying ETH or BTC using USD a fee is imposed by the exchange, usually in the form of an exchange rate. Hope this clarifies.  BTW, at the request of our users we are working on adding a feature that will allow users to choose their own base currency - that way a user that wants to be exposed to the volatility of a certain coin and would want to withdraw in that coin could keep his balance in that coin and avoid exchange costs.

It continues to do so today and we keep making it better with our own insight together with the wisdom of our contributing users. This is to say that, our interests here are aligned, we are miners like you are and strive for best overall performance just like you do. We are the first to suffer from inefficiencies if such exist.  Specifically to your points:  (1) Hashrate - is it really constant? The short answer is yes. The more accurate answer is divided into two: (a) Hashrate of a GPU generally has a certain max value, but it does sometimes fall beneath it. It could be for a shorter or longer periods of time and may be the results of overclocking, environmental conditions, operating system, drivers, CPU load (which may have a substantial impact on GPU performace) etc.; and (b) Coins having a DAG, e.g. Ethereum, mean that your hardware hashrate will change every few days (e.g. 5 days in the case of Ethereum). To avoid a situations in which a system performance is based on the wrong hashrate reading, whether the result of a sudden drop or changing DAG, we decided to have the benchmarking run once every 24hrs.  (2) Can all coins based on the same algo be bechmarked by just one coin? The short answer is yes. The more accurate answer is again divided into two: (a) Non ethash coins - bechmarking one coin is sufficient, and that is what we do; and (b) ethash coins (ETH, ETC, EXP, UBQ, MUSIC, DBIX etc.) - benchmarking needs to be done taking into account the DAG size - and that is what we do (here we minimize the need for benchmarking by categorising the coins into groups based on their DAG size and doing benchmarking once for the entire group).  Is there room for further optimization? - definitely Are we working at it? - we sure do.     ",False

This is really NOT recommended for a rig of multi GPUs, especially with a Pentium CPU. A high load on a CPU, which is what you are probably getting by having it mine, can substantially hurt the performance of any GPU, let alone a rig of 8 GPUs like the one you have.

So the dynamic algo of WinMiner takes into account the expected switch time while looking for stability in the attractiveness of a certain coin over the others, before attempting to switch.  Its interesting to see in the feedback we receive that different users have very different taste when it comes to switching - some want it no more frequent than once a day while others want to rapidly switch, the moment an opportunity unveils. We aim for the golden path that maximizes profits for everyone   Perhaps we should be adding some manual customizing capabilities to the switching algo so every user could tailor it to his/her taste - what do you say?",False

Hardware: 6 1080Ti's and a 1070  Oh, and according to the Job Decision grid, it claims that it should be mining ZEN for $25/day, but it's not.  (Benchmark was just performed 30 minutes earlier as well, so it was relatively fresh)  Yeah, yeah, I know.. prices change, difficulties and hashrates change.. But this is not an isolated example.  NiceHash used to beat you guys around 50% of the time a few days ago, and 50% of the time you were significantly more profitable.  That has stopped.  I have yet to find a single instance in the last few days where your profitability has exceeded NH (even though the job decision grid claims it should be).  Frequently, you're $3-5 and sometimes as much as $10 less profitable.  And that's not even counting all the lost profit from benchmarking every time I turn around.  Speaking of which, some of those benchmarks run a LONG time.. 20-30 minutes.  That's crazy.",False

We take great joy when something we create is being so warmly embraced and even more so receiving great feedback, the warm words of support, but no less, the wise advises, ideas, bugs to be fixed – you guys are our rock stars!  (1) Profitability ideas:       - We continue working on the switching mechanism in an effort to optimise its performance.       - We know there is still room for performance optimization - but 70% difference in performance sounds more like a bug - please send us logs so we can take a look       - Your ideas are great and we surely explore them further in our continuous effort for max profits. (2) Watchdog       - WinMiner_service is a watchdog   (3) Auto update       - We might add an option to disable auto update BUT even then some updates will have to be automatic and mandatory - e.g. when client-server protocol changes mining will not be possible without an update.. (4) Intensity settings per each miner       - That would be cool. This would probably take the form of adding an additional command line for each miner/algo. The thing is that at the moment the command line for each miner may take a totally different form which is not convenient.. We are thinking on how to solve this in the best way. Stay tuned.. (5) Cleaning WinMiner icons in tray       - Dev team is looking into this. Thanks for reporting. (6) Live dashboard, required refresh       - Work on getting this page to perform as we want it to is still in progress...sorry for the inconvenience...we will get it right    In the meantime you may want to wait a bit before refreshing, sometimes it takes a few seconds for the data to flow.. (7) Additional coins       - We are adding coins all the time and we have noted your request for FTC and SIB. Keep in mind that due to the one click nature of WinMiner adding a coin means apart from the right miner, the right configuration etc. also the entire food chain that follows including the exchange handling etc. but hey, we never complain about hard work     (8 ) No job on server for XMR       - Please send logs (and make sure ""enable debug log"" option is checked) so we can nail this down. (9) Live dashboard – removing miner does not work       - Noted. Thanks for reporting. On dev team to do list.. (10) Exit – yet service is still running       - This is not a bug, it is the watchdog which is a Windows service aimed at bringing the main WinMiner app to life if for any reason it crashes or is unresponsive for any reason. It should not be taking up any resources, and being in the background waiting for the moment WinMiner is launched means the best possible watchdog performance.  Great points!

That means that your balance (in USD) is guaranteed and protected from coins fluctuations. To do so, WinMiner exchanges coins mined into USD.  When a user wants to withdraw, we take the balance (in USD) and carry out the user withdrawal order, whether a PayPal transfer (in USD) or BTC or ETH (in which case we purchase the coins for the user and make the transfer).  When buying ETH or BTC using USD a fee is imposed by the exchange, usually in the form of an exchange rate. In your case the exchange rate was ~400USD for ETH by the exchange.  Deducing our fees (3% = 1.5USD) and the ETH transfer fees (~0.2USD - you can verify that looking at the block explorer for your ETH transfer) from 50USD brings your net to ~48.3USD.  ~48.30USD would buy you 0.12069685 ETH at the exchange and this is the amount we transferred to you.  Hope this clarifies.  BTW, at the request of our users we are working on adding a feature that will allow users to choose their own base currency - that way a user that wants to be exposed to the volatility of a certain coin and would want to withdraw in that coin could keep his balance in that coin and avoid exchange costs.

I have been trying it on my Gaming PC/Part Time Miner, Core i5-7500+RX580 8GB+RX560 4GB, I could use it on my mining Rigs, and recommend it to my Gaming Community, but I need to solve the following.  First my doubts: - How do you calculate the revenue per day and I guess the currently mined coin?, I mean, do you consider the current price?, do you sell the coins at that price upon reaching certain amount?/or time?.  Problems: - Only minor ones now, major ones got solved before I finished this message. - WinMIner.com Live Dashboard got offline message if not used after a while, I have to open again the window from the program. - GPUs do not start to work in some occasions, they stay idle when restarted after stopping the mining process to do some other thing, I will try to get the cause and report back.  Ideas: - As some have already suggested, dcri control and voltage control are critical, my RX580 needs a 38 dcri and my RX560 a 24 dcri, so they are not working at their best now while mining EXP. - I usually undervolt my cards on the Miner, now I am using AB with WinMiner, with the RX580 the OC is ok, the undervolt only reachs -96mV, so its running hot or/and noisy now, the RX560 is not usually a problem as it doesn't consume too much power, but it can not be undervolted on AB and if OC it never reaches the specified clocks, so I got only 2 MH/s, maybe a driver, AB version, etc., problem, but anyway, it could be great to add a way to control dcri, voltage and clocks in WinMiner, obviously while keeping it friendly for any casual Miner/Gamer.

Without the logs it’s really hard to put a finger on the possible cause (dual CPU or operating system compatibility could be on the list to name a few..), were you mining in “all coins” mode or did you choose specific coins?  What happens when WinMiner is down We have built WinMiner in a way that in a case it ceases to operate (e.g. a crash) for whatever reason, the miners can continue to work and they do so for the benefit of the user. Therefore, in the situation you described, your CPU was working to increase your profits even though WinMiner was not running. (BTW You don’t have to take our word for it, you can simply run a test, kill WInMiner, then let the miners continue to work and check the balance after 10 minutes)  Live dashboard This was released a few days ago and like any infant has to walk before it can run J That means that there are still issues in its operation and sometimes it may report an online rig as being offline. We are ironing out the issues with the dashboard but in the meantime, when in doubt check the WinMiner app window for the real data.   Admin mode Some miners require admin mode to be run effectively, so to get best performance we recommend running WinMiner in admin mode.  Hope this addresses your questions and concerns - let us know if you need further clarifications.  Looking forward to having you back on WinMiner ",False

I use a saved profile for this. 2) When WinMiner starts actively mining, it wipes out my configuration 3) The configuration in MSI-A actually remains, but I cannot re-apply without a small change, so I make the small change and re-apply. 4) Winiminer changes miners/coins/etc - I make the small change and re-apply as in #3.

WinMiner base currency is USD, that means that the balance you see in your account is guaranteed against fluctuations in price of digital coins. For this purpose we keep your balance in USD. When you choose a method in which you wish to withdraw your funds we take the balance (in USD) and make the required actions needed to enable the withdrawal. In the case of a BTC withdrawal we need to exchange the USD amount into BTC this exchange entails a fee that in many cases does not come in the form of a ""fee"" but rather embedded in the exchange rate.  At the request of our users, we are now working on adding a feature that will allow users to choose the base currency of WinMiner, that way, you will be able, if you so wish, to keep your balance in BTC and withdraw in BTC without exchange fees.

See the graph of unconfirmed transactions here - https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#30d  .  The load on the Bitcoin network causes transactions with low transactions fees to be pushed back on the queue and high transaction fee deals get prioritized. As a result WinMiner withdrawals in BTC (which are using a relatively low transaction fee) take longer than usual to confirm.  Any WinMiner withdrawal transaction made and not yet confirmed can be seen by searching for the transaction number on sites like https://blockchain.info/ .    Such transaction will be confirmed as the load on the Bitcoin network eases up. There is nothing we can do to speed this up or cancel the transaction – these are the rules and the nature of the Bitcoin network.  To assist users who insist on Bitcoin withdrawals and are willing to pay a higher transfer fee (which will put the transaction in high priority and shorten the expected confirm time) we are working on offering an option to opt into a fast, high commission transaction.  So what does that mean to you:  If you already made a withdrawal in Bitcoin and it is still unconfirmed – Patience is the only remedy.  If you are about to make a withdrawal you should consider the following: 1.   Withdrawal in ETH gets a much faster confirmation 2.   Withdrawals in BTC: - Make a withdrawal and wait for the network confirmation - Wait for the high transfer fee and priority solution - Write to support[at]winminer.com and ask for a manual BTC withdrawal using high transfer fee. 3.   Withdraw using one of the other payment methods – e.g. PayPal  Hope this helps",False

Both are very volatile (especially the difficulty in certain coins e.g. SIGT – which is one of the coins you were mining per the logs). To understand the magnitude of volatility we would just say that seeing the profit drop by 80% and/or double within a minute is not uncommon. This alone could explain switching to a lower profit coin, so if mining is at, let’s say, 3$/day one minute and the next minute due to surging difficulty the very same coin would profit just 1.5$/day, then switching to the next best coin at 2.4$/day would be the right thing to do.  But there is more  ..  (2)    Benchmarking – testing of all mining options is fundamental. In WinMiner we introduced a next generation benchmarking, called Express, which incorporates crowd wisdom while also enjoying the full benefits of all options benchmarking to achieve great performance out of the box. We do that by testing the top performing options, based on other users work choice on similar machines, and then periodically (every 30 mins) test another option until all options are tested (we of course continue price monitoring and benchmarking continuously).  Your logs show that you were on Express benchmarking (which is the default) which could explain a quick benchmark option test every 30 mins or so until benchmarking is complete.  Lastly, we are working to enhance our nVidia miners and profit options. The same optimization algo would max profits for both AMD users and nVidia users in the same way, so without a significant benefit creating separate versions for AMD users and for nVidia users is probably just more overhead..  Sorry for the lengthy response…we wanted you to have all the info..  Thanks for using WinMiner, for the warm words and keep on sending feedback.   ",False

First let us start by saying that we want WinMiner to be the product of choice for any card type owner – so here is to all the “notsobad” card owners out there – we are here for you!  Sgminer issue – mining Bitcoin is for a long time not feasible on hardware which is not dedicated for Bitcoin. The issue we have had with the coin DMD is now resolved.  Your comment re fluctuating profit metrics is a great opportunity to understand one of the great advantages of WinMiner. But first lets clarify a very important point – WinMiner was created to, and indeed manages our rig farm machines therefore you can rest assured the numbers you see on WinMiner are real and reflect real time data. We do not make up numbers. The cause of fluctuating metrics is real time changes in the difficulty metric and the coin price metric. If you study these metrics for KRB as an example you will understand how intense the volatility is for this coin. Now we get to the cool part, with WinMiner you can ride the waves of such volatility to max your profits (you are welcome to see the live comparison here  https://www.screenleap.com/winminer) – WinMiner continuously monitors and takes advantage of this volatility for your benefit. You can always decide to avoid coins with high volatility by unchecking them on your settings screen, but then again why not enjoy the extra profit? Anyway the steering wheel is in your hands..   We work hard to make WinMiner do all the hard work for us and for you, but there is one thing it can not, and no one else can do, and that is visibility into the future. No one knows what the difficulty and prices of coins will be in the next 10 seconds let alone in the next month, so unfortunately there is no way to guarantee the rate of return on your hardware investment. You simply have to make a decision whether you jump in knowing there is zero visibility. If its of any comfort, you are not alone in this dilemma, yet we think it will be fare to say that to this date we doubt if anyone regrets jumping in, the real regret is probably not jumping in with a mightier computing power… but then again this is not a recommendation to buy or not to buy hardware. If you do jump in, we believe you will be very happy running WinMiner on your rig and so will we.   Finally, your comment on the user interface is noted, we are considering how to do that without overloading the screen with too much confusing data. Stay tuned.  Hope this clarifies.",False

However, there's room for improvement. Even greater thanks for sending us the important feedback that can help us become better every day.   Firstly, it seems quite inconsistent with how it calculates earnings - like the guy above me said.... It seems that WinMiner fluctuates A LOT with mining XMR for $.30 a day to KRB for $.70 a day. How come? Is this due to the currencies changing in value so frequently or what?...  Is it possible that the currency is changing in value so quickly and so frequently?  (1) Winminer reports only true and real numbers. (2) Certain coins experience high fluctuations in price as well as mining difficulty e.g. KRB (3) WinMiner takes advantage of price and difficulty fluctuations to max profits (4) You can choose to avoid coins with high fluctuations and enjoy more stable, yet lower, profits. Please look at our full response to this matter - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2004875.msg20711549#msg20711549   Also, I am doing CPU mining, so I will only have CPUs selected to do mining and not GPUs. However, even with the on board GPU displayed in the Available mining devices and unselected, it still says Mining: KRB @ xxxh/s = $$$ - and it's the exact same number as the above CPUs. Does that mean it's really using the GPU to mine too, or not? Very confusing. Sounds like a bug :-) Sorry for that. Could you please send us log files? (Help>Send error reports, make sure ""send log files"" is checked, and please write your nickname so we can know its from you) This will really help us track it down quickly.   I am mining through a VM, so was wondering what the best config for CPU would be - how to configure the CPU bit? Are results likely to be the same if I configure the VM with 1 CPU with 16 cores or 16 separate CPUs with 1 core? This is a great point to clarify - There are a couple of things to remember re virtual machines: (1) the sum of multiple VM instances can not be greater and will almost certainly be lower than the performance of the host machine; (2) A GPU can only be allocated to one ""machine, either real or virtual (dont expect to have the GPU allocated to multiple VMs)   Does anyone have experience in whether it's better to use Linux & NiceHash or other apps instead of Windows? I heard it's usually better on Linux but didn't really have that experience, so I'm not sure what to think. My knowledge is limited so it might be that I didn't configure something properly :'D . Linux allows for greater creativity in rig buiding - e.g. more GPUs etc. but should not provide different performance vs. Windows.    Also, would it be good to invest in a good GPU to do some mining? If so, what are your recommendations? A good GPU will increase your profits considerably. There are many calculators out there ranking GPUs based on their anticipated return. Just remember that no one knows what will happen to digital coin prices in 10 seconds let alone a month. Read the full response on this matter https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2004875.msg20711549#msg20711549   Why is it when I open Task Manager, CPU utilisation isn't 100% when WinMiner is mining? Great question - it all boils down to the architecture of the CPU and the manner in which the mining algorithm can use it. Some algos utlize specific computing capabilities, some functionalities are per core others per thread, so the fact the CPU consumption is not showing 100% does not mean that the CPU is not giving all it has to the mining of a specific algo.

Im really new to all this, and although its featureset is impressive (especially the ability to use an alternative to coinwarz to determine profitability - I think the dream would be something that would average profitability math across multiple sites), I have found that something like Awesome miner is just too much to configure for someone like me who is small scale enough to where 40 cents a day is good profits, lol.

It then begins monitoring for best performance. In this mode you get up and running quickly with great performance while making sure your machine is fully optimized at the end of the process. The second mode is a traditional full cycle benchmarking which tries out all options until a winner is found and then monitors for making sure you are always optimized.

First of all, I'd like to say 'thank you', it's been a good 20 days aboard (mostly good), thank you for the product and all that you have done so far. We, the guys with 2GB VGA memory ""notsobad"" cards ( ), or those with second to none technical skills with miners (I guess), do appreciate the existence of your creation. As you get small part of our computational work - this is happy relationship and I hope it will be more so. This it why I am writing. There are some questions I'd like to address, feel free to respond or ignore me, I mean no ones harm, please forgive my English, it is not my native and not as good as I like it to be, if I offend with some words or misuse them - sorry in advance. Oh - and there are some pictures too. So...  1. sgminer and unrecognized option and all things already said here - will not repeat, but it will be great. Back in the days when bitcoins was so easily mined and dwell in between 5 and 20$ and was sold for that   - I've had some pretty good results with sgminer. Pretty consistent. Yes - consistensy, onward...  2. The estimated profit numbers - ALL over the place for me. With many miners and coins. And winminer is looking me in the eyes and tells me lies. May be it is just me, but I do have 2 monitors and keep an eye on both Winminer GUI and miner command prompt window while reading - the hashrate stays (relatively) constant, but even on 1 session - the expected reward swings sometimes 300% back and forth and back again. Most of the time more like 50 to 100%, which is irritating enough, so to want to do something about it. Is it from the miner, is it from the pool, is it from me, should i move to other miner, what can I do...? The picture below shows mining KRB in 18 minutes time - same hashrate, once it is showing 1.90$/day profit, after a very short while - 1.01$/day. Then back up again. And have seen like 0.60$/day. In a matter of minutes. Why? What number is the real number I get. How can i make decision on what to mine with what to mine if I don't have proper information. Should I take it off the list of currencies i mine? How can I take it off if it is my ""best"" coin? What is then my best coin? BTW showing KRB as experiencing largest fluctuations of numbers shown with it. There are more currencies with similar behavior. Today I looked around some mining calculators around the net and putting in my hardware i get like 0.44$/day with KRB. Not that will complain if you give me, like 1.20$/day for something that costs 0.44$/day, but it is not good, generally speaking, and if it is showing 1.20 and I get 0.44 is ... well, not good. You get my point.  First image is from 03.08.2017, when i start thinking about writing you about this, so made some screenshots, to back up my words. http://imgur.com/a/vxAB9  And 3 hours ago, still auto on choosing what/where/with what to mine http://imgur.com/a/pIBJ9  3. I know you guys work on this hard, and I see progress and things added, refined and polished. I salute you for your work. But some things are rough. Basic ones. Look at the picture below. It is me, spontaneously zooming my days work, random day, on the website, 'Statistics' tab, 12 hours interval, took the same 03.08.2017 for example, but when scroll back and forth it's more or less the same every day. ""The WinMiner software analyzes each systems and automatically determines which miner to use and which coin to mine .... in order to maximize the return."" . Well, it tries. But sometimes misses I guess. I have not been on the computer at this time. The bar interval is 10 minutes, as it illustrates better (I think). And for those using speech engines tired of reading will sum it up - there are HUGE differences in profit, from 0.00087$ in 10 minutes, trough 0.009$ in 10 minutes, to 0.015$ in 10 minutes (for faster readers - count the zeros). The difference (for 10 minutes work in 6 hours interval) is 17.35 times. Or in percentage - 1735%. Bit of a scary number. This cannot be explained with the program bench-marking, the internet gone, or the price of the specific coin up or down. If the pool we're connected goes off I've seen winminer starting again, so it is not that too. http://imgur.com/a/19BWo  For me - it's the program choosing not the best job there is. Or it is an issue connected with the one I spoke earlier (p.2). That goes again choosing not the best job there is and so on and on...  4. Here is another, this time suggestion, I think no one have mentioned it and can be pretty useful. It can resolve partially at least (or for the most part) ""numbers"" and ""consistency"" deviations. And can be beneficial to us all. The program (winminer) does collect data while it works. It's on the statistics page on the website. I doubt that is all from the logs. Or that it can be all from logs. So it is possible to collect, and split up, and visualize for a given period of time ""anyone's"" specific hardware configuration's work. For the day, may be better I think, or whatever suits you. For that period for  - what WAS the most profitable coin, or miner, or coin/miner duo that have worked on YOUR machine. With something visual, like bars with numbers, horizontal with different length, for a fair (statistically) amount of time. Like ""for the last 24 hours you've had  X, Y, Z coins mined (with corresponding miner, and/or any other info) AND for that 24 hours you have mined coin X at rate 0.0065$ per 10 minutes, coin Y at rate 0.0059$ per 10 minutes, coin Z... etc. You get it? I will not post a picture of 'stacked bar chart'   , if someone needs one - Microsoft Word / Insert menu/ Charts or google it. This way one can decide for real what is more profitable for his hardware to mine. For that moment in time, at least. Because honestly - I never got those 2.22$/day from the second picture. Nor the 1.57$/day.  The reason writing for the last more than hour is - now I have my machine, and for 20 hours per day it does nothing, and I am using it with WinMiner. Since the ETH became... well... hard to mine - there are a lot of nice not so expensive 2GB VGA cards around me, if I am able to evaluate the possible profit of a card with WinMiner I can build relatively inexpensive rig and give it a go. WinMiner is a very welcome option for me, esp. with the ability to choose what to mine with what miner to mine, backups are awesome, but all in the end for me goes to simple calculation - if I invest thousands of $$ in 8 cards rig it will mater how fast those come back. It will no longer be a matter of 1.20 or 1.50$/day But I need reliable Winminer for that.   Well, you said ""help and feedback"". This is me, helping and feed-backing. Good night all. With ClathmoreDualEthBlake on R9 270X at the moment - signing off.",False

I just recently started researching and exploring the world of crypto currencies and stumbled upon WinMiner. Been using it for a few days now and it's a great idea! Very easy to use, super simple, which is I guess what you were going for. However, there's room for improvement. Firstly, it seems quite inconsistent with how it calculates earnings - like the guy above me said. Also, I am doing CPU mining, so I will only have CPUs selected to do mining and not GPUs. However, even with the on board GPU displayed in the Available mining devices and unselected, it still says Mining: KRB @ xxxh/s = $$$ - and it's the exact same number as the above CPUs. Does that mean it's really using the GPU to mine too, or not? Very confusing. I am mining through a VM, so was wondering what the best config for CPU would be - how to configure the CPU bit? Are results likely to be the same if I configure the VM with 1 CPU with 16 cores or 16 separate CPUs with 1 core?  Does anyone have experience in whether it's better to use Linux & NiceHash or other apps instead of Windows? I heard it's usually better on Linux but didn't really have that experience, so I'm not sure what to think. My knowledge is limited so it might be that I didn't configure something properly :'D .  It seems that WinMiner fluctuates A LOT with mining XMR for $.30 a day to KRB for $.70 a day. How come? Is this due to the currencies changing in value so frequently or what? Obviously it's better if I mine KRB for $.70 per day than XMR for $.30 a day. But WinMiner changes between them automatically and when I want to put it back to KRB manually, I get a tiny number like $.20 - even though it was showing $.70 just a moment ago? Is it possible that the currency is changing in value so quickly and so frequently?  Also, would it be good to invest in a good GPU to do some mining? If so, what are your recommendations?  Keep up the good work guys!  Thanks (y)  EDIT: One more thing I noticed - Why is it when I open Task Manager, CPU utilisation isn't 100% when WinMiner is mining? Most computers show around 50% CPU utilisation and only one of computers is showing around 80% CPU utilisation by NsCPUCNMiner64.exe. All of them are configured to be in ""Farm Mode"" mining. Am I right that it should be 100% utilisation or what am I missing? Would appreciate an answer as I want to maximise utilisation on these machines.",False

We listen and learn   We have been working on a couple of things which bothered some of you and are happy to inform that we just released an update with the following improvements:  (1) Express Benchmarking - WinMiner now offers a new benchmarking method called Express (on top of existing benchmarking) - the express, which is now the default benchmarking method, leverages crowd wisdom to get you up and running quickly with great results while making sure your profits are optimized. It does so by testing a couple of options most likely to give you best profits (based on results from others with similar hardware). Then, once in a while, it will make an additional attempt at a time until a thorough benchmarking is complete.  (2) Express benchmarking stop checkbox has been added - so you can make the express benchmarking stop (and the old benchmarking will then commence), with a click, if you so desire  (3) Turning off a specific miner - you asked for it. it is now enabled.  (4) Wrong hash rate display for nVidia cards - we believe we have nailed this one down.  (5) Nvidia cards looping benchmark - we think this one is history.  This is it for now, more things in the pipeline (e.g. more miners for cuda)   We can’t wait to hear if we have solved a problem you have experienced or if you like the changes we have made.",False

The payouts have been much better than Nicehash for my systems. However, I've been running into some issues with my main gaming rig that has two GTX 980s in it. A couple of issues with how WinMiner is reporting the hash rates compared to what I'm seeing in the console window, as well as continual benchmarking.  For example, when mining ZEC, the console window shows GPU0 at 317 h/s, and GPU1 at 340 h/s. However, the WinMiner GUI shows both GPUs at 317 h/s. I don't know if this is effecting the actual payout rate for the other GPU, but it's strange that it's not reporting properly.  Another issue I've been having is with EthMinerCuda. Before that was enabled, the benchmarks cleared fine and WinMiner was properly selecting the correct algorithm based on payout. However, WinMiner seems to be stuck in a constant loop of benchmarking with EthMinerCuda. It ran for over almost 24 hours and never switched off to another miner to benchmark. In addition, the hash rate is being reported completely incorrectly with that miner. Each GTX 980 should be getting around 22 Mh/s, for a total of 44 Mh/s. However, WinMiner is reporting each GPU running at 44 Mh/s, which is completely incorrect.  I was wondering if there might be a way to disable specific mining software if we don't want to use it. I know that we're able to disable certain coins, however that doesn't help out when there's both EthMinerCuda and Claymore for Ethereum. For me, the hash rate was no different between EthMinerCuda or Claymore in Ethereum-only mode.  Previously, WinMiner was typically running any combination of dual mining modes for a maximum payout and was working great. Now I simply have it set to mine ZEC/ZCL/ZEN/HUSH because I'm getting a better payout out of those than it simply sitting in a loop while benchmarking EthMinerCuda.  Other than that, the program has been great and my payout is still better than what NiceHash was providing. In addition, the program has had absolutely no issues on my R9 280X system (possibly due to EthMinerCuda not even being a possibility on that system as that seems to be the issue on my nvidia system).",False

In fact we too ask ourselves the same question whenever thinking of using a new app/service.  The short story is that we are the guys behind SpeedBit, the company that invented the most popular download manager - Download Accelerator Plus. We made our first steps in the crypto space sometime ago building our rig shop (we did it again and again - trying to make them more cost effective and with better cooling etc.) and at the same time max our profits from hash power by mining the most profitable coin at any given time. We simply could not find a management software for our rigs that would cut it.. so after months of very hard work we created our own (aka WinMiner). Then we thought why not let everyone enjoy it, so we packaged WinMiner in a way that anyone could easily install and enjoy, but were not sure if people would like it or not so we came to this great community and forum and asked for help and guidance.

To address the accessibility cause we chose US Dollar as the base currency of WinMiner as this appeals to everyone. That means that the profit rate as well as the balance are shown and held in US Dollars. This way users get visibility and stability to their profits and the coin price speculation part is eliminated. Users will get paid their balance amount even if the price of the coins they mined collapsed. The flip side is also true, so if the coin price goes up their balance is not linked to the coins and will remain the same (just to clear, in the latter case we do not enjoy the price appreciation of the coins either ? there is no conflict of interests between WinMiner and its users ? our interests are always aligned).  Having said that, we are working on adding the capability of changing the balance currency to each users preference this way the balance will be shown in the currencies of choice and the user will be fully exposed to the fluctuations of that currency.  Volatility of coins ? since the balance is held in US Dollars coins get converted to USD continuously so price fluctuations is mitigated. Further, since the dynamic mining algorithm continuously shifts to the most profitable coin, a coin with high volatility and low volume that results in low sale price will immediately lose its attractiveness and hash power will be redirected elsewhere.  Hope this clarifies  One last request from everyone ? we will address all your questions appreciate all your comments and critic ? but at the same time if we are doing something good or if you like what we do then please share that with us as well ? this is the staff that gets us going",False

After months of hard work we think we are ready with our new baby product – WinMiner WinMiner was built to allow anyone, without knowledge of computers, digital coins or technical background to make a buck from their computer when its idle (90% of the time) The WinMiner software analyzes each systems and automatically determines which miner to use and which coin to mine and also serves as a pool in order to maximize the return. It also makes it real easy to receive the payment – getting Bitcoins is of course offered but also getting iTunes gift cards, PayPal and soon pre-paid cards  So the idea was to make it simple, efficient and good for anyone – from a kid and his PC to a guy running a farm All we ask is that you give it a try and let us know what you think and how we can do better.

So while crypto mining community as you say will prefer getting coins (which is an option) an everyday guy from Idaho (no offense  to anyone living there :-) ) who does not know how to handle coins may want cash or gift cards - we want to make all options available. (2) Optimizing the mining - our app will test which coin is the right coin to mine at any moment for a specific computer and will switch to the most profitable one. We think its cool and may interest crypto mining community members as well. With regard to your comment on Setup.exe - this is the way we write code that can be easily installed by anyone , and have done so for many years for many users to enjoy. If the community think that we should offer this in the form of zip file we will gladly do it. We worked on this product for several months giving it our best. We come in peace.

On the technical side - this should be a no brainer if there was a clear identification and methodology for identifying the different GPUs by the miners that we could plug into. We believe this is something being dealt with by the Miners teams.  See Claymore latest update: Quote from: Claymore on April 11, 2016, 03:30:36 PM Latest version is v9.6: - new GPU sorting method for AMD cards. Now GPUs are sorted by physical bus index...  It is easier to fix when one GPU is AMD and the other NVidia, but more complex for multiple identical cards. Anyway we are working on this and will update when this capability is enabled.

You have raised a couple of points: 1. Weak password – for security reasons we chose to require passwords which contain lower case upper case numeric and special (!@# etc.) – this requirement is shown on the page where a user is required to choose a password for the first time. Following your comment we will change the text in the dialog that comes up when a password does not meet the criteria – instead of referencing “weak password” we will reference “password does not meet the criteria” and mention the criteria again. 2. Windows Defender – two points:     a. No need for disabling – We prompt our users to exclude the WinMiner folder on Windows Defender (Not to disable Windows Defender altogether).     b. Best miners -  We want WinMiner to deliver the best profits to our users. To accomplish this we work with the best miner softwares available. Unfortunately some of the best miners (e.g. Claymore) are restricted by Windows Defender, and without them you will simply make less money…so it’s your call whether to exclude or not. 3. Start button – If you could use the bug reporting mechanism (see below) it will help us figure out what went wrong. 4. Bug reporting - We have built a mechanism in WinMiner that makes it real easy for users to report bugs and for us to get all the info we need to fix and get back to the user. Simply click on the Help drop down menu at the top right corner of the WinMiner screen, choose “send error report” and make sure the “Send log files” box is checked. Please write your email address and any comment you want in the window and voila – we get the info and can deal with it right away.   Hope this helps and clarifies.   Thanks again   Team WinMiner",False
