Bondkick Syndicate is a blockchain interface of the classic investment fund, to be open in 2018 for investing in syndicated loans, real estate, equity and derivatives all around the world. No CSD-locking, nor regional or currency restrictions.  Bondkick introduces XBK tokens instead of traditional less liquid shares, being sold for fiat EUR and USD and crypto BTC, NEO, ETH and NeoGAS (more and more cryptocurrencies being added on the Bondkick portal for easier investing). XBK (Bondkick Bond tokens) will be tradable on the Bondkick Exchange and other selected Exchanges since the beginning of the 2018.  Bondkick invests its own funds equal to the 25% of the subscribed tokens total value in cryptocurrencies, represented by the Bondkick 0x Index.

This commitment is limited to the 625 000€ and lasts until all the 24 999 XBK tokens will be initially subscribed and the Syndicate will start operating.  Mission statement We're happy to introduce tokenized syndicated loans, empowering the decentralized and completely digital securitization – the new form of hedged investing into assets, covered by smart contracts, liquid and tradable from the day one of the issue.  Vision Our vision is to revolutionize the model of joint investing, applying the diversified and decentralized approach powered by artificial intelligence and the blockchain technology.  Problem In most cases, a small business fails to represent itself to an investor: weak presentations, unclear promotional materials and obscure financial reporting – all of these make investors suspect the matter of a business. There is no clear form of application recognized by investors, helping them to make a choice easier and, therefore, faster. Tied up to only one region or a country is so old. Countries join into unions, so should the money. The access to money is usually limited, even though a business could afford it. The “Know Your Customer” has evolved. Meet the eResidency (https://e-resident.gov.ee/) and make things clear – there should be less hassle around the money. Retail investors, seeking for high-yields or stable returns with rather aggressive or more conservative tolerance profiles fail to analyze the enormous volume of data and, therefore, make the right decision. Securitization of debts and assets is limited to the region, legislation and, therefore, illiquid, complicated and non-transparent. There have been many individual lending and banking solutions, but no one has focused on the SME sector (99% of all enterprises) with tokenized securitization approach.  Bondkick Bond Details The overall supply of the Bondkick Bonds is 24,499 XBK tokens. All the Bonds will be available for purchase during the ICO, started on the 6th of November, 2017.  Bondkick Bond tokens run on the Ethereum blockchain according to the ERC20 standard. Every investor is able to move the bonds to any other Ethereum account outside of Bondkick.  The Bondkick Bond tokens will be tradable right after the issue. The first exchange to operate Bondkick Bond tokens toward most of the cryptocurrencies and most popular fiat currencies will be located on the Bondkick platform in the beginning of the 2018. Following the growth of the interest to the Bondkick Bond tokens, we're going to cooperate with other third-party exchanges and open the trading facilities to the other operators.  The value of the Bondkick Bond is tied to the Euro currency. The length of the fraction of the Bondkick Bond token is hundred thousands.  Bondkick Syndicate Investment Strategy Investment objectives The objectives of the Bondkick Syndicate are to:  1.   create and maintain a mix-investment portfolio, based on short-term and long-term investments in equity, fixed income, real estate and other derivatives; 2.   keeping the annual net growth of the Bondkick Bond value up to 15%; 3.   making the Bondkick Bond liquid at any time.  The Investment objective of the Bondkick Syndicate and predefined investment choices are programmed into Artificial Intelligence module, leading the work of the Bondkick Syndicate.  Investment Choice The Bondkick Syndicate investment strategy may include, but not limited to all or one of the following: 1.   Lending to enterprises with and without collaterals and/or management guarantees both long- and short-term; 2.   Direct residential, industrial and commercial property investment for buy to let or flipping plans; 3.   Fixed income financial products investment (including both secured and unsecured high-yield commercial and sovereign bonds); 4.   Buying third-party debts or real property investments; 5.   Buying new and/or leading cryptocurrencies and/or CFD-s as riskier to maintain more aggressive investment portfolio parts; 6.   Any other investment that the Bondkick Syndicate may feel prudent to achieve the investment objective.  In formulating this strategy Bondkick Syndicate considers relevant features of the various investments in accordance with both the Syndicate objectives and appropriate legislation. In drafting this investment strategy, Bondkick Syndicate has taken into account all of the circumstances of the Syndicate, including:  •   the risks and likely return associated with each investment; •   the range and diversity of investments held by the Bondkick Syndicate; •   any risks coming from limited diversification; •   the liquidity of the Bondkick Syndicate investments; and •   the ability of the Bondkick Syndicate to meet its existing and prospective liabilities such as buying out some of the Bondkick Bonds held by its investors.  Policies The policies adopted by the Bondkick Syndicate in order to achieve these objectives are:  1.   Regular monitoring of the performance of the Bondkick Syndicate investments, the overall investment mix and the expected cash flow requirements of the Bondkick Syndicate; 2.   Re-balancing the Bondkick Syndicate investment portfolio due to changes in market conditions through asset sales and new investments as appropriate.  Bondkick Syndicate will aim to follow the investment strategy, however, it will at all times reserve the right to change the investment mix depending on the market situation and opportunities available to better meet the objectives of the syndicate.  Risk profile and risk tolerance The Bondkick Syndicate is a long-time horizon oriented, while allowing both short and medium goals. It maintains rather conservative profile, allocating up to 25% of its portfolio to debt instruments and real estate; however, 25% of the portfolio is placed to faster increase the future income and raise the value of the Bondkick Bond. Lead by the Artificial Intelligence in the robo-invest environment, Bondkick Syndicate risk tolerance is in conform with market changes.  Asset allocation The targeted asset allocation will recognise the need to have a diversified asset mix, however, given the long-term investment horizon of the members, the allocation will have a strong growth asset bias and be focused on maximising capital growth.  The Bondkick Syndicate recognise the higher risk in investing predominantly in growth assets and the volatility associated with shares and property. The volatility will be compensated by the prospect of achieving higher returns and growth in the longer term. In order to minimise this risk Bondkick Syndicate will consider investing in different industries and sectors where possible.  See white paper for more details.  Bondkick Bond ICO Bondkick Bond is a smart contract (an Ethereum ERC20 standard token, also recognised as a cryptocurrency or digital coin), issued to replace the classic illiquid investment paper. The name ""Bondkick Bond"" stands for a solid binding contract, backed by assets. Every Bondkick Bond, being issued by the Bondkick Syndicate, represents a value in Euro-currency, being jointly invested into one of the assets, fitting the Bondkick Syndicate investment plan.  The short-code of the Bondkick Bond is XBK. XBK is issued on the Ethereum blockchain and may be kept on any Ethereum account outside, as well as on the integrated account inside Bondkick. The total amount the Bondkick Bonds to be issued is 24,999 tokens.  The name value of the Bondkick Bond at ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is 100.00 EUR. The further value of the Bondkick Bond is based on the yield being produced by the Bondkick Syndicate and recalculated daily. During the ICO, Bondkick invests its own funds equal to the 25% of the subscribed tokens total value in cryptocurrencies, represented by the Bondkick 0x Index. The profit of the Bondkick 0x portfolio will be transferred to the Bondkick Syndicate and increase its market capitalisation. This commitment is limited to the 625 000€ and lasts until all the 24 999 XBK tokens will be initially subscribed and the Syndicate will start operating.
