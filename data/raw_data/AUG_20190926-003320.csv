Collaboration with the best specialists and laboratories, fast hypothesis verification/hypothesis testing, using flexible methodologies help to shorten the new technology development process from 5-7 to 1,5-2 years.  The “RECONSTRUCT” project is a set of technologies necessary for creating/making/developing augmented bionic limbs which are as close as possible to the original ones, given to human by nature. The “RECONSTRUCT” project uses the principles of bionic engineering to ultimately recreate/restore a limb. Not only is the external view reconstructed but also the structure: bones, muscles and tendons which altogether provide fluency and accuracy in movement. Bionic augmented limbs are used in prosthetic repair, science and astronautic/space field.  New Generation of Bionics ABR has developed a pack of innovative technologies intended to create bionic limbs of a new quality level  Human Engineering pack The parts used in products reproduce the bones and tendons of a real human arm, the cinematics is based on natural gestures. Typical industrial elements of construction are not used which helps to achieve fluency and authenticity of movement that mechanical prostheses are unable to provide.  Muscle Intelligence The technology is based on the spectromyographic recognition of muscular tissue activity. Owing to the development of surficial myography processed by spectral analysis method, further wavelet transformation and comparison to the biochemical model/prototype we get the new quality level of recognizing muscular signals. For a wider potential of RECONSTRUCT there are possibilities to remotely update its version. http://abrlab.com/myo.html  AM technologies Technologies of additive manufacturing are used in the project. -scanning of the remaining limb allows to create the exact model of the lost limb. The scanning result is compared to the master-model thus making the prototype ready for printing. Printing production with the usage of innovative materials such as flex rubber and titanium completely duplicates the natural arm/limb. The customer gets their individual RECONSTRUCT modification that fully corresponds to the lost limb and fits perfectly.   ICO  During the ICO tokens with AUGMENTUM code are going to be sold. Owning AUGMENTUM tokens gives a possibility to get a bionic prosthesis (provided there is the necessary amount of tokens) or to grant it to the ones who need it (a special website section is going to be developed for this). A token has its own value and can be sold or bought on the stock exchange.  10’000’000 AUGMENTUM tokens are going to be issued. 80% of tokens will be sold to the investors. 10% of tokens will be sold during the pre-ICO and 70% during the ICO itself. 5% of tokens will be allocated to finance the referral program, and the remaining 15% will be provided for the development purposes and other business operations. The tokens are being issued on the basis of Waves platform.  The price of a token is going to be 1$ during the ICO. Pre-sale buyers are going to get a 50% discount (0,5$ per AUGMENTUM token during the pre-ICO). 500 000 is expected to be gathered during the pre-ICO.   Why to invest?   — New concept of technology development — Bionic engineering, providing smooth and natural gestures inaccessible to competitors — A unique product which is going to change existing market conditions — Token fixing in prospective engineering development with a high possibility of growth — Possibility to exchange AUGM tokens to other technological tokens at the internally generated rate — We have been investing in reseach for more than 5 years  Website: http://abrlab.com/ Whitepaper:http://abrlab.com/file.pdf  Contact us  Facebook https://www.facebook.com/abrlabs/ Telegram https://telegram.me/abrlab Medium http://medium.com/@abr_lab Twitter https://twitter.com/ABR_lab",False
