First of all, gaming industry is more than 100 bln dollars, enough for several huge platforms and tens of smaller ones. Yet all we have is Steam. Secondly,  Steam is only for PC games. No mobile games, no MMO, etc. Thirdly, it's quite hard to be accepted and when you do, you're lost in thousands of other games. We have analyzed Steam stats and we realize that usually a developer gets $12,000-33,000 per game. For most countries, skilled professionals that can develop a game receive that as a 2-month salary, not as a 1-1,5 year's profit needed for a game production.",False

This is a huge industry with an increase of 8% per year, which will retain its significance even 20 years from now. We can't help but notice oppressive stiffness with the way things are currently standing. Unfortunately, major game developers concentrate entirely on minimi- zing their risks, they prefer to penetrate the market with products that have been tested with time and are favored by the mass-market, and that's why they are constantly creating hollow & soulless copies of the games – repeating the same pattern of game mechanics year after year. In order to gain the player's attention, developers spend up to 56% of their revenues on PR, marketing and advertising. However, indie-developers and even mid-size game developers that are involved in creating unique and innovative products are not able to effectively function in this environment. They are filled with enthusiasm that is needed to develop a product that will win the hearts of the consumers, but yet ehey lack the capa- bility to allocate the needed monetary budget to attain the same level of results through the same marketing and advertisement conduits.     Interests of the players are completely different from the interests of the developers, but we can converge them together.    Currently, more than 95% of all gamers are deprived of the opportunity to convert their gaming achievements into real money or make use of them when switching to another game. Only few have learned to make money off their gaming achievements, selling resources via in-game messages, forums and social networks. The disadvantage of this approach is a complete anonymity and impossibility of positive identification of agents of the transaction, which leads to deception in more than half of the transactions. Blockchain technology not only makes peer-to-peer interaction completely transparent for players, but also will allow to battle fraud and cheating (hacking game processes with the aim of increasing virtual values and faking payments), which will lead to retention of gains and keep out toxic players negatively affecting the mood of the community.    On the CryptoHIT platform when switching to another game within the system the player will be able to use tokens accumulated in one project to buy starter packages in another. In addition, participants will be given the opportunity to make money off the sale of resources and characters on internal exchanges, bet on other players and their warriors.     For the convenience of mutual settlements among the participants of the game platform, we have developed the Galactic Credit Coins (GAC) token based on the ERC-20 standard, which will be used by players to purchase in-game characters, items and package offers. We are issuing a limited number of GAC tokens, which will not exceed 50,000,000 tokens and will be adjusted downwards based on the results of the ICO. This kind of a token can be purchased at Pre-ICO and ICO, and after their completion it will be traded on major crypto-exchanges. As a result, each investor gets the opportunity not only to sell GAC cryptocurrency profitably after it has been listed on the exchanges, but also to invest and earn almost immediately in first crypto games. All of the elements of interaction will motivate the consumer to stay and try other games in the system, rather than go to external projects. This will allow all the participating developers to receive millions of free users with zero marketing costs and an opportunity to tailor the system of discounts, rewards and bonuses for each user from the very beginning of the game, based on their previous activity, involvement and total purchases.  Currently, the commission fees of intermediaries (such as Steam, Google Play, Apple Store, etc.) account for up to 30% of sales. Tax liabilities vary depending on the country, but on average they deprive developers of another 25-30%. Having gained GAC crypto currency from the sale of game content the developer can exchange it for fiat money on any exchange and choose within which jurisdiction he should convert it into cash and legalize it. There is no need to purchase any licenses, connect a special merchant account for receiving payments, there are practically no transaction costs. As a result, when using the CryptoHIT platform the cost saving for developers will be up to 60%, which will allow them to invest more in quality content for users and to grow faster. In order to further interest first developers who will catalyze exponential growth, we will provide them not only with a functioning platform, but also with an active ecosystem with existing consumers.  The key idea is the gradual development, scaling up and growing business operations. We plan to develop and launch three game projects which were specifically de- signed based on calculations and estimates of current trends, market research and players votes. Having gathered the primary few million players in our own games, we will be able to direct them to our partners' projects with in-platform advertising on a gratuitous basis. This should resonate in the community and facilitate the rapid recognition and popularization of the platform. Currently, the total number of game developers in the world is more than 3 million people and there is no platform that could provide a similar spectrum of benefits and advantages.     When new developers get involved, our platform becomes more popular and more content will be implemented, which will create a huge deficit and demand for GAC crypto currency, as each new game comes with the new release of tokens. Accordingly, we predict the significant growth of the exchange rate and huge profits for our investors: even with the cautiously pessimistic 0,5% of total market share, the mathematical expectation of the cryptocurrency growth is more than 10,000%.

Their token is RFR. They are developing their API currently and this will allow game developers to integrate the Refereum reward system deeply into their games. Thus, rewarding achievements.

Yes, these projects are very similar to CryptoHIT, and there are a bunch of others like Abyss, Chimera, IQeon, playkey, .flux, Astor. DMarket is only a marketplace. They are not a platform for developers, they are like Ebay, just providing a place to sell and buy items, they still need game owners to approve selling items. In most of the games there's no way to trade items between the accounts. Developers make a profit by selling these items themselves through in-game purchases, and letting players trade them means they're losing profits and gaining nothing in return. CryptoHIT is so much more, we have thoroughly thought through all these points.",False

Most of the early investors try to buy tokens with a discount and then sell them as soon as they get listed on cryptocurrency exchanges. Some like to keep a long position for strategic purposes. In our case, we belive that you can earn more using a number of investment tactics in our first games. You will be able to purchase certain game characters (warriors) that have improved stats and cost less for a short period of time, then bet on their wins, sell them at auction or get paid to breed new warriors. If you're familiar with CryptoKitties projects, you can understand the potential of the system. There are more ideas in our WhitePaper, i'd recommend perusing through it. Also we will soon provide you with a bounty+aidrop program where you will be able to earn GAC tokens with daily actions, and a referral program where you can send potential investors to our website and get a 5-tier level reward.",False
