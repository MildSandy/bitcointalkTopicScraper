As some of you may be aware, SCL is being listed on HitBTC this week! The exact date and time is yet to be confirmed, although we have been told it will be sometime on Wednesday or Thursday.  Below are answers to the many questions that have been asked lately regarding the program.  What is the buy-back program?  The buy-back program is our way of acquiring SCL. Instead of allocating X amount of SCL to the team during the ICO period, we decided to run a buy-back program on the exchange. This way, SCL will be purchased with BTC instead of being allocated free of charge to team members. A total of 5% of SCL will be purchased back once SCL is listed on HitBTC.  How much is spent on the buy-back?  In a previous post here, we stated that we may have to reduce our position of 5% if the price of SCL rises dramatically. We planned on $800,000, although that was when the price of ETH was very different from now. We have allocated 2500 ETH to this program‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand of course, it needs to be exchanged for BTC since the listing is SCL/BTC. That means that the buy-back program will run until we purchase 5% of the circulating supply (being approximately 835,700 SCL) or until we spend all 2500 ETH (in BTC equivalent).  What is the buy-back trading pair?  The trading pair will be SCL/BTC as that will be the only trading pair for SCL at HitBTC. We may eventually get both ETH and USDT trading pairs added in the near future.  What is the estimated price that SCL will reach during this period?  We‚Äôre unable to make any kind of price indications as it is illegal to do so in the country that we operate in.  How long will the buy-back program go for?  We‚Äôre unable to make estimations for the length of the program. It could finish on the first day, it could take multiple days, or it could take multiple weeks. It all depends on how much SCL is being sold within this timeframe.  What if 5% of SCL is not sold during this period?  As per the question above, the buy-back program will run until we either spend 2500 ETH (being approximately 120 BTC) or purchase 5% of circulating SCL. Therefore, the program may potentially run for days if not enough SCL is being sold, or it could run for just a few hours if holders decide to rush to the exchange and sell.  Will the buy-back happen instantly once listed at HitBTC?  The buy-back will be launched quite quickly once listed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääalthough could happen as far as 24 hours from listing. HitBTC is located in a completed different timezone from us, so listing could happen as we are asleep. Announcements will be made via Twitter and Telegram once it has begun.  How will it work exactly? What will you do?  Quite simple actually‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe will be setting multiple buy walls at different prices going upwards periodically. Once the buy-wall at a price is completed, we‚Äôll move it up. For example (and only for example, the following prices/numbers are not real), we will set a buy wall of 10 BTC at the price of $0.40. Once the buy wall is complete, we‚Äôll create a new wall of 10 BTC at the price of $0.45. The price will constantly be moving up for each wall that we create until the program is complete.  What will you do with your SCL holdings after the buy-back?  We will have a new announcement after the buy-back program about what we will be doing with our SCL holdings. Long story short for now, we will be locking them away until further developments of the platform.  Keep an eye on our Twitter during the buy-back as all updates will be posted there in real time.  As always, if you happen to have any questions regarding this post, please email us at support@nexus.social, or join us on Telegram.",False

Fantastic to hear things are running ahead of schedule and looking forward to the official HitBTC listing..  Sphere is most certainly a copycat, right down to the colours and coin logo, as well as the features of the platform, card etc.  Pretty blatant really.. Whilst I do agree that competition is healthy and there is room for more than one, these guys are just taking the piss.  Curious to know what the legal team think of this? I guess not much can be done across borders and without registered trademarks.. The fact that Sphere Social is using a blue circle with a stylized 'S' on it is bound to cause confusion in the market. While it may not be entirely illegal, what they are doing is completely unethical and I think they need to be squashed now.  Release the hounds....",False

There are other companies competing directly with us, and we welcome that. Although Sphere is most definitely not one of those. All other competitors have their own unique features and content - when Sphere has blatantly stolen our content, features and much more. We have registered trademarks in 5 countries, although not for anything that they are using directly. Plain and simple, as you said it - what they are doing is unethical and not morally right.

All coins belong to the investors and the DEVS will just buy 5% from theExchange. COins are just minted once we pay the ETH and no new coins will ever be created after the ICO is over  IF the devs are holding 50% of the coin and they dump those coins then it would have a negative impact to the Price. Even if they dump slowly it would still create a sell wall that will bring the Price Down  The buyback program will actually increase the Price of SCL coins that means more profit for INvestors. It also implies the confidence of the Devs in what they are doing  I am not optimistic with the Marketplace because it is hard to compete with ebay but at least it will add value to the SCL coin since it will be used for purchasing goods  ADS within Nexus is nice and again it will add value to SCL because you have to purchase SCL coin to be able to advertise,False

In the whitepaper there's only the mention of the market that is social media and Online purchases. There's no sight of which major company hold market shares. (Amazon,facebook to mention two.) How are you planning to compete with these platforms? Facebook became big because college students and teens used it. Because teens used it, companies started using it and parents because their children are. Basically everything flowed from there. What incentive is there for teens and regular mainstream people to start using Nexus? I honestly think the majority of society doesn't care about their privacy.  If you want to state that as a main reason. I've seen allot of social platforms one's with very similar idea's as Nexus only without blockchain technology and centralisation. All of those are niche's and quite unsucssesfull. How are you going to differentiate yourself? Where's the uniqueness of the project?  Things as how many billions of people use social media and purchase online aren't going to cut it. That's very nice and all, it's a fact nothing more. Now how many people are going to use Nexus, Social. How do you plan to get people to use Nexus Social. Why would I go from facebook to Nexus? Why would I go from Craigslist/ebay to Nexus? Why would I go from twitter to Nexus? etc etc. Twitter,ebay,facebook,amazon are unique and set themselves apart hence why people use so much social media cause they have differentiated themselves from others. I go to Pinit to for recipes, I go to facebook for chatting with friends, catching up, see what's new. I go to instagram for well whatever people do there... I go to twitter to follow my latest investements on Crypto to see what the company is up to.  What I'm really trying to say is: ''There's no plan.'' There's nothing. The Roadmap just shows what updates of software/blockchain and there's 0 mentioning of aquisition. How you are going to attract members, nothing.  I know it seems like I'm bashing the project really hard, and truthfully I am. I think it will amount to nothing but an app that maybe gets some attention but remains unused on the longterm.  There's no mentioning of users. Seems to me you're forgetting the most important part.   At the same time though you're very right for starting a new social network. People WANT to leave facebook, People want to quit twitter. People don't however because they have all their close tied friends on it. Or they have a friend who moved to another city/country and they catch up on facebook. Facebook has almost become the friend instead of the media to bring them together. So if you're going to do this, do this right. Give people other than privacy, reason to leave those social networks. Privacy is something no one gives a **** about. I care about my privacy, but my 20 friends who are all on facebook (i'm not) don't. They share their drunk pictures shamelessely. It doesn't take very long to realise that there's no privacy on internet and trying to guarrantee it is a fools claim. People will find and go to places where they can be unprivate and uncensored.   Correct me if I'm wrong but I really feel this project is doomed to fail or becomes an extreme niche which isn't worth investing in.",False

Thanks for reaching out with your concerns. More than happy to address any questions regarding our project.  On page 5 of the white paper, we state the growth of both social networking and digital commerce. It shows that the amount of users social networking world wide is expected to grow far beyond 3billion by 2021. We also state that the amount of people purchasing any kind of good or service online will expand to more than 2.1billion in 2021, being a $2trillion dollar industry.  Our platform is very unique, and as you can see from the other posts here from other BitcoinTalk members, they think so too. Just some of the new features include the instant access debit card, Tor and VPN integration, and multi-wallet with ShareShift built in. It also needs to be understood that Nexus will be a social network for the people. Moderator priviledges will give the power back to reputable members of the platform, therefore keeping it safe. These members will be paid in SCL for their services.  Nothing will be developed in the future without the feedback of the community first. We're not just going to make executive decisions on what we ""think"" the people will want. Instead, we'll turn to the community and hold Q&As for what they want us to integrate next. We will also be open source, and therefore allowing third party developers to submit pull requests on Github for changes that they'd like to see. So really, we're putting the users first - so I think you're incorrect in stating that we haven't thought about them.  We state on both the ICO website and in the white paper that we will be marketing the platform to raise awareness and gain new members after the new version is released. We will be performing both tradition marketing, along with approaching influences in the space.  We have many plans in the near future for aquiring new users. Many of which we are not ready to announce to the public yet as we're still getting it looked over by our lawyers to make sure everything is above board.  Why wouldn't they want to come to Nexus if they can spend almost any cryptographic based token as real world fiat currency? Why wouldn't they want their data encrypted and stored securely? Why wouldn't they want crowdfunding and marketplace features built right into the same network they use day by day? Why wouldn't they want their messages encrypted end-to-end? Why wouldn't they want all the other benefits of the platform?  The amount of overwhelming postitive feedback we have recieved has been great. People love our platform, and they want to see it succeed as they feel there is a real world use for Nexus, as per the above points. We're not saying that we're going to replace Facebook or Twitter or any other mainstream social network for that matter - we're saying that it can coexist - just like SteemIt is not replacing blogging websites, it can coexist with Medium.
