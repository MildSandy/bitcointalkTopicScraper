Read on to find out why.  We have big plans at Pocketinns. We aim to build the world’s first alternative digital cryptomarketplace with its own supporting financial structure and its own currency in the PINNS token. The goal is an alternative digital nation in the next 7-10 years.  To do that successfully, we must ensure our investors are protected and legal distractions don’t get in the way. To explain more, our Founder and CEO Sarva Mada recently sat down with BlockTribune to discuss why we registered as a 506c exempted offering under Reg D.  It seems like issues with ICOs pop up every day. This isn’t good news for investors looking to get in on the ground floor. Whether it’s outright fraud, like this ICO the SEC stopped in early December, or simply a bad project, such as all these cryptocurrencies that have gone extinct, participating in an ICO carries far more risk than it should. We want to reduce risk as much as possible with our ITO. This is why we’ve decided against a presale at Pocketinns. We want to protect our investors — the people who support us on our journey to build the world’s first community-driven cryptomarketplace.  Pre-sales can lead to selloffs once the public sale starts You’ve probably seen it before. “Buy during the pre-sale. Receive a 30% bonus!” a startup will state during its ICO. That sounds nice, right? Too often, this leads to a selloff once the ICO launches for the general public. Folks take their profits and run. Nothing substantial remains. We’re not doing a pre-sale because we don’t want artificial bonuses negatively impacting our investing environment. We want our investors to know they’re putting their money in a meaningful project.",False

They could very well create an alternative digital economy. I'll be keeping my eyes — and maybe participating — in this ICO. I like they're not doing a pre-sale and letting investors determine price through the Dutch auction. They seem very transparent about what they're doing — a welcome sight in the ICO world.,False
