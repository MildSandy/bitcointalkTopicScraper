While we're open to bounties (contact us as needed) but we're serious about our coin and would never diminish our value without seeing results!   Humbyl is not just your usual decentralized fantasy sports platform--- sure, we offer a transparent, global ETH20-based decentralized fantasy sports platform (on mobile and web), but Humbyl is more than that. Humbyl engages and empowers fans by connecting them to their favorite celebrities and aims to abolish the problems plaguing status-quo sports betting websites.  We simplify decentralized gaming so everyday consumers still have a shot at winning the big prizes, and our business strategy aims big picture--- past ICO, past beta, past launch, to see long-term how we'll achieve our goals of engaging the average user, incorporating celebrities into events, and overall just thinking outside the box.  Join our ICO or contact us through social media, and help us shatter what everyone expects from a decentralized gaming platform!

The project is headed up by more traditional marketers so they only recently put me in charge of recruiting people from BitcoinTalk, since I think the whole process is new to them.

So, the result is coming from a real match if I'm not mistaken. Interesting concept in my opinion. And it looks like there will be a bounty campaign, will wait for it. I think decentralized fantasy sports is becoming a little too common, so while our beta platform will likely be minimal (lottery platform, pick winners, etc), the long-term goal is to hold events and make the experience more fun. Plus, there's controversy involving traditional fantasy sports and DFS in which 1% of players earn 96% of the earnings... ideally we avoid that pitfall.   In any case, thank you for your interest.     We genuinely want to involve the community in our efforts and hope our bounty program helps achieve that. ICO aside, having that community will be wonderful for our growth and lead to a better end-product.  - Dr. Nic of Humbyl",False

Also, we raised something like $400,000, although I personally don't handle it so it's just an estimate. We've stalled due to our lackluster marketing efforts that we're trying to remedy, so we're making a much stronger push in August when our beta is released.

Our social media marketing team has been undermanned so we couldn't be too active on BitcoinTalk answering questions (the team we hired wasn't professional, waste of funds and time). We're still at a disadvantage because of starting so late in reaching out to BitcoinTalk and because our offline sales team is struggling with old-fashioned marketing attempts. In fact, with only about six weeks remaining, we're finally putting money towards external PR firms and advertisements (with our limited budget, no less). Hell, the product itself is actually almost complete since we sunk our pre-sale funds into development instead of marketing, but more funding will make a stronger, more global product in the end.   Just an update, though (especially to you guys who assume we're a scam)-- we do have a demo video and our partnerships with athletes are genuine. In fact, the irony is that because we invested in our development and our partnerships, we shortchanged our marketing. We've also begun talks with exchanges, although how high we can reach will depend on our ICOs success. If we don't reach softcap, the exchanges we can afford are fairly limited.  And lastly, using a website doesn't make us a scam, dingus. Check the white paper and reach out, we're NOT anonymous, we DO have all details worked out, and we ARE available for chat on our telegram.  - Dr. Nic",False
