They don't pay enough attention to what is happening around, or what might happen to their investment, they kinda have only a final profit floating before their eyes. Because, let's be honest, still too many people look at any ICO as a $ factory, and those people doesn't give a dime about security, innovation, evolution..  And then average Joe goes to.. say a landing platform, and dream about becoming a millionaire over night, not because he is not well intended, but this much he can understand. And same Joe then comes to Blockbits, doesn't understand a word of it, he sees that his money is locked, and no profit till release, so it must be something that doesn't worth his attention / investment.  I am not trying to say that most people are dumb, but they definitely act as such. While at the beginning there were more technical people (alongside criminals) involved in crypto, in general, the more mainstream it became, the more uneducated people joined. And the rate of the ones who are really interested, does understand, and able to see the bigger picture, is less and less.  This is only a theory of mine, it could, or not, be the real reason. I am doing my best to educate the people around me, who are opened to learn and gain not just wealth. Probably many others could do the same.",False

The platform proposed by Blockbits manages to protect the investor and also the Founders of the ICO based on it. Backed by experienced investors, newcomers can learn and educate themselves based on elders.  I think the main point of this platform is to protect the ICOs network. Imho, this might be the future of all upcoming ICOs. At least you can sleep well knowing that if the project based on the platform is unsuccessful you can get your precious ETH back not only in the pre-funding and funding stage but also based on future ICO's milestones. Good strategy for newcomers and also an incentive for future ICO devs.  As every real case transposed into code, the WP and all the technical documentations of Blockbits ICO are quite long (took me around 2 days to read all, including the SC) but once you understand the basics, things come natural and you ask yourself why they did not do it before. Ofc there always will be space for code upgrades, but the devs are open minded people, very receptive to upgrades and sugestions.  This will be a good project since only REAL ICO's will be created through this Platform.  Keep up the good work, will keep an eye on this.",False

We are getting traction on this project and we think that this is a good opportunity for members that are not yet part of it to find more detailed information (technical and non technical).  Q: Can I have a look at some Blockbits related smart contracts? A: Sure, just take a look at https://github.com/blockbitsio/smart-contracts  Q: Under WP '3.1 Description', for ""Platform testable risk indicators"", what are the these indicators? A: You can find detailed information in our documentation at https://docs.blockbits.io/project_risk/  Q: Under WP '3.2.4 Direct Funding Payments', who is the 'vault's owner'? A: The investor is always the vault owner, each investor gets one, no matter which funding method do they choose (direct or milestone).  Q: Can the ICO participants view the content of the vault? A: Yes all vaults are public, and a contributor can choose to validate their own vault on etherscan using ( https://github.com/blockbitsio/smart-contracts/blob/master/build-merger/FundingVault.sol ), since all of them are created by the FundingManager (which is the contract factory, all must be the same).  Q: Under WP '3.2.14 Fully open source', for the github repository, to confirm if it will be privately shared or public. A: Take a look at https://github.com/blockbitsio/ The project contains the 2 repos (source code and documentation) where everything we have is in source format, which includes diagrams / code / tests / forks of support projects like truffle and solc-binary, coverage tests and results, just about anything we could see as useful to anyone wanting to contribute to our project.  Q: Under WP '4.1 Phase 1 - Proof of Concept', it's dated 'June 2017 - January 2018' with many deliverables. Would like to have a glimpse of those deliverables (except the last 3 items). A: Everything in the specified list is available ( except the mobile application which we are currently redesigning for better usability ).( https://docs.blockbits.io/ page has urls pointing to these )  Q: When do you plan to hold the AMA session? A: We are available for interviews any time, and for AMA sessions we are currently waiting for the community to grow larger for it to even make sense (anyone can come and ask anything they need information about here). You can find all the information regarding contacting us on the official website.  Q: Would be visually helpful if you could indicate the estimated YYYY/MM for 'Development Milestone 1' to 'Development Milestone 7': Doable? A: The milestones are specifically estimated in days and not dates, because any can be postponed if issues arise ( postponing can only be accomplished through a proposal accepted by investors )  Q: There seems to be no one within the core team that have experience in the evaluation of companies for equity investments (eg. angel investment background)? A: The team is composed of co-founders that have been in the software scene for 15-20 years, helping other companies achieve their goals. Some of us own small businesses and have come together to create a product that will help this space evolve into a safer market for both investors and projects.  Q: Who within the team will be coding the smart contracts, backend & frontend, or is it external at this moment esp. for the smart contracts? A: Part A of the smart contracts is already written ( upgradeable architecture, funding, milestones, voting, independent organization, code upgrades ), they're used for the actual funding of this project, and have been written mostly by me ( Micky Socaci ) with help from @Lynceus and Mihai ( @DoomBike ), as well as audited by the community.

There are 3 inputs and 2 periods:  Contract Name   Address (Ethereum - MainNet) InputDirect   0xb05faba79ac993dc1ff7e3a0a764c3d0478cdc1f InputMilestone   0x91ca47b9ec3187c77f324281a1851f4b991103f1 InputMarketing   0xdfe06d5a4534fbe955eebe8a4908ef596763c2a4  Both InputDirect and InputMilestone - are funding inputs that create a personal smart contract ( funding vault ) that stores received ETH and tokens you bought until the 1st of May 2018.  InputDirect - releases your locked ETH if funding has not met soft cap. - releases your tokens if funding is successful  InputMilestone - releases your locked ETH if funding has not met soft cap. - releases your tokens if funding is successful in a percentage ( see the end of the post for percentage list ) that is assigned to each milestone, once said milestone is complete. - if for any reason a milestone fails and investors vote that it's failed, you can take the remainder of your investment back.  InputMarketing ( period 4th of feb - 10th of March ) - Gives you 20,000 tokens for 1 ETH - Is a funding input that sells tokens directly to your wallet. - ETH collected is used exclusively by our marketing team, for google ads / youtube video promotions and ico listing promotion.  PRE-ICO - InputDirect and InputMilestone, will give you 9800 Tokens per 1 ETH (40% bonus). ICO - InputDirect and InputMilestone, will give you 7000 Tokens per 1 ETH.   Total supply: At the end of the funding period, based on total supply sold, another 40% is minted for the project team ( split against team / advisors / early investors / marketing partners ). At the same time a pool of 3% is minted and allocated to the Bounty Manager contract, that will then send tokens out to participants.  The project 40% pool will stay locked for a period of at least 2 years while development milestones get implemented and validated by investors.  To resume: If you believe in the project and want to help us with marketing, yes you are taking some of the risk with us, you get a bonus for doing so. If you want to risk nothing, use direct or milestone funding, and you'll be able to take your funds back if we don't manage to get enough traction in order to get funded.  Trustless: Everything described here and more is already implemented and running the DAPP deployed to the main ethereum network. You can find the full list on https://github.com/blockbitsio/smart-contracts As well as attached to each contract on etherscan.io  In the next following weeks we will be adding a new area on our website that will allow you to view how each transaction works and affects the system. i.e: if you send ETH to DirectInput, it travels to the Funding Entity, which validates it, then passes it along to the Funding Manager that instantiates a new personal Vault ( if none exist ), sets you as an owner on it, then sends the ETH to it.  The ""hard part"" is already done, the blockchain code is already there, we just need to assemble an intuitive and user friendly interface for you guys   Milestones contract -> https://etherscan.io/address/0xb4e8d821b5b43fca08f5986d9b52a8dc00565cc5#readContract Milestone Percentages: 1 - Minimalistic Platform - 20% 2 - 3rd Party Launch Functionality - 20% 3 - Code Upgrade Tools and Token Buyback - 10% 4 - Basic Risk indicators and Collaboration tools - 15% 5 - Advanced functionality - 15% 6 - Token Holder Upgrades - 10% 7 - Full Decentralization - 10%  ---------------------------  Hope i've answered your questions and feel free to ask anything.
