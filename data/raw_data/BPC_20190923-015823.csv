Mujin Community Like the old Japanese mutual aid society, MUJIN, we will offer a place where Cryptocurrency and community interact.  P2P Insurance We will aim for a new insurance service with P2P Insurance and Cryptocurrency. A platform with transparency that never over-charges will be provided.   A world of insurance expands with Cryptocurrency. Gathering everyone’s money and making use of it, now that is the spirit of mutual help. Plans where helping one another by distributing burden and responsibility to every-one have existed for many generations. For example, insurance, mutual aid societies, crowd funding by friends, etc., these large and small mutual support plans take place among friends and family, acquaintances, and people sharing common worries.  In the traditional way of things, coordinating group of people and money has many ob-stacles. SNS etc. has come to the scene, and communication has evolved, but fiat cur-rencies differ by countries and, in reality a bank account can’t easily be managed col-lectively.  We are trying to create a comprehensive platform for people to gather money among each other and manage it, with the power of cryptocurrency and its underlying technol-ogies.  Mutual help = insurance (almost), so we call BITPARK an “P2P insurance platform.”   Cryptocurrency The Wallet handles bitcoins, but for Mujin and insurance, BITPARK tokens will be used. BITPARK tokens is issued on Ethereum(ETH) blockchain. This is token to be used from the time of official release.  Types of insurance We limit it to small payoff and short-term insurance, making the platform available for casual use.  Community In groups, Mujin or insurance, there is always a community for each. Wallet and com-munication functions are all in one.  P2P Lendings By rating groups and individuals, one can receive discounts in insurance fees and quali-fy for small amount loans.  Collective management All participants can view the balance and transaction history. For security, funds can only be sent to participants, and multiple participants need to sign in order for payment to be sent.  Asset management For tokens gathered by Mujin or insurance, we will provide functions to store and asset-manage in local currencies.   --- ICO PLAN ---  ICO website: https://ico.bitpark.net WebSite: https://bitpark.net  ICO 1st July 25th until August 15th 5 million token will be distributed to ICO participants.  ICO 2st September 5th until October 15th 70 million token will be distributed to ICO participants.   --- ICO STRUCTURE ---  The total token supply is 100 milllion.  1st Phase: 5 million token will be distributed to ICO participants. 2st Phase: 70 million token will be distributed to ICO participants.  20 million tokens will be reserved as financial incentive for founding members, strategic partners and dev team. 5 million tokens will be reserved for service users instant buying.  --- INVEST ---  ICO 1st The first 400 users will receive 50% bonus to their sent BTC. Next 401 to 1200 users will receive 20% bonus to their sent BTC.  - It uses the multi-sig for maximum security. - The minimum amount of BITCOIN in the ICO 1st does not have. - This time, we don't have referral program.
