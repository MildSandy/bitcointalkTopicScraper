It is worth noting that individual investors have contributed voluntarily in full-time or part-time.

They will be locked for 1 year via a smart contract after the Antshares MainNet launch. After the 1-year locking, these ANS will be allocated for supporting the long-term operations of the Antshares.  ANS designated to early supporters, ICO 1 participants and ICO 2 participants will be in place after the official launch of the MainNet of the Antshares Blockchain.

And what I don't understand is how bookkeepers will be elected. Could potentially everybody be a bookkeeper and/or is there a limited number like the federated server design in Factom?

And it's not meant personally, but the 50% of shares held by the team, at least for one year, also means voting power plus 50% of all new created ANC for one year, and 8% of the future total supply.

One is basic bookkeeping fees that are negotiated by bookkeepers and users. Basic fees are transferred directly between them. The other one is additional service fees, including asset registration, bookkeeper candidate registration, and asset write off. Additional service fees are consumed/burned and will be redistributed to ANS holders.  As for centralization vs decentralization, we use dBFT consensus algorithm, which is a combination of delegate and BFT. The bookkeepers group needs to reach at least 66% consensus. Say there are 60 bookkeepers, if a single institution wants to take control of the system, at least 40 bookkeepers should come from the institution side. That is actually very hard. I'll provide math calculation later to show you the immunity of centralization.  Thanks!",False

I've spent the last couple of hours to read and learn more about it.  But I have a few questions. I'm not a technical-guy but what I would like to understand better is this:  What is delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance, or dBFT?  I believe that I understand the principle, that it's about elected nodes run by professionals, but:  ...in the Pre-Ann it's said:  ""The consensus model is a Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance, which is similar to Delegated Proof-of-Stake Model. In Antshares, ANS holders will vote on trusted nodes who will confirm transactions.""  Will there be a limit of nodes?    And the economical-design is very(!) interesting, but also not easy to understand.  My first question may sound naive: Shareholders (ANS) get ANC-payouts, right? It's not selling ANS for ANC, ANS won't be ""consumed"" for ANC? Are there two different kind of addresses or how does that work practically?     And it's said that both ""tokens"" will be tradeable and I'm very eager to see how the exchanges will find prices in such a complex system. It needs some understanding to come to rational conclusions about value. ;-)  My next questions: Who and how will the price of using the system will be set? Or with other words: If the price of ANC would explode out of irrational-market-pumping - what will prevent the whole system to become too expensive to use it? In the whitepaper it's said ""Antshares uses fiat currency internally.""  Is that combined with a price-fixing regarding the fees to use the system? And: Is that (Fiat) already safe regarding law and regulations etc. or could there be setbacks or even a ban/barrier?    A more practical question regarding the market: Will ANS also launch on western-exchanges, hopefully Poloniex, or is that something that shouldn't be expected right after launch?   Sorry if I missed the answers. I've read this thread and the whitepaper, but it's not easy to understand while it's really interesting.",False

In the whitepaper is said:  ""ANC are used for  Accounting Charge payment Extra Service Charge payment Bookkeeper Nominee Deposit as collateral""  ....and:  ""ANC will be written into the corresponding ANS addresses proportionally. ANS holders could claim these ANC to their ANS address anytime they wish to. For example, a shareholder who has 1% of all the ANS could acquire 8*0.01=0.08 ANC in every block of the 1st year, meaning 460.8 ANC everyday.""   ...and:  ""To write a transaction onchain, a certain number of AntCoins will be charged as accounting fees, which goes to the bookkeepers to compensate their expenditures in storage, connection and computing resources. (...) As long as more than 2/3 of the bookkeepers are willing to, a transaction can be free of charge when writing into the Antshares Blockchain. Thus, organizations using Antshares in bulk could pay the bookkeeper offchain with fiat currency without further the hassle of paying AntCoins onchain.""  Bookkeeper = nodes? There is said ""could pay the bookkeeper offchain"" - singular? Or is that just a typo/error?    There will be 8 ANC per Block and those new created ANC will be distributed to 100% to the shareholders, right?  And those who will run the nodes will be paid with fees whenever the system is used or if 2/3 of the bookkeepers agree in fiat.   I try to think about possible price-scenarios of ANC. Thing is: If those who will run the servers could agree to take no fee but Fiat off-chain, there would be not that much incentive to care about the price of ANC or am I wrong? It's a very theoretical scenario, because it can be expected that those who will run the nodes will also hold shares and get payouts in ANC and some fees in ANC but what I try to find out in short words: Will the price of ANS and the price of ANC be connected in a predictable way or will it be more kind of surprise?  ;-)   And when it comes to the question of immutability and decentralization: What could prevent a centralized scenario if, for example, a big company would hold so many shares that they could vote that many own servers as bookkeepers to get the whole system under centralized control?    My questions are really not meant critical in any way because in my opinion it's the most interesting economical design since Factom - but more complex and really not easy to understand. ;-)",False

It's really good to have people actually reading the White Paper in details. Your interest is very much appreciated!  For your questions: 1. So ANC will be given to the ANS holders by giving them the right to initiate a transaction to claim the ANC in the system. In that way, the right to initiate ANC claim is consumed, but ANS is not. 2. You can understand the value of ANC and ANS in a way pretty much like loans. Holding the ANS is like holding bonds and you will get ANC (interest & principle) payment in the future. Now we are doing ICO and market will determine the price for ANS. If ANC is too expensive people will long ANS and short ANC. That will decrease the ANC price. Also, people can directly use fiat currency in the system to buy ANC. Also we hold certain amount of ANC if we find that people are holding ANC with a malevolence intent to speculate, making ANC price to go up and unaffordable for normal users, we'll provide additional supply. 3. Some of our fees are fixed for now such as asset registration. Others like bookkeeper fees are determined by the market. As for fiat currency it is fine in China because its nature is more of buying a kind of service. But for overseas fiat currency I have to confess that we are not sure if there is setbacks 4.

Yes, all new ANC will be distributed 100% to ANS holders. And yes for the bookkeeping fees. For the ANC consumption, bookkeeping fees could use fiat directly but other activities such as asset registration requires ANC consumption and those consumed ANC is back to the system awaiting ANS holders to initiate a claim transaction. Price of ANS is the present value of a serial of ANC payments. It's like a bond. As for this ICO we are mainly distributing ANS to individual investors. In the future there might be a big company trying to buy Antshares. But as you may see from historical merger & acquisition cases, hostile takeover will definitely cost a lot. We believe the ANS price will be around the fair value normally so if hostile takeover happens, the acquiring firm will have to pay a lot more than what the system values.

""Confirmed"" is a probability expression under bitcoin, any transaction can be removed from the blockchain as long as there is a alternative history with more hashing power.  Joint mode means every block is validated by multiple parties, unlike a single node as in PoW/PoS/DPoS. You are right, joint mode enables finality with one confirmation.  ""it requires nodes to authenticate themselves to achieve a weak trust from other nodes"", authenticate here means approving it's own identity.

This previously rumored technology now all of a sudden became the key word among venture capitals and financials. Not long ago, U.S. blockchain firm Circle concluded its D-round at 60 million USD, once again, proving the capital magnetism of blockchain start-ups.  Founded in 2014, Antshare is one of the early Chinese non-profit community-driven blockchain projects. While the team behind Antshare set up Onchain as a company to promote and enrich Antshare ecosystem. Onchain also provides technological solutions for companies with its blockchain capability.  Antshare is a decentralized network protocol based on blockchain technology. It digitalizes real-world assets and equities, enabling registration, issuance, transfer, trading, clearance and settlement services via a p2p network. According to its founder, Mr. Da Hongfei, Antshare can be applied to equity ICO, P2P loan, digital asset management and smart contract, etc. When applied to equity ICO, start-ups could acquire value assessment and liquidity while users are granted with an exit mechanism. By registering equities on Antshare Blockchain, start-ups could be funded in a Blockchain ICO fashion.  When applied to P2P loan, online loan platforms may register the creditor rights on Antshare, making these rights transferable and tradable and hence increasing the liquidity. This also makes equities beyond the clientele of users of a single platform. Users may be assured to purchase long-term claims under high interest rates without worrying emergency monetization. With the Antshare trading and transferring functionalities, users may monetize their registered long-term claims whenever they want. Moreover, companies could issue their own bonds with Antshare.  In terms of employee holdings, Antshare was designed to provide flexible control over equities to client companies. Companies may limit that equities can only be held by certain employees, or set a cap of the percentage of equities transferable or tradable. For example, a company could set that an employee can only transfer his/her holdings of the company equities by 25% per year.  When it comes to smart contract, Antshare is different from payment systems like Bitcoin, but a blockchain-based digital contract system. Users sign the contract with their private keys thus concludes the transfer of digital assets. In fact, Antshare could be implemented on any kind of digital asset.  If the subject matter of the contract are digital assets already registered on Antshare blockchain, its delivery and execution will be programmed to automatically perform onchain. If the subject matter is offchain, the parties involved shall execute the contract on their own. Even in the latter scenario, Antshare is able to cut the red tape of signing and keeping large piles of paper contracts, ensuring enforceability with digital signatures.  During the development of blockchain or bitcoin, regulatory compliance has been always the unavoidable. To address this issue, Antshare has build-in KYC&AML APIs. Third-party payment providers and banks may use Antshare without legal issues. For the sake of missing private keys, Antshare has an Asset-Retrieving mechanism in place, that is, even if you lost your private key to a certain address, you could still retrieve it without resorting to a third party. In the end of October, 2015, Antshare concluded its ICO, raising 2,100 bitcoins within 10 days. After nearly 1 year, the long-expected second-round of Antshare crowd-funding is on the horizon. Da Hongfei told us that the second-round will be open on August, 8th to a global audience. Based on international practice, this round of crowd-funding of antshares accepts only bitcoins.",False

Antshares' Chief Architect Shed Light on the Upcomming Developer Initiative! Tech guys check this out! https://www.antshares.org/en-US/Blog/Details/31    Antshares is a decentralized and distributed ledger protocol that digitalizes real-world assets into digital ones, enabling registration, depository, transfer, trading, clearing and settlement via a peer-to-peer network.  Antshares keeps records of the transfers of digital assets with e-contracts. In Antshares, digital tokens generated by e-contracts function as general underlying data and could be used for recording titles and assets like equities, creditor’s claims, securities, financial contracts, credit points, bills and currencies, and could be applied for areas like equity crowdfunding, equity trading, employee stock ownership plans, peer-to-peer financing, loyalty programs, private equity funds, and supply-chain financing, etc.  understand antshares in 90 seconds    Linking the Real-World with Compliance  - Replacing Tokens with E-Contracts The transfer on Antshare is conducted in the form the e-contracts. In most cases, the transfer of assets requires the digital signatures signed with the private keys from both the sender and the receiver. In certain cases, an extra signature from the issuer of the asset is required. Recording transfers of assets on the Antshare is merely an onchain solution of the transfer of offchain assets. There are no new legal relationships that parties could enter into, so unlike the tokenization, flaws in laws are eliminated.  - User-Controlled Identity Authentication  Antshare employs digital certificate to perform user identity authentication. Users (individuals or institutions) may apply for digital certificates from the certificate authority (CA) to prove the correlation between the identity and the public key controlled. CAs will not be appointed by Antshare, but freely chosen by the parties of a trade. For example, Chinese users may choose any one of the 38 CAs recognized by the MIIT, or choose the company who registered the equity to be the CA, to perform identity authentication and issue the certificate.Rather than the X.509 digital certificate solution, Antshare employs blockchain to maintain the certificate revocation list and is set to gradually develop a blockchain-based digital certificate and identity authentication solution.  Meeting the Demands of Financial Trades  - Certainty Bookkeeping without Forks Antshares uses Joint mode for bookkeeping. Joint mode is advantageous over consistency and finality, it requires nodes to authenticate themselves to achieve a weak trust from other nodes.  - We Use Fiat Currency Crypto-currencies like bitcoin could deliver a sound function as the medium of exchange, i.e. users may transfer assets globally via bitcoin. However, inflexible supply of crypto-currencies makes them highly volatile in price and jeopardizes their capacity to function as bookkeeping units and value storage.This is to say, while ANS is the stake and ANC is the gas, fiat currency can be directly used as currency on the Antshares Blockchain.  - The Division of Labor of Nodes and their Professionalization With Antshare, our design goal is to have a clear division of the system’s workload. Bookkeeping nodes are at the center of the Antshare Blockchain. They are trusted by the holders of AntShares in reaching consensus and generating new blocks. Full nodes are critical participants of the Antshare network. They are run by service providers to store complete historical data and detect and relay transactions.  Highly Scalable Framework Design  - Low Latency, High Throughput and Pluggable At the moment, the block generating rate is manually set at 15 seconds. With low enough latency in inter-nodes connection in the future, most blocks will be generated by every 1 second. With the bandwidth at 100Mbit/t and external cryptographic computing hardware, the Antshare Blockchain is capable of handling thousands, if no tens of thousands, of transactions per second.  - Hierarchical Design and Superconducting Transaction Our hierarchical design places the order-book-keeping and order-matching functions on the second layer while achieving the full trading capacity through a mechanism called superconducting transaction.  dBFT Consensus Algorithm https://www.antshares.org/Files/A8A0E2.pdf  1st refundable ICO (rICO) in the World  Refund Policy We do have a refund policy should an over-funding scenario comes up due to the unlimited ICO funding target. When the ICO terminates on Sept. 7th, 2016(Beijing Time), ICO participants could have the option of continuing or quitting based on the general conditions of the funds raised. If a participant wishes to continue, he/she will not be required to do any extra operations; if he/she wishes to quit, a refund application should be submitted on www.antshares.org/ico anytime before the formal release of the Antshares Mainnet. When a refund takes place, 100% of the bitcoins invested by the participant shall be refunded to the bitcoin address designated by the participant in his/her refund application. The refund option will become unavailable upon the formal release of Antshares software, which is under development. The release date of the software is not determined yet but will not be within 7 days after the ICO termination, leaving adequate period of time for the participants’ deliberation. All the bitcoins due in the refund process will be sent 30 days after the formal release of the software all together. The refund policy does not support a partial refund and is not revocable once applied. Valid ICO amount and its allocations will be announced within several days after the formal release of our software. Should a special occasion occur during the ICO, say, malicious refund leading to a 2/3 refund ratio, Antshares team reserve the right to proclaim invalidity of this ICO and refund all bitcoins raised.
