He also added –“We are already into a digital era where transparency offered through blockchain is demanding banks to conduct its business in the most efficient and cost effective way.. We are already have approvals to start our banking using blockchain as backend technology and a interbank transaction coin which is gold backed is next in our agenda.”  Digital banking has evolved and is the top category in fin-tech space however innovation in creating new investment products has been lacking.

Our new network is ready and we are ready to swap.  Swap procedures will give us the security of eliminating all orphan coins that were mined after exploit. It is important to read carefully and follow exact steps in order to have a successful swap.  1. Open your wallet     Go to Tools -> Show automatic backups     Go one step up to OryxCoin     Copy your wallet.dat to your desktop     Close your wallet  2. Delete all content in your Oryxcoin folder    (make sure you have saved your wallet.dat before deleting the folder)  3. Download latest OryxCoin wallet v. 1.5.0.0 from here: https://github.com/oryxian/oryxcoin-resources/releases/tag/OryxCoin1.5.0   4. Open new wallet V 1.5.0.0 Generate new recieving address under File-> Receiving addresses   5. Send an email to Ciprian@oryxprive.com with: -your new OryxCoin address from wallet V1.5.0.0 -your old wallet.dat file ( attached )  We request you to send an email with wallet.dat and new address because every wallet.dat will be manually checked.  Every wallet.dat holder will receive in his new OryxCoin address all the coins that were in his addresses up to block 206510.  All the coins that were mined after block 206510 are part of an orphan chain and are deleted.  Once you received your new OryxCoin in wallet V1.5.0.0 you need to backup your wallet / encrypt your wallet / unlock for staking.  We need all of the community to first stake in order to help the new network to move blocks. A script will be published for Merchantnode setup after we start the swap and the staking begins.

GENERATION FULL POS MASTERNODES] ORYX COIN,"Interview with Ciprian Popa, CEO and Co-Founder of Oryx Ecosystem:  https://cryptoorders.com/articles/interview-ciprian-popa-ceo-co-founder-oryx-ecosystem/  1. What is the Oryx ecosystem and what is the vision behind it?  The Oryx ecosystem is a multifaceted platform that harmonizes technology with investing and banking in a way that creates real value for all of the members of the Oryxian community. Technology is at the heart of Oryx’s ecosystem. We use a third generation blockchain called Nihilo, that we developed entirely in-house. This blockchain powers all of the different platform in the Oryx ecosystem.  Oryx has a blockchain-powered venture capital fund that invests in startups and nascent companies that use technology as a business enabler or differentiator.  Our digital asset is called OryxCash (ICO started on August 20th). Members subscribe to OryxCash, and this subscription powers investment into the VC fund.  In the Oryx ecosystem, there are three banks, which are in different stages of formation in the jurisdictions of Puerto Rico, Uruguay, and Peru respectively. These fully licensed commercial banks will serve as value enhancers for the ecosystem by providing Oryxian members the banking platform they need to monetize their digital asset holdings held in their OryxPay e-wallet. OryxPay is our Mastercard-powered payment platform, which we believe is a game-changer for the crypto investment community. I noticed that a lot of entities that try to monetize wallet holdings into fiat currency fail. We wanted to create a payment platform that actually works in the real world.  In addition, there are five other utility platforms where the utility value of our digital asset, OryxCoin is enhanced. These utility platforms include a lotto and auction platform, a platform that monetizes social media accounts, a funding platform for movies and entertainment programs, and an e-casino platform. OryxCoin, which is publicly traded, also gives community members a chance to earn additional income through staking and masternodes. OryxCoin will also be used to pay dividends to OryxCash holders.  The ecosystem aims to have an integrated platform that will enhance the value of its stakeholders and generate income for the Oryxian community.  2. What are the products powering Oryx?  Two digital assets power the Oryxian ecosystem: OryxCash and OryxCoin. Both digital assets run on our in-house developed blockchain—Nihilo.OryxCash is the asset-backed digital asset that is the core of our product. OryxCoin is our utility coin.    3. What can you tell us about OryxCash?  OryxCash is the asset-backed digital asset of Oryx. The most important thing to note is that subscriptions to OryxCash lead to the creation of the venture capital fund that is central to the platform’s operations. The fund invests capital into startups and companies in their early stage of development. These companies all use technology as an enabler, enhancer, and differentiator.    4. How will OryxCash help the startup companies in the long run?  OryxCash creates the venture capital fund, and this fund invests into technology-powered startup companies. OryxCash is an ongoing ICO. In the current round, we will be raising and deploying $45 Million USD. Later on, we will issue more OryxCash for subscription when the need for more investments arises. Thus, we will create an on tap fundraising source for startups. Oryx provides funding as quasi-equity, so it also acts as a long-term partner to investee companies. This will make Oryx the ideal funding platform for many startup companies.    5. What is OryxCoin?  OryxCoin is the utility coin of the Oryx ecosystem. OryxCoin is on a public blockchain and is mineable. Currently, OryxCoin is listed on three popular cryptocurrency exchanges and i available to trade on those exchanges. A few more exchanges are already working on making OryxCoin available to trader.  OryxCoin is paid to the holders of OryxCash as dividends upon gains in the valuation of the venture capital fund portfolio. OryxCoin also provides holders with the opportunity for additional income through staking and masternodes. The total supply of of OryxCoin is 21 million. 8.5 million coins have already been mined.  OryxCoin has enhanced utility because we have developed five platforms for the Oryxian community that will allow them buy products and services in exchange for their OryxCoin holdings.    6. What are the future plans in developing this promising project?  The project will work towards improving ideation, innovation, and entrepreneurship. We are already in talks with a variety of incubators and accelerators. We plan to develop a program along the lines of Shark Tank. Thus, entrepreneurs will have a platform where they can present their business ideas to the Oryxian community for a chance to receive funding.  We are also working on establishing a training and development institution in India. The institution will train developers, coders, and consultants who will then be used for the consulting arm of Oryx. They will help implement and execute the blockchain for projects in both the private and public sector.  We are also exploring further opportunities to bring different cryptocurrencies into the Oryx’s payment platform. That way their holders will be able to monetize their holdings using the MasterCard payment gateway.",False

GENERATION FULL POS MASTERNODES] ORYX COIN,"Latest news from our Ceo and Co Founder Ciprian Popa: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/oryxcash-vc-20-ico-ciprian-popa/  Dear Family, Friends, Colleagues and Fellow Oryxians  I would like share with you the progress on Oryx project we have been tirelessly working for past 20 months, and try to explain what we have achieved so far.  Oryx is a product of combined efforts of a professional team consisting of over 25 members having 400 man-years of combined experience. It is a combined effort of this team in their pursuit of facilitating venture capital industry by resolving issues faced by this market sector, and ensuring that investment into potential startups becomes accessible to the mass affluent of our society.  The vision is to solve problems such as Liquidity, Transparency of the funds being utilized, High Investment Barriers, Technical concerns for traditional Venture Capitalist, and enable access of mass affluent investors to potentially hot startups. We aim to achieve this through the creation of a decentralized financial ecosystem, and distribution of the fundraising model into the community: through deployment on blockchain and tokenizing the fundraising process by issuance of OryxCash Coins.  We are striving to create a financial ecosystem where everything will be integrated like a completed value chain. In this retrospect, our utility coin OryxCoin—a Proof of Stake based Coin is already launched, and available for public trading on two crypto exchanges named Southxchange and Coinexchange. It is already finalized to be listed on Cryptal Dash, while we are also in the later stage of our negotiations with the leading crypto trading exchanges including but not limited to HitBTC, Cryptopia, Sistemkoin, Bittrex, Binance, and KuCoin.  Being a utility coin, OryxCoin will also be accepted in our in-house utility platforms Nickets— Crypto based raffle platform with a fair and transparent reward mechanism, Bartero— A social platform enabling you to monetize your daily online social activities, and Nihilo Marketplace—A state of the art ecommerce platform providing online marketplace for B2B, B2C and P2P purchasing of goods and services. Moreover, OryxCoin is also being accepted at an Indian based gaming platform for making in-app purchases. (As a medium of account)  I would specifically like to mention that with the help of our partner bank Est Capital Zug, Switzerland, we are in the process of acquiring the approval of issuing Master Card based debit cards, that would enable OryxCoin holders to instantly liquidate/cash out their coins at millions of ATM points, Point of Sale and merchants across the globe.  As per the roadmap, we are in the process of Initial Coin Offering for OryxCash—A hybrid asset-backed digital token that would enable investors to acquire equities into potential startups. There is a proper mechanism for determining the potential of such startups which is to be done by the Investment Committee consisting of: highly experienced Venture Capitalists, Fintech experts, professionals from AI, IoT and Blockchain Industry and Oryx Advisory Board. Also, 30% of the voting would be decided through Democratic Voting—a feature that allows OryxCash holders to decide to vote whether to invest in a startup or not.  Moreover, in our bid to give back to society, Oryxian global investment mission is to promote social awareness opportunities supporting charitable and humanitarian projects in a variety of municipal public good sectors. Our investment guidelines ensure that the groups and organizations we collaborate with can add value and enhance the “Human Development” equation for all aspects of life.  We have partnered with Rotary Tanzania, part of Rotary International and other partner charity organizations. Upon our successful exit from any investments, 2% of the gain from such an exit would be allocated to the Rotary and other partner charity organizations. The names of new charity partners would be announced on the website, as and when, the partnership with them are finalized.  In order to get our message heard and expand our offering to the wider global community, we are looking for writers, influencers, and YouTube bloggers or anyone who share the same vision as we do.  We sincerely offer such visionaries and influencers an opportunity of potential mutual collaboration.

We are serious utility coin that is focused on building stable and solid infrastructure for long term investment and we are her to stay. The so called fact that you claim that we ""are a scam"" actually tells a lot more about your personality and level of cognitive dissonance, than what you try to imply about us ! We are family and I take personal offence of stupid retard comments like this. If you were intelligent enough to do your own research and bothered to follow our official channels you would not ask such stupid questions and offend our project by calling it a scam. We are community of elite entrepreneurs, managers, investment bankers, VC funds, lawyers, marketing specialists and people within government and we have more than +500 years manpower of knowledge combined. So if you dont have patience and think you get rich quick, you are in the wrong place. We are here to facilitate transmission of power from the 1% to the 99% and we will persist and never give up before we reach our goal! We want to build a stable and non volatile currency that is as easy to use as possible in order to gain mass adoption!  Bottom line is this: Listing on larger stock exchange will be announced when it´s available ! If you dont have patience and only are looking for short term investment, please go sell you coins. My community is ready to buy. We like weeding out weak hands and enjoy when people sell cheap so we can build more masternodes for free, we are in for long term hold, aka minimum 5 years ahead and if thats to long for you, you can always find a new Bitconnect, they pop up everywhere everyday.
