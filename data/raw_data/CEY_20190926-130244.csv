Customers who travel to multiple countries with various forms of currency inevitably run into the “Cash Withdrawal Fee” and “Currency Transaction Fee.” These charges are often a percentage of the transaction plus a flat fee, industry-leading fees are between 2.75% – 2.99%.

This technology is standardised worldwide and your CHIP enabled debit card can be used and is compatible everywhere (where Mastercard is accepted)  Contactless (formerly called paypass) is a card technology that allows for quick payment for small personal purchases in shops etc. by just tapping or waving the card at a card terminal. No PIN or signature is needed for small amount purchases. There are protections against accidental or double payments. Contactless replaces cash for small payments.
