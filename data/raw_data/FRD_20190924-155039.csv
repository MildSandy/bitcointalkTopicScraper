The balance of 1,400,000,000 FRD tokens, which were not distributed, have been burnt.  After the closing statement of the FARAD Program, the team has heard the concerns of the community on the remaining FRDs and has taken them into serious consideration.  I would like to put all doubts to rest on the tokens’ destination.  After much deliberation, the team has decided to burn the tokens through a wallet without a private key, making the tokens inaccessible and unavailable to be used forever.  The wallet address is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001.  This will also put to rest any concerns whether the supply of FRD tokens will increase in the future and is part of the transparency process of the blockchain system.  Furthermore since there are less tokens up for trade, the tokens that are available will become more valuable.  Hence, this is a way of rewarding the contributors for their continued support.  Finally, I would also like to assure that the rest of the FARAD Program is continuing smoothly according to plan and we will keep the community updated on the progress.

Total FRD which are eligible to be traded are 200,000,000 FRD, which were issued to the Public and Program Manager.  The trading places are as follows:  1. Etherdelta Trading Platform: etherdelta.com 2. Decentrex Trading Platform: decentrex.com 3. Virtue Exchange Trading Platform: vxe.ae  We have chosen the above platforms as the first batch of trading platforms based on the following basis:  a. FRD is an ERC20 tokens based on the Ethereum platform. The above platforms (i.e. Etherdelta & Decentrex) represents about 30% of total ERC20 tokens trading volumes. Which means FRD is traded on the most liquid and vibrant trading platforms for ERC20 tokens.  b. We are promoting Pure Peer-to-Peer and decentralised trading platforms as they are the real future of any blockchain based coins and tokens.  c. We also believe that “pure” Peer-to-Peer platforms are better from the prices discoveries as well as fairness in price - since they are not controlled by large market players, which could influence the price behaviour of the tokens, which is evident from the price behaviours of many tokens traded on some of the major trading platforms.  d. At the same time, we are setting up Virtue Exchange Trading platform which will carry out similar practices of “pure” Peer-to-Peer Trading Platform, which would make FRD as its base token (beside ETH), which will then make it to be the main Trading Platforms for FRD. Virtue Exchange (VXE) is expected to be ready soon.  e. We have applied to other major exchangers for trading of FRD on their platforms, however the decision by them when FRD will be available for trade on their platforms hinges upon the volume and liquidity of FRD trading - which may be achieved after a few months of trade. We will continue in our engagement with them and announce the results as they come along.",False

HASNI  In addressing certain inquiries as well concern expressed by FRD holders, Dr. Wan M. Hasni has penned down his personal replies. Today, he will talk about the cryptocurrency market and exchange  CRYPTOCURRENCY MARKET AND EXCHANGERS  1.   Cryptocurrency (CC) market is extremely volatile and new. Therefore, we can see too many volatilities in the markets, wherein last 30 days BTC is up by about 35%, ETH up by 16%, BCH (bitcoin cash) by whopping 250%, and so on. Such environment is clearly wildly speculative and very unhealthy for the CC market. We expect that the volatile market will continue and unabated for quite some time. So far, CC market exhibits zero-sum-game scenarios - whereby my gain could be somebody else loss (or vice-versa).  2.   FARAD is within the same ecosystem, but not at the centre of the storm. The expectation to “pump-and-dump” is high among some participants - which is for FRD to shoot up in price in a very short time and some people will then dump it, in hopes of high and quick returns. The “dump” will only be done on someone else, who will then have to face the possibility of losses.  3.   CC is actually a Peer-to-Peer system, whereby all transfers of coins or tokens are among the CC community. Many large exchangers are operating NOT on Peer-to-Peer principles, whereby they operate through “market-makers”, which pushes the prices of some tokens to the “roof” then suddenly the prices collapse without any recovery thereafter. All “big-exchangers” are practicing a very unhealthy practice which is tantamount to “market rigging” and “price-fixing”. On that score, all “centralized exchangers” will be put under regulations by their country of origin at anytime soon. (We expect that spates of regulations are coming within the very near future. China already banned the “centralized exchangers earlier). In fact, the SEC did make some remarks that these exchanges are involved in some “unfair market practices”.  4.   For that reason, FARAD team is pursuing centralized exchangers with much caution and care. First, to avoid any “pump-and-dump” behaviors, and to avoid any unhealthy market practices that will affect the long-term prospect of FARAD to be within “Stable Token Agenda”.  5.   For this reason as well, we promote FARAD to be listed on pure Peer-to-Peer exchangers (EtherDelta and Decentrex), because in our analysis, these are “autonomous exchangers” where everything is transparent and can be seen and observed by the market participants.  6.   However EtherDelta and Decentrex suffer from another element, that is there is no market making, which “match the order books” in a sequential manner. Anyone can match any orders at any prices as he or she wishes. This is a major defect of such Peer-to-Peer exchangers. That’s why we can see FRD trading at some ridiculously low prices or at times at ridiculously high prices. In other words, there are no clear senses of mark-to-market prices. For this reason, we can see some people commenting on prices “too low” and commenting why that is the case. It is not about prices too low or too high, it is that the order book is not being filled (or matched) in sequential orders.  7.   To fill this void, we plan to launch a “sequential matching of order book” Peer-to-Peer exchanger under Virtue Exchange of Blockchain Digital Assets, because that is what is currently missing within current Peer-to-Peer exchangers.    8.   We ask FARAD holders to be patient because to set up such exchangers with the proper market mechanism, and yet avoiding the pitfalls of major exchangers is no easy task, but we will surely be up for it. We need some more time to finalize the codes and test them before it can be fully operational.  9.   Virtue Exchange will also be available as a Distributed App (DApp), which is currently non-available among other Peer-to-Peer exchangers.  10.   Among the features of Virtue Exchange is for participants to deal with the trade directly from their ImToken wallets (or any other third party wallets). This is currently not the practice of any other exchangers (major ones as well as Peer-to-Peer), whereby you have to deal with “their designated wallets” from your private wallets. There are many other features that will be introduced to overcome the defects of these existing exchangers. For that, we need a bit of time and we ask for some patience as we work to provide you the best services we can offer in the market.",False

NOVEMBER 20, 2017 - The Farad Programme is pleased to announce a significant new contract has been awarded to HK Aerospace Beidou New Energy Technology Co. Ltd., (‘AeroBeidou’) with a top elevator company in the world.  This huge win ensures that Aerobeidou can easily cover the full 36 months swap-back program with Farad holders without relying on any other contract.  The US$ 248mil supply contract was signed between Aerobeidou and Guangzhou Kone Elevator Co. Ltd. on January 23, 2017.  Aerobeidou is to supply 30,000 units of Ultra-capacitor Emergency Cell Module and the equivalent units of IoT software to Kone.  These will be installed in Kone’s current and future escalator products.  To recap, the original token swap contract is 1.6 bil FRD tokens.  However during the Farad program, only 200mil FRD tokens were sold.  Under the contract manufacturing and sales agency agreement for the swap-back program, Aerobeidou agreed to act as an agent to sell the tokens at a price of US$ 0.145 per MF (each FRD represents 1 mF).   Therefore, the value of the Kone contract is three times more than the 36 months swap-back program.  Dr Wan M. Hasni, Chief Executive Officer of Farad Programme, said the contract provide an assurance to FARAD holders that the swap-back program will commemorate as planned at a swap-back price of US$ 0.145 per FRD (redeemable in ETH equivalent at the time of redemption).  “We are delighted to announce such good news to our token holders and we look forward to forming more of such partnerships in future.  “Farad is always in search of innovative and top-of-the-market ideas in expanding its programme to benefit our contributors,” he said.

In order to put things in perspectives, it is quite important for us to analyse and comments on these developments in regards to FARAD.  First, regarding the US SEC and Singapore MAS: the ruling is clearly meant for parties offering ICOs which in essence had the purpose and intent of the “coins” being a substitute for securities offering or share offerings. This is clarified by performing what is termed as “Howey Test”. Under the Howey Test, a transaction will be classified as security if: It’s an investment of money There is an expectation of profit The investment of money is a common enterprise The profit comes solely from the effort of the seller or third parties  Second, regarding the Chinese central bank warning: the warning comes at the backdrop of so many ICOs being offered by Chinese parties or entities, to the Chinese public. What is peculiar when comes to these Chinese ICO offering, is the aggressive use of the so-called “Chinese exchangers”, which basically functions as market intermediaries. These exchangers do take “fiat currencies” (i.e. Yuan), for people to subscribe to these ICOs, which essentially makes them to be operating in the “investments intermediation” business. The warning is clearly directed to many exchangers in China and the ICOs being promoted by or through those exchangers.  It is important to note that all regulations thus far, DOES NOT specify or makes cryptocurrencies being illegal or outlawed. What it does is to ensure that the public are not being taken into cryptocurrencies to be an investment scheme or investment program, with promised of returns on investments and alike. Many of the ICOs of late are being touted as investments and being promised with multiple times of returns on investments. And worse still, many ICOs thrived on aggressive marketing by getting people to buy the tokens with fiat currencies, and aggressively marketed as exchangeable to fiat currencies at its multiples. This what makes these ICOs to be vulnerable and becoming a highly speculative investment.  FARAD is purely a TOKEN SWAP program, which strictly defines that we only accept BTC or ETH as the tokens acceptable to be swapped with FARAD. We don’t deal with cash or accept cash. Furthermore, we strictly defined the conversion ratios between FARAD and ETH. FARAD is part of Ethereum ecosystem development, with the notion of stable tokens as its agenda. FARAD should not be seen and used as an “investment programs” or “investment schemes”. The risks of FARAD lies with it’s business model, that is building a healthy ecosystem backed by the energy storage industry, and reliance on the Ethereum Blockchain systems.  FARAD had clearly refused to be associated with any “cash exchangers” from the early days due to the risks of being identified as investments program (in China or elsewhere). For that, we may have suffered slacking demands coming from anyone with “cash exchanging” in mind.  FARAD is in essence a Distributed Autonomous Organisation (or a DAO), which means that it does not exist within any specific jurisdiction and neither any specific country; even though the parties supporting the FARAD DAO do have physical and legal jurisdictions. A cryptocurrency (such as BTC or ETH) is actually a DAO, and hence FARAD should always remain as a DAO.  Furthermore, FARAD had from beginning avoid the use of the word cryptocurrency, and instead use the word Crypto-Token or Cryptoken; and the reason is very clear - that is to avoid the misrepresentation of the usage of the label: “currency”. A Cryptoken is NOT A CURRENCY, by any definitions of any forms of currency. Even though not a currency, this doesn’t mean that a Cryptoken may not have any value. A Cryptoken is a Digital Asset, or Digital Commodity. FARAD is a Cryptoken that fits this definition, and hence could have values assigned to it.  After the current TOKEN SWAP program, FARAD will continue to operates within Token Swaps framework. Token Swaps is an exchange between token with another token. For example, FRD would be directly exchangeable with any ERC20 tokens (such as ETH and alike).  In order to avoid any confusion, in the next immediate stage, FARAD will open it’s FARAD Store applications. FARAD Store, in essence is a store for exchanging FRD with goods and services, and it will also function as a Token Swap platform. This is among other things that will come in the way of FARAD, and all along I have been explaining about having FARAD to be functioning as a complete ecosystem.  We have designed and programmed FARAD to be confirming to these notions as described above, in order not to be caught in the current ICO frenzy and confusions surrounding cryptocurrencies.  Henceforth, under the current situation, I would say that FARAD is the right model of blockchain ecosystems; hence we should avoid any speculations related to other so-called ICO’s in the market. FARAD is NOT an ICO within most of those definitions (of investments), and in its essence, FARAD is a token swap program, and a program for building a healthy ecosystem surrounding it.  To avoid any more confusions, let us drop the words ICO from all of our communications.  Thank you and best regards,  Dr. Wan Hasni CEO, FARAD Program & Virtue Fintech FZ LLC",False

It is very heartening and humbling for me to see the support of people who embark along with me in this journey.  Honestly, I have to admit that most people are new to blockchain ecosystem, and many that I met are first timers as far as blockchain is concerned. I took a very hard approach of educating people by going down to many places personally to talk about blockchain and what FARAD Cryptoken Program is trying to add to the blockchain ecosystems, particularly to the Ethereum Blockchain system.  It is extremely hard to explain to everyone, with diverse background and knowledge, first about blockchain, second, about FARAD Cryptoken, third about energy storage industry, and fourth about the economic model behind all of them combined. The FARAD Cryptoken project involved not only blockchain algorithm as its operational backbone, but another set of algorithm as well, which is what I would termed as “economic algorithm”. To put them together in simple form is never easy, and could not be explained in one go.  I kept on emphasising many times about building an ecosystem under FARAD program as it’s prime target and objective. However, an ecosystem might mean different thing to different people. Let me explain here so that the same meaning could be transmitted and clarified. A FARAD ecosystem means that the participants and users of FARAD or FRD as Cryptoken is widespread not only in terms number of people, but they are also from diverse geographic location, will be used in diverse applications particularly in the energy storage industry and generally within wider economic applications, and finally the use is based on economic rationale rather than pure speculations.  The creation of FRD Cryptoken is meant to be its “genesis creation”, which in essence, first to create a crypto-token (or general cryptocurrency), second, to create the base valuation, namely the “escrow tokens” which will be backed or linked to “manufacturing tokens”, and third to to allow options for FRD to be “converted back” to it’s base, should ever the need arise within a certain time and conditions. This “genesis creation” is actually will be over a period of three years (or thereabouts) while the corresponding manufacturing process is undertaken, and the escrow being filled up. After such period, FRD would then have the corresponding backing in terms of the escrow token balance. The reason I use the word: “tokens” here is to signify that all items are actually would be recorded on the Ethereum Blockchain, which means that the whole strength of blockchain such as transparency, audit-ability, accountability could be applied. All of these are linked together through what is termed as “Smart Contracts” within an Ethereum Blockchain systems.  One thing that may confuse people is regarding the usage of US Dollar as “base valuation” for the “genesis creation” of the tokens. This is actually inevitable, since the easier route to explain about Ether (or ETH) as the “base currency” is rather problematic due to high volatility of ETH (as opposed to say, US Dollar). Whereas, in real terms, the economic algorithms are linked to actual fiat currency valuations. This “dis-jointment” is what cause the confusions. In normal circumstances, it would be easier just to simply “peg” FRD to ETH. But then, that would cause a gap between FRD and the escrow program, which will be filled from a “manufacturing process generator” which is based on fiat currency sources. And those fiat currency will have to be converted back into crypto-currency, which in general case would be ETH or any liquid cryptocurrency. This is one part of the economic algorithm which FARAD is using. Furthermore, there would be other economic algorithm which will be applied as we go along (i.e. As the ecosystem developed), that is to introduce what we would termed as “FARAD Store”, which essentially would create a platform whereby FRD could be used as a medium of exchange within the store. The FARAD Store will follow after creations of FRD (within very near future). At the back-end of the “escrow token”, there will be what we would termed as stabiliser operations, which is normally would be termed as “treasury operations”. The treasury operations is linked to the FARAD Store, which in essence providing what I would termed as “buyer of last resort”, which currently are not available within any other cryptokens (or cryptocurrencies) in the market. All of these are generically termed as the “economic algorithms” that will supplement the FARAD program, which will be introduced and applied as the development of ecosystem is progressing.  I have to admit that, in order for me to explain everything in absolute details of everything would be extremely hard (for people to gather what is meant by the whole thing), and furthermore, I don’t like to put the “cart before the horse”. It will add further complications and confusions, to what already is a hard subject to most. To provide some level of comfort for some people, let me just simply make a promise here that I will explain step by step as we go along on this journey. Nevertheless I have to accept that lot’s of things must be taken on the face value for now; and I do that for the sake of ensuring that we don’t confuse people unnecessarily and complicating the subject beyond what already is.  Lots of the things I said here actually is written in the draft of my upcoming book, which proposed title is “Blockchain Economy”, that is planned to be published before end the year (currently under editing and finalisation). I will provide the e-book version for free to all FARAD participants, when it is ready. The book provides in clearer details of what is meant by the economic algorithms as I mentioned.

It says somebody is really reading the Overview Paper. Thanks.      Ok, UCC is Ultra-Capacitor Cell. And you need a few of UCC to produce CC. Take it as the first step of the building block, before any further product can be produced, engineered.  How you use UCC? Well, our smallest product, Model 1515, uses 2 UCC. Hence, 40mF is being used, and it is very small - 0.25mm x 15mm x 15mm I'll furnish the details on Voltage and so on later.    The Price? 1 FRD (=1 mF) you offer for about 0.0000621 BTC which with current BTC price of 4600 dollar  makes a price of 0.28566 dollar per mF For a 0.02 Farad piece that makes 20 * 0.28566 dollar = 5.7132 dollar. This could only be justified if it is an ultra high voltage capacitor which UCC are not. They are very low voltage.  Actually, the price is being calculated as a 90-day, Simple Moving Average. Not a weighted one. As such, 1 FRD == 0.125 USD == 0.0005921 ETH. You can tell that the value of ETH being used by dividing the 2 - 0.125/0.0005921 == 211 USD.  So, 1000 FRD == USD 125.  Why USD 211? That is the result of the 90-day SMA. Of course, this is calculated just prior to the Pre-ICO. Why? Ether and Bitcoin are very volatile. That is.   1 Farad you sell for 1000 * 0.28566 dollar = 285.66 dollar You get 1 Farad capacitor (super capacitors) in normal stores for about 1 dollar.  1000 FRD == 0.5921 ETH. At the time of 90-day SMA calculation, it's just a shy of 120 bucks.    The Money you get? 1.6 billion FRD * 0.0000621 BTC = 99360 BTC 99360 BTC * 4600 dollar = 457 million dollar   Like I said, we calculate this based on the 90-day SMA. And the value is always in Ether, then converted to BTC. Only 1.28 billion FRD to be sold. If you calculate that, against 0.0005921, you'll get 757,888 max ETH, which based on 211 USD at the time of the calculation, it is about 160m USD.  Let me break it further: 1,280,000,000 FRD * 0.0005921 == 757,888 ETH 757,888 ETH * USD211 == USD 160,000,000  Hope that clears the air.",False

We are the leader in Metal-Oxide Ultra-Capacitor from our patents. And we can produce better capacitance value per dollar, unlike expensive Graphene-based UC.  And UC is pretty much a capacitor in series, except the electrolyte now is already in electrostatic, and not on electro-chemical as per normal capacitor. Our electrodes are symmetric activated carbon, which can store better charges as per Helmholtz double layer principle.  Now, since the UC are already double layer, and the electrodes are already in activated carbon, what may change if we replace activated carbon with Graphene? Symmetric graphene as electrodes? asymmetric Graphene as electrodes?  We have all these in store, and even we have tested different electrolytes with rare-metal, rare-earth metal and so on.  I can speak more on this, but these are our trade secrets, to be revealed until the new patents are finalised.    What is your USP?  If you looked closely, our Model 1515 is 15mm x 15mm x 0.25mm. You cannot find UC this small. Most of them are like dry-cell batteries.  And we can stack these UCC into whatever voltages our client require, and still doesn't take a lot of space.",False

First, on Ultra-Capacitor (UC): Our UC is a patented technology, to be used in combination with battery to supplant the energy requirement for mobile phones, electric vehicle, IoT, etc. Battery can store a large amount of energy, but can only dissipate them in small amount at a time - like a bottle, when you pour the water out, it takes time to empty the bottle, and it takes a long time to refill the bottle. UC, on the other hand, is like a vase. You can empty the vase, and refill it again in a very short time.  UC is a small vase, and battery is a big bottle. That's the analogy. From the big bottle into the small vase for faster energy transfer, or recuperation.  Second, on FARAD: FRD token is a forward contract of Ultra-Capacitor Cell. 1 FRD == 1mF. When you're buying FRD, you have the rights to the Forward Purchase Contract for the UCC manufacturing. It has a buyback value, so you really have a floor value on FRD.  Of course, FRD will be traded at exchangers after the ICO. You can sell at the participating exchangers, or sell back to us, whichever is higher for you.",False

I'll go to it by context.     Well, ultra-capacitor (UC) is just an energy storage medium that can store, and release very fast energy   Is this related to the automotive industry?  The applications of UC is on any device that needs fast energy release, and restore/recuperate - from EV, mobile phones, military, etc.   Do you have a research and production base? Or in the garage on the knee collect?  Our research is done for the the past 15 years, and we hold 27 patents of UC, specifically metal-oxide patents. Our patents have been used in productions for a few companies, and now we're mass-producing the UC ourselves.  4 Patents registered in China 15 Patents registered in Taiwan 8 Patents registered in USA   What research institutions do you cooperate with?  Here's an excerpt from our website: https://farad.energy Dr. Yao, is an expert in ultra-capacitor and energy storage technology. He has served in various research and technology positions in companies and higher institute of learning in China. He has a Ph.D. in metallurgy and materials science, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.  Our patents are also being used by Apogee, for example.   What team do you have?  We have a full research team in Taiwan, and China, just for UC research.   Why the capacitor, not the battery?  Capacitor alone cannot replace battery, as it has a lower power density than battery. A combination of UC AND battery is a potent one where we can have a very fast energy release, and a very fast charging of the battery when needed. For example, a Tesla car on Ludicrous mode with UC will be much more thrilling I can say. You can go ultra-fast with UC, and ultra-fast charging when needed.",False

The manufacturing of UCs are not related to the ICO funding, except for extending the manufacturing capabilities from 5 lines that we have so far. Only Line 1 of the manufacturing is being used for this ICO. Maybe extended to another line if receiving overwhelming response from the public.
