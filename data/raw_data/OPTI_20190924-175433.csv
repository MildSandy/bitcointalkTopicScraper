There was a time about 2 or 3 months ago when it was basically impossible to access the TON whitepaper. So essentially a lot of the theory on what GRAMS will accomplish was speculative. I thought it was basically snapcash on a DTL. THat would indeed be lame. However, I invite you to read the paper by Dr. Nikolai Pappalov of which where you'll be able to see that TON has real potential to compete with projects like Ethereum. I especially am bullish on the TON teams proposal to scale by sharding from a bottom-up method. It's one thing to say ""scaling"" ""sharding"" blah blah etc. Anyone can make a whitepaper and propose vapor fantasies and raise some capital BUT when it's said by a PHD who's co-founder to one of the worlds most successful and popular apps.. I tend to have more faith. You'll often hear me complain about the way ICO's are moving toward ""CENTRALIZING"" all fund raising to U.S. QI's but the fact of the matter is this, difficulty of access to some of these shrewd projects adds barrels of value to accessing. We received 2 opportunities to access the TON presale for the 2nd Tranche. One through BNKtothefuture and another through a private VC who I'm friends with a prominant member. I chose the deal from the latter as the market also seemed incline to more bear. Pegged and received a good price for a small amount of ICO buyings, these buyings now take place of those former ICO funds. It worked beautifully, just as ETH fell under $700 and charts pointed to more blood, we pegged our value and expect a 4x to 5x return on that portion of holdings. Details were described in our TG group if you care to scroll through and check that it's t.me/OptiToken we will continue to seize opportunity when it presents it self so long as it's in the best interest of OptiToken's long term growth and profitability.",False

To begin 16% will be quite sufficient, HOWEVER as we go along that number may need to be adjusted to best suit the OptiToken protocol. Bear in mind too that we are looking for certain thresholds before executing the buy portion of protocol. So if 16% profit from a particular cycle wouldn’t be enough to affect upward movement on an exchange based on avg volumes or open sell orders than we’ll simply put that amount aside and wait, in fact we may take those funds and use them for short “funding” orders to optimize that amount even more. Once it = or > the threshold we deem necessary than we will execute a buy(s). Sell walls may be sorely ad they were placed there as we chew through them and push higher.  As for the remaining % which is actually 82%, as 2% will go toward operational costs so that we have a profitable and sustainable business, that portion will be automated and indeed and will go right back into the “buy basket” to buy the next “oversold” target based on %’s and RSI’s.",False

We are definitely on our way.  Quote from: Hopernumbs on April 02, 2018, 04:40:10 PM This project seems like it was very well thought out and the team seems very experienced. What is the advantage of holding OPTITOKEN?  Thanks for the kind words. There are many advantages! By holding Optitoken you will be exposed to a token basket that increases in value through advanced algorithmic trading strategies. The profits will be distributed via buy backs and value will be consolidated by regular hyperdeflation. Thanks to the value fed by the OptiX trading engine, OPTI can increase in price even in bear markets. Right now, by holding Optitokens you will also be exposed to the Telegram ICO without the 100,000 USD minimum buy, as we have secured a % buy. Currently, thanks to our pegged prices, you can protect the value of the crypto you're holding by buying at ETH/BTC prices that are much better than the current market",False

OptiToken memperkenalkan konsep baru 'Tekanan Belian' dan 'Ketidakcukupan Strategik'  Cara ianya berfungsi adalah dengan menghasilkan keuntungan melaui siri perdagangan yang berterusan dan infusi ke dalam pasaran OptiToken sendiri untuk memberikan tekanan peningkatan harga yang berterusan . TToken yang telah dibeli itu kemudiannya akan dimusnahkan dengan menghantarnya ke dompet yang khas supaya ianya tidak dapat digunan bagi mengurangkan bekalan token dan supaya token tidak dapat dibenarkan dari memasuki semula ke ekosistem sebagai ʹtekanan jualan.ʹ Baki OptiToken akan meningkat nilai setiap kali kitaran ini berlaku.     Optitoken adalah didorong oleh portofolio perdagangan algoritma 24/7 matawang kripto terpilih dan telah terbukti. Pada asasnya, algoritma ini mengambil peluang daripada perubahan harga di antara kumpulan token terpilih, yang dikenali sebagai ʺThe Basket,ʺ atau bakul yang terdiri daripada beberapa koin yang berubah‐ubah, yang dianggap secara statistik atau dikategorikan sebagai bawah nilai. Mereka juga akan ditetapkan, dan projek yang didorongi oleh pertumbuhan dengan potensi peningkatan yang tinggi berdasarkan beberapa faktor menurut trend lampau pertumbuhan dan/atau purata pasaran. Ianya juga akan mengambil kira bekalan token dan permodalan pasaran.      ICO akan digunakan untuk membeli mata wang asas awal dan akan segera digunakan untuk perdagangan.

This portion will be done manually as there's no way to automate it AND also no real need to automate this. We were considering a few others but have chosen to pas on those.

Just ask if you have any question.  Quote from: MrDom2 on March 30, 2018, 07:00:59 PM hi guys, can u explain about distributing value, please?  So the way our model of distributed value works is that all profits generated from the automatic trading of the token basket are used to buy back Optitokens on exchanges. Buys will be planned carefully and executed on the most favorable times to create upward price pressure/action. This will favor the sellers (who sell at good prices), the traders (who get upward price action and nice volatility) and the holders, as the price spikes will attract external buyers (basic FOMO action) and because all tokens that are bought back are destroyed, created value through scarcity.",False

This will be a significant cycle and a very important one for establishment of our brand of currency! It should be a head-turner and should attract much attention which is great for marketing. As for future cycles, we will need to be able to accomplish sufficient support so we will need to determine thresholds to = or >. That will be quite easy to determine based on volume averages and limit buy/sell order depth at given times. As the project moves along the thresholds should grow and that’s a good thing as that would mean our organic volume is maturing and growing. OptiToken should be able to accomplish this in a manner that outpaced most projects that open and rely on simply twirling their thumbs and waiting/ hoping for adopters to come. As the thresholds grow though so should our ability to meet such thresholds theoretically as we should become more profitable over time assuming our algorithm meets or exceeds expectations and forecasts.",False

Thanks so much for the great questions and also nice feedback, let me answer some of your questions in what would hopefully be a sufficient manner:  1.) Are you referring to ANN not having something on that subject? Whitepaper had it originally, although we're a few edits later and I may actually need to check if that includes something regarding that. So actually the goal is to find a private insurer for a portion of deposits. It seems the most common availability of such a service is something where a company underwrites a portion of holdings. We are still working on that, it's not as easy as just contacting AIG yet! Maybe soon it will be, so as for custodial services, I'm actually having an issue with these providers. I believe Gemini is able to offer some kind of depositors insurance to a certain extent BUT only for US individual accounts if I recall correctly. Their fees are quite exorbitant, though is another issue. Somewhere to the tune of $100,000 or 1% yearly, whichever is greater. The same goes for ItBit HOWEVER, ItBit doesn't even offer US individuals any depositor correction but they have plenty of high level sales guys to respond and schedule Skype calls with you to explain ""why thats actually a good thing""?! Needless to say, we skipped that skype session. Coinbase has followed suit offering a replica service to Gemini of course haha. We'll skip on them as I can't imagine them placing OptiToken's fiduciaries ahead of any regulatory weird happenings that could come to any crypto service operating in a less than friendly GEO. Switzerland is a nice geo for that but the question becomes this: are any of those options more secure that Bitfinex's cold wallet security protocols for corporate accounts? They're not any different, unless any of them can offer something like insurance on part or all of coins they store for a customer than it makes really no sense to utilize their services over Bitfinex's nearly identical system, actually probably superior as they've been through real fire alarms and not just drills. So right now, we think the best plan of action is to utilize their system AND continue to try to find a company to underwrite a private policy for our project. There's no reason to believe we shouldn't be able to find a solution for this relatively soon. I would guestimate that by mid-March we can have some sort of agreement with a service provider that will assist in protecting the project a great deal. We will add all this to the next version of the WP as it shapes up.  2.) The way we'll likely pick what foreign currency to use at any given time will depend on a few things: availability and current value/trend. I don't think utilizing a basket of currencies makes sense for this at the moment but there's no need to rule something like that out, especially as the portfolio grows and project could become susceptible to intraday price volatility. Utilizing something like that would mean an additional service provider and some additional fees and in my opinion it just doesn't make sense for us at the current juncture. I know we would like to avoid the USD, any reason US regulators could find to say hey you're operating in US somehow or way is just another potential headache. It bodes well for that idea that the USD is currently heading in a downward trend for the foreseeable coming months, at least. BitFinex offers Euro and USD so for the most part I think we'll use the Euro, I also think the Euro is undervalued at the moment so I think it's sufficient for now. I'm semi familiar with the JPY as well so an eye will be kept on it. That's why those 2 are mentioned specifically.  3.) Stable coins are scary too! How stable really is a stable coin, right? I mean it's a question we must ask. Interestingly enough we came up with an interesting hedging method. I actually talk about it in an interview I did the other day. So stable coins are an ingredient of most crypto traders at some point in time, so one needs to consider the Tether dilemma. Is it a fear and propaganda campaign by the likes of banks or people with certain enormous traditional currency interest? Hard to say... Is it real? That's also hard to say. That being said, when the Tether hype was at its worse recently, we actually avoided and put the kibosh on any trades set to execute into it immediately. The result was a bit more loss than had to be realized when the market turned bear on that news and the other negative news around the same time. This was only a few weeks ago Im sure you recall. The answer I found, although how scalable and what risks it carries of it's own, is still being determined and calculated. So, Kraken offers a very interesting trading pair: USDT/USD! Interesting right? I'm looking at it for profitability purposes as well as there's potential there for sure, and anyone even semi-familiar with traditional ForEx can see that, especially since they have some weird way to get credits for fees at the moment. However the fee redemption is a bit confusing and I haven't been able to justify spending a lot of time on it currently, as there are more urgent matters in front of us at the moment. That being said, we recently test margin shorted Tether to USD at a small amount. Only 4000 tether, just to test the flow AND also as it technically was providing a decent little hedge for the test portfolio/algo that is indeed currently live on Bitfinex and plugged into our website VIA api. The position was actually closed at a profit of roughly $12 when UpBit announced they too are backing Tether. I thought that sufficient to close that test position and continue on as is. By that I mean, continue using USDT or EURT on BitFinex while continuing to seek out an insurance policy. So there is a really nice way to sufficiently hedge risk here on a stable coin, I think it's the clear option of stable coin to use as it also happens to be the only one BitFinex offers. Well what about Kraken though becomes the question, would that mean we would also need to seek some sort of depositors insurance policy there? Maybe... It may also be that we will want to avoid Kraken altogether, as they are based in the U.S., so it's a question that will also need to be addressed by legal. It would be pressed higher on the urgency check list HAD UpBit not come out saying they will also back Tether. But since that event happened it's been pushed down the list a bit BUT will be addressed and that info shared publicly of course. The other question here is what amount is needed to hedge at any given time, but that's a much easier question to answer and a simple formula can be made to suffice at the very least a partial hedge, if not complete. That too can be shared publicly and openly when we finish that work.  4.) A good and fair question, actually something we've discussed was a monthly look back at holdings and some sort of breakdown at what transpired. Yes someone could also look at the website and easily comprise the basket BUT that doesn't fully mean every token listed is what basket is comprised of A.) because that report I believe only offers so many lines to list trades and B.) because maybe one of the tokens in the basket just wasn't a trade target that when someone happened to go look and try to discern basket. Make sense? So yes, I think it's something we'll also run by the community as well as there's no reason for that to be a decision made behind closed doors.  5.) So thank you for pointing this out, this is something that needs to be updated in our documents (it wasn't ready when we drafted). We our officially incorporated and headquartered in The Cayman Islands. That section, wherever it state ""still being determined...."" will be replaced with address and a statement fitting to reflect that's where we are. It's important for the project to be headquartered somewhere that is tax friendly, no one wants big tax bills taking chunks out of the project quarterly or annually!  Also, I think Cayman Islands have established themselves as fairly crypto friendly so that was taken into account as well.  Per your comments: 1.) Another good question, it will likely depend on if people start demanding in droves the open-sourcing of such. It could be possible to open source YET obfuscate certain variables to appease all at the same time. Then the only complainers would be people who just want to run our script for their own selfish gains haha.  2.) You're 100% right, that term is not supposed to be there and thank you for pointing that out. It's important for people to understand this is not a fund, its actually closer related to operations that support traditional currencies. Although the difference is we seek to manipulate supply and demand SOLELY TO BENEFIT price, AND never to do something like inflate supply in hopes of ""nurturing employment"" or in support of any other economic fallacies. So thanks for pointing this out as well, that typo will be removed!  Awesome questions, I love having high level conversations with people who understand the concept. I invite you to join our groups on social media or anywhere that we can chat more in the future.",False

OptiToken does this to tip the scale in it's favor but it benefits all who are apart of OptiToken and not just a select few. Take for example De Beers and their manipulation of the worlds diamond supply to create the appearance of scarcity OR another great example is John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil. - Much more",False

Everything is thoroughly professional. From the website, to the team, to the whitepaper to the roadmap. I certainly appreciate the effort the team has put into making this project look thoroughly encouraging to investors.  I would like to find out though, the diversified cryptocurrencies that would be encapsulated into this token would be which ones exactly? Would they be already established cryptocurrencies or new ICOs?  Thanks very much for the kind feedback! For the time being, the projects basket of tokens is based mostly on established and actively developed coins. You can actually view the basket on the website. The tokens for the time being must be on Bitfinex although we would love to incorporate a few not listed there yet. In the future this may be possible, as well as ICO’s, but to keep it simple at first we are sticking to 90% projects with either something tangible such as the top 5 by marketcap as well as the top privacy coins. Then we include a few mid-cap projects with high upside and smallest percentage is comprised of a few high flyers.",False

OptiToken introduces the novel concepts of 'Buy Pressure' and 'Strategic Scarcity'  This works by creating profits from the ongoing series of trades of the OptiToken portfolio and infuse it into the market(s) of OptiToken itself to provide constant sporadic upward price pressure. The tokens purchased are then destroyed by sending them to an unspendable address to create ever growing scarcity in the token supply and disallow the tokens from re-entering the ecosystem as ‘sell pressure.’ The remaining OptiTokens held by the cryptocurrency’s adopters will gain value each time this cycle occurs.     Optitoken is fueled by a 24/7 algorithmic trading portfolio of established and manually selected cryptocurrencies. Essentially, the algorithm takes advantage of price swings among a select group of tokens, known as ""The Basket,"" made up of a variable number of coin(s) deemed statistically or categorically undervalued. They will also be established and growth driven projects with high upside potential based on several factors based on past trends of growth and/or market averages. It will also take into account token supply and market capitalization.      An ICO will be used to buy the initial underlying currencies and will be immediately put to work trading.  Our test portfolio, that uses the strategies that will be adopted by the algorithm, is consistently outpacing Bitcoin since it started, by about 40% to 100%. You can view the movements live on our website!  SIGN UP FOR PRE-SALE: https://optitoken.io/presale/    Unique Value Proposition  Optitoken's trademark strategies of Buy Pressure and Strategic Scarcity can create perfect conditions for price appreciation. As our algorithm trades automatically between the basket of tokens, a portion of the profits created will be used to buy OptiToken on the market, thus providing upward price pressure. Afterwards, the tokens will be sent to an unspendable address and be destroyed, creating scarcity and further increasing value.

Do you have any rough figures or is that something you can’t quite comment on? I mean technically it could rocket up to like €100+ a coin before coming down some but than garnering a second wave from the attention it draws. You should buy in waves the first batch, at least 2 or 3 waves saving biggest for last maybe. Anyways I’m excited and presale is purchased 👌",False

For the time being, the projects basket of tokens is based mostly on established and actively developed coins. You can actually view the basket on the website. The tokens for the time being must be on Bitfinex although we would love to incorporate a few not listed there yet. In the future this may be possible, as well as ICO’s, but to keep it simple at first we are sticking to 90% projects with either something tangible such as the top 5 by marketcap as well as the top privacy coins.

If yes then will it be only during price correction phases, Which ones and why those ones?  4) At which frequency will you report? Will you disclose publicly the whole portfolio composition? Something similar to a monthly factsheet?  5) Some important decisions like location and accounting method are still under consideration, when do you plan to communicate on this? Will it be before the end of the ICO?
