Here are three prime examples to showcase different industries that will be affected by these massive changes.  Producers TraXion will power producers’ financial systems, solving their woes in terms of finance — in payroll, employee benefits, and transfer of value from one department to another, value chain, and supply chain — logistics from production to merchant. This is a valuable proposition to producers as they can now solve many various issues within their specific financial systems. For example, a farmer could use TraXion’s systems to help better track the amount of funding he receives from his crops that he sells. Not only would he be provided a unique wallet solution, he would be able to acquire a number of services with his funds as well.

Similar to TraXion, Coins.ph primarily delivers financial services over mobile to more than 300 million unbanked people in Southeast Asia, enabling them to make cash deposits and withdrawals at more than 10 thousand participating retail locations. Other services include bill payments, mobile top-ups and remittances. It also grants access to online shopping at over 100 thousand retailers that accept digital currency.  Now, whenever someone uses their Coins.ph app to donate money to a charitable cause, the user can go to Bills Payment and look for the Donate section. This section houses GavaGives’ reputable NGO partners that anyone can support.  GavaGives has over 120 NGO partners, and has helped raise over $1 million USD for various causes in just the past year alone. All donors on GavaGives are automatically given a “reputation score” via blockchain smart contracts, with the highest-performing ones gaining prominence on the site. Through GavaGive’s data-sharing deal with Coins.ph, making charitable donations will now be just as easy as it is with the TraXion wallet.  But the real value is not just ease of use. It’s trust. Because the NGOs are all ranked on a blockchain database, there is finally true transparency in charitable donations. This means that money can be donated with the full knowledge of where it is going and how it is being used. This is huge. Traditionally, charities have been far too open to fraud abuse, with almost half of all fraud cases going unreported for fear of losing future donations.  “Charity fraud is not only about NGOs losing donations. It has massive knock-on effects in terms of creating public distrust toward charities, resulting in greatly reduced donations overall. Meaning the needy lose out on assistance that would otherwise come to them if corruption did not exist. We aim to end that,” said TraXion CEO Ann Cuisa.  Our team at TraXion envisions a future free from charity fraud. And we’re giving a big shout out to Coins.ph for also embracing this goal.  https://medium.com/traxion-tech/traxion-crowdfunding-service-gavagives-signs-partnership-with-coins-ph-ee80b958a2e0",False

This partnership will see us playing a long-term and pivotal role not only in bringing LG’s business onto the blockchain but also in leading the region’s blockchain development.  LG CNS, as the information technology subsidiary of LG Group, has been leading the company into the blockchain space. Last year, they partnered with finance sector blockchain consortium R3 and became a member of the Open Blockchain Industry Association (OBCIA) in April 2018. A month later, LG launched its own blockchain service “Monachain” for the logistics industry, putting together a team of 50 people that they expect to double in the coming months.  Working with our deep expertise in Hyperledger will make it possible for LG to reap the benefits of blockchain technology without compromising on data security and privacy policies in place in its organization. While TraXion will be operating independently of Monachain, we are working with LG CNS to ensure that interoperability is foundational in all the projects we work on. This will be a challenge but we anticipate consolidation or interfacing with Monachain in the future.  This partnership deal is a key milestone in broader blockchain adoption globally. Businesses in the supply chain will be able to work more transparently and efficiently with the parties they contract with. In the long term, this will have the same inclusive and democratizing effect that the internet has brought to the business world — more opportunities for innovation, better services, and financial growth.",False

As we approach the start of our Pre-Sale on 05.01.18, we thought it would be good to share some tips with you on how to better secure your wallet:  *Never click on suspicious links or download apps from unknown developers. They can log your private keys and other information   from your device.  *Always be sure to back-up your wallet. Wallets usually with have an X-phrase mnemonic in case you lose your device. Write this   phrase down and store in a very secure place.  *If you are using a wallet software, always have a password for it.  *If you are using a browser for a cloud wallet such as MEW, always check to make sure you are at the correct URL address.  *Using a localized, hardware wallet such as a Trezor or a Ledger wallet can help you secure your wallet in “cold storage”. This will   help prevent your wallet from being hacked into as it will be in an offline setting.  *While on social media or forums, do not mention what cryptocurrency exchange or wallet you use.  *Do not ever share your private key for your wallet.  *If you have an online wallet, be wary of accessing your wallet on a public Wi-Fi connection as this poses a security risk.  Disclaimer: While these are some helpful tips for securing one’s wallet, there are still risks that exist and funds can be lost and or stolen. TraXion claims no responsibility for the possibility of these events occurring and this article is meant as advice. Each user should do their own research and take necessary steps for the security of their wallet.",False
