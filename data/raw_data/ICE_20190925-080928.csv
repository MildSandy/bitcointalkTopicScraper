Users of IceBreakerAR will have the confidence to approach each other and be equipped with conversational tools which can assist initiating the interaction in an innovative and fun manner, from whether the user is seeking a relationship, friendship or networking/business opportunity. In addition, all user data is secured in the blockchain thereby providing the highest standard of security and integrity.  The Problem  Dating, meeting and career networking websites and apps have not undergone a meaningful evolution since entering the market in the early 2000‚Äôs. The most recent progression is simply porting the website onto smart devices, but the mechanism has largely been passive. Users must create a profile, scroll through innumerable matches, strike a conversation and attempt to move the online connection to the real world. In addition, they suffer from the same core issues.   Solving the Problem  IceBreakerAR‚Äòs solution is comprised of four components working in unison to provide a fun, secure and seamless user experience via:  IOS/ANDROID APP | AUGMENTED REALITY | RETAIL PARTNERSHIPS | BLOCKCHAIN  iOS and Android Users have the option of a quick profile creation to get up and running as quickly as possible, or a more detailed profile setup for higher quality matches. Once at least one profile from either Dating, Friendship or Networking has been created, the user can begin to scan the vicinity for matches. The user can also seamlessly switch between categories to scan if they created a profile in multiple categories  Augmented Reality The application will provide an augmented reality experience for the user by enabling them to scan their surroundings for other IceBreakerAR users who meet or exceed their defined match threshold percentage. The match results are displayed in an augmented reality fashion where an avatar represents the matches, displays the match percentage and top likes/dislikes. This avatar can be customized with a selection of free or purchased accessories.  Retail Partners To further the value added experience for users, IceBreakerAR will form retail partnerships to provide benefits to the User. Users benefit from discounts, retailers benefit from increased sales, IceBreakerAR benefits from happy Users and Partners, it is a win-win-win paradigm. ‚Ä¢ Retailers who provide a modest discount for IceBreakerAR Users will show up on scans ‚Ä¢ IceBreakerAR provides retailers a zero risk model that will attract net new sales ‚Ä¢ Only after an agreed to level of sales to IceBreakerAR users will the retailer pay a portion of the sale to IcebreakerAR  Blockchain usage 1. Security Traditional servers or data are generally centralized, making it a likely target for malicious attacks. By looking at the Equifax‚Äôs security breaches and other cybersecurity concerns arising in recent times. Instead of having a single or limited # of server‚Äôs that hackers can attack, decentralization via the blockchain greatly increases the difficulty. The more participants/nodes in a network, the more copies of the data there is. Therefore, if you want to tamper with the data, you will need to attack every single node on the network and alter all of their data simultaneously. Not only does blockchain make data tamper-proof, it is also hard to breach. Every ‚Äúblock‚Äù on a chain contains a certain amount of data, and when that block gets filled, much like a USB drive, it is encrypted and sealed forever. To get the full picture, hackers will need to hack not just the current block, but also every block before it. This is not only technically almost impossible, but it is costly, thereby reducing the incentive for malicious activities.  2. Redundancy/Disaster Recovery Essentially we would have the same set of data distributed across the world, we wouldn‚Äôt need to worry if we lose a node. This provides data resilience to IceBreakerAR, which gives peace of mind from any data corruption, server downtimes, backups, etc..  3. Overhead/cost reduction Having a decentralized network of nodes to maintain this ledger allows IceBreakerAR to offset and offload hosting, security, and maintenance costs. It removes a lot of the costs of IT staffing, Dev Ops, and infrastructural overhead.  4. Accountability With all of the above in place, you can be sure that everything that is logged or deployed on the blockchain, is accurate, and true. All of this results in the ease of trust, and ease of the ability to do business in a transparent manner, without needing to trust the counter-party. You can simply leverage blockchain technology to let the data and facts speak for themselves. Do currently systems and data infrastructures work? Sure, but they are not perfect. They only exist the way they do because there hasn‚Äôt been technology that could come along and offer a vast improvement until the introduction of Blockchain.  5. Permissioned Blockchains To only authorize a limited set of readers and writers, so-called permissioned blockchains have been recently proposed. Here, a central entity decides and attributes the right to individual peers to participate in the write or read operations of the blockchain. To provide encapsulation and privacy, reader and writer could also run in separated parallel blockchains that are interconnected.  6. GDPR Compliance With our blockchain partner we will be able to encrypt our storage with 256-bit AES encryption as well as have the ability to remove data upon request from an individual user permanently  WEBSITE | FACEBOOK | TWITTER | TELEGRAM | MEDIUM | INSTAGRAM | YOUTUBE | LINKEDIN | REDDIT | WHITEPAPER | BOUNTY PROGRAM  Token Metrics  Token Symbol: IBAR Total Token Supply: 300,000,000 Token Available for Sale: 201,600,000 Token Price @Token Sale: $0.09 USD Min Fund raise (Soft Cap) $3.0MM Max Fund raise (Hard Cap) $17.9MM Token Policy: Unsold tokens to be burnt Currency Accepted: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, FIAT Currency  Token Offering   ROUND 1: PRIVATE INVESTOR SALE Target Supply: 4%, USD $495,000 Marketing Restrictions: Sophisticated/Accredited Investor Start & End Date: 14 May 2018 ‚Äì 31 July 2018 Lockup: None    ROUND 2: PUBLIC PRELIMINARY TOKEN SALE  Target Supply 16%, USD $3,487,000 Marketing Restrictions: None, appropriate geographic restrictions may apply Start & End Date 01 August 2018 ‚Äì 14 August 2018 Incentive Structure: 20% Bonus from Token Sale Price (USD $0.09 + 20%) Lockup: None   ROUND 3: MAIN TOKEN SALE Target Supply: 52%, USD $13,950,000 Marketing Restrictions: None, appropriate geographic restrictions may apply Start & End Date 15 August 2018 ‚Äì 05 September 2018 Incentive Structure: None, Token Sale Price (USD $0.09) Lockup: None   Blockchain usage and token holder value diagram:    WEBSITE | FACEBOOK | TWITTER | TELEGRAM | MEDIUM | INSTAGRAM | YOUTUBE | LINKEDIN | REDDIT | WHITEPAPER | BOUNTY PROGRAM     Team Members Thien To ‚Äì Founder & CEO | linkedin.com/in/thiento | Michael de Blok ‚Äì Founder & COO | linkedin.com/in/michaeldeblok | @mjdeblok Kaitie Zhee ‚Äì Marketing & User Acquisition Director | linkedin.com/in/kaitiezhee | @kaitieZhee Connor McKitrick ‚Äì Business Development Director | linkedin.com/in/connor-mckitrick | @StarmanCrypto Ben O'Grady ‚Äì Development and Marketing | linkedin.com/in/ben-o-grady-826079152 | @benogrady11 Zaheer Merali ‚Äì Strategic Advisor | linkedin.com/in/zaheermerali | @Zaheer_Merali Kristin Lewis ‚Äì Growth Hacker | linkedin.com/in/kristinlewis | @digilou     Dev Team Members  Theodosis Mourouzis, PhD ‚Äì Cryptographer | linkedin.com/in/theodosis-mourouzis-phd-58556a15 | @mourouziscy Taylan Pince ‚Äì Lead Developer | linkedin.com/in/taylan | @taylanpince Serkan Terek - UX | linkedin.com/in/serkan-terek-0b42a01a | @SerkanTerek Kaan Eryilmaz ‚Äì Senior UI Designer | linkedin.com/in/kaaneryilmaz | @keryilmaz Hakan Demiroz ‚Äì Senior IOS/AR Developer | linkedin.com/in/hakan-demir√∂z-15491a95 | @demiroz_hakan Georgy Gadzhiev ‚Äì Blockchain Engineer | linkedin.com/in/ggadzh | @Gershi15 Adil Haritah ‚Äì Blockchain Engineer | linkedin.com/in/adilha | @adilh_dev   WEBSITE | FACEBOOK | TWITTER | TELEGRAM | MEDIUM | INSTAGRAM | YOUTUBE | LINKEDIN | REDDIT | WHITEPAPER | BOUNTY PROGRAM",False
