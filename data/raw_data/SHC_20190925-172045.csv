But now I see that SHC token will be used as Escrow between a freelancer and person who will hire him. This idea is not bad, because there isn't many trusted escrow services and you definitely need some kind of escrow in this business. For example in a situation when freelancer finishes his job and then the buyer doesn't want to pay him because he is not satisfied with the product. In this case, an escrow will decide about the payment.  What I don't like is that your team is anonymous. Please provide full names and LinkedIn profiles or Facebook/Twitter.",False

Price of SHC token is 1 ETH / 3000 = 0.000333 ETH So you estimate your project to be worth 60 000 000 x 0.000333 ETH = 20 000 ETH At current price 880 USD this means 20 000 x 880 USD = 17 600 000 USD  $17 million is too much for a freelancing platform.,False
