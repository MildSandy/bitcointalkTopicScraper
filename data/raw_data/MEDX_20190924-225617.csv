Unlike private equity deals, token holders have little control over use of ICO funds and early platform direction. Now, with the release of Augur‚Äôs prediction market, there may be a way for companies to provide potential token holders with some assurances.  Team experience, white paper, development progress and company milestones are a few important metrics used when considering participation in an ICO. Team experience and white papers can be assessed prior to buying tokens. Development progress and company milestones, however, tend to be harder to measure as the majority of work tends to occur after the ICO. Token holders often have little choice but to trust the timelines put forth by companies.  Months after the ICO craze, token holders are realizing that they were duped by project ‚Äúroadmaps‚Äù as companies now proceed to announce delay after delay in development milestones.  The problem is that companies with upcoming ICOs often have ulterior motives. ICOs with imminent roadmap milestones are more appealing to token buyers than ICOs with more realistic and distant goals. Companies know this, and dangle these milestones just down the road from token distribution.  Even those companies with purer intentions, but less versed in the development of decentralized protocols, are now discovering that their ambitious road maps are not feasible. This is further compounded by the challenges faced in blockchain development. Decentralized apps require carefully laid out incentive structures and often lack the developer tools readily available in traditional development.  The issue of accountability is not new. There are a number of projects attempting to provide greater transparency. Messari is a startup that aims to provide the public with an open data library for cryptoassets. As another solution, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin recently proposed a fund raising mechanism called a DAICO, which funds teams based on the achievement of project landmarks. To date though, there is not a robust solution that is ready for implementation.  Until better accountability measures exist, potential token buyers may be reluctant to purchase utility or protocol tokens instead of equity. Augur‚Äôs prediction market may provide a solution that, in part, remedies this.  For the first time, it is possible for ICO companies to assure their commitment to project timelines by putting money where their mouths are in prediction markets on Augur. While one can never perfectly predict development hurdles, there are basic project milestones that teams should be able to confidently deliver.  MedCredits aims to be the first to do this by creating a market on Augur that signals the release of its Hippocrates medical app on Ethereum mainnet by October 15th, 2018. The MedCredits founders intend to place a 25 ETH bid (10,750 USD) that Hippocrates will be released according to this schedule.  The Hippocrates dApp is the first decentralized medical app to be deployed within the MedCredits Health System and must meet the following 5 objective criteria by October 15th, 2018:  - Hippocrates contracts deployed on Ethereum Mainnet - Smart contracts guide the patient and physician encounter - Patient medical records are encrypted and stored on IPFS - ETH is a payment option within the Hippocrates dApp   Doctors are available to diagnose and provide medical recommendations to patients  If the above criteria are met by the above date, then MedCredits will have successfully launched the Hippocrates dApp. Reporters on Augur should use the above criteria to verify this outcome.  Currently the Hippocrates dApp is in public beta testing. If you would like to try the dApp, it can be found at https://hippocrates.medcredits.io. Currently, payment is in test MEDX tokens which you can request in our telegram channel.  At MedCredits we believe in launching real decentralized applications. Most of our core team has personally invested in cryptocurrency for over 5 years now. For the past 18 months, we have been busy building the first truly decentralized healthcare system‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMedCredits. Going forward, we want to give our community assurances that our timeline goals will be met. We aim to create additional markets under the category MedCredits on Augur for a number of our future milestones as they approach.",False

Part of the reason why it's so exciting is because it works! Doctors and large institutions have taken a great interest in it because of the promise. A recent paper actually reviewed teledermatology and concluded it was a valid tool and a reliable consultation method:  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.14341/abstract  The MedCredits innovation is the use of telemedicine to build the foundation for a decentralized healthcare system.

MedCredits is a platform that connects patients and doctors for medical services. If you were sick at home or a relative was worried about a mole on their arm, you would use the MedCredits platform to be connected to a doctor.  Patientory is building a platform that will allow participating hospitals to share medical data. Their platform does not engage in healthcare services between doctors and patients. Bowhead Health is experimenting with a niche market of personalized vitamins and supplementation. Their platform does not engage in healthcare services between doctors and patients.  I hope that clarifies the difference between MedCredits and a lot of other projects out there. We are indeed the first platform to offer medical services and our team is led by licensed medical doctors. By offering real medical services, we generate healthcare data. The patient will then own this data. MedCredits lies closest to the actual data and is therefore best positioned to build out a truly patient-centric and interoperable EMR.

Investors want ROI.  Investors know that there are ten other telemedicine apps and companies out there that have real working apps with over 50 doctors in most specialties.  So in summary, MEDX tries to dodge the ""this is not a security"" by trading Medx tokens for medical services.  In return the one that bought MEDX tokens gets nothing except a chance to redeem MEDX tokens for medical visits on the app.  If you are healthy and don't need to see a doctor then this is a waste of your money.  Even if you are sick, and see a doctor on MEDX app and received a correct diagnosis, you still need to see a real life doctor for treatment anyway.  How do you remove a cancerous mole from the arm?  The app can't do that.  So in a way you have to pay money to use the app then pay money for a real doctor to get treatment.  This is a great idea but it could be better if you promise investors some ROI (that is how you get funded, instead you promise investors a diagnosis, which many investors don't really care).  However, if you promise investors ROI, then it is a security and you can get into trouble with the SEC.  So if you love to support a great project like donating blood, then do it.

From what I understand, some projects are hoping to become a 3rd party, connecting existing EMRs together (Patientory) or providing a service (Bowhead, MedCredits). There are also references to creating new EMRs, but I personally think that should be a secondary/tertiary goal as, as referenced in this thread, there are hundreds of EMRs already in existence. The lesser known EMRs typically target smaller clinics/facilities as the market share of medium-large hospitals already belong to EMRs such as Epic, Allscripts, etc. Projects such as Patientory face a hurdle of larger EMRs already collaborating to create a Health Information Exchange so that patient information can flow freely between organizations and systems.  I feel this is a strong project because although Telemedicine (and preventative medicine) is the direction the United States (and perhaps other regions, as well) is heading, it is limited to demographics which presumably have established health care already as the initiatives with the most momentum are organizationally driven. This large gap (those who do not have health care) gave rise to services such as WebMD, and here in the Silicon Valley, start-ups pushing to create other tele health/Concierge Health services who are doing it without a blockchain.  What are the plans around staffing the tele-derm/tele-health service? In order to keep use of this service accessible, would that require artificially keeping the value of MEDX tokens down or will it scale based on the current market value? Example: If MEDX becomes valued at $10 and MEDX servivces are ~100 MEDX, what benefits are there for a patient to use the MedCredits service over traditional services? If a scaling system is used, how would you present that to patients in a way that is easily digestible? How do you plan to interoperate with the other established EMRs? Lastly, are there any plans in addressing health insurance and it's historically low/non-existent reimbursement for tele-health services?  I look forward to learning more about your work.",False

This is actually already being done by EMR providers and does not particularly require a blockchain. http://www-304.ibm.com/shop/americas/content/home/en_US/pdf/Epic_Interoperability_Fact_Sheet_10.pdf  MedCredits is a platform that connects patients and doctors for medical services. If you were sick at home or a relative was worried about a mole on their arm, you would use the MedCredits platform to be connected to a doctor.  Regarding EMRs: When a patient sees a doctor, the doctor documents the encounter and potentially prescribes some medication or orders additional testing (blood work, MRI, referral to a specialist). This generates data. The critical point is that healthcare data is generated when doctors evaluate patients. EMRs simply store this data. The MedCredits platform will generate patient data and allow the patient to own this data (private keys). As the MedCredits clinical services expand, so too will the volume of patient data. MedCredits will therefore become both an EMR and a platform for medical services.  I hope that clarifies the difference between MedCredits and a lot of other projects out there. We are indeed the first platform to offer medical services and our team is led by licensed medical doctors.",False
