Momentum also features an automated marketing and communication engine, allowing brands to determine the rules for rewarding their customers, suppliers or charitable beneficiaries with digital coins backed by real value. The rules can be set quickly and changed rapidly as the system learns and can be related to purchases, loyalty, attention, insights, customer activity such as coming to a physical shop, attending an event or writing a review or for becoming socially involved or helping others. Customers can enjoy the digital currency with the brands they love, or they can save it, gift it or exchange it into other digital currencies. Since Momentum allows companies to generously reward brand loyalists for becoming involved, creating content, becoming active influencers ‚Äì it will become a source of income for people around the world, creating jobs and bettering the lives of many. Momentum allows brands to efficiently reach people they never would be able to reach before and turn them into loyal customers who get involved, drive brand value, boost business and help improve products.",False

The first is the most important which is project preparation and outreach. I see Momentum is doing very well in this. Enjoying all the content and updates, so we really want to build strength. The Telegram is useful for updates also, well done there. Second aspect is the market, it is poor as we can all see, and wise to wait for it to recover so people are more confident about investing.

It is rare that anyone, investor or not, will visit a website or publication where it is not referenced in one way or another. When most people that are unfamiliar with the system think of blockchain, they think of it in terms of finance and currency. What many don‚Äôt realize, though, is that blockchain technology is positioning itself to cross over into a wide range of industries. One of the industries with the most promise and potential is the marketing and consumer relations sector. Just as blockchain technology has changed how people transact currencies in a mutually beneficial way, the same can be done in how loyalty is transacted between companies and consumers. Improved relationships increases both monetary and advocacy benefits for companies when done in a way that also provides value and ownership to the customer.",False

Sale 26.04,"   Dear Momentum community,  Since we started building our community around the Momentum a few weeks ago from nothing, we have made some great progress; we have over 3000 supporters across our Telegram channels (incl China), 1100+ Followers on Twitter and lots of other activity, both online and offline. We are listed on the main listing sites, the reviews and feedback is overwhelmingly positive and our friends and family sale will beat our expectations! However, we want this to be a success for everyone and we believe we are not yet performing at top capacity; Chinese New Year meant we had a delay in our Asian activities and our PR and Marketing haven‚Äôt kicked off properly due to the high demand in the market for the best resources. In brief; it just took us a bit longer to get going!  With that in mind we have decided to delay our public sales by 1 month. What does this mean?  - We will run our friends and family private sales until 23/03, as planned. Early supporters can still join with a min purchase of ‚Ç¨10k and as a gesture to these early supporters, we offer an additional 5% bonus tokens for those that want to buy Momentum tokens before the 23rd! - An extended private sale period will start on 24/03 with revised terms; the minimum purchase will increase to ‚Ç¨50k to allow for a select number of larger token buyers to take part before the public sale. To protect the community and ensure wide distribution of the token after the public sales, we will impose a limit to the private sale and allow a minimum of around ‚Ç¨10M of tokens to be available during the public sale (final no. to be determined).  To ensure people don‚Äôt miss out during the public sale, we will open up our whitelist around the same time.  Over the coming weeks you will notice an increased activity around the Momentum as our marketing efforts really kick in. We will be attending events globally, more and more press will appear and no doubt our social communities will continue to grow. Thank you for your support of the Momentum project, so far, we are looking forward to the exciting weeks ahead of us!",False

Sale 26.04,"   Hi there. The project will be adopted all over the world through partners implimenting the technology for their customers. We expect (retail) partners to create their own token (e.g. Best Burger Token). This token's value will be pegged against the local fiat currency, e.g. 1 token is ‚Ç¨0.01. When a user wants to change their Best Burger Token in bitcoin for example, a conversion rate between BBT and Momentum will be established (most likely the current market rate -/- a margin) and the exchange takes place. This allows the retailers who launch their own coin full control of their eco system. As most of them work in Fiat and none of them want to be exposed to the volatility of a fast moving market.
