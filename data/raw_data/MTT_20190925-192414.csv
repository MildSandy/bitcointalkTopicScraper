The New Content Economy Online News publishers made the historic mistake of not convincing consumers early-on that quality content deserves a fair remuneration. Pumped provides the opportunity to not only correct this mistake but to change the way we consume news.  The Pumped App uses machine learning to connect publishers and readers to create a new content economy in which both are seamlessly rewarded for their publication and consumption. Publishers earn 100% ad revenue while readers are paid for reading, curating and engaging with news from the Pumped App. This new content economy is powered by the MulTra Token (MTT), which serves as the fuel of the Pumped ecosystem.  The Future of Digital News Pumped is a for-profit business and is in the business of profiting others. It promotes high-quality news sources and silences sensationalism and agenda-driven fake news. It is not just free for everyone to use, it pays everyone for using it.  Publishers are seamlessly signed up through their RSS feeds which are beautifully displayed in the Pumped App for readers to consume news. It utilizes machine learning to understand consumer preferences, so consumers can consume and engage with their preferred content types. Readers are rewarded with MTT for reading, curating, sharing and engaging with the news content.  Earned MTT can be used to pay for premium subscription-based services provided by news publishers, traded on crypto exchanges for their market value or used for different services on the Pumped Partners platform. This way, readers make money with their own attention, instead of others making money off them.  Join Pumped - the new content economy! Shape the future of news by joining the Pumped Initial Token Offering and purchasing your tokens at a highly discounted rate before the MTT are listed on the crypto exchanges in 2018.

You are welcome to contact me directly if you have further remaining questions. This whitepaper includes all information: https://www.multra-gmbh.com/files/Pumped-Whitepaper.pdf  TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION…   1. Higher hard costs for physical assets Pumped is not only a content sharing platform but it introduces a new content economy with five pillars that are outlined on page 16 of the Pumped whitepaper. Having a close look on these pillars will show that Pumped is not only a virtual platform but also has real life aspects. The five pillars require higher budget than just software development and marketing.  For example:  •   According section 5.1 on page 32 of the Pumped whitepaper, a physical Pumped Residence will be set up. This involves costs for property and a building (hard assets).  •   Under section 8.7 on page 46 of the Pumped whitepaper, ICO investors have all time access and even free accommodation and hospitality based on the exchange amount they invest during ICO (physical service and operations).   2. Higher hard costs for talented people and quality services Talented people that create measurable impact have higher salaries. Highly qualified people with expertise, passion, spirit and discipline are required to succeed with the Pumped mission and to ensure power, prosperity and pleasure in the service of consumers, publishers and investors.  For example:  •   We focus on clean business operations especially in legal terms. For that reason, we comply with upcoming regulations beforehand to secure the investment of our ICO investors in compliance with requirements of regulators: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iT_byeL1qMU&index=2&list=PL0Eq8CIcJZgIgAb5CrHphp_2FuWkUKb01  •   The DApp development will be aligned with the vision of Vitalik Buterin and the mission of Ethereum: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tzNpHSKfQA&list=PL0Eq8CIcJZgIgAb5CrHphp_2FuWkUKb01&index=3    •   We will need to recruit and retain local teams in various parts of the world to implement and ensure accurately that the exercise bears fruit for publishers and consumers of quality news content. This will be a sophisticated process which requires us to take highly qualified and committed talent on board.   3. Higher infrastructure costs to build a product that disrupts the status quo Pumped is intended for a global roll-out winning the same relevance for news media as Instagram for photography.  For that reason:  •   Since 2014, MulTra GmbH is a limited liability company incorporated in Frankfurt am Main which benefits from German infrastructures and consistently pays taxes to help maintain these infrastructures. Rather than setting up an offshore vehicle to avoid taxes, we have decided to accept the burden of Federal corporate and local commercial tax. Despite high tax rates, we trust that buyers of MTT will appreciate this commitment to the city that allows us to operate under excellent and constantly improving conditions.  •   The Pumped Economy is capable of rebalancing revenue streams in a very substantial global industry. Despite the structural simplicity of the Pumped system, its implementation as an addition to the highly sophisticated and engrained global news market system will be a major operation.  •   The system will need to be adjusted to different technical and cultural environments in various parts of the world (EMEA, North America, Latin America, China, Japan, Subcontinent etc.). We anticipate that this will trigger the need for adjustments of the Pumped Technology.  The tax burden is mitigated by the fact that the quality which we managed to achieve for the ERC20 compliant code allowed us to proceed without the burden of a pre-sale. This has saved a considerable expenditure and it has relieved buyers of the risk that the token may be insufficient.  The quality focus on the product is confirmed by independent rating on ICOBench: https://icobench.com/ico-analyzer?ico=pumped   4. Page 49 of the Pumped whitepaper shows the budget allocation for the 200k ETH.  20% - Economy Development 20% - Residence Opening 10% - DApp Development 10% - Rewards Onboarding 2% - Rewards Platform 2% - Publisher Onboarding 4% - DApp Marketing 10% - Contractors 13% - Legal and Administration 9% - Contingency  Many thanks, Onik Mia [MulTra GmbH]",False

I've some questions to the ITO:  1. Why do you think, you will be able to raise 200k ETH (approx 186mil USD now)? Why do you need so much for an DApp, where other like ENVION raised approx 150m USD and they have to buy a lot of hardware? Ok, 20% of the raised money is for a residence. That are 37m USD, if you reach the hardcap. Should this be a goal rather than concentrating on the app? And you can't claim, that you need millions to pay for taxes or staff. There are only 2 ICO/ITO in history, who raised more than your fundraising goal. I think it will be hard to raise this amount of money and this hardcap maybe could deter bigger investors to take part in this ITO. 2. How does the company make revenue with this project,  if the platform is fully launched? Maybe you can help me to make it clear. 2. Will there be more marketing efforts? Your Twitter Account has only 31 followers including me ;-) 4. When does the ITO ends? There is no end-date on website.  Thank you in advance.",False
