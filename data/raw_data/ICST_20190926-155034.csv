I'll do my best at answering it with one of many projects in the works.  ICST owns the StarMaker App, which has a user-base of 50 million already. The Starmaker App will adopt the ICST Token instead of using their previous payment methods that their user-base used to interact and engage with content.  Since their is a limited amount of coins that are released, simple supply and demand will come into effect. Creators will create ""smart contracts"" with fans and consumers of their content. ICST is creating a token-based economy where value is derived from an artist’s work. When an artist tokenizes, they’re turning their intellectual property (IP) into a financial asset, so an artist’s token reflects the value of their creative output. The more people who consume the artist’s creation, the higher the value of the token.  I hope this helps. Let's discuss further if not.",False
