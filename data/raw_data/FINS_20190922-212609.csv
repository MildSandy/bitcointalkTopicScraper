Did you read questions about ICO and the way Funshi people answer them? Did you even read the ""whitepaper""? Whitepaper - suppose to be a technical documentation of the project, whitepaper of funshi is talking about ICO distribution, how the market is growing, with screenshots  of Coinmarketcap.com (Do you even understand how it is calculated and how it is being manipulated? Take a research if you don't, that should be fun). really? They don't even pulled bulk data by their own, there is NO research of the current market situations, literally nothing. Indeed they are talking about distribution of their ICO and  facebook bounty compaings (IN THE WHITEPAPER CARL!). Just take a look at Bitcoin, Etherium and every other legit project's whitepaper.  I do not attack any person, Im trying to figure out what the project is about. Never touched any private or personal information about the founders of the Finshi.  They are talking that they fit all legal conditions for the US citizens and give a link to the SEC regulations. (can be found here - https://www.sec.gov/investor/alerts/ib_hedgefunds.pdf and here - https://www.investor.gov/system/files/news/documents/english/ib_accreditedinvestors.pdf), and if you will take a closer look: Quote The hedge fund’s offering documents and agreements contain important information about investing in the fund, including the investment strategies of the fund, whether the fund is based in the United States or abroad, the risks of the investment, fees earned by the hedge fund manager, expenses charged to the hedge fund and the hedge fund manager’s potential conflicts of interest.  Does the Finshi capital have ANY of that in their whitepaper or website, forum information ? Answer - yes, but ONLY 1 thing: Quote Risks  There is no guarantee that the invested funds will be safe or will lead to profits.  All of your investments might be lost!  The investments are not insured and there are no private or government insurance representative that the investors can address.  There is no guarantee of the token’s liquidity in the future. There is a risk that the tokens won’t be in demand.  There is a risk of all the fund’s assets theft by fraudsters or hackers.  There is a risk of appearance of regulatory or legal restrictions, which can complicate the fund’s work or stop it altogether.  There is a risk of a fail investment, which the fund might proclaim unprofitable and write off as a loss.  There are technical risks (e.g. connected to Ethereum) that might cause the fund to be unable to make a transaction of the profits.  There is a risk of cryptocurrency, fiat currency or investment devaluation.  There is a corporate risk of losing control over shares of the portfolio startup. All legal conditions and agreements, including those for the US citizens can be found here. All investors must read carefully and accept these conditions and all the risks!  No Investment strategies, nothing about fees earned by the hedge fund manager, nothing about expenses charged to the hedge fund and nothing about the hedge fund manager’s potential conflicts of interest.  Or this is investment strategy? Quote The Fund's investment strategy Around 60% of the raised funds will be spent on short-term investments in carefully selected projects that are planning to launch their own ICOs. Up to 30% will go to long-term investments and no more than 10% will be left for classic venture investments. Such portfolio allocation assures balance between the risks of short-term and long-term investments. The strategy might be changed by the management whenever there is a need to do so.  And thats it. This IS NOT the strategy. If you dont know how the legit strategy looks like, ask google.  One more: Quote Why FinShi Capital FinShi Capital is the first blockchain venture fund formed entirely of cryptocurrency. There are some venture funds on the market who invest in Blockchain startups, but they use classic venture scheme and do not allow partners invest small sums of money. Thanks to the smart contracts technology, we can invite unlimited number of unprofessional investors to invest together with us. So firstly, you should choose us because we make it possible for you to become an investor of a professional venture fund with the minimal investment of just $1.  And by the SEC regulations you HAVE to be an accredited investor. Quote An accredited investor, in the context of a natural person, includes anyone who:  - earned income that exceeded $200,000 (or $300,000 together with a spouse) in each of the prior two years, and reasonably expects the same for the current year, OR - has a net worth over $1 million, either alone or together with a spouse (excluding the value of the person’s primary residence).  So they are talking shit telling you they fit the SEC regulations. They don't.  17 mil raised, lol.  That is exactly the way scammers are working on. If you don't see it, thats not my problems, Im just trying to help kids not to get rekt. Unfortunately, you ignored me, so you won't see this message.",False

How was it founded? It’s the third fund founded by Capinvest 21, this time together with a group of private investors Asia LP.  Our team  Andrey Orlov Managing Partner Andrey has been working with investments since 2008. He founded and developed several startups. In 2015 he became the Managing Partner of Capinvest 21’s main fund. He’s also a representative of Blockchain Association.  Vyacheslav Sorokin FinShi Capital’s Partner Vyacheslav is an entrepreneur with 16 years of experience and 3 own startups. He is an official partner of IIDF in Tyumen Region. He is mainly responsible for strategic management of the portfolio companies.    Ayami Tanaka Lead Manager Ayami has experience in organizing various events, meetings and conferences. She is a professional translator fluent in several languages, so she works closely with international projects and partners.  Our fund The fund will select startups which have projects based on blockchain or finance technology. The main advantages for our investors are: - careful and proficient selection of projects; - guidance on management and development that the fund’s team provide all of its portfolio projects with; - payments of dividends to all of the token owners after each exit. Investor’s won’t have to waste their time digging into each project’s history by themselves. They won’t have to feel perplexed by the controversial opinions posted on communities and forums.  Our fund’s structure is built on a principal that our team gets profits only together with our investors (!). That’s why everyone in FinShi Capital tries to do his best to insure good earnings. Moreover, once our investors get their tokens, they will be able to sell them on most of the popular exchange markets.  Main advantages for token owners: - dividends: 80% of the fund’s profits will go to the token holders approximately every month (starting from the 4th quarter of 2017); - increase of the token’s cost: its cost will depend on real startups, it will grow after each startup’s share purchase (the fund’s portfolio will be getting bigger) and after each startup’s share sale (the fund gets net profit, providing that the share’s cost has grown significantly, which we are positive will happen to each of the selected projects).  FinShi Capital will be buying shares in real startups. It means that owning the fund’s tokens is the same as owning shares in these startups. Every investor will be a shareholder of all of the companies FinShi Capital invested in. Rest assured, with the professional help from our fund’s team, each and every one of the portfolio companies will achieve great success.  The fund’s goal The fund will invest in 15 to 30 different projects on seed and A rounds. FinSHi Capital is currently monitoring around 30 interesting non-public startups, some of which might eventually get funding. We expect our fund to have 520% annual income.

Our previous funds had considerable profits, this one is no exception. In two years period we will select 15 to 30 blockchain and fintech startups, then we will invest in them, help them to grow and develop their product. After the startup is developed, we will sell it with profits. A private investor can't control the growth and development of a company, can't be a part of board of directors, etc. We can. Private investor just gives his money and monitors the project, without any opportunity to interfere. Our fund, on the contrary, helps startups to develop as fast as possible.

One of the main things that differ a private investor's approach from the fund's is the fact that the first one can try to understand a project's code, study out cryptography etc; while the fund would investigate the team, study the market's history and analyse financial model. A project might have an excellent cryptography, but lack the right means of presentation to the audience and simply fail. Moreover most of the startups don't even have MVP, so there's nothing even to study. The times when we need to figure out all of project's technical sides, we hire outsource specialists.

You can contact our portfolio companies and ask them yourself: what is it that the fund does to help, apart from giving money. Shouldn't be a problem for you, you speak both Russian and English.

You didn't answer why the hell you need a token to make your venture fond functional. Just do your job like you did before and make your 120% annual (wait, at crypto you are expecting 520% annual return)  We know ourselves what we should and shouldn't do, thank you. There are projects which we couldn't fund from classic venture funds due to the legal restrictions. So using tokens is kind of the main idea, it's a whole different area. People who use cryptocurrency invest in the fund, then get dividends or just sell tokens with profits.   With 1mm how much you will raise in 5 years?  3.8 billions? lol.  In five years maybe even more. But our fund is planned to work for 2 years, during which, yes, we expect to have 520% annual income. With $1 million the fund's partner is expected to have $8 091 429 (without taking into account changing cryptocurrency rates).   The community will be appreciated if you will provide some expert explanation and roadmap of your job. Only thing what your are doing - is promising. We promise this, we promise that, no proofs, newbie accounts, no experience in crypto, super-puper investors.   Are you the official representative of the community? How does that work? One person - is not the whole community. It's your humble opinions and interest. As for our roadmap, you can find it on our website, it's clear and simple: 1. Projects selection. 2. Due Diligence of the selected projects. 3. Investment deals. 4. Guidance and development of the projects. 5. The fund sells its shares in projects to strategic partners, venture funds of the next rounds, or through exits to markets.  What proof do you need?  If you have any other concrete questions, happy to answer them.",False
