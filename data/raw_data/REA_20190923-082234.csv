For the full launch of REALISTO we need to be in full compliance with the regulatory environment in Germany. This will require more time than we have initially anticipated. Unfortunately this has impact on the launch of the final Realisto Platform, this does not stop us from emitting REA backed projects with great ROI for you. We are aiming to deliver a proof of concept property soon.  The crypto business is subsumed into the existing framework of rules. Because these rules were not made with something like cryptocurrencies and token in mind, they are sometimes an ill fit, and are prone to produce surprising conclusions. Our legal team has now found out, that REALISTO will need to apply for a certain type of license from the German regulatory body BaFin, called a “payment provider license” to conduct business according to the business model we are proposing. To give you the precise lay-of-the-land, we need to become a little bit technical to explain fully the intricacies of the problem in hand.  Crypto markets are fraught with enormous volatility, with cryptocurrencies hitting new highs followed by deep dips, then recover, then hitting another low. This happens within minutes, hours. As project emitters (those who use the platform to capitalize their projects) can´t afford to bear the risk of falling currency prices, and since REALISTO’s business model forbids to take on this risk entirely onto itself (nobody would make any money), the model for cryptocurrency payment could look like this: When a user wants to invest into a project on the platform, the REALISTO platform receive cryptocurrency from him.  At the moment when the Investors digitally signs the investment contract. We then convert the crypto funds into fiat money. These investments are then conveyed by us to the token emitters,so that the emitters may real-world capitalize their projects.  This is the only solution to fixing a price at the time of the investment which forms the basis of all subsequent dealings. Another problem consists in the fact that in Europe there exists by law the right to withdrawal from investment contracts if the investors is a private entity. It follows, the only possible way of conducting such a deal is an “on the spot” exchange of the cryptocurrency funds involved. This, however, entails the right of the investor to withdraw from the contract and be refunded in fiat money at the market-value currency price, fixed at the time the exchange has been made originally. A setup like this requires the above mentioned payment processor licence.  Originally, before we were confronted with this, we were under the impression that these requirements might be dealt with by securing the services of a partner who is licensed in Europe. It turned out, that such firms would also have to be licensed in Germany and this new requirement is due to stricter financial regulation compared to the rest of Europe.  Another issue that is surfacing right now is that global regulation of cryptocurrencies and, especially the token economy, is imminent! Of course, you all also know, that the “Utility Token” trick is no longer working: namely, that type of token that pretended not to be a “security” in the sense of the law, because it claims not to bear the functionalities of a security. But of course, it does. At this time, all token that constitute shares in a venture, no matter what their other functionalities might or might not be, are for all intents and purpose now deemed “Security Token”. For this reason, crypto exchanges around the world could come under intense pressure for offering trading of those disguised securities.  Since there is currently no crypto-exchange licensed to trade security token we will have to find a partner with that licence to list the tokens our emitters on the platform are looking to emit.",False

First of, and most important, we are steadily going forward with platform development, hitting no snags other than wishing we could be even faster. In order to create the greatest possible impact with the launch of our platform, we are busily at work to form partnerships that will add considerable drive to our efforts in becoming the first and only fully regulated blockchain investment hub.  Meet REALISTO   We are also on our way to show our faces in the blockchain industry, and to this end we aspire to attend the Blockshow Europe in May. Right before that we are at CrowdCon in Frankfurt in March and at BAFIN-Tech Berlin, which is one of the most important gatherings of the regulatory and law-making scene. There will be a host of other opportunities for us to fly the REALISTO flag, which we will announce upon confirmation. We are looking foward to meet as much members of our community in 2018.   Market down, markets up — well, that’s what markets do…   As to recent market developments, we can only say that from our standpoint it’s all good: we are a long-term business venture, not speculators, and the fact that, apparently, most of the “bad” money is getting out of crypto and that the doubters have left the playing field, it is clear sailing from here on in. For everybody who sees the blockchain and ICOs as feasible and above-board instruments for business this is indeed good news! As to pending regulation itself, recent signals from the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission allow a more positive outlook as to the impact of such regulation. But here at REALISTO we think, that offering honest business models will go a long way in convincing regulators and the public that the blockchain will create real-life value for all concerned.  https://medium.com/@Realisto/realisto-weekly-update-6-897135975aad",False

Among those 3.6 M Tokens, 2M is being hold for 2nd funding round (should happen around Q2 2018).  So in general you are right, the absolute value of existing REA tokens is smaller than the absolute value of existing Bitcoins.

While the world is staring at tanking crypto prices, we at REALISTO can only say that this latest development is of supreme indifference to us. We have said from the start that we have a sound and long-term business model which will provide safe haven from the vagaries of a volatile crypto market. But even more important: we have absolutely nothing to fear from impending regulation and legislation! The REALISTO platform will be completely in line with all existing and coming regulation. We are here to stay — and here to grow! More and more big investors, as well as large banks are sitting down with us and talk about the future of our (and yes, yours too!) enterprise.  Diversifying the REALISTO business model: asset management on the blockchain  In our efforts to develop a multi-use platform that goes beyond the real estate business, we have naturally explored all avenues in which our idea might be put to its most effective use. The REALISTO business model is more and more recognized as being truly disruptive for all kinds of asset management and securities emissions. Our new partners from a major Germany-based banking house have quickly picked up on the immensely cost-saving nature and potential transparency of our venture. Using the platform as a virtual digital asset management hub, we will be able to break the (costly!) dependency on clearing houses, custodian banks, securities exchanges and brokers. Our platform is the ideal place for quick, reliable and faultless crowd funding and crowd lending. Low cost and accessibility for any size investor or borrower will leave old-style asset management in the dust.  The best news is that dependency on the crypto market — and its volatility — is no longer a problem for us, because we at REALISTO will be able to emit our own “securities” that directly relate to existing currencies like Euro or Dollar.  Platform development is now clearly structured, and several partner companies have been assigned their tasks. A new, detailed timeline has been set up and the beta launch is timed for the end of Q1 in 2018.  The REALISTO platform is becoming a reality fast. And it is not just another app, but a serious business designed for long-term growth. A business that is sound, reliable and unafraid of any regulation that may come.  If that isn’t good news, we don’t know what is. More exciting news next week!  https://medium.com/@Realisto/realisto-weekly-update-5-a260708d3f43",False

Rest assured, we are in the process of securing listings with several exchanges.  Most of the larger exchanges charge listing fees of more than 20 BTC (or 200 to 500 K US $), just to get with them. Understandably, we’d rather be spending this kind of money on platform development. However, many of the well-run and stable exchanges that don’t charge an arm and a leg are so swamped with new applicants that they are seriously busy. As a result, theses exchanges have stopped taking on new token listings until sometime in February. Also, there are several exchanges which do not accept security tokens.  Despite all these of these obstructions, we are indeed confident to be able to secure one or more listing by the middle of February. As already mentioned above, we are in intense negotiations with several exchanges that have taken an interest in our unique business model and, consequently, in our token. We believe that patient negotiation will give our investors a lot more value than panic-splurging on overpriced listings.  Platform Development Update  We now have an ambitious but very much do-able project plan for platform development. We — and the tech people we work with — estimate that in 45 days (starting today) we should be able to roll out a functioning BETA. The beginning of February sees a comprehensive kick-off workshop to get things rolling in earnest. Naturally we’ll keep you posted as to how development is progressing.  Finances  Anyone invested (or even mildly interested) in crypto has been following the wild market antics of recent. Bitcoin’s remarkable dive has sent everyone scrambling, safe maybe for those who are in for the long haul anyway. But perception of crypto as a passing bubble is, in our estimation, extremely shortsighted: token offers based on economically feasible and forward-thinking business models will prevail. As to the drastic BTC value loss in recent weeks, this might to a large extent be due to the fact that “old economy” has struck back: stock-exchange listed BTC futures contracts were about to be settled for the first time when it became clear that players have been massively building short positions. We’ve all seen it before, only this time they did it with BTC.  As to REALISTO’s financial strategy: we have been selling off 100 ETH at 1,150 US $ to kick-start platform development. We will, by-and-by, sell more of the crypto when markets have calmed down — and only in quantities as immediately needed for platform development.  Cleaning House: Token Burning  As previously announced, we have burned excess tokens. You may check on process and protocol by clicking on the links below. Total token supply is now at 3,629,667.586 REA, with 1.629.667 in circulation.  https://medium.com/@Realisto/realisto-weekly-update-3-ec59bb0c568a",False

When we launched the ico most of the tokens/coins where less than half the price they are now (btc at 5000, eth at 300 and ltc at 50) so the early contributors „paid“ less than the current ones in a mathematical sense but we still understand the feeling of beeing an early backer.  First of all we spent 400,000 USD on marketing which came from our own initial investment. Since the ICO industry skyrocketed since June (where we initially planned the ICO) you can also imagine that the prices for advertisments skyrocketed. In fact the prices went up x10 since June which is crazy. So it is not a lack of marketing funds nor were the funds spent in the wrong place.  Please consider that the Bonus tokens now offered ( 50 % for 150,000 REA) come directly from the Teamtoken pool. Everyone (also the first day investors) will benefit if there are more funds raised.  We also consider the idea of stretching the ICO. The problem ist that we would need massive marketing.

These assets will generate steady returns for users who plan to hold their tokens and watch the intrinsic value grow. The second half of the capital will be used for an OPPORTUNITY POOL, where more active investors can vote for the acquisition of real estate projects of different risk-to-yield ratios. By allocating REA tokens to different investment opportunities investors can actively manage their own real estate portfolio.  ROI is directly paid out to REA token holders in ETH on a monthly basis, starting early 2018. REA token holders will also share 70% of the fees generated by the REALISTO platform.

REALISTO is a decentralized, global platform dedicated to crowdfunding the world’s best real estate opportunities. Using blockchain technology, the REALISTO platform operates as a two-sided marketplace allowing real estate experts to present unique projects, tokenize them, and offer them as curated investment opportunities.  The REALISTO Team will run the first two projects on the platform: With the first half of the capital raised in the ICO, REALISTO will set up a CORE POOL of expertly selected, high-quality residential and commercial real estate assets. These assets will generate steady returns for users who plan to hold their tokens and watch the intrinsic value grow. The second half of the capital will be used for an OPPORTUNITY POOL, where more active investors can vote for the acquisition of real estate projects of different risk-to-yield ratios. By allocating REA tokens to different investment opportunities investors can actively manage their own real estate portfolio.  ROI is directly paid out to REA token holders in ETH on a monthly basis, starting early 2018. REA token holders will also share 70% of the fees generated by the REALISTO platform.

There were comments from someone in another Telegram group saying that they didn't look into the company as soon as they saw there was no cap. That's what made me think it was worth considering.  If they can invest €20-30 million per year with their existing team, let's assume they could quickly triple that if necessary. That would be €60-90 million per year. 5 years worth of capital would be €300-400 million. Maybe round up to €500 million for even more of a buffer and say that's the cap.  There's no way they will be able to raise €500 million in an ICO. Again, nothing against the team, but the ICO market just isn't that deep yet.

I’m sure you’re all aware that the Ethereum Project and its cryptocurrency Ether (ETH) is a completely different beast from bitcoin (BTC). While the BTC price is approaching stratospheric regions, ETH is steadily climbing back to its previous all-time high. Now, people who want to get in our REALISTO pre-sale and the upcoming ICO might see this as a disadvantage, since it is becoming (a little) more expensive to get ETH. But in terms of your investment this is actually good news! Because it simply means that there will be more fiat money available per token after the conclusion of the REALISTO ICO — money that will then be used to buy assets, meaning: real estate. The individual token will thus be more valuable, because the real-world value it represents is larger. So, the fiat value you invested in buying ETH is not lost in obscure and volatile market movement, but is precisely mirrored by real assets in your REA token. Can’t say fairer than that. Just wanted to get that out there! No reason to fret a higher ETH price, because it buys you a higher stake in the real-world real estate values that the REA token represents. The REALISTO pre-sale is still up for another three days at a 30% discount for early investors. So, take your strong Ether and buy your way into a strong business model! The REALISTO way is real!

Further, a lot of ICOs offer only one potential for a return on your investment - if their tokens go up in value once they're listed on exchanges. Sure, they might skyrocket and ""go to the moon"", or, they might not. Many news streams are calling ICOs the next great thing. But frankly, I think it's quite unfair - you invest, yet you receive NO share of the company's profits! This leaves investors wide open to losing their money with nothing to show for it.  As a result of this, I'm very interested in any ICO that offers something more than just the value of the token.  Realisto is one of those rare ICOs that offers something ""real"" (backed by real world assets - property), as well as returns beyond the value of the tokens themselves. The big one for me is the monthly residual income generated from the underlying real estate investments made by the Realisto management team and from licensing income generated as the team resells/rents the platform to other real estate companies globally.  My only criticism is that the Realisto team are being a bit too cautious in their approach. They are starting with the German market that they know very well, and will slowly expand to international markets over time. My worry is that someone else might see the wonderful approach Realisto are taking, then copy that pattern and move a lot faster into the international markets. I'm also seeing a lot less ""buzz"" around the Realisto ICO than I'm seeing around some other ICOs. One ICO I've been tracking for example, launched just 10 hours ago, and has already sold 95% of their tokens and raised $US27M. When you go on these different ICOs' Telegram channels, they have 1,000s of users and lots of people talking and generating buzz and excitement. Realisto unfortunately doesn't have a Telegram channel where people can talk (only company announcements are sent out on the channel) - correct me if I'm wrong, but I can't find any other Telegram channel for Realisto. While this BTT forum is a place for people to talk about Realisto, it's very old school compared to a platform like Telegram. Realisto needs to be embracing Telegram and assigning a number of admins to always be online (24/7) to answer people's questions and generate buzz.  As a result, the pre-sale which is solid, is however still moving quite slowly compared to a lot of other ICOs.  I think Realisto needs to strike while they have the lead in this awesome area and start thinking a lot bigger, and immediately and rapidly expand their marketing efforts.  One other suggestion is to maybe add a special ""Founding member"" benefit, which gives only the pre-sale investors some super-special benefit around the international expansion. I'm thinking for example, early access to international opportunities when new real estate companies come onboard, and/or even better, maybe a small ongoing residual income to Founding members from every new real estate company that joins the platform (beyond just the licensing fees). To me, it's the international expansion that will make Realisto absolutely HUGE within a couple of years. Giving Founding members a small slice of that international expansion (again, going beyond the licensing fees), will make the tokens INCREDIBLY VALUABLE AND HIGHLY SOUGHT AFTER in the coming months.  In closing, the above comments aren't meant to be negative at all. I'm just expressing my observations and giving my suggestions for how to improve things.  If I didn't believe Realisto were onto something MAJOR and UNIQUE, I wouldn't have invested my money into the pre-sale (and, if some additional Founding member benefits can be added, I personally will be investing a lot more into the pre-sale!).  I look forward to any changes you might make, and feel free to reach out if I can help with anything (happy to send my CV privately to you).  Cheers.",False

Every other approach is actually deemed to fail, we have worked in Berlin real estate since 2011 and and took many years to understand the market and get a good feeling for it.

Real estate is a local affair! And you need local experts - REALISTO provides that but with a global scale.

I thought about asking the questions privately, but I thought it would be better for it to be public:  1) Do you think it will be difficult to get financing for properties with a tokenized structure?  2) If financing is not an issue, how much leverage do you intend to use and will properties be cross-collateralized at all? For instance, let's say within the Opportunity Fund I invest in Property A, but not Property B. If Property B defaults on its loan, will the lender have Property A as additional collateral?  3) I see that there's no hard cap. I understand the benefits of having more capital available to invest. However, 10% is supposed to go to Operational Expenses.  I wouldn't expect all costs to go up linearly as a percentage of capital raised. So, let's say you raise much more than actually necessary to operate the fund and you don't really need the full 10%. What happens to the extra operating capital? Does it go to the team, back to acquisition capital, or is it reserved somehow?  Also, even though I agree raising more capital is better, there's still only a limited amount of money you can invest. How much equity do you expect you can reasonably invest per year?  I know it may be too late for this, but I think it would be better if you only raised enough for 1-3 years worth of acquisitions, but allow yourself the ability to mint/sell more tokens in the future. Some people are just automatically turned off when they see you don't have a cap and don't bother to look further into the business.  4) Is there a Limited Partnership Agreement (or something similar) that can be reviewed?",False

Realisto is looking to raise money for an investment fund (with a small amount set aside for the team and operations).

I believe commercial real estate transaction volume is around 6 billion Euro per year (although I'd have to double check that), so it's a pretty large market, plus they will be doing some residential investing. But they will still have limited resources that an unlimited ICO can't easily solve. They couldn't acquire 6 million worth of real  Raising cash that sits idle because you can't invest it quickly enough isn't productive because it won't generate a return. That'll dilute dividends for everyone.  That's why I was saying they should consider raising funds over time...as they have the ability to invest it.

Regarding the cross-collateralization: First of all there is no need for that since it is not 2008 and the properties are not overrated as such. Furthermore we are going to use leverage but if everything is properly managed there is a very slim chance of a loan defaulting.  Regarding your question about the Operational Fund, those 10% are also used to fund and develop the platform, the more equity we have available the faster we can grow into more markets ( since we need to establish companies in other jurisdictions to properly do that) also every launch of something new requires marketing (Apple is advetising its Iphone X on every bus stop from here to bejing for a reason).

We differ a lot because we are actual real estate experts with experience in the field since 2011, we do hold our initial coin offering with an established company which has a running and proofed business model. I will not take the right to judge other projects in the real estate field but if you look closer they either imitate i.e. AirBnB on the  Blockchain, overreach by claiming to tokenize the World with just a few millions, pretend to be able to circumvent legal rules and governments with a digital land registry... We have a very realistic approach and the expertise which is need to successfully invest in real estate in a market we know inside out to produce great returns for our REA token holders. Furthermore we do know the real estate industry inside out, our platform which we will develop serves Investors and Emitters alike so it is deemed to be success and our token-model does not have the downsides of other Real Estate ICOs. ( you will have noticed those if you read their whitepapers as well.) We use the blockchain not because it is hip but because it solves problems which are otherwise almost impossible to solve. You really don´t have to give us money - you should invest your money into our project because we will invest 90% of the ICO procceeds directly into high yield real estate for you and you will participate in the fees generated by a global real estate tokenization platform, a concept which was rated by one of the big four accounting firms as ""disruptive and able to claim an at least 80% marketshare if successful"". 2. We laid out our businesscase in our Whitepaper and we do have a two phase approach since some areas of the business need more time to develop and some can start immediately. The REALISTO Team will run the first two projects on the platform: With the first half of the capital raised in the ICO, REALISTO will set up a CORE POOL of expertly selected, high-quality residential and commercial real estate assets. These assets will generate steady returns for users who plan to hold their tokens and watch the intrinsic value grow. The second half of the capital will be used for an OPPORTUNITY POOL, where more active investors can vote for the acquisition of real estate projects of different risk-to-yield ratios. By allocating REA tokens to different investment opportunities investors can actively manage their own real estate portfolio. The platform is already in development and will launch as a beta early next year, we know real estate experts all over the world who would love to fund their projects in return for asset backed tokens so we know this will be a very fast growing platform, and as a cryptocurrency holder you are well advised to diversify your portfolio with asset backed tokens to hedge against volatility. 3. We offer an asset-backed token, when the first real estate is acquired and the first ROI in ETH is paid out next year the price will increase, even more when the platform is fully operational and real estate projects will be launched by third parties there. We don´t think of our token as an zombie-token which will lose its value shortly after the ICO but rather increase in value steadily so you should not think of 60.000 token as 60.000 USD but rather 60.000 asset backed tokens which will increase in value among the best of them. you can check the ROI on more successful ICOs here https://icostats.com/ Aside from that we do not only rely on bounty to advertise us but rather have a big PR-Team working on it. And as a last note, Bounty will be 3% of all tokens created at the end of the ICO so depending on how good the work of everybody in the bounty program is and depending on how successful our ICO is there will be a lot more REA tokens as bounty than 60.000. 4. As others have stated our Pre-Sale is already live and has sold almost 50% of available tokens, you can still sign up for it on www.realisto.io and as others have pointed out we have more than 10.000 Investors on the Whitelist.",False

As always you didn't disappointed me  It is great that you explained that issue, although I strongly think that you should put it in some clearly visible place to avoid confusion.  I hope I am not becoming annoying. However I have few new questions to you I like to have a clear view on situation:  1. Is there any minimal budget you are aiming to obtain during ICO as whole? If so, what will happen with ICO find if you won't reach this minimal cap?  2. As you said. You have decided to scale up REA tokens in relation to ETH (so 1ETH = 330 REA). Will that happen as well with Bounty Campaign rewards? I believe it is only fair to do that as well.  3. On your token pre-sales website it is stated that currently obtained founds are 500k $. It has a disclaimer that it includes FIAT contributions. Could you give more details about that issue? What are Fiat contributions? I do not believe to see anything mentioned about it before. Do you have some external investor (company?)? Is it possible to know more?  4. In relation to previous question. I made some calculation and current ETH and BTC investments are responsible of around 110 000 of REA tokens. However, there are around 660 000 REA tokens created. it means that 550 000 REA tokens were created other way.  I believe they were created by FIAT contributions with this transaction: https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd446f653870393100c865d89cdf8ae05d5141ce3a1277a28d52b7641d2804dc9  Can you explain us what happen in this transaction. Were this 500 000 REA tokens came from?  5.  In relation to question 4.  I see on your github that your contract has function:    function grant_token_from_offchain(address _toAddr, uint _nTokens, string _ref) public onlyRobot {     require ( (campaignState == 2)               ||(campaignState == 1));      do_grant_tokens(_toAddr, _nTokens);     TokenGranted(_toAddr, _nTokens, _ref);   }  I find it slightly dengerous that there is a function which can created unlimited number of tokens without providing ETH to contract. What are the guarantees that it won't be misused or hacked?  6. Last but not least. Please verify and publish a source code of your smart contracts on etherscan (including token pre-sales smart contract). One of the most important things about Blockchain is full transparency. Currently, by not publishing and veryfing your code on etherscan you make yourself look less legit as a company. Please take this seriously into consideration, full transparency and view into your code for investors is crucial. It is all blockchain is about!   Thank you in advance for your answers!

As we stated earlier our budget is indeed very flexible since we are not an ICO trying to fund an idea but rather a running and successful company trying to fund the expansion into a new dimension (a blockchain based platform for real estate project tokenization). Because we don´t need to spend the funds we collect in the ICO on setting up a company and paying experts to tell us what to do to become profitable, we can work with a smaller budget as well as with a big one. As in any business, growth can happen faster and more easily if you don´t have to cut back on new employees as well as other expenses so we will grow a lot quicker a lot bigger with more funds raised, especially considering that we´ll invest 90% of the funds into real estate (using leverage) thus more funds equal more real estate equals higher returns for tokenholders. 2. We upped the Ratio of REA tokens to ETH because the ETH exchange rate is based on EUR/USD and we do need FIAT money to buy properties, since the actual value of the REA tokens will be based on the Portfolio of real estate which we will acquire and manage after the ICO (and the demand for the platform to be built) we feel it is correct to keep the Bounty token distribution the way it is currently - since those tokens will be worth more than regular tokens of a non asset backed ICO. On that note, we are very much looking foward to your contibution to the bounty campaign ( the polish translation). 3.4.5. Indeed we were approached by an Investor who wanted to Invest into the ICO with Fiat (Euro) currency instead of ETH / BTC, since every enlargement of our funds is benificial to every REA tokenholder (just as stated in the whitepaper) we agreed to accepting this contribution and treated it like a regular ETH/BTC contribution. Regarding question Nr. 5 indeed this is the blockchain part of the FIAT transaction we received. Regarding your feeling about the quoted code from github, since we do accept BTC as contribution there has to be a way of generating tokens on the Ethereum Network with matching a direct contribution to it, it is the same procedure every ICO employs if the accept more than one (the native) currency in the ICO and thanks to the blockchain you can rest assured that every transaction can be tracked and that the amount of trust you will have to put into us not abusing this function (which would ruin the asset backed nature of our token, so it would be no option for us) is as small as possible. In Terms of gurantees you can be sure it will only be used to credit BTC transactions and large FIAT contributions, regarding hacking attempts we cant disclose to much about our security to not make us vulnerable but we can say there have been more than 45 attempts at hacking us, none of which were successful. For us as the founders of REALISTO it would make no sense to generate free tokens since those would not be asset backed and thus be worthless and you can be sure it would be next to impossible to access this function from the outside. 6. We did publish the full code on github and the audit of our contract is live on the CoinFabrik blog but we will also publish it on Etherscan just to be 100% transparent. Please Note our Pre-Sale and ICO contract are all combined into one.  Have a good night today and we will be available for further questions tomorrow morning Best wishes",False

To answer your questions:  1. The platform will be launched at the latest in Summer 2018, we will most likely release a light version / Beta in spring and develop it together with our community. 2. We do run the first 2 projects on the platform: With the first half of the capital raised in the ICO, REALISTO will set up a CORE POOL of expertly selected, high-quality residential and commercial real estate assets. These assets will generate steady returns for users who plan to hold their tokens and watch the intrinsic value grow. The second half of the capital will be used for an OPPORTUNITY POOL, where more active investors can vote for the acquisition of real estate projects of different risk-to-yield ratios. By allocating REA tokens to different investment opportunities investors can actively manage their own real estate portfolio. Regarding your example investors would receive Novotel Tokens according to the terms of the project. 3. There is a difference between tokenization for ownership and tokenization as an investment, our goal is to provide opportunities to invest in real estate and earn returns from those investments, tokenized ownership is obviously a great thing but many years will pass until this can be done legally binding (think land registers, taxation, smart contracts as legally binding contracts etc.) In your example you would own the complete ""investment"" and would receive all the returns but since this one million dollar investment could be just a 10% share of a bigger residential building you would not become the legal owner of the building. - It is still a very early phase of development but we had a great meeting with one of the biggest real estate brokers in Germany and we talked about how they would like to offer individual Apartments from newly build residential buildings via our platform for sale to individual investors. But there would be a lot of things to clear up (and it depends on why you would buy the apartment, to occupy it yourself or to rent it and sell on at some point.)  4. This is a very important question and we are very happy to answer it. The Blockchain offers the perfect transparency but as soon as funds are transacted into the ""real world"" we are in an environment that requires a level of trust and faith. We do have an Escrow/Trustee system in place where all the funds from the ICO are sent to a bankaccount which is run by a third party law firm, those funds can only be disbursed for real estate transactions (and the related costs) and they will offer a public data room where all the transaction records will be uploaded. The same secure system will be employed for future projects from third parties, we will always try to keep our investors and their funds safe. (Think lisk in with their monthly accounting reports on their expenses). There is always a leap of faith because there is no 100% safety but that goes for everything which is managed by humans (of satoshi decides to sell all of his BTC at once, or if Vitalik decides he is done with Ethereum those turn of events would probably have a very negative effect on the underlying values.) You can rest assured that we will make everything as public and as transparent as possible and we will benefit a lot more from making REALISTO the amazon or google of real estate tokenization/investments on the blockchain than by trying to snag of a few euros here and there. Furthermore we are a Germany company, held to german tax laws, accounting laws and the civil code. 5. You are correct, this is the date the registry copy was pulled, the company was founded on 16.10.2015 (Gesellschaftvertrag vom 16.10.2015).

This obviously goes for future projects on the platform as well, mind you there will be a realistic minimum contribution to not clog up the network since it is of almost no use for an investor to invest .00001 USD even if there are very high returns possible.

You indeed put some light on those scenarios. I really hope you will somehow incorporate those information into your whitepaper, as I think it had some gaps in those areas.  I have some follow up questions for you It would be great if you could provide your answer for those as well  1. As far as I understand, Initial investment for both Core & Opportunity Pools will be reinvested over and over again into new real estate deals (from which ROI will be given to REA token holders). Am I right? If so, how long such process will keep going? Ad infinitum or maybe some limited period of time? How many ""investments"" do you plan to have within one year? I know it depends on the project, however some average value would be great.  2. On your application mockup there is ""running time"" parameter of an investment. What does this parameter mean exactly? Is a time between buying an estate and selling it (and consequently expected ROI dividends)? Or does it have any other meaning?  3. How ROI dividends will be payout in a scenario of selling an estate and renting it? I believe that those two are quite different scenarios from the ROI and return point of view  4. Let's assume that we have a Founder who starts crowdfunding on your platform. We rise money, mint some new Tokens and buy the estate. After the first investment is finished, Founder use initial investment to make another one. What is the use of Tokens in this phase? Can Investors still vote for the next investment or maybe now it is all the Founder decision? What will happen if Founder decide to not re-invest initial investment into new estate? What will happen will all that money?  5. If a Founder, re-invests his initial investment (let's say it is named ""phase two"") does he still have to pay fees on your platform? Or do fees apply only on the initial/first/phase one investment (the one with the crowdfunding)?  6. What kind of security mechanisms/guarantees do you provide so that money from the estate sales/renting will go back to blockchain (ETH for token holders)? What are the security mechanisms to prevent founders to just run away with earned money or to forge the documents and give back smaller ROI than it really was?  7. Last but not least. Do you still need Polish translation for your Bounty Campaign ? If, the answer is ""yes"" I would gladly prepare one for you.  Thank you a lot in advance  Best Regards",False

We aim to get a good mix between cash-flow properties with longer holding times and short term refurbishments to get an attractive ROI mix. 2.Projects will have a predetermined runtime until the Project is successfully completed. There can be projects with shorter runtimes like flat refurbishments and projects with longer durations i.e. cash-flow residential/commercial buildings with an exit in a few years. 3. If the project is only acquired for the purpose of developing and then selling it, the focus is on a high sales return - Investors who have invested into those kinds of projects will receive their returns upon the sale of the property, if it is a core-Pool/opportunity Pool property, the initial price of the building is re-invested. If it is a third party project the full funding amount plus the agreed upon returns will be paid out to the investors. If the project is a cash-flow property with an exit in a few years to token holders will receive the monthly returns from rent/leases and at the time of the exit the returns from the higher sales price compared to the initial price. Investors can choose if they prefer constant payouts or rather have bigger returns but more time between payouts. 4. Before a project by a third party expert is launched there has to be an exact business plan of what he plans to do, either he wants to realize a single project - after completion all the funds invested are paid back. Or he wants to launch his own ""fund"" where he manages a portfolio on behalf of his investors, even then there will be a planned exit or several optional exits for the ""fund"". Since we take measures to secure the funds from the investors against misappropriation with escrow,trusts and holding companies the investors can rely on the experts to realize their projects according to the plan. 5. If the real estate expert launches a new project he will have to pay new fees. (As i noted earlier the fees will depend on the individual projects/plans) 6. We do implement a third party escrow/admin who offers a public data room where everyone will be able to track FIAT account movements, in and outgoing.

Realisto definitely have their place as an investment to consider it is about much more than real estate, it is fully decentralized, members vote on the direction of the platform via a stake weighted liquid democracy system with the first vote scheduled after the ICO.  Not to mention that the whole idea of Realisto is to function as an agnostic platform where anyone can bring an investment opportunity to it and tokenize it. Just like Ethereum created an ecosystem for applications to be run on top of it, Realisto is doing the same but for any and every investment opportunity out there.  They are providing a platform for existing funds (REITs), such as the existing US-based Real Estate fund they are launching with, to gain access to new sources of capital from the crypto markets. Property title deeds are not held by Realisto or the users of the platform, they are held by the third-party escrow lawyers and all smart contracts will be accessible for review by investors. The investors sourced via Realisto will be issued asset-backed tokens the more REA tokens they hand out for free as a pre-sale bonus, the less funds – in relation to tokens generated – they will have to buy assets. As the Real Estate fund gains in performance the asset-backed tokens increase in value and may be exchanged at any time via the  infrastructure, network, and blockchain expertise, providing instant liquidity in what is normally a less liquid market.  It would be foolish to dismiss any ICO based on one aspect you disagree with or MISUNDERSTOOD. I will definitely be investing on their ICO and using Realisto platform.",False

Berlin real estate prices have steadily been rising over the past 4 years, having now reached the same level as the European banking capital of Frankfurt.

It looks solid, and it is great that you see the use for blockchain technology in real estate market.  However, I still have some questions for which I could not find an answer neither on your web page nor whitepaper. I believe they are touching some crucial aspects of your buisness case. I hope you will be able to answer them (or even include within the next iteration of your whitepaper as presales and ICO are still ahead of us)  1. I am a little bit confused with a phrase ""ROI payout"". ROI is calculated as: (Gain from investment - Cost of Investment) / Cost of Investment. where Cost of Investment is initial funds from ICO/Crowdfunding and Gain from Investment is the Sales Price of a Estate. I believe you meant in your whitepaper that payouts will be made from Gain from Investment i.e. sales price. Your current paper suggests that if we had 100k $ for an investment, and the Gain is equal  150k $  payouts will be made only from 50k$ as it is 50% ROI value. In such scenario, there is no way for payouts to be beneficial for investors, as they will always lose their money. I am pretty sure that I just overinterpreted your paper. however I believe that your white paper is not specific enough in this matter. Payouts should be provided as a mathematical formula, so there is no place for misinterpretation. Could you elaborate on this issue?  2. You also say that REA token holders will receive 70% of the platform generated fees. In my opinion it also lacks of mathematical formula. However, my biggest problem is that you don't provide any details like: what services will be prone to fees and how big the fees will be like. What is more I would be very grateful for some predictions of potential fee revenues with appropriate assumptions. Right now the annual fees might be of any value. Consequently it is hard to assume any potential revenues from this stream. Could you provide more details?  3. My final question. Have you ever considered how your buisness case match with current crypto market volatility? I think it might be a significant problem for a investors. I will give a simple example:  - I invested 1 ETH into lucrative real estate investment with projected 50% ROI. Consequently you exchanged this ETH into FIAT - lets assume 300$ and use it to buy and renovate estate - After 6 Months you sold estate with 50% ROI - consequently there is  450$ waiting for me - However over this 6 Months ETH changed its value to 500$ (Actually It did over the last 6 months - checked on World Coin Index) - As a result I receive 0.9 ETH, even tough I have invested 1 ETH. Of course, I have more money, however I would have even more if I hadn't done anything  This example clearly shows that your business model is prone to cryptomarket fluctuactions (which are significant). Ironically, business will be beneficial for potential investors only when ETH price will stay the same over the time of investment or drop down!  Can you gives us your comment to this scenario?  Thank you a lot in advance  Best Regards!",False

We will try to add your questions to our documentation. 1. Indeed we aim to pay out the returns from the Investments in ETH, to be operational we will only pay out the returns, not the money invested, otherwise there would be no more funds to acquire new projects, that’s why we can only pay out the returns and not the equity raised in the ICO (if we would do that we could only do one round of projects and the REA tokens would be worthless afterwards.) What you are not crediting in your consideration is that the Investor still holds on to the REA tokens with an at least equal value of their initial investment. For Example and clarification If you invest i.e. 100 $ you will hold at least 100 REA token, and you would receive the 50% ROI so 50$ on top of the 100 REA token you hold. Your initial contribution is never lost in the equation since the REA tokens will be worth at least the 100$ you put in since those will be again and again used to acquire and convert/sell real estate. As an investor you receive the profits in ETH and you hold the REA tokens bought in the ICO – Those tokens are asset backed with real estate and will receive returns from those projects thus giving the tokens a “floor price” which will be a factor-x of the returns. The Investor holds on to asset backed REA tokens and will receive constant returns.  2. If real estate experts use our platform to fund their projects we will take a fee for the emission of their own asset backed tokens with our system, this fee will depend on many different factors like complexity of the screening process, individual regulation, the amount of work it takes to secure our investors against the individual projects, the amount of capital to be raised etc. Conventional real estate crowdfunding platforms take up to 15% of the capital raised as a fee, since our structure and model is very different from those and our operational costs will be lower as well, our fee will be lower than that and we will attract a lot more experts to fund their projects with the crypto-community. The global real estate crowdfunding market is on the rise with numbers growing exponentially. This market will by estimation grow to over 90 billion USD in 2025 and we will be the forerunners to pull this market onto the blockchain and generate fees from that.  3. With our Token we hedge against crypto-volatility, your example does not pay regard to the actual REA token which we emit in the ICO. Your Example should be: You invest 1 ETH in the presale and receive 390 REA token (we exchange the ETH to FIAT like you assumed and receive – 300 $), The 1 ETH is invested into Real Estate with 50% ROI. After the project is finished there are 150 $ in returns waiting for you, while you still hold on to the 390 REA tokens which will be valued at at least 300 $ (initial price) although it is much more reasonable to expect the value of the token to increase since after the ICO there will be a finite number of tokens, all asset backed and with the right to claim returns – driving value and conserving their initial value through their asset backed nature. The 150$ USD will be converted to ETH and claimed by you. If the Ether value has dropped you will receive more than 0.5 ETH, if the value of ether is up at the time of the exchange you will receive less ETH but still the same value. All the time you also hold the initial REA Tokens valued at i.e. 2$. Since we continue to invest your initial contribution into real estate and we are developing the platform with a global blockchain based reach you are actually a lot better off since you receive actual liquidity to spent while keeping the initial investment in REA tokens. If you would have hodled your 1 ETH you would have to sell it to liquidate your returns – with REA you will stay in the ecosystem and can sell the ETH returns to liquidate while staying in the economic cycle.  If you have further questions feel free to ask, you can also join our telegram or slack groups via www.realisto.io  Best Wishes",False

We are real estate developers with many years of experience in the market. We do not claim to tokenize assets with which we have no experience, like other asset backed ICOs. 90% of the proceeds from the ICO will be directly invested into real estate in the city of Berlin, Germany. Thus our token will be asset backed and the tokenprice will grow because of monthly ROI payouts. We focus on real estate with an ""add value"" strategy and a high cash-flow. Generally speaking we are offering two portfolios for investors to participate in: The core pool will follow a focus on real estate with focus on a strong cash flow and the option to realize an add value strategy e.g. an attic to be converted or similar. The opportunity pool will offer investors the chance to directly manage their portfolio by placing their REA tokens on curated projects, usually refurbishments, strategic repositionings, or condominiums to be sold. We know our market inside out, this may seem to local for a worldwide blockchain real estate project but consider Berlin real estate market cap last year was 24,8 billion usd, almost the entire ETH market cap in October, but we would never claim the be able to invest in real estate for example in New York since we have no experience in the market of New York.

Offering a project up for funding on the platform will be as easy and straightfoward as possible. You will submit all the relevant information about you,your company and the project you want to fund and how high the ROI for the participants will be. Than we together with real estate experts from the area in which the project is based will check the information, run all the neccessary due diligence and if everything checks out your funding will start via an individual smart contract. The participants will receive a project based asset backed token. If the project is successfully funded the funds go to a third party trustee who will only disburse those funds upon proof of contract, thus securing the investors as good as possible. Depending on how you as an expert run your project you can opt to pay out the returns monthly (e.g. for a cashflow property with a fixed exit) or for example you can offer a buyback of the asset backed tokens when to project is finished. The possibilities are endless. For this service the platform will raise a fee, this fee is split 30%/70% between the REALISTO platform and the REA tokenholders from the initial ICO.",False

The REA Token Sale restart date will be announced after the fork.  The past few days, Leonard and I have been polling our community on their concerns and feedback on the upcoming Bitcoin hard fork in relation to the REALISTO ICO. After HOURS of conversations, surveys, and calls, it was clear that a vast majority of the REALISTO community preferred waiting until AFTER the November 16 hard fork to participate in our ICO. All contributors until now can chose to either get a refund or to have their contributions credited upon restart of the sale. Bounty Hunters will be credited as well. 1. REALISTO ICO Date Changes Given the uncertainty of the upcoming Bitcoin hard fork, we will be postponing our pre-sale and ICO to a time after the hard fork, when the market is stable again. We assume this will be at the earliest on November 17, the exact date of the relaunch will be announced as soon as technically possible. The change will allow for the hard fork to execute and provide time for the industry to react. We feel that this will eliminate any concerns or confusion with Bitcoin contributions leading up to the fork and will help you guys invest with a peace of mind. Keep in mind, all bonuses and terms will remain exactly the same. We will publish all dates accordingly on the REALISTO website for your convenience. 2. First ICO to Accept B2X We are very excited to announce that with this postponement comes the addition of B2X contributions! As of right now, we are the first ICO to publicly announce that we will be accepting B2X following the fork. Our dev team is prepped and ready to go. To recap, you will be able to participate in the REALISTO ICO with contributions from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and B2X. We are going to keep a close eye on the fork and ensure that we B2X contributions are accepted as soon as possible by industry standards.",False

We are real estate developers with many years of experience in the market. We do not claim to tokenize assets with which we have no experience, like other asset backed ICOs. 90% of the proceeds from the ICO will be directly invested into real estate in the city of Berlin, Germany. Thus our token will be asset backed and the tokenprice will grow because of monthly ROI payouts. We focus on real estate with an ""add value"" strategy and a high cash-flow. Generally speaking we are offering two portfolios for investors to participate in: The core pool will follow a focus on real estate with focus on a strong cash flow and the option to realize an add value strategy e.g. an attic to be converted or similar. The opportunity pool will offer investors the chance to directly manage their portfolio by placing their REA tokens on curated projects, usually refurbishments, strategic repositionings, or condominiums to be sold. We know our market inside out, this may seem to local for a worldwide blockchain real estate project but consider Berlin real estate market cap last year was 24,8 billion usd, almost the entire ETH market cap in October, but we would never claim the be able to invest in real estate for example in New York since we have no experience in the market of New York. This is where our REALISTO platform comes into play, other real estate experts will be able to offer their own real estate-backed tokens on our platform thus creating a global hub for real estate investments on the blockchain.  @Wiss19 We regard our project to be very different from other real estate projects on the blockchain. We do not base our concept on overreach and dreams of giant towers or huge tourist resorts all over the world but rather build our business from the ground up, investing in a market we know inside out and generating great ROI for our tokenholders right after the ICO.  @Arteezy.rtx we will be in touch with you shortly.  @ankit10 you can contact us trough the bounty form on the footer of our homepage and will will set everything up.",False
