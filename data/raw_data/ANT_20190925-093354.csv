Are additional coins in circulation being added?   Quote from: jp8219 on October 14, 2017, 04:13:41 AM I appreciate the response. Could you confirm the coin count circulation is 39,609,524 and will remain unless further notice of a additional change? Thank you.  For now, no new coins will be added to the total supply, when the Aragon Network launches and the governance is gradually moved over to the token holders, they can, for example, create a proposal and vote on minting new tokens, so it is a possibility sometime in the future, but not anytime soon.  The circulating supply will change a little bit as the vesting schedule cliffs happen, at the time(s) a portion of the tokens under vesting will be added to the circulating supply. The founders have 2 year vesting with 6 month cliffs, so the first batch, 25% of the founders tokens will be released to them six months after the token sale.",False

Did some reading. And I still don't understand what can be done with ANT tokens? Apart from p&d actions, what would effect its pricing?  I see on this blogpost, that the company bought back some of the tokens to distribute on actions like bug bounties, or paying some freelance employees. But those are not the main business of the company, rather means to their business. What I'm currious about is how would this company's vision/business success or failure will effect the tokens?   Btw, from where I stand, I don't think there is a chance that founders would just take away the ico funds and dissappear.

When Aragon is implemented, those tokens will buy a number of things (read extensively about it in the white paper) and will be minted through the provision of a number of services and uses, via fees, much like proof of stake but different. It's future price will be determined, like now, by the market and their rate of inflation by the stakeholders of the coin.  If you believe in this project AND are willing to wait quite a bit of time, purchasing ANT now could be a great investment, but it is pure speculation -like every other coin with the possible exception of Dash, if you have a node-. Current price is quite steep (my opinion) considering all the circumstances and how long in the horizon is a reality of great usage of the Aragon Network AND some of it's key features (the Arbitration one is particularly complex and potentially quite manipulable). But these are times in which development of these things take a bit of time but implementation is usually pretty fast because, obviously, the first to use the applications are the organizations within the proper crypto world itself (think Ethereum, again), so neither of these projects needs to be implemented by a big brick and mortar organization -that seems to be in a very, very distant future and with a big IF in front of it- and can literally thrive on self-propagation of crypto projects. Specifically Aragon can become part of a chain (on top of the Ethereum blockchain) that includes other DAOs -potentially many of them- that will bring added features in a never ending (potentially) decentralized organizational and operational network for all kinds or organizations. You will notice I included a couple of times the word ""potential"".... in the foreseeable future though, you can look at Aragon as an improvement on the Ethereum smart contracts (allowing distribution of dividends, for instance, which Ethereum doesn't provide), among several other uses such as voting and arbitration (again, this one very far from proven effectively as of now).  I don't know if your interest is in sticking around for a while in Aragon to see what it can really do and what his worth ultimately be, or if you are thinking in investing in it for pure speculative purposes. If the later is the case, I believe there are many other projects that will probably have closer catalysts than Aragon. This one has a long and very winding road ahead before it reaches even a minimal part of what it is set to achieve.",False

This post will provide you with details on who purchased ANT before the token sale, the terms of the sale, the total Ether received, and how those funds were used. Contributors and Sale Terms We received contributions totaling 2,719 ether from 6 buyers during the pre-sale. Buyers included: CoinFund ICONOMI ShapeShift Joe Urgo — Ethlance & Sourcerers Daniele Levi — Stampery Anonymous Ethereum Founding Member Each buyer had the same pre-sale conditions: 20% discount over the public price (1 ether = 120 ANT) and a 6-month vesting schedule with a 3 month cliff. Note that public sale contributors will not be subject to vesting or lock-up. Institutional buyers (CoinFund, ICONOMI, and ShapeShift) were allowed to contribute the equivalent of $40,000 in ether, while personal buyers could contribute up to $10,000 in ether. For liquidity purposes, ShapeShift was also allowed to purchase an additional $20,000. That specific portion of tokens were not discounted and are not subject to vesting. Aragon is pioneering the change in organizational structures, and redefining how companies are managed worldwide. At ShapeShift, we strive to align ourselves with companies that further advance and broaden the usage of blockchain technology. We are delighted to play a role in Aragon’s upcoming token sale. - Erik Voorhees, Founder and CEO of ShapeShift Capital Allocation The purpose of our pre-sale was to fund the development necessary to make the public sale possible. As a result, we made a point of offering only enough tokens to fund our development and operations until the public token sale. In addition to funding development, we’ve allocated part of the pre-sale capital to (in ether): Security Audits: 49.54 ether Legal: 208 ether PR: 106.95 ether Advertisements: 133.91 ether ENS: 212 ether Other: 15.47 ether After months of work, the pre-sale capital has brought us to today's sale.
