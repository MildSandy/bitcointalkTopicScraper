The combination of mobile ubiquity and blockchain is unlocking opportunity for prosperity like never before. The Nuclus Platform will be the #1 marketplace for international order fulfillment from Sub-Saharan Africa serving new buyers and realization of commercial goals and objectives of related development programs.  The introduction of a digital utility token NUCLUS Money or NUCLUM (NLM) will stimulate trade between participants as it has no residual effects or distortions i.e. inflation and the transaction is totally completed at the point and time of exchange. We introduce a new economic philosophy to ensure sustainability and to advance equitable opportunities for economic participants during economic growth with benefits incurred by every section of society.
