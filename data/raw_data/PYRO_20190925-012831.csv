The Need For Change The Internet and connected devices have introduced a more interconnected society than ever before. However, in the midst of all this innovation, we have made a choice to prioritize convenience over security and put trust in companies, websites, apps, and people online, exposing us to various security and privacy threats. Additionally, the promises of blockchains and decentralization prey on people's revolutionary belief, but are often illusionary, taking our money and leaving us with the same problems that we faced yesterday. It is time for a change.  What is Promether? Promether is a new type of network called an Adaptive Symbiotic Network (ASN). Based on the principles of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Ubiquitous Computing, Promether allows anybody to create secure and anonymous networks simply by deploying and configuring a series of reusable software components. It is an open-source and component-based, reusable system that abstracts the details of the secure network from the applications that use it. Supporting centralized, decentralized, distributed, meshnet, and hybrid topologies, any application can communicate and transfer data securely. To become the decentralized privacy network of the future, Promether will deliver a security based API, distributed computing platform, decentralized VPN, secure communications app, decentralized data sharing and storage solutions, and a fully self-sustainable rewards-based ecosystem. Whether you're an individual trying to build your first application, or a company who needs to develop a global service, or even a government that wishes to establish secure communications - Promether is flexible enough to adapt to everyone's specific networking demands. Simple, reusable, and effective end-to-end security for everyone with complete variety in function.
