Hence the proliferation of crypto hedge funds seen this past summer.  But not everyone who wants to invest in a basket of crypto assets can afford the minimums or fees of a hedge fund, and nor do all such investors want to hold anything more daring than a basket of the top coins.  Enter Trident crypto index fund, which is launching the HOLD 10, a new passively managed index fund of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by inflation-adjusted market capitalization.  The index will hold and weight the top 10 cryptocurrencies by inflation-adjusted market capitalization, taking into account the supply inflation schedules for the next five years, in contrast to the more common ranking by current circulating supply on sites such as Coinmarketcap.com.  Eligibility requirements include that a coin needs to trade on multiple exchanges, its monthly trading volumes must exceed 30% of circulating supply for the last three months, and it must have a free-floating price, not one pegged to another asset.  http://www.tridentcoin.com",False

Coin can be manipulated and have different results than the index fund results, hence the price will be wacky and all over the place instead of sticking with the index results.  This means we would require some sort of company having one hand on the wheel and make it centralized instead of decentralized version of this. Coin may work as well since its a great idea but it would require a lot of regulation in order to work so it doesn't get too much different than the index results, you would need a lot of trust on the coin and the developers for that to happen though.",False
