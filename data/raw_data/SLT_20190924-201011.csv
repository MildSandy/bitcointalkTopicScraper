It’s rather disheartening to know that some challenges still exist in the smooth execution of transactions made through centralized and some decentralised exchanges. Transactions that involves cross-border payments through centralized exchanges are very expensive and unreliable while getting cross-chain transactions through decentralised exchanges is laced with delays and lags that are capable of stripping one off about 50% profit; bearing in mind that digital assets market is one whose price, changes within few hours per day. Therefore exchanges ought to be 99.9% free of any lag or inadequacies.  Having said this, let’s refresh our minds with the 2008–2009 financial crisis that made a lot of people regret all their commitments with traditional banks and a similar incident in August 2016 that saw a huge loss of 120,000 BTC from decentralised exchanges to hack attacks. But whichever way you look at it, cryptocurrency has come to stay as a big stakeholder to the future. So the question is where do we get a better decentralised exchange platform where there’s no high percentage charge on transactions, free and direct transaction between cross-chains, low trading fees and possible returns/profit on investment?.  Functions of SLT Exchange platform SLT Exchange platform aims to List SLT token on other exchanges to increase accessibility and liquidity. Provide a medium for exchanging various cryptocurrencies and altcoins (multi exchanger) which will allow users to easily diversify their portfolio. Provide a debit/credit card to support easy payments of goods/services and instant withdrawals. Provide a wallet exchanger which will help users manage, store and exchange their assets in the most efficient and secured manner. Provide a Mobile App for iOS and Android devices.  SLT Tokens Is a powerful ERC-20 based tokens that supports the SLT exchange platform. It can be transferred from peer to peer (P2P), traded on exchanges or staked to yield a 50% weekly rewards. SLT is officially listed on Mercatox, Coindeal, Crex24 and recently on Coinpayments. With a total supply of 100m, latest price, charts, marketcap and other information are available on CoinGecko.com.  Investing in SLT token in a bearish market SLT tokens’ ICO opened sales at $0.30 and later concluded at $0.50. Due to the malicious dip that has berserk the crypto-community, it has returned to a $0.352 price on exchanges. Now, if you think that this is unbearable, what about its token holders rewards? I bet you, there’s no total loss when dealing with SLT platform. Because it has a good circulating supply and various exchange listings, making it easy to maneuver through many options.  Investing in SLT token in a bullish market With a good volume and excellent working platform, it’s very easy to see SLT’s price “mooning”. Don’t forget that SLT is an exchange platform with a difference and it’s unique features will attract major tokens of value to its listing queue. This will further increase the demand for SLT token thus making it’s value to grow exponentially.  Use Case Fred Smith is a cryptocurrencies trader but have one major concern which is how some decentralised exchange platforms list “shit coins” thus, leaving traders at the mercy of these scammers. He also detest the time lag he usually encounters when trading. This has made him lose about 3eths in profit (when summed up). SLT exchange platform solves all these concerns and Fred is more confident and satisfied as he continues with SLT platform.

She downloaded it, signed up and every other thing became history as she now has a diversified portfolio of altcoins and few cryptocurrency.   Now is the era of internet of values and most financial systems have moved on to digitalization and blockchain but it’s not about having a blockchain; it’s about having a self sustaining and efficient ecosystem that would encourage the existing crypto-community, products/services and at the same time, level the entry barrier to cryptocurrency and blockchain usage.

The world of digital currency has raged past pure crypto currency coins and has made great headway into more practical applications. SLT is one such example. In the future we will have transparent trading platform. This platform will be created to fight several issues of the cryptocurrency world — from difficulty of participation in the cryptocurrency market trading space to the friction in carrying out the transactions to security breaches.  SLT is on its way to developing as a trading platform to face all these challenges while offering the users with the power to buy and sell their digital coins to each other. SLT proposes to revolutionize the experience of market participation in cryptocurrency trading by making it easily accessible to all types, classes and grades of users, safe and free of security breaches. Not only that, it also offers a wide scope of applications within the ecosystem.  One of the trickiest realities of entrepreneurship and business start-ups is that very few start-ups make it to the level of a fully developed business. The rate of failure in startup is 42%. This is not just demotivating for entrepreneurs but also raises questions as to what went wrong.

Our advantage is that that we will have share profit with SLT holders are you familiar with BCO ( crypto bridge token) they offer long term staking and share profit with holders without inflation on their own token. For example, holders will get a little bit of all tokens which are traded  on their exchange, not like Kucoin ( KCS) their holders get only KCS token as shared profit)  but BCO do not accept ERC20 tokens.  So we can say that our project is combination of Kucoin in sense of marketing, promotional offers, all tokens ( the most interesting ones) will be accepted + BCO way of sharing profit with holders + mobile wallet (exchanger) where users will be able to cash out trading profits on debit card - at first, members will be able only SLT convert to FIAT on card after some time that wallet will upgraded to multicurrency wallet.  This is one of the way to drive trading volume to our token. Our project is divided in two parts. First one is decentralized exchange  and second one is wallet exchanger. Second part of our project can not be decentralized because of Debit card.  We think that decentralized exchanges need more marketing, attractive designs and of of course functionality. At the moment you can find functionality everywhere but attractive designs like Kucoin or Binance NOT.  Just imagine that Binance or Kucoin are decentralized and share profits with their holders in form that holders gets all tokens from exchange + new tokens are added on weekly or bi-weekly basses sounds brilliant doesn't it, I would trade on that exchange, wouldn't you ?  + users can cash out profita on debit card  Well I do not see project like this, not alive nor in ICO phase. SO we do not have competition  actually, because we do not compete with new technology, we only use what is already functional and making it more attractive to users and providing a better service than competitors.  Of course if we stumble upon some tech problem we will fix it.  Hope we answered your question.   ",False

The platform will severely cut down on time lost due to transaction delays and slow execution which is a big break for us,users.So, they will use together,wallet exchanger and a digital asset exchanger in the same place,platform will exponentially increase the speed with which users may access funds and convert coins in whatever they want.Because of blockchain tech. transactions will be done very fast. Silo processing doesn't work well because it is limited by physical infrastructure.Use of blockchain technology as the bases of the platform will increase security,it will be hard to hack it. The best part in all this is  that SLT token will provide and quick and easy platform for those who love to trade but don't want to deal with the delays when opening different wallets.

No, SLt is not security token, is a utility token. It does not represent share of a company, it just represents companys services. In our case, our service is withdrawing crypto currencies  on ATMs or spending with our card by selling your crypto currencies for SLToken and selling SLToken for fiat + trading tokens on our decentralized platform.  You are familiar with kucoin and binance exchanges, right ? imagine if they have a feature (mobile wallet, ecxchanger) where you can sell ( exchange your BNB token or KCS token for fiat on your card + their exchange platform is decentralized.  So, SLT is utility token not a security token.  You can find out more about the difference between security and utility tokens here ---> https://medium.com/@bonpay/security-tokens-vs-utility-tokens-1aa7531aabe8  one more example is crypto bridge token and decentralized exchange http://crypto-bridge.com  part of the profit generated from trading fee will be distributed to SLT holders but not like dividends it is more like a informal ""staking"".",False

When I see supply of some coin I can make a conclusion about the price that will be on the market. Here I see only 5mil and looks like there will be less tokens because all will not be sold.  They are going out on the exchanger in this month and beside that Coinpayments accepted them and gave a good estimated price of $3.30. Price at the moment is $0.50... there is no reason not to buy SLT.  So I invested  and waiting for your exchanger because the price can go very high with this supply. Some tokens/coins have 50 mil supply and their price is $20 so SLT can go even to $200. Personally believe in this project so keep going! Thank you!,False

Yes we need a partnership to produce debit or prepaid cards. At the moment, we can not tell who our partner will be because huge manipulation is happening.  Wave crest along with the rest of their partners canceled all transactions(cash outs, top ups) on their cards  via eny crypto currency only to cause a panic on market so some other felas - read BIG NAMES could get into it + everything happened too fast last year so governments were not ready for this.  But do not sell you favorite tokens because of this panic because in Q3 Q4 everything will be crystal clear again.  We will make custom decentralized exchange + wallet od SLT token to suit our needs because we have unique project in our hands so there is not copy/paste exchange just implement it on our site.  Because of all this manipulation we decided to launch our fully operational exchange with the prepaid card  in begining of 2019. Of course we will start preparation much sooner.  We already started, actually. few days ago we reserved our domain to avoid ""smart asses"" who would reserved it before us and try to sell it for ridiculously high price back to us.  wallet for SLT token will probably be much sooner than exchange.  Wavecrest is not the only card issuer in the world but it is the biggest with high influence.   Hope,  this answered your questions.  Regarding card, we will wait "" air to clean a little bit"" - it should be clean enough until Q3, so we can announce our Card Issuer parner. Regarding exchange - we already started to work on it - it will be fully operational at the end of Q4 or begining of Q1 ""19 - this is a big project we need time.

Yes we will deal with FIAT money but on our way, members probably will not be able trade  directly against FIAT but they will have option to cash out FIAT money via our app - separated wallet for SLT token which members can sell for FIAT and cashout on their bank acc or our prepaid card.  Making seperated exchange wallet allow us to register as a ltd. which sells  digital goods and yes unfortunately  when members reach certain limit which is stated in financial law theay have to Verify themselfs trough KYC but that is only for that wallet if they reach certain limit. But they can trade without limit and no questions asked because it is a decentralized exchange  We will  explore more our options regarding FIAT money but for now it will be like I explained above. If we use USDT - which is token as well we can use our token instead to cash out you have to be verifed on both tokens. In last few months USDT had a lots of accusations regarding BTC prica manipulations, so we will see what we are going to implement. For now is lika I explained in first part of this text.  Thanks againg for your question, if you have more questions like this one we would be delighted to answered them because trough them we have opportunity to explain more about our project.",False

So, we all can find plenty projects solving that issue. Have you noticed how market dictates ""theme"" for projects (ICOs) lets exclude scams like one ICO wrote penis on their website when they raised millions  At the moment, HOT ISSUES are transactions and fees,mass shopping adotpion, customer protection ( most of the crypto currencies have anonymous transactions so this is huge) if some projects could pull of buyers protections like PayPal had but keeping anonymous part, is going to be huge. I think that UTK ( Utrust) is really close to do that.  Hot issue is centralized exchanges as well, because thaey keep your funds on their wallets, so they can scam you anytime they want there is no law who can protect you, well there is some laws but forget about those because crypto word is not accepted buy all ountries on the world, so it is ""wild west"". And the best answer on that is decentralized exchanges - find out more about decantralized exchanges here https://www.cryptocompare.com/exchanges/guides/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange/  So we saw high demand for decantralized exchange and we started our project + we added a prepaid card on it ( members will not be able withdraw huge amounts of fiat on that card  because limits quite low on them per day 1000$ or so, some of them have limits 2000$ and someof them have 500$ per day) + mobile wallet for SLT token adn with time that is goint to be multicurrency wallet.  Because we are underdevelopment, we constantly changing (updeting) our white paper - you can expect in May updated white paper with more detailed informations, same is with road map. We follow market and we adjust to new rules from goverments and demand from traders.  If you have any questions, we would be delaghted to answer them",False

At the moment, it seems like Bulls are coming back so we should see green days on the market but that depends as well where traders are going to move their capital ? into a bitcoin against $ or in altcoins.  But with the basic math you can predict for yourself.  For example for every coin outhere you should see max circulation and is it a fixed suply or not. After that you should see how many coins is sold or is going to be sold in ICO and on top of that and the most important you should check out white paper and understand what is a project behind this token, does it have future in crypto world - is it out there any kind demand for such a project, if your answer is yes than jump in and remeber do not put all eggs in one basket  I hope I answered your question anykind of speculations from our side would not be professional nor ethically correct.",False
