The goal of the decentralized platform, is “to help everyone, from end-consumers to the ship owners, Shipping companies to the Agents/brokers, small or large courier companies, Manufacturers, Producers(farmers), the traders, and the investors around the world to facilitate their ventures and ease the trading practices by connecting all the continents to one unique platform.”  How BitNautic works?  In traditional shipping ways, the transactions involve a lot of paperwork such as sales contracts, charter-party agreements, bills of lading, port documents, letters of credit and others related to vessel and cargo. All these documents need to pass through a long chain of departments. BitNautic prevails over old traditional shipping ways, which eradicates the need for several contracts to be signed multiple times and hence reduces paperwork. BitNautic also provides services and transportation which is internally boosted by decentralized blockchain technology. Inspired by the way blockchain payment system works, BitNautic proposes a trading platform for commodities where consumers, importers/exporters, ship-owners, service providers and producers of goods will be able to trade their products in the open market and free trade environment.  Bitnautic ICO  The ICO token BTNT provided by BitNautic is an ERC20 token which will act as a medium to help you be a part of the project. Funds raised via ICO and pre-ICO will mainly be used for the research and development of the platform, in-house trading business, and to purchase ships to be used for the transportations of goods in containers as well as bulk products such as agricultural goods (sugar, corn, rice etc.), minerals and construction materials. The BitNautic ICO will involve the release of 35 Million tokens for crowd sale.   Hope this helps.",False

We want to change that.     THE BITNAUTIC PLATFORM   Our solution is a single platform, capable of holding together all the major players of the market: carriers, shippers, producers, buyers. Every one of them has different needs and different obstacles that prevent them from fulfilling them. And how do they solve them? Phone calls, unfavorable deals, friends of friends. Lack of choice, long waiting times, tedious and complicated bureaucracy. What we propose is a completely transparent network, where ship owners can list their ships, their location updated in real time, and cargo owners can find the best routes for their shipments, and at the best price. At the same time, this will allow them to forge new business relationships, extending their network and bringing new customers to their business.     BitNautic Benefits Comparison Table     THE BITNAUTIC TOKEN (BTNT)   We have created our own BitNautic Token (BTNT), which will be used for all deals made on the BitNautic network. There will only be a 2% fee on every transaction as payment for the platform.    PRE-ICO & ICO   Our Pre-ICO is Live! You can already buy BitNautic Tokens (BTNT) on our website. Find all the details about our ICO in this infographic. The minimum contribution is 0.05 ETH = 25 BTNT.  Every contribution over 3000 USD will be verified with our KYC service powered by IdentityMind Global.     We are currently developing our MVP, which will be available for Public Beta Testing on July 30, at the end of the ICO. It will comprise all the BitNautic core functions: ship listing, cargo listing, and the possibility to compare offers and use BTNT to pay for transport and logistics services.     TEAM & ADVISORS   Our incredible Team is working hard to bring this great project to life, guided by our expert Advisors from the Shipping Industry and from the Crypto sector.
