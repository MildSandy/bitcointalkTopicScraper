We expect that in the Crowdsale, our tokens will be purchased to a large extent by funds, private contributors, individual contributors, and individuals who have their own companies and will use our tokens for electricity supply. We expect that the true use of tokens will be when the Crowdsale ends. Then, we expect the token value to grow rapidly because the real users, which are thousands of electricity suppliers and millions of companies, will start purchasing tokens and use them on the platform. It is certain that we already have some contracts that will reflect the entire market. The value of EPC token is connected to the amount of energy traded through the token and is set to grow as the demand for the token grows due to higher volumes in energy trading. Furthermore, the platform users need to have the EPC token before the trade in order to be able to participate in bidding sessions as well as to trade electricity - which leads for higher token demand and value as the user base of the platform grows. Moreover, users have a strong incentive to purchase platform services and pay platform fees with the EPC token, which will also drive the demand. For more information check the token-model on the homepage of our tokensale.EnergyPremier.com website.  best, Your Energy Premier Team .",False
