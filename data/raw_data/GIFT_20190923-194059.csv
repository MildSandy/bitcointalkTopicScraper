Sale on 20th March,"   Hi there,  With regards to why we are using Blockchain: Cryptocurrency platforms are supposed to have lower fees, but they have risen noticeably recently. The Giftcoin approach is to use a shared distributed ledger, rather than a public mining network. This avoids the inefficiencies of public networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum but still provides the possibility of a shared network and the benefits of distributed ledgers. In the early days (MVP and just after) we expect that Giftcoin will operate the whole network, and pay for the infrastructure costs ourselves. After that, we will seek partners from the charity sector, or foundations to share the costs and to operate the network with us.  On the subject of liquidity, most people who participate in the ICO are not buying tokens to give to charity at this stage. Also - we are keeping 25% of the currency back to provide liquidity in the system.  This will be converted into 50% crypto/fiat.  We are looking at a two coin solution where Giftcoin itself is not controlled but donations can be converted to a fiat token for stability.  Funds can be used for donating to charity from October, or sold on an exchange. The purpose of the token is to be able to give to charity with greater transparency.",False
