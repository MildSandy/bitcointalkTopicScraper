About PlayUp :  PlayUp is a fully operational global sports and licensed interactive gambling platform enjoyed by over 250,000 users around the world. We currently employ 17 full-time employees in Sydney, with satellite operations in Hong Kong. Our team is passionate about building the world’s largest community of interactive sports fans- and we are well on our way to doing just that.  PlayUp's ecosystem is undermined by live sports peer to peer pool based challenges, sports betting and traditional gambling offerings. The user experience is uniquely packaged with social interaction, decentralised Blockchain control and community belonging.   What we do:  The PlayUp platform hosts a suite of innovative online daily fantasy sports and sports betting products. Traditional gaming products are also available on PlayUp, ensuring clients are provided with a turnkey solution for their entertainment needs without ever having to leave the PlayUp platform.  Methods of entry or participation will range from free to play, pay by cash and pay by cryptocurrency.  Our model:  PlayUp has implemented a business model based on “freemium” to “Premium” transition. The journey starts with PlayUp attracting the attention of digitally connected sports fans via marketing and promotion. Users enter free-to-play offerings and then are incentivised to transition to pay-to-play services, such as paid entry challenges and wagering.  Compliance:  PlayUp is actively engaged in delivering our products in 4 key territories. We currently operate a gambling license in Australia, a wagering market recognised as one of the most mature and regulated in the world. We apply industry leading practices and systems to deliver consumer protections, including “know-your-customer” (KYC), account verification, underage screening, responsible gambling practices and anti-money laundering (AML) checks.  PlayUp is in the process of acquiring real money gambling and fantasy sports licences in several key territories including the UK, Europe and the USA. As an already licensed operator, we will only need to make marginal adjustments to our existing compliance and operational processes to begin operating in any new jurisdiction.   PlayChip:  With the introduction of the PlayChip (PLA) we will deliver the world’s first fully-integrated and Blockchain enabled global fantasy sports and online sports betting platform for our digitally connected users to connect, compete, bet and win. The creation of the PlayChip token is the first step towards the PlayUp Platform operating with a decentralised blockchain, utilising a global utility token.  We hope you share our vision and our passion to succeed in a Global Arena.  Please feel free to open lines of communication through this Page or furthermore you can email media@playup.com    ",False

With offices across Sydney, London, New York and Hong Kong, PlayUp employs more than three-dozen full-time staff. Daniel Simic is the CEO. Michael Costa is the CTO. They’ve also engaged a seasoned team of advisors spanning the sports and blockchain arenas, which should serve them well. Major League Fantasy Founder Jesse Merl is among the advisors, as well as Echelon One Founder Luke Lombe and IT Consultant Stephane Savanah, among others. Verdict PlayChip has a certain appeal, one whose components sports betters are sure to appreciate, particularly those in the blockchain community. The more deals they can ink, the better their chances for creating a universal sports-betting token. The pre-ICO is currently unfolding, and the public crowdsale is only expected to be a two-day event in August. As a result, if you’re interested in this project, you will have to act quickly to be part of this ICO. Risks     PlayChip says in its white paper: “Changes in the PlayChip valuation may influence the value of winnings and support growth of the PlayChip economy.” Considering the volatility that is inherent in the cryptocurrency market, the PlayChip valuation could indeed influence the value of the winnings in either direction — higher or lower. (-1)     Combining two industries whose very future is dependent on the jurisdictional regulation in place — sports betting and cryptocurrency trading — is a lot like playing with matches. It could either ignite a firestorm or go down in flames. PlayChip points to a recent decision in the U.S. that lets states legalize sports betting. While on the face of it this is a positive development for PlayChip, the ruling is in juxtaposition to the desires of the NFL. (-2.5) Growth Opportunity     Recipient of the “Draper’s Hero Choice Award”, which is the namesake of billionaire venture capitalist and cryptocurrency advocate Tim Draper. The award, which was presented by the San Francisco Blockchain Economic Forum, reflects the ICO with the most promise. +3     A current user base of more than 500,000 across 70 countries. Playchip has also inked partnerships with the likes of Draftstars, ToppBetta, ClassicBet, MadBookie.com.au and PlayUp. $430 million in annual turnover. +4     Listings on the No. 9 cryptocurrency exchange based on trading volume HitBTC and LATOKEN, which is among the top 65 exchanges, scheduled for August 23. +3.5 Disposition We arrive at a score of 7 out of 10 for the PlayChip ICO.

However you clearly didn't read the Token Offering Document which explains how these numbers will be dissected.  Allow me to fill you in a little more to explain this split.  Indeed, 25% of the Tokens will be sold to the public. However - I am absolutely stumped as to where you read that 75% of the money raised is to ""fund costs""?? A quick look at our website would have shown you that we are an existing online gaming ecosystem with no need to do such a thing.  A further 50% will be granted to the operational partners of the PlayChip. This can further be disseminated into ""Platform Growth and Community Development"" (25%), to seed economies and prize pools of platforms within our ecosystem. The PlayChip Bet Float (10%) will be used to manage bets and mitigate risk, and Operational Incentives (15%) will be put towards suppliers, affiliates, founders, advisors, staff and charity. Further explanation on this can be found on page 28 of our Token Offering Document.  All of these PlayChips will be released to the operational partners over a three year period under strict escrow conditions from the PlayChip Foundation, where certain business and user criteria must be met to be granted a further share. Remember also that we have many online gaming platforms seeking to integrate our token, and plan to announce more in the near future.  The final 25% will be reserved for the PlayChip Foundation itself, which is tasked with the future growth of the ecosystem. These tokens will remain under escrow for a minimum of 12 months, and require multiple signatures and conditions to guarantee their release.  I imagine that you are not aware that we are an existing business with seven fully operational platforms ready to integrate the PlayChip, PlayChain, PlayWallet and PlayXchange into their operations. Though we are of course interested in the value of the PlayChip growing over time, that is secondary to our prime objective of growing the PlayChip Ecosystem and thus the utility value of the token. Under no circumstances do we have any interest of ""dumping our share"" or anything of the sort. A brief two minutes of due diligence on your part would have shown our history and experience in the online gaming space, and the lunacy and improbability of us dumping our own currency, ruining not only our credibility but our future business prospects.  Regardless, we have these escrow conditions in place to show to our supporters that we are dedicated to the long term prospects of the PlayChip Ecosystem. The blockchain revolution is only in it's infancy - we seek to become the Universal Gaming Token and remain a major operator in this space for many years to come.",False
