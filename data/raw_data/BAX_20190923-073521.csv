The biggest concern I have is scalability. Ethereum network is capable of doing 15 transactions per second and as a comparison, Visa does about 45,000 per second. With this being said, as more people use Ethereum network, the longer it will take for transactions to go through. And there are many other erc20 tokens and more are being created. So I'm concerend that soon it will be taking hours for transactions to go through (similar to situation with bitcoin right now) and people will not like this and therefore will not use BABB as it is an erc20 token and uses Ethereum network. Of course, Etheruem is working on scalability issues, but it's not certain how it all will work out and I hate to think that BABB success depends on Ethereum.

Regarding the BOE banking licence: From submitting the application it can take up to 12 months to obtain the full licence but we’re aiming to make it in 9 months  2. Launching the product will drive new demand for BAX and therefore we will supply the market. BABB thinks it makes sense to release a second tranche of tokens once the platform is live and BAX is of practical use, rather than selling them all now. There would be another 10bil BAX for sale to users.  There may be a gradual release into the market of the additonal tokens (at market price): if appropriate and there is enough demand (which should not affect market price).  These are the conditions for the second phase of the token sale:  This won't happen until BABB will deliver: a) a banking licence b) at least one international partnership with a bank c) a working product  Here is a short video about this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpeiUS2YzjE  You can join the BABB discussion here: https://t.me/babb_official",False

I've only been trading for a year and I've had a good time, I've won and I've lost, at first it's just that, but little by little I've started to like the blockchain more than the exchange. Most cryptocurrencies are worth only for that, for the exchange, it is a reality and the utility a joke. But it's fine, speculating is fine, but I think that's going to end. We need useful coins that demonstrate the value of the block chain. I have been looking for a serious, cheap and exciting money for a few months now, BAX believe that it fulfills all that and if they do what they promise they will grow a lot, in the long term I hope, the fast uploads do not usually bring anything good. I prefer more development and evolution of the project than more exchanges, because in the end the exchanges are the big lie of the coins. I hope it takes a long time to enter the big exchanges, or at least to enter with the ""duties"" performed, if not its price is set as fast as it will fall. Enter binance (One of the worst diseases of the cryptocurrencies) will be wonderful but I assure you that if the project is not a reality I will wait for it to double its price and then I will go, maybe come back when, surely, collapse or maybe leave for good . I encourage the team to do their job and forget the exchanges for the moment, bet on the utility before the exchange will bring, in the long term much better things. And a lot of information! No less than a daily Tweet, even if it is to say hello, investors feel quickly abandoned, and losing confidence is much worse than a price collapse.",False

I obviously have not wondered how they can do it and how they can get it. Another important issue is the market cap. They have to be collecting 1 to 3 times where other bank projects collect (proportionately) make themselves less risky. As a result, an iconun that collects $ 20m will have a market cap of $ 40m, which is 2x for investors, while an iconic $ 40m buyer is half the money.

Through the BABB app, you can connect instantly with all other account holders and participate in peer-to-peer financial services. Lend to and borrow from one another; exchange currencies; and deposit and withdraw cash, all via self-executing smart contracts.  With withdrawing and depositing physical cash from your BABB account, you will use a peer-to-peer system of ‘human’ ATMs. People who want to withdraw cash and people who want to deposit cash can meet using the app and exchange the cash between them. But it depends on where you are. Example: if you are in the middle of the desert, of course, nobody will available, if you are in London city center you must find someone who’s willing to meet face to face and cash out for you at an extra fee. Please note that P2p cash in and out is decentralized, people that participate in this mechanism will earn money. Alternatively, you can transfer to your existing Bank card and cash out from any ATM.

At first glance it just sounds like insane over-pricing, but the reasons behind this are valid, and actually pretty sad to hear.  After near total economic collapse in 2008 with their currency experiencing 11.2 million percent hyperinflation and fears of it happening again, the government has taking a ""full control"" stance on everything financial, even locking their citizens out from using any credit card transactions.  This has sent people flocking to bitcoin for financial security, all while at the same time fears of new rounds of hyperinflation circulate.  In other words - after being locked out from Visa and Mastercard, and a government providing totally untrustworthy paper FIAT cash that could become worthless at any time, Bitcoin is a shining beacon of hope.  A similar dynamic is happening in Venezuela, it's being called ""Bitcoinization"" - basically, when a government screws up so badly, people stop looking towards them all together and turn to the blockchain to provide the oversight their government isn't.  Just a couple weeks ago, we covered a story where the government of Venezuela even began blaming Bitcoin miners for city wide power outages, as the popularity of cryptocurrency grows while the value of their dollar declines.  In a surprising twist - this has made actual daily use of cryptocurrency common in countries like Venezuela, buying a beer at a bar or even paying for a doctors appointment in bitcoin is part of daily life there now.  And it shows in their transaction volume - this time last year about $200,000 week was being spent within Venezuela - that number is now at $2,100,00!   Surprisingly, some 3rd world countries have even gotton creative, creating what is basically cryptocurrency out of other digital assets like cell phone minutes. In poor nations where cell phones function on pre-paid minutes, want a gallon of milk? You can pay for that by transferring 60 minutes of cell phone time from your account to the sellers.  In developed nations while we're experiencing a battle and endless debates over crypto VS fiat - these underdeveloped nations are ready to make the switch now.  That's where crypto companies like BABB (GetBABB.com) are stepping in, reaching out to the 2+ billion who have access to a phone, but unreliable, or no banking at all.  BABB however is taking things up a notch from simply allowing the sending and receiving of cryptocurrency - they're turning the user into a bank themselves, and are giving the ability to have friends, family, neighbors open accounts in their new virtual bank - and even issue them cards.  We've seen examples of this before, where nations skip entire portions of usual development.  In 3rd world countries where cell phones are common - land lines are not.  Corporations never came in and built the infrastructure needed for land lines - but cell phone companies did come in and put up towers.  The same could happen with banking and cryptocurrencies.  These nations may never see a physical bank built in their city - but soon may have fully functional banking on their phones - thanks to the blockchain.  http://www.globalcryptopress.com/2017/12/how-blockchain-will-be-link-between.html",False

Payments can take place between any parties on the BABB app - merchants need only a BABB account to receive instant payment from customers. In practice, you can exchange crypto on the BABB platform and spend it, similar to how you’d use a TenX card or Tokencard. exchange that follows regulation can choose to accept GBP easily, similar to how they integrate cryptocurrencies.  Visa/MC have dominance in the first world. There are many countries who have skipped the 3rd generation of payment methods and are ready for us. We are indirectly competing with them since we are taking part of the cake which they are not tackling at all... in fact, it’s another cake all together.

Register here: https://getbabb.com/  hello, do you know how much is their hard cap for the pre sale? and most importantly, what is the soft cap? IF the hard cap will not be able to meet.   Phase 1: 20 million USD Once we deliver a fully working product and banking license, we expect the demand for BAX to increase significantly, and we will release an additional 10 billion BAX tokens to meet that demand, either as another token sale round, or via our mobile app. This will happen no sooner than Q3 2019   Wait, im confused. Whats that 20m usd for? Is that for pre sale ONLY? cause you are about yo start the pre sale, right? So im asking as of now the soft and the hard cap of the pre sale.  What's what is hoping to get raised on the first pre-sale and public sale. The caps for the pre-sale and public sale are combined I believe. I will clarify with the team.  please do mate. because i really wanted to know the more specific details for the pre sale. cause i am seeing this to have a good potential. Maybe 20m usd is the soft cap of their project and i also want to know the hardcap of this project and when is the exact date of presale?  The HARD CAP for PHASE 1 is $20 million. The pre-sale opens on January 15.  You can join us on Telegram, we have a good community on there: https://t.me/babb_official  hi, thanks for the clarification.. now i wanted to know if how many pahses do they have for the ico? because you said 20m is the hard cap for phase 1. meaning there will still be phase 2 right?  Recent changes in the ICO market have given us cause to reflect. We want to define the structure of the token sale based on a more frugal approach and a desire to hold ourselves accountable to token buyers. We have decided to split our token sale into two phases, with the second phase contingent on the completion of certain deliverables.This will be no earlier than 2019 This approach maximises value for early participants, links the release of tokens to the app use and token utility, and holds us to account for developing the tech, obtaining a banking license and securing internal partnerships.",False

Announcing: the accountable token sale. The pre-sale will begin on 15th January, and the whitelist will be open soon.  Recent changes in the ICO market have given us cause to reflect. We want to define the structure of the token sale based on a more frugal approach and a desire to hold ourselves accountable to token buyers. We have decided to split our token sale into two phases, with the second phase contingent on the completion of certain deliverables.  This approach maximises value for early participants, links the release of tokens to the app use and token utility, and holds us to account for developing the tech, obtaining a banking license and securing internal partnerships.

First of all, this project is aiming to serve everyone. I think it will be most beneficial for people who can't open a bank account for several reasons like: Difﬁcult physical access to branches/technological access to online banking, Over-reliance on cash, (particularly in emerging markets), Customers do not have enough savings or cash ﬂow to beneﬁt from an account. And other clients who wish to manage their bank account on their own (""be the bank"") with utmost privacy.  Anyway, i recommend you to read the white paper of this project.

Whether banks do it or not has to do with their own risk policies and their costs for validating your information. - We do not expect to institute any minimum deposit balance. - We do not expect there will be any maintenance fee for ordinary accounts, although we reserve the right to assess that for accounts above a certain amount. - As a UK Bank, we will be able to offer protection to our customers deposits under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). - But more importantly, we run a full reserve, we don't lend out our customers' money, so we are not subject to risks from running a fractional reserve like other banks do. - Regarding ability to open bank account - there are limits of course. If all we have is your name and photo and no ID, there are limitations on the amount held and transacted. But we CAN open the account within those limits.",False
