Green Energy – Green Mining,"We have equipped and launched the first mining container of our own assembly. The container is designed to operate on wind energy, which is its unique feature.  The specificity of operation of wind turbines is that in the absence of the wind or if its speed decreases, energy generation either stops or its volume declines. In case a wind power station suspends generation due to weather conditions, all connected electricity consumers switch to power supply from a public grid. Production costs rise, and mining profitability is reduced as a result. In addition, the electricity on the public grid originates from different sources, and fossil energy makes up its significant share.  Since our policy is to utilize renewable energy for mining, we have developed a special container where the operation of miners is adjusted depending on current wind conditions.  This container is controlled through a controller that automatically turns off and connects miner groups with the power consumption of 12 kW as the energy generation increases or decreases. Thus, minimizing electricity consumption from the public network, we do our utmost to ensure that mining is carried out with the use of electricity produced by our wind stations.  On the market, we will be offering 20 and 40-foot cryptocurrency mining containers allowing to host Antminer S9, S11, S15, S17, and other ASIC models, and designed to use energy from wind generators with a capacity of 200 kW – 1MW. On the territory of our wind park, in turn, we plan to install such containers next to each wind turbine.          ",False

Green Energy – Green Mining,"[ANN] [WEMcoin] Wind Energy Mining. Green Energy – Green Mining.   It is hard to imagine what we would do without electricity - it supports almost all processes necessary for normal life. However, the electricity production has its negative effects.  The use of fossil energy resources results in rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere that becomes the cause of the greenhouse effect, and subsequently, climate change. Electrical power consumption is steadily growing, new kinds of consumption appear, and cryptocurrency mining has more recently become one of such kind. Mining consumes an enormous amount of electricity that can be compared with the consumption of individual countries. This particular issue has become one of the reasons for restrictions imposed on the cryptocurrency mining.  There is no doubt that we need to re-evaluate our attitude towards the production and use of electricity. The transition to renewable energy sources is the only possible solution.  At the same time, the electricity producers face reluctance of bureaucratic entities and political elites, closely related to oil and gas monopolies, to support green production. The possibilities of producers are limited by the energy regulating bodies, new unreasonable requirements are introduced, and the production becomes impossible in principle.  Our company, ETB Ltd., has been dealing with wind electric energy production in Latvia for more than 10 years The company owns 7 wind-driven electric power stations with total capacity of 4.5 MW. The geographical location of our wind power stations lets produce electricity throughout the year.  As a solution of the issues, we consider creating a model in which renewable electricity is used for cryptocurrency mining, and the proceeds from the cryptocurrency sale are invested in the development of green electricity production. This model will let explore the possibility of effective green power production without state aid. The transition to such a funding model would improve the possibilities of producers and become an incentive for the creation of a new, blockchain-based, electricity trade system.  The combination of mining and electricity production has an additional advantage. Electrical energy demand within 24 hours is uneven: there are peak demand hours, and there are hours when the demand is low, but production remains the same. Electricity accumulation might resolve the problem. However, by now, it is technically impossible to accumulate a great amount of electrical power in order to provide it to the grid later, because there are no sufficiently large, inexpensive, high-performance accumulators that would perform the task and would not affect the electricity price. The alternative is either to reduce production or to create artificial energy consuming facilities. Consuming electrical power at the time when it is not used, mining rigs can effectively serve as such facilities. The imbalance between the demand for and supply is thus regulated through mining, which eventually has a beneficial effect on the electrical grid.  Within the project, we plan to increase the capacity of our renewable resource park and install containers with GPU and ASIC units next to each wind power station. The obtained cryptocurrency (BTC, LTC, ETH, Zcash, Dash etc.) will subsequently be sold at an exchange, and provide funding for the further development of the project.  We also offer those wishing to an opportunity to install their own mining rigs on the territory of our wind park, and to use green electricity directly from its producer.

Token sale start on March 20, 2018  PROJECT UPDATE PAGE 6  How often do we think what we and our children breath in? Do we think what electricity is made of when we turn on the kettle in the morning, or why it snows where it shouldn’t be any snow? Crypto currency mining consumes a huge amount of electricity, at production of which mainly fossil sources – gas, coal -  are used. This particular issue has become one of the reasons for restrictions imposed on the mining of crypto-currency. The only way to solve this problem is to develop and increase the production of alternative energy  Unfortunately, the green electricity producers often face reluctance of bureaucratic entities and political elites, closely related to oil and gas monopolies, to support such production. Moreover, producers face deliberate intention to impede their development. The possibilities of the producers are limited by the bodies regulating energy sector, new unreasonable requirements are introduced, and the production becomes impossible in principle. In such circumstances, the payback problem is thrown into sharp relief. The possibility to build new green power stations is doubtful, because the political and bureaucratic obstacles connected with oil and gas sector lobbying, limit the freedom of actions of the industry willing to develop green energy production.  The Wind Energy Mining project aims to circumvent these obstacles.  Our company has been dealing with wind electric energy production in Latvia for more than 10 years The company owns 7 wind-driven electric power stations with total capacity of 4.5 MW. The geographical location of our wind power stations lets produce electricity throughout the year. We are going to use our electric energy for mining for cryptocurrencies and to allocate the proceeds from mining to the development of production and new power stations construction.   ICO OBJECTIVE AND DETAILS ICO objective is fundraising for the further development of wind energy production, through an Ethereum based token issue. WEM tokens are debt tokens WEM price – 0.001 ETH Accepted currency – Ethereum Buyback price – 0.0015 ETH   Whitepaper https://etb.lv/pdf/Whitepaper_Wind_Energy_Mining_(en).pdf  ICO launch: March 20, 2018  Buyback start: in 9 months after the ICO and fund raising Buyback period: 2 years Detailed information on our token, possibilities of buying, and buyback you can find on our homepage www.etb.lv  PROJECT DESCRIPTION Purchase of mining equipment Increasing the capacity of the wind park and its supplement by solar power stations Use of renewable electric energy for cryptocurrency mining Cryptocurrency selling – return of investments and further development of the project  ALLOCATION OF TOKENS 90% - ICO participants  5% - the team  5% - bonus program  ALLOCATION OF ICO FUNDS 28% - purchase of 1,000 ASIC Innosilicon A6 LTC or 2,000 Antminer L3+ and 1,000 Antminer S9 12% - purchase of GPU equipment (6,000 GPU Radeon VEGA 64) 15% - construction of solar power stations with total installed capacity of 2 MW 15% - project implementation costs (construction, electric installation) 30% - modernization and increasing the capacity of the wind park  RELIABILITY OF INVESTMENTS * Existing wind park – guaranteed electric energy for mining * Long-term operational experience * Transparency of the project – all information is available on our website If the planned amount is not raised (or bigger amount is raised), the project costs will be reduced or increased proportionally according to the amount of raised funds. The project will be started within the available amount.
