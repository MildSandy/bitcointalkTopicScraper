RadJav General purpose programming language and Decentralized Datacenter, bringing apps and dapps together  Website | Whitepaper | Video | Roadmap | FAQ | GitHub | Join Our Slack Channel  What’s RadJav? RadJav is not just another blockchain technology, RadJav is a general purpose JavaScript programming language and Decentralized Blockchain Datacenter. It is designed for creating apps and dapps as quickly as possible. It is currently available for Windows, and HTML5. Linux and Mac will be supported sometime in August 2017. Android, iOS, and Windows Universal App support will come in future versions. RadJav allows developers to rapidly create and deploy GUI, server applications, make blockchain transactions, and execute decentralized applications. Dapp, side-chains, custom tokens, and smart contract support is coming in the future. Currently, GUI and 3D Engine applications run with nearly the same performance and look across all platforms. There’s 4 main sections to RadJav: GUI       Currently supported          Create desktop and HTML5 applications using the same code. Custom themes, this is only available in the HTML5 version currently. Desktop support should be coming later 2017.                Supported features coming soon          Create responsive native desktop and mobile applications using the same code. Think of this as Bootstrap and jQuery coming to native desktop applications.             3D Engine       Coming soon in August 2017. Quickly create video games or simulations that run on multiple platforms.    Server       Supported features coming soon          HTTP/HTTPS Web Server and client support. It can currently make HTTP/HTTPS GET requests. Web socket server and web socket client functionality. Raw TCP/UDP socket communications over IPv4 and IPv6. Light database to be added. WebSocket Server/Database hybrid allowing GUI objects to be updated as the database is updated.             Decentralized Blockchain Datacenter       Blockchain V1             Currently supported                Securely mine and transfer XRJ coins over a blockchain, it is a slightly customized version of Bitcoin.                         Blockchain V2             Will give developers the ability to create smart contracts, sidechains, and their own coins.          Blockchain V3             A decentralized datacenter where mining is completed by the amount of time the application has been running for, the amount of storage that has been used, and the amount of bandwidth used. Detailed roadmap will come Q3 2017.              Is this an ICO? Why yes it is, we want RadJav to be a community driven project, and we need help raising funds so we can hire people to help develop this programming language and blockchain.  The date of the Pre-ICO and ICO will be announced at a later time.  Introductory Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYv45mGwUQo  GitHub Repository RadJav 0.11 has been released, you can run a blockchain node or try your hand coding at: https://github.com/HigherEdgeSoftware/RadJav/releases  Javascript API Reference http://www.radjav.com/en_us/api-reference/  Slack Come join our public Slack channel at radjav.slack.com or be automatically invited using: https://radjav-slack-invite.herokuapp.com/  FAQ https://github.com/HigherEdgeSoftware/RadJav/wiki/FAQ  How do I start mining Blockchain V1 (XRJV1)? Do not start mining yet, we are releasing a new version that will be on a different chain soon.  Where do I view the block explorer for Blockchain V1 (XRJV1)? You can view it at http://xrjv1explorer.radjav.com/  RadJav Blockchain V1 (XRJV1) Specifications Premined coins: 110,000,000 Developer’s Premined Coins Share: 20,000,000 Pre-ICO Coins available for purchase: 9,000,000 ICO Coins available for purchase: 60,000,000 Number of XRJ distributed per block: 16 Block Time: 3 minutes Ticker Symbol: XRJ Mining Algorithm: SHA-256 Max coins: 21,000,000,000 Uses Bitcoin’s tried and tested source code, including CSV and Segwit activated by default The following BIPs are activated: Bip34, Bip65, Bip66, Bip68, Bip112, Bip113, Bip141, Bip143, Bip147 Currently built straight into the programming language, separate Linux nodes are available.  RadJav Blockchain V2 (XRJV2) Would allow developers to create their own smart contracts for the network to execute. Eventually will give developers the ability to create a sidechain along with their own coins/tokens.  RadJav Blockchain V3 (XRJV3) Each computer has the option to host RadJav applications. Computers hosting RadJav applications would earn coins from the application being ran. These computers would be known as “nodes”. Every application would have an address associated with it, that would deduct funds while the application is in use. All storage and memory associated with the application will be encrypted. A system must be developed where hostile applications or applications hosting illegal activities can be reported and removed. Same for any hostile nodes. Once in place, I would like to eliminate all coin transfer fees, and have nodes earn coins from hosting RadJav applications only. We are open to all suggestions.  Who's Running the Show? Higher Edge Software, LLC    Nathanael Coonrod – Managing Member and Lead Developer     Isn’t this a large project? Why yes, it is! Thanks for noticing! In all reality, it’s not that large, it uses existing open source developer kits to help speed up development. As of right now it uses a few too many, so I’d like to try and cut down on that significantly. The most noticeable kits I’d like to get rid of would be: Dojo       This will be removed as soon as possible, as it causes way too many issues, and is far too large in file size and number of files.    wxWidgets       This may or may not remain in the project, depends on how many people I’m able to hire.    Ogre 3D       Again, this may or may not remain in the project.    cURL       This will be removed in the future.    Bitcoin Source Code       Obviously when Blockchain V2 arrives, the Bitcoin source code will be completely removed. This is when RadJav WILL hard fork.     How will the money from the ICO be used? The money will be used pretty much entirely on just hiring people, maintaining their salary, and creating marketing materials. Should we be lucky enough to get enough funding, we will also try to attend Blockchain related conventions and presentations.  How will coins from the ICO be distributed? You can purchase coins directly through the Higher Edge Software website, can pay using either Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, or numerous different cryptocurrencies. Once you purchase your coins, you can either have them stored using our online wallet, or have them transferred to your personal wallet on your machine. We will strongly encourage exchanges NOT to allowing trading until the ICO is complete.   What happens to the ICO coins that are not sold during the 30 day ICO? They will be locked in multi-signature account with a public address for everyone to see, and offered for sale again February 8th 2018.  Note for Developers Please keep in mind RadJav is still under major development, so many parts of the API will change heavily.  Website https://www.radjav.com/",False

That feels high to me. Your ideas and plans certainly sound impressive (I'm not a developer) but not much is built so far. And projects with targets over $10 million tend to have a lot more disclosure on their website (ex: who the team is), a whitepaper of varying sophistication, and a clearly outlined token sale. There would probably be some sort of marketing effort as well. If you were targeting $10 million max, or even less, I would be very interested.  Perhaps you can share your track record with us.

I thought it would've been weird to have a single page dedicated to me. I guess I could have it be about the company too. I started the company in 2006, and it's been mostly a services oriented company, creating custom software and websites. I started RadJav in 2013 when it went by the name RadXML but I didn't like how it turned out. So I tore it all down, made it a lot more flexible and turned it into RadJav.  Unfortunately I've had no one to refer to about launching an ICO, only the few articles I've been able to find on the internet; and I apologize for that, as I've made several mistakes so far. Funny thing is, I didn't think having a white paper was all that important. Turns out I was pretty wrong about that. And as for marketing, I have a marketing budget of around $700 USD, so I'm using it as wisely as I possibly can.  Ultimately this is a community project, if you guys want a page detailing the employee of the company, I'll do it. If you guys think the prices are too high, that's fine, I'll lower them. What you say makes sense based off what you're saying. Since there haven't been any sales so far, now is a good time to do so.  I've changed the pricing to reflect more of what you're talking about. Here's the new pricing, and this one won't be changing:               XRJ Coin Pack Cost                  Number of Coins in a Pack           $1 USD  / 0.000425 BTC / 0.005055 ETH                  6 XRJ          $10 USD / 0.004248 BTC /  0.050553 ETH               65 XRJ          $50 USD / 0.021242 BTC /  0.252766 ETH             350 XRJ         $100 USD / 0.042483 BTC /  0.505533 ETH            750 XRJ         $250 USD / 0.106209 BTC /  1.263832 ETH         2,000 XRJ         $500 USD / 0.212417 BTC /  2.527664 ETH         4,250 XRJ      $1,000 USD / 0.424834 BTC /  5.055327 ETH         9,000 XRJ      $1,500 USD / 0.637251 BTC /  7.582991 ETH        14,000 XRJ     $2,500 USD / 1.062085 BTC / 12.638318 ETH        30,000 XRJ                                                               1 BTC        32,500 XRJ  Let me know if you have any additional suggestions on anything else I can do better.
