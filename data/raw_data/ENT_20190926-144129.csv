That seems, that first of all, our tokens are necessary for becoming our Member.  ONLY our Members, whether they are small or large investors, can participate in ICO Presale events, and be awarded up to 60% discount, furthermore, the mandatory minimal EVENT tokens ownership, preserves the right to access Presale events. Access is enabled as long as this amount is maintained or restored. The initial purchase of EVENT tokens has a significantly higher value considering the benefits it enables, such as pre–screenings, networking, early bird access, and highly discounted tokens price for ICO’s.  Our EVENT tokens [our ENTs] will give you such benefits as: (1) access to early exclusive ICO Presale events [you will have access to the most prominent startups’ Pre–ICOs];  (2) significant and exclusive discounts on issued tokens [we are giving our Members the unique opportunities to receive the future startups’ tokens with the significant discounts (up to 60%)];  (3) a lower risk of investing in fraudulent startups [as we represent on our platform only those projects which were validated through the multistage hybrid–screening process we leverage the risks of investing in fraudulent startups. Several factors have combined to make these ICO scams so common. The fact that Blockchain isn’t yet well enough established for most people to understand how it works and what it can or can’t do. That makes it easy to deceive investors. At Presale Ventures, we’re tackling this huge problem by our unique and smart ecosystem. We keep our members safe due to our multidimensional filtering system. It rejects the ICOs who are either scams or have no real future and promote the best ones. PreSale Ventures ensure a brighter future for its members, the best startups and the technology underlying it.];  (4) access to the most current information database, discussions and news.  To conclude all the above–written, we represent the opportunities for making the investments in the most prominent startups and leveraging the risks of investing in the fraudulent projects. Enjoy up to 60% discounts on the future ICO tokens issued by qualified startups. Our tokens will give members early access and heavy discounts for other currencies. The platform will also provide a filter for the best new cryptocurrency offerings, using algorithms and the wisdom of the crowd to identify and support those most likely to succeed.   By the way, you can also glance through our BOUNTY PROGRAM. We allocated up to $1,000,000 USD To Our Bounty program and it runs until the total allocated amount of EVENT tokens is exhausted. Our Bounty Program is designed to help you take your first step inside our ecosystem while enjoying free EVENT Tokens: bonus.presale.ventures  Kind Regards, Presale.Ventures",False

If you don’t think it is useful for you, surely, you can continue (and YOU ARE FREE to CONTINUE) investing on your own. First, probably, with regular terms, without any discounts/bonuses (in our case during ICO you could make up to x2. And second, investing on your own is also wonderful, but you should have the exceptional analytical skills to analyze the probability of the startup’s (or, if you are investing in several projects, then …the probability of the startups’) success. Undoubtedly, the choice is always yours. You are the only person who choses your fortune. Here we can just make the only remark to show you our argumentative position: we believe that you will receive much more profit with us because basically our business conception, implemented in our business strategy, consists of three constituents: (1) we reveal and eliminate any scam projects. In other words, with us you would have better and faster ROI; (2) we represent on our platform only those projects which were validated through the multistage hybrid–screening process;(3) we are giving our Members the unique opportunities to receive the future startups’ tokens with the significant discounts (up to 60%). We are implementing these exclusion/inclusion criteria as the primary standard for choosing the most prominent projects among all projects.  Concerning “not successful” project, these words don’t have the argumentative basis. Success always represents itself through the timeline. Everything needs time, you should understand that. Currently, we would like to say that there will be certain rules as with usual venture fund, thus we believe your funds would be much safer.  Presale.Ventures",False

We are implementing these exclusion/inclusion criteria as the primary standard for choosing the most prominent projects among all projects.   Let me start answering them from the last one as it would be the most accurate logical representation of the information you are interested in.  (3) Do I understand correctly that the sale will last a month? Currently we are under the Private Presale stage. It will be closed [or completed] on May 31. After that our IMO [Initial Member Offering] stage starts (the ICO). The exact timeline of our ICO (the last date will be announced and represented on our website: https://presale.ventures/, there we have the VIRTUAL TIME CALENDAR-CALCULATOR, an amazing virtual device) and it counts the exact time. At present, it shows how much time you have until the Public Presale stage would be closed and after the May 31 it will represent the TIMELINE for our IMO [ICO].   (2) Can I buy them for Bitcoins? We accept ETH. If you have ETH, you can purchase our EVENT tokens [ENT]. If you have only BTC, you should change some of BTC through cryptocurrency exchange for ETH (glance through the current exchange rates BTC/ETH to choose the best ones).  (3) What exactly can I do with these tokens? Our EVENT tokens [ENT] are exclusively designed for being used on our platform by our Members. That seems, that first of all, our tokens are necessary for becoming our Member.  ONLY our Members, whether they are small or large investors, can participate in ICO Presale events, and be awarded up to 60% discount, furthermore, the mandatory minimal EVENT tokens ownership, preserves the right to access Presale events. Access is enabled as long as this amount is maintained or restored. The initial purchase of EVENT tokens has a significantly higher value considering the benefits it enables, such as pre–screenings, networking, early bird access, and highly discounted tokens price for ICO’s.  Our EVENT tokens [our ENTs] will give you such benefits as: (1) access to early exclusive ICO Presale events [you will have access to the most prominent startups’ Pre–ICOs];  (2) significant and exclusive discounts on issued tokens [we are giving our Members the unique opportunities to receive the future startups’ tokens with the significant discounts (up to 60%)];  (3) a lower risk of investing in fraudulent startups [as we represent on our platform only those projects which were validated through the multistage hybrid–screening process we leverage the risks of investing in fraudulent startups.
