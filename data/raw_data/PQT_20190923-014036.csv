We are creating something greater – a symbol and the state of the art for architecture, as well as a unique center of entertainment and recreation.  🐟The concept  is clear. From outside, the size of the aquarium will be only partially comprehendible. The viewers will only see the rift in the crust of the earth. Yet, inside this rift, wonders will happen. The rift will be entirely filled with water, and inhabited by creatures of rivers, lakes, and the ocean.  🐟We will openly show every step of the project, every dollar made and spent. We will invest the earnings into a grand social project that gives back something special to the people.  🐟It continues with the goal of transmitting the feeling that our capitalistic society of consumers, information, communication, and countless organizations is something more than just the life of bigger and smaller fish, joined together in the fragile bubble of our aquarium.   https://ico.paquarium.com/ https://www.facebook.com/PAquariumCOM/ https://twitter.com/PAquariumCOM/ https://www.instagram.com/paquariumcom/  Your PAquarium Team",False
