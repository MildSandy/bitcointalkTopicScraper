We're actually interested in criticism and negative comments as much as we are the positive. It allows us to assess the project and roll out improvements where we can.  Yes I agree there are a few similar projects and yes some have a few known ambassadors. I'd be interested to see what projects you think have a bigger foot print in the music industry than we do. We presently have massive and established relationships with big DJ's, Producers and Record Labels in the UK, USA, Spain and Italy as well as various other countries. We're a long way passed brand ambassadors but more on the basis of signed up partners working very closely with us. Certainly haven't seen any projects developed this far and would be interested in seeing the ones you feel are similar.  As for a normal clone. Can't really agree with this. It took many months work on the blockchain to get it coded and ready for our needs, sure it has a base code that we used but the majority of cryptos also follow that too and in fact many don't even have their own chain and are simply tokens sat on another chain.  As for the platform... We have the most comprehensive list of platform facilities of any music blockchain based solution. We're definitely planning a lot more than just online radio. Again, we're very interested in seeing any projects that are looking to roll out a more comprehensive platform than we are but having looked at all the other major music based platforms we can't find one.

Since the launch, the Muusic project has gained some enormous traction within the music industry with DJs, Producers, Artists and Record Labels all queuing up to get involved.  We have always been keen to hear the feedback from our friends in the music industry and one of the regular comments we have received is “What’s this new platform going to look like?” — Based on our roadmap development of the new Muusic Platform is set to begin in January 2019.  The Muusic Project is pleased to announce that we have absolutely smashed our roadmap and the beginnings of the new Muusic Platform which can be found at https://muusic.io is now live.  Please note this is very much in BETA and the majority of proposed functions are still to be added and developed for the site. This will include the following:      Online Radio Service     DJ Mix Hosting     Audio Hosting     Live Streaming — to include Video and Audio feeds     Amazing new online music marketplace with very low fees (We’re proposing 20% which will be one of the lowest in the industry, if not the lowest)     Muusic TV     Muusic FM (To also include all our global sites such as muusic.es and muusic.us)     Payments in Muusic Coin and also USD,GBP,Paypal and other Crypto     Built in Muusic Coin reward system for DJ’s, Producers, Users and Listeners     Full Design overhaul based on feedback from our communities  So, please sign up and grab your user name and get prepared for the amazing stuff that’s soon to come. At the moment, you can get involved on the platform with posts, photos, audio files, event listings and user profiles.  This is the backbone of everything that will come and be incorporated into the Muusic Platform, if you have any feedback, suggestions or anything please do not hesitate to get in contact with us. This platform is for the world of music and we’re committed in bringing to the industry exactly what people need.  Muusic Coin Use Case and Track/Album Sales  Muusic Coin will be an integral part of The Muusic Platform bringing many benefits to both the DJ’s and artists along with the regular users.  Track and Album sales will soon be enabled on the new platform and we’re pleased to be offering one of the lowest rates in the Industry set at just 20% leaving 80% of all sales going to the artist (The way it should be!!!) This will apply to all payments made in regular currencies, paypal and crypto. This will not apply to purchases made in Muusic Coin.  As what must be an industry first, we are pleased to announce that any music purchases made using Muusic Coin will both benefit the Artists and also the regular users as the Muusic Project will NOT charge a fee on this purchases.  For all purchases made using Muusic Coin the Artist will receive 90% of the revenue and the remaining 10% will be discounted off the price of the track or album thus providing a saving to the user buying that music.  On top of all of this, once the streaming services, full mix hosting services and full audio hosting services go live we will be assessing the revenue generation from these and ensuring a big share of revenue also goes back to the artists.  All of this is in addition to the Muusic Coin reward system that will be part of the platform ensuring both DJ’s, Producers and Artists plus the Regular Users earn rewards in Muusic Coin for actions performed on the platform.  All together this has been an amazing journey so far for the Muusic Project.  Keep a look out for things to come. This is going to be epic!!!!

The licensing and copyrighting for this project spans various elements of the upcoming platform so I'll try and detail this as much as possible:  1) Radio, Streaming etc - This will be covered by the relevant broadcast and online streaming licensing. 2) Track Uploads - we will be working directly with the producers and copyright holders in this respect and they will have the ability to upload tracks that they hold the copyright for  A large number of our relationships and partnerships are direct with the artists and copyright holders, making this much easier to take care of.

Some more info about our project, hopefully this will answer some of your queries.  We already have a radio platform up and running. This is almost 2 years old - muusic.fm (please note we are in the middle of a full schedule update which will be complete in a few days)  We have very strong relationships with major DJ's, producers, record labels and other music non blockchain based platforms. Our CEO has owned and also run a number of major labels in the past along with producing music including gold disk singles, music writing in conjunction with some major artists. In comparison to other music based blockchain projects we are certainly much further ahead musically in this respect and on a more equal basis with emerging artists.  As for partnering with other blockchain projects... We are certainly happy to work with anyone interested in the music industry but not sure what benefit other blockchain projects could be to us. However we are happy to work with anyone or any project that shares a similar vision.  As for rolling out the facilities noted in the OP or whitepaper. Musically we have all the arrangements, connections and partnerships already in place for this or well in motion. On top of that we already have the beginnings of the Muusic Platform V2.0 coded. Following the crowd sale we just need to move on the to the final stages of coding the new platform and incorporating the new platform functions and then begin the roll out.  Hope that helps but please do let us know if there is anything else we can expand on or clarify for you.",False

We're in the middle of a new website design and this will be detailed more specifically once complete (a few days away now) but I'll summarise briefly for you.  The majority of funds raised will be used for the final stages of the new platform development which will include the massive roll out of additional facilities on the new platform. A lot of the front end coding is complete now but the back end stuff requires a lot more work and some additional developers to finish off.  Another big area will be managing the complex licensing required to roll out all of this correctly. One part being correct licensing for live streams. Unlike facebook, we dont plan on having DJ's steams taken down due to in adequate licensing.  Other than that, some funds will be used for an almighty sever to host the platform and finally exchange listings.  The point is we want a fully funded platform that does not need to rely on an external income to survive. This will in turn allow us to provide more to the users at zero cost to them. I'll link the new website this week that will provide more specific detail on this.",False

We're also looking at increasing this further but more details on that later as the specifics are not quite agreed yet.  - Yes, absolutely, we're planning FIAT, Muusic Coin and various other major cryptos as payment methods on the site, this is one of the easier and cheaper things to implement so already part of the over all plan.",False
