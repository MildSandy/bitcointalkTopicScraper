A: In the last 2 week's we attended Mobi in Munich at BMW's head quarters. Participants from Renault, Ford, Bosch. We also presented what we're doing to the Mobi community - slides here: https://www.slideshare.net/gverdian/quant-overledger-for-mobility-iot-and-automotive-sector-mobi-20190220-v1 Colin and Gerald also presented at the British Computer Society last week in Leeds on blockchain, interoperability and Overledger. I attended a roundtable at Nesta - on how to help foster adoption with the appropriate ecosystem, regulation and support. We also met with Oracle as we tweeted at their office plus had a lot of client meetings and calls. One thing we've done recently for the FCA is apply with a partner in Australia for the GFIN call for cross border innovation.

This includes so much!  #QUANT is helping bring trust back into our business world.  The Quant technology solutions help businesses and users take full advantage of blockchain technology with a little as pain as possible. Quant technologies help organisations safely and seamlessly take full advantage of blockchain technology. Overledger is the world’s first blockchain operating system (OS) that not only connects blockchains to one another but also connects existing networks to blockchain and facilitates the creation of internet scale multi-chain applications otherwise known as MApps. That is pretty cool right? The Quant team think so, and what a high calibre team of tech experts they have!  Core Tech/Components:  1. Overledger is the world’s first blockchain operating system (OS) that not only connects blockchains to one another but also connects existing networks to blockchain and facilitates the creation of internet scale multi-chain applications otherwise known as MApps.  2. Quant Networks solutions help healthcare organisations by limiting the complexity of adopting blockchain technology. This in turn will improve their operational inefficiencies, so they can instead focus on what truly matters – helping and making scientific breakthroughs.  3. GoVerify allows people to verify and check any that email, SMS, letter or phone call received is legitimate and actually from the company they are sent from.  Disclaimer: this video was 10000% free.
