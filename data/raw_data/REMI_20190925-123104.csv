Global certified institutions require the premium for the cost of providing “trust”. In contrast to domestic money transfers where it involves only two banks (sending bank, beneficiary bank), a minimum of two banks are required for overseas remittances thus requesting higher fees. In this context, the “network’s complexity” leads to high costs.  The Hawala system and the SWIFT system reviewed in the previous article should be compared considering both “trust cost” and “networks complexity”. To cut to the chase, with legal issues and global scalability problems set aside, systems like Hawala are much more beneficial to senders. Therefore, it would be normal to question next whether a “legal and globalized Hawala system” can exist. The REMIIT project is making this happen.  This article illustrates various blockchain models developed attempting to reduce trust cost and networks complexity in overseas remittances and value transfers. The difference between REMIIT and other models are discussed in three perspectives.  https://medium.com/remiit/blockchain-models-around-overseas-remittances-fdc7a457a7a1",True

SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- A Blockchain Powered Remittance Platform – REMIIT – completes its IEO through the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Coinis, raising approximately $2.3 Million over two days.  IEO is an abbreviation of ""Initial Exchange Offering"" which is a method of fundraising for blockchain businesses where the cryptocurrency of the project conducts fundraising being directly listed on the exchange. The key element to an IEO is to partner with an exchange (or multiple exchanges) to function as the distributor of tokens. Project developers mint the tokens and conduct the sales directly through the exchange, which will then sell the tokens to individual contributors for the corresponding pair.  REMIIT that completed their IEO last November is a blockchain powered remittance platform that builds on Ethereum with the Cosmos Chain as a side chain to enhance the transaction capacity and reduce costs. In the current monopolized remittance industry, REMIIT brings an alternative solution that resolves not only the issues in the banking sector but also the problems that exist in the blockchain remittance businesses. With the REMIIT Smart Contract (RSC) that can be activated with their stable coin REMD at its core, it is expected to minimize the number of intermediaries involved for a faster and cheaper overseas money transfer experience.  After the project launch through the IEO, REMIIT's CEO Stevie An spoke, ""REMIIT has many competitors in the industry but there still remains a large amount of market share available for blockchain remittance"" and that ""REMIIT will capitalize on the previous remittance business experience to speed up the blockchain implementation in our everyday lives.""  With the support of the REMIIT project from South Korea, it has demonstrated great potential for the possibilities to grow further in the global sector. Despite the difficulties that may lie ahead, REMIIT stands at the forefront to bring adoption of blockchain technology to our everyday lives.  https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fundraising-ieo-instead-ico-200000221.html",True

Especially due to the development of the internet, the number of overseas remittance and payment transactions is rapidly increasing. (The market size of more than $650 Billion will be covered in [Market Potential].) While such a huge market has spurred monopolistic financial institutions, the barriers between users are still high and transparency continues to be a consistent problem. First, ""overseas remittance"" transactions are slow and ineffective because of systems like the SWIFT network while Money Transfer Operators (MTOs) such as banks and non-bank fintech companies have limitations in scalability and expandability. Furthermore, the ""exchange rate"" that emerges when discussing global finance is changing in as we read depending on the political and economic interests between countries. The fees for foreign currency exchange among financial institutions also vary. Thus, participants (individuals or businesses) have paid more than necessary for exchange fees and have been constrained by entry barriers in the ""overseas payment"" business, a business closely related to overseas remittances. Under these situations, there have been many innovative attempts to destroy inefficient structures through technologies based on the blockchain. The core technology of the first generation blockchain was transparency and security through the Distributed Ledger Technology. For the second generation blockchain (such as Ethereum), the core technology deals with smart contracts and scalability. Since then, the improved block capacity and speed handling which has been consistently brought up is already widely known as the technology that will be first applied to overseas payments and remittance businesses. However, it is still in the early stages of many innovative attempts and the current reality is to present various models. The REMIIT Platform aims to be a revolutionary initiative as a catalyst for the development of a more efficient and innovative structure for overseas remittance and payment and provide these various services in each and every country",True
