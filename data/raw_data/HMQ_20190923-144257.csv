Event explained as well.   3:35 Anton explains they categorized the many questions into three types. 1. Exchanges 2. Cash-in-cash-out 3. Technology/techonology cooperation     4:21 Exchanges. Humaniq has been working hard on getting listed on exchanges, they have applied to many. The process has changed a lot for major exchanges in terms of how new tokens are being added. It doesn’t happen immediately as it usually would anymore, they conduct thorough review processes to find out whether a token falls under the category of a utility token or a security token, the process of investigating the liquidity of the token (who uses the token, why do they use it, etc. etc.), and of course the last is the decision of the exchange itself of listing the token. By now we all know the hmq token is considered a utility token by swiss lawyers right, there are legal documentation (? Could not hear properly due to video stuttering) that can confirm this. Humaniq has been going through this process. They have discussed with quite a few tier-one exchanges. They are currently going through the review process, once they are admitted they will share it with the community.  Humaniq has created a team solely working on getting HMQ token listed to new exchanges. It’s been one of their main priorities for some time (getting listed on new exchanges).    6:12 New cooperations and processes. Since last AMA we heard Anton talking about the cooperation with TransBox and others. Since then, Humaniq has signed an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) with two more companies.    6:40 Prover. We’ve heard about Humaniq’s cooperation with the company Prover, they have started a pilot project together. The team of Prover is working on the bio-identification in videos, these will be linked to the blockchain by creating a hash of the video which ensures the authenticity of the video and the legitimacy of the user actually taking the video at that time. Humaniq (Anton) emphasizes the importance of creating the digital passport, the identification piece is a very interesting product which Humaniq has put a lot of dedication and focus on creating. The cooperation has helped Humaniq in developing this concept even further.   7:20 Rivets. Humaniq has partnered with the company Rivets to further enhance the anti-fraud system, ensuring the hardware data matches the software data layer in terms of the identification on the physical device. This prevents more fraud from happening while also ensures Humaniq maintains a high quality growing user base, helping real users with actual problems of using the app.     8:17 Cash-in-cash-out. “Transferring the tokens; how does it happen, what’s going on, how can we do that?”. For the people who are using the Humaniq app, there is a bot called Nia who can assist users in the transferal process. It is not necessary to use Nia, you can just send the transaction to your exchange wallet address and the money will be delivered. With Humaniq’s hybrid blockchain model, users won’t be subjected to paying exchange fees. YouTube AMA with Humaniq CTO Anton Mozgovoy [Video] 9:27 Token price; why is HMQ token still valued under a dollar for so long, why hasn’t it gone up? To explain this clearly, the general crypto market has dropped quite a bit for the past months, even recently (Sunday) it went into a major dip. Due to BTC’s dominance on the market, the price fluctuations affect others as well. In time we will see more stability as the user base of Humaniq keeps growing. Just to put it into perspective, we have more than 300.000 users of the Humaniq app, which is significant increase considering we had less than 150.000 users five weeks ago (we doubled the number of users in about 5 weeks). The end-product of Humaniq has been released on November 1st, which means we have grown a user base of more than 300.000 members in just a little over seven months. We have grown faster than we expected, in less than a year. It’s the result of an amazing synergy effect between the groups inside our team: marketing; finding the right strategy of connecting with the end-user, product; knowing the differences in nuances in the works and what happening with the product, and technical; who created the solutions to the end-users.   11:45 Availability in other countries. Currently the app is only fully available in 10 African countries. It’s still limited for the rest of the world. The reason behind this decision is due to legislation; Humaniq wants to make sure they’re fully compliant with all the regulatory rules every respective country that apply when entering the market.  However, Humaniq is also working on their Global Expansion Plan; a plan to open the wallet in as many countries as possible. It is estimated that this will happen in just a bit more than five-to-six weeks.   12:56 Will there be an iOS release? Humaniq chose to go with Android first. Mobile phones became something very personal. Humaniq reaches its end-customer directly through providing these services on mobile computing. Due to the price of mobile phones dropping dramatically in the past years, it became a lot more accessible for people to acquire a mobile phone. The main mission of Humaniq is banking the unbanked, empowering the unbanked. Making sure financial inclusing is out there, hence why Humaniq decided to focus on Android first. However, Humaniq is aware of the strong industrial community behind iOS, which is why Humaniq is also working on an iOS app. It is important to note that Apple does not allow HMQ, just like with other tokens. The Humaniq team has been working on resolving this problem, however the iOS app is not a main priority, and it never will be.   14:50 Other new Ethereum technologies. The new Ethereum technologies like Plasma and database sharding are developed for the purpose of solving the problem of scaling, to make sure the network is capable of processing these transactions. With the hybrid blockchain model, Humaniq is not interested in the scaling problem anymore, as they’re capable of growing and consequently getting more and more users.",False

Between humanitarian aims and capitalist growth targets? Or can we square the circle of achieving a flourishing, entrepreneurial world, whilst ensuring that nobody is left behind?  Humaniq believes the world can, indeed must, have both business and humanitarianism. Business as usual, where 3.5bn people are shut out of the 21st Century economy’s opportunities to earn, save and invest because they have little or no access to banking, is not an option. But international development also falls short on its own, and can benefit from partnering with business to capture innovation and new ideas.  This belief in ‘humanitarian capitalism’ informs everything we do, even our choice of name, reflects a belief in a different kind of entrepreneurialism that puts humanity first, harnessing the power of the Blockchain for good. And it is why we are seeking partners keen to offer services in the Humaniq App ecosystem, a ‘blue ocean’ for apps aimed at the global unbanked. As a startup partnering with us, you would immediately have a relationship with our existing community of users. This is a community that broke the 200,000 mark in our first few months, and which we aim to grow by one million in 2018, every one of whom will have gained access to an online identity and currency with Humaniq.  You would also, crucially, be joining a global mission to end extreme poverty, ensure decent work, and secure access to essential services. Humaniq joined the United Nations’ global drive as we formally endorsed the UN’s Compact with business to become a member of the community of companies around the world signed-up to helping to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs). This commits us — and our partners — to support worldwide efforts to end poverty, hunger and lack of access to clean water, and secure decent work, healthcare, and other essential services  And since launching our app in the Google Play store in December, we already have a community of over 200,000 users in the African nations of Rwanda, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Each user now is earning HMQ cryptocurrency through interacting with the App and recommending friends. The next stage is to build on this by providing our community with a variety of new services they can easily access with their bio-ID and HMQ coin in their wallet.  With these goals in mind, we launched our Humaniq Challenge, which attracted over 450 applications from startups keen to join our initiative to provide new routes out of poverty. The winners refined their cases on a mission with the Humaniq team in Kenya, and are now three promising partners developing services for our verified, coin-holding community members in the market for services nobody is offering them.  We will be accepting further applications in a second round in the latter half of 2018, and are looking forward to seeing further proposals that not only have a strong business case, but also directly contributing to the SDGs. It could be improving access to clean water, providing new employment opportunities or improving food security by better connecting farmers and consumers.  In signing up to the UN Compact, we have committed to making its principles part of the strategy, culture and operations of our company, and to engaging in collaborative projects which advance the broader development goals of the UN. We will in the autumn set out a description of practical actions we have taken to advance the achievement of the global goals, with measurements of progress.  We share the desire of the UN’s 193 member states when they three years ago decided to define the world we want, to adopt the SDGs and provide measurable targets to track how far we are going in the right direction. Partnering with us, you will also adopt these commitments and also, crucially, get access to the UN network and resources to assist you in your endeavours. https://blog.humaniq.co/sglobal-goals-for-both-business-and-development-allow-everybody-to-win-7c310918304",False

The largest mobile operator in Kenya Safaricom, owned by French Orange and operated by British Vodafone, in 2007 presented the M-Pesa service. Soon after, the company began to have representatives in literally every village and every corner of the endless slums of Kibera in Nairobi. Local residents came to the offices of the company with their ancient ""Nokia"", registered and received an additional menu item of the phone, which allowed them to transfer money to another subscriber's number. To cash the transfer, you just need to send an SMS. You can pick up the money in the same offices of representatives of the company or in some ATMs, even without using a debit card. So humaniq it is very hard to compete with these giants.",False

London, March 19, 2018 - Humaniq has achieved the first working hybrid Blockchain with the 2.0 version of its app, to retain the benefits of the Ethereum main-net while expanding faster.  Humaniq today announces that the recently launched 2.0 version of our app is delivered on a unique Hybrid Blockchain. In a technological milestone, it is the first project with a working hybrid Blockchain that is not in prototype or beta-testing stage. Humaniq has successfully solved the problem of scaling ERC20 projects. The new, improved app sits on the Ethereum Blockchain with the unique combination of sidechain solutions in individual African countries, such as Uganda, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Rwanda.  Before, all Humaniq coin transactions were made on the Ethereum main-net. However, the security of a transaction in the main Ethereum network is provided at a cost of about $84.85 at the current rate[1]according to figures that apply until 15th March, 2018. This is a barrier to the App’s expansion and to emerging economies entering the 21st Century economy. This is why the company started work on a new architecture that would both allow for HMQ tokens to remain open and accessible on the Ethereum main-net, and also provide an inexpensive method to secure the network - vital to allow our users to make small transactions with transaction fees close to zero.  The solution consists of one, main, HMQ Blockchain, and a number of internal Blockchains where user wallets from different countries are stored and operated together, while remaining identifiable and personalised based on the user’s country location. When the capacity of the existing Blockchain due to the volume of transactions gets fulfilled, the system unpacks and boots up the next Blockchain to scale the system horizontally.  It means that transactions can continue to be made in a decentralised and transparent way, necessary to overcoming the cost barriers to expanding financial services to the many regions that banks do not serve. But now there is no ceiling to the growth of Humaniq community and of the use of the app, which has been already downloaded more than 100,000 times from Google Play. It also means the company remains open to any regulatory rules that individual nations may adopt.  “Our development team’s proud of this technological first, which brings together the benefits of the Ethereum Blockchain and of individual Blockchains. Our unique solution allows us to serve ever more of the global unbanked population, building on the 100,000 downloads already made - without the costs of providing services of either the miners or the traditional banks,” said Anton Mozgovoy, CTO Humaniq.  http://www.pressat.co.uk/releases/humaniq-celebrates-success-first-working-hybrid-blockchain-and-100000-strong-community-8dce92892610f618d7c44d0e9219e7b0/",False

The Humaniq app includes a wallet, bioID, secure messenger and the unbanked can use it for making digital ID and peer-to-peer transactions in African countries (including Uganda, Senegal, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, and Rwanda).  The new features include: New referral program  With Humaniq’s  egalitarian emission approach, a large proportion of the HMQ crypto coin is reserved for active app users. A referral program has showed a very positive adoption curve from users, with more than 10,000 users together inviting more than 75,000 thousand friends in total to join the application.  Humaniq’s new 2.0 referral program  will build on this by displaying community progress with referrals and thereby make the  referral process more transparent and intuitive for all users.  Transaction options extension  Transactions can now be made via the messaging chat system. The principle the  Humaniq app is grounded in- is that everything should revolve around humans coming together to build a community. That is why an ability to communicate is crucial.  The Humaniq team have introduced transactions into personal chats to focus on the communication between people. Whether it is a text, or an image or a gift in HMQ – it is now all in one place.  In addition,  users  are now allowed not only to send HMQ, but also to request directly from their friends or family. The Humaniq team believes that an ability to request a desired amount is a more efficient and faster way to communicate financially.  This feature is available for all users that have access to the wallet, and is also secured by our enhanced anti-fraud system. Users can also enjoy a new way of grouping transactions as a smarter way to organise personal communication. From now on, users will be able to clearly focus either on the financial history or on the correspondence with a specified friend by staying in the unified chat room.  While text and media messages will be grouped based on the timing, financial transactions will be grouped by type and action type.  New on-boarding process  The Humaniq team redesigned the on-boarding process to make it clearer and easier for inexperienced smartphone users.  The close collaboration with Humaniq’s ambassadors in African nations led to the creation of an on-boarding process that adapts to the needs of customers, whereas the purpose remains the same: to explain what features are available, how to use them and how to benefit from their use.  New registration process  A new registration process allows users to start interacting with a Humaniq assistant bot, which becomes smarter and is learning to execute more useful commands, even without the registration.  Unlike conventional applications where a user has to specify required personal credentials in order to get access to a given  functionality, the Humaniq team would like to let users choose what functionality is needed, and how to access it.  Optional passcode and new security standards  Humaniq App security standards have also been reconsidered and will allow users to opt-out from a required passcode. There is, therefore, also an AI powered system to decide when an additional biometric verification is required to eliminate the risk щa unauthorised transactions.  “The Humaniq’s team of ambassadors in Africa received and analysed feedback from users, and with this data it was possible to create such  significant updates. We hope our users will appreciate all the innovations and we will move even further towards our goal to empower the unbanked” – said Anton Mozgovoy, CTO Humaniq.  The Humaniq team has also made additional upgrades to remote infrastructure and with new CDN points, users in Africa will experience a faster by 16% response rate from mobile application which is already available in Google Play and can be used even on low-end mobile devices with Android 4.0.3.",False

I believe that they have a great project.  However, I think it is not appropriately marketed.  The fact that HMQ allows the users not using the public key is the most powerful tool. HMQ IS A PRIVATE BANK. It should be underlined!  HMQ is an excellent solution for unbanked AND THE BANKED. It should be well communicated! Otherwise, for the unbanked, the project will be superseded by bitcoin (and by other projects); and with regard to the “banked”, they could not be in any manner attracted to the project. This is a big mistake not to attract the “banked”, and just to target the unbanked. Omisego understood it, this is why it is successful.  Thus, to sum up: HMQ is a great asset if HMQ team conveys the essential message that WITH HMQ THERE’S NO NEED TO THINK ABOUT KEYS, AND HMQ IS A PRIVATE BANK AT HOME!  For your knowledge: below are the interesting details of the white paper:  Our solution: we discarded the private and public key approach, which confuses newcomers; we also had to reject using fractional amounts of coins, since decimal fractions may be uneasy for people with little or no education.

Yes, this is not a project meant to provide anonimity, it's simply using blockchain technology to provide a service that is sorely lacking in many underdeveloped countries.

Look at Ethereum, it didnt trade for a year and then was dumped to shit before its first real leg up a year after that.

We've recently decided to overhaul our communication, with weekly tech and pilot updates to keep the community informed. We are very sorry that so much time has passed without a global release, but there was a lot of work to be done, and as always, the realities of development mean that we were too optimistic with our promised schedule. On top of that, we had to make changes to accomodate local regulations, which postponed the release even further. Regardless, the app is currently being tested in the pilot program in Ghana, involving 2000 people, as well as smaller test groups in other countries centered around our ambassadors and the local universities.  We're getting very good feedback from all of them and a lot of interest from the users, allowing us to fix many issues.  We will be confident enough to give a final release date for the Google Play version in one or two weeks.   Here's what has been done in the past two weeks:    Pilot App  New people outside of Ghana onboarded for the pilot, testing app, use cases, providing feedback and experience:    - 28th September, ambassador Peter Sampson, Tanzania University of Dar es salaam (UDSM)  - 27th September, ambassador Oladimeji Shekoni, Lagos State Polytechnic University Ikorodu Lagos  - 6th October, Kayode Babarinde, University of Ibadan, Nigeria - Pilot App Launched  - 6th October, Alakanani Itereleng, Botswana - Pilot App Launched    Who is running the program:    - Humaniq developers team    - Ambassadors of Humaniq research games and mobile app games  - Coordinator of Humaniq research games in Africa    --------    Tech Team update:    - Messaging feature has been finished by our Tech team. From now on Humaniq users can use the app as a messenger as well. Botswana is the first place where the messenger feature will be released.  - We are finalizing the Humaniq Referral system. This feature gives the users the ability to send invites to friends and get rewards for this activity  - In anticipation of the exponential growth of new users after Google Play release we are concentrating on users’ data privacy, analytics and fraud detection processes   The updates will be posted every Friday.

Here's how things work with Humaniq:  1. Work quietly, giving minimal verifiable information, and when you DO give updates, post polished fake-feeling videos to places like FB.  The rough and tumble forums like BCT and Reddit are just not how this team rolls.  They do what they HAVE to do to be able to check these boxes off, but they don't live here. 2. When complaints periodically get loud enough, hold an AMA, or video session, pretend to answer questions, and claim victory. 3. See the trees, not the forest.  It seems counter-intuitive, but this group seems to ENTIRELY focused on regulation and all of the craziness that goes along with it.  Most of us would expect the grand vision of inclusiveness to be very disruptive and aggressively displace current forms of payment.  That's not the path that Humaniq is traveling.  They want to be blessed by the institutions, not destroy them.  I'm frustrated as hell with this project, and have basically given up trying to follow their progress.  I'm holding, but it's one of those ""come back and check if they're still here in a year"" type experiences.  This group is smart and capable, but they are playing in a space that doesn't fit them.

Modifications to the emission matrix, to enhance white paper statement  Fiat to HMQ and backwards conversions in the app, for those who do have a bank or other type of electronic cash (useful for merchants and exchangers).  Onboarding merchants to perform cash exchange in rural areas (where no infrastructure exists)  Safety report mechanisms, developed together with our partners, to prevent the higher than usual risk of scams.   On top of that, we're working with one major partner to provide critical financial information to users, and start integrating loans and insurance functionality.

I remember people threatened to dump after ICO! And the moment it hit exchanged people dumped as promise because humaniq team have not shown any tangible progress!  In terms of catering to the unbanked, we have a team in Africa with native employees, and we have been expanding it in preparation for the full launch. With their knowledge of local realities we are quite confident that we'll succeed in creating a solid userbase. The app is also quite intuitive to use and doesn't require full literacy.  In terms of progress, we're currently running the pilot program in Ghana with the app, solving legal issues with the release, and doing internal bug hunting to make sure everything runs smoothly. It's the kind of gritty work that doesn't look flashy, which is why the price has been quite stale (at least in USD terms). These things are however necessary to have a solid product, and promising the world without having anything to show for it (yet), doesn't seem like the right move to us.",False

I see your point, but you need to understand i have been in crypto for afew years and seen alot. The price drop didnt bother me, it was the price drop combined with missed deadlines, stopped updates, team gone silent, and accusations on reddit of fake twitter followers, all recipes for a scam. Im not saying Humaniq is a scam, maybe they have good reasons for the above, but ive been burnt once before and if i see the same signs i will get out immediatley. Its a shame though because i really did like their vision. SO WHERE IS THE APP NOW? DEFINITELY THIS IS A SCAM , LOL BEEN WARNING PEOPLE SINCE LAUNCH..  If You think about this - SCUM, I ready buy your HMQ for 3000 sat ...  You can sell me your HMQ - and go to the next step of your life. i just dumped.. goodbye Good luck, I hope you will not regret your decision, HMQ is a long term project, allow at least 1 year to see the results. I will still hope despite some people are dumping, let's see who will laugh and the end.  It’s painful to hear that we’re a scam, but in some ways understandable given how often this happens in the cryptospace.  To recap what has happened lately:  The Lite version of the app was presented on the 26th July at the meetup and released under an invite-only pilot test program in Ghana.  The reason for this is that we are committed to complying with both local and international legislature, and as such high standards are expected. Any software product requires testing first, to iron out bugs that will inevitably pop up, especially one that deals with money. It’s impossible to say when exactly the app will be ready for public use, but it won’t be long. We acquired the domain humaniq.com and renovated our site. A unique feature of the site is that it is stored locally, to minimize the amount of traffic that our users need to spend. The app is designed with the same philosophy in mind. Development is continuously under way. For now the app has fairly limited functionality, but as the months go by, more and more interesting features will be added.         https://pp.userapi.com/c841123/v841123429/f03b/aXNGuT5Onf8.jpg  Here's a screen of the app  Quote from: Dr Araki on August 04, 2017, 12:10:30 AM Hi It looks like a good project, clear use case and potential to scale like anything. However, am concern about the coins that aren't in circulation yet, more than 70 million Humaniq. How will they be distributed? According to TotalMarketCap there is 162m out of 184m as total supply but the maximum supply is 920m, that is huge. I searched the website, forum and read a lot of articles but couldn't.t find a clear answer  The difference between circulating and total supply is likely given by all the ICO participants who haven’t withdrawn their tokens yet. They’re only created on the blockchain at that time. Maximum supply will likely change, but we can’t give details yet.    Quote from: Neo Gnosis on August 05, 2017, 08:53:48 AM  Totally disagree.

Many of these people live on $1 to $2 a day and have never had or seen money. Can you imaging how they will flock to this opportunity? Can you imaging how many westerners would run with this if it mean they would get $50 for signing up and another $50 for getting someone else to do likewise? A HMQ coin will look like gold to most of these souls.  This will spread like a highly contagious virus.  Offering opportunity to hundreds of millions of poverty stricken people is not something that will take a long time to catch on... believe me!   The app can even be used from one phone for an entire village, for example. Different accounts are allowed on the same phone. It’s hard to say how quickly our app will spread, but in any case the project is much wider in scope than just a one-time infusion of money for the poor people in Africa.

Lets get to reality, the price has been hovering around 5000-6000 mark for the past few days,  and recently even dipped to 4700...I mean come on, if the work/updates of the team does not have an impact on the price, is this even worth holding for the long term? Moreover the trading volume of this coin is very low too....Not many people know about this coin.  I am regretting to have got this in at 7400, still holding to recover my losses....I highly doubt how long is it going to even take to reach to this level?

HMQ has been holding its .15c USD as most alts have been holding their USD value. Its USD value will increase as people look for alts with REAL potential instead of hype.  As BTC settles down from its new high over the next few days HMQ will rise to the 5000-6000 mark again. People are panicking atm as most alts are dragged down by BTC under tow. It will settle as people seize the opportunity to grab REAL coins at bargain prices. Buy low sell high. Its the only real way to play markets. Every turn in a market is an opportunity for those who approach it professionally. Others are better off at a casino if all they want to do is play a game of chance. ,False

Last post of the previous page  Quote To recap what has happened lately:      The Lite version of the app was presented on the 26th July at the meetup and released under an invite-only pilot test program in Ghana.  The reason for this is that we are committed to complying with both local and international legislature, and as such high standards are expected. Any software product requires testing first, to iron out bugs that will inevitably pop up, especially one that deals with money. It’s impossible to say when exactly the app will be ready for public use, but it won’t be long.     We acquired the domain humaniq.com and renovated our site. A unique feature of the site is that it is stored locally, to minimize the amount of traffic that our users need to spend. The app is designed with the same philosophy in mind.     Development is continuously under way. For now the app has fairly limited functionality, but as the months go by, more and more interesting features will be added.        https://pp.userapi.com/c841123/v841123429/f03b/aXNGuT5Onf8.jpg  Here's a screen of the app",False

A financial inclusion app is to be launched in Ghana in coordination with the UN with the aim of giving young slum-dwellers a tool to improve their lives.  The Humaniq App, which comes out on Android on the 31st July and is targeted at people in low-income, suburban areas of the capital, Accra, with the aim of giving them a way to receive, borrow, sell and earn and improve their lives. The application has four main sections: bio-identification; a contacts and referral system; a wallet system; and a data-light chat system, all liberating for people without access to banking, and having to live day-to-day.  Bio-identification gives the undocumented an identity necessary to access financial services, an identity that one billion people in the world lack. It involves taking two photographs of a user that must match and, in order to eliminate fraud, the second requiring the user to show a particular emotion. This is in order to prevent anybody using two matching photographs that are not of themselves. In addition, a further security measure is the validation of the user’s phone number with an SMS.  The referral system, meanwhile, allows those downloading the Humaniq App to immediately start ‘earning’ HMQ coin cryptocurrency, and will underpin the growth of the app. The app displays what contacts from the contact book are already using the app, and for those that are not, there is an option to invite them.  Invitations generate SMS texts with unique referral links. The app tracks the status of invited users, and as soon as they join the Humaniq community, their status will be updated and both users will receive a HMQ bonus. For those contacts of users that already belong to the Humaniq community, users will be able to initiate transactions, send messages or start a voice call.  In addition, every user has a personal web page, stored in the format hmq.im/username, which can be shared with other users in order to get bonuses as another way of building a stronger community where users have a growing number of connections. In order to get invited and to get a bonus, users can leave their phone number on the personal page.  The Humaniq App chat system, meanwhile, has the unique selling point of providing encrypted conversations guaranteeing privacy that are also light on data consumption. This is a crucial feature in emerging countries where smartphone data is expensive compared to average incomes.  The chat system also provides cloud synchronisation, so all chats are synchronized if you log in from another device; group chats; voice calls; audio memos; and image and video sharing. In addition, chat users can request funds from each other, and see transactions coming in, and going out. This is the first step towards building a more collaborative, peer-to-peer economy in regions where people are currently shut out of the 21st Century, digital economy.  The wallet system is the part of the app that makes it possible to send and receive cryptocurrency. A user can review their balance in HMQ and the comparable amount in local currency, determined by their geo-location.The app shows a user’s entire transaction history with extensive details: the status of the transaction, the amount and the local currency equivalent.  An app allows users to send and request funds either by selecting users from the contact book, scanning a QR code, or even by entering a phone number for users not already using Humaniq, who will receive an SMS with a weblink where they can collect their payment.  The Humaniq App provides an open source full-stack and API that will be available for startups and other services to build services on top of the core Humaniq technology. This makes it easy for Fintech partners to plug into the Humaniq network to reach a huge market that is not served at present.  In the pipeline for later this year and 2018 are additional tabs allowing users to earn, borrow and access an online marketplace and further financial services, such as insurance and medical services  Source: https://www.intelligenthq.com/wp-content/cache/all/innovation-management/financial-inclusion-app-launches-in-ghana-to-give-low-income-young-a-tool-to-progress//index.html",False

If HMQ can capture even a 10% market share of the world wide P2P lending flow, then this project will be absolutely HUGE.  Edit: The current global market cap for P2P lending is ~30 BILLION. So, if we assume even a 5% marketshare for HMQ, then that would be 1.5 BILLION market cap for this coin. Basic math: 1.5 Billion divided by 142 Million coins = $10.5 per coin.

Please help me answer:  1) The whitepaper states the HMQ unit is integer and not fractional.  This means the smallest payment that can be made is 1 HMQ.  At some point 1 HMQ might become as valuable as 1 USD or 10 USD or even more (currently $0.16). Let's say 1 HMQ == 10 USD. Then, 10 USD will be the minimum payment that must be made via the Humaniq App.  This is not desirable, especially not in developing countries where many people live on as little as USD 2 per day (stated in their white paper). How shall this problem be solved?   2) The white paper states:  ""Emission proceeds until kmax people are registered. kmax should be relatively big."" [...] ""Denote the total amount of coins sold via Pre-ICO + ICO by Vico"" [...] ""The objective number 4 states that the total average number of coins that a user can mint in-app must be close to 500"" [...] ""kmax = round (Vico/125)"" [...] ""the maximum possible amount of Humaniq coins is limited by 5Vico""  Now the question is how big is Vico:  - Etherscan (https://etherscan.io/token/Humaniq) says there are currently 184,190,414 HMQ - The ICO contract code (https://etherscan.io/address/0xcbcc0f036ed4788f63fc0fee32873d6a7487b908#code):      // 31 820 314 tokens were minted during preICO     uint constant public preICOSupply = mul(31820314, 100000000);      // 131 038 286 tokens were minted during ICO     uint constant public ICOSupply = mul(131038286, 100000000);  which leads to 31820314+131038286 = 162,858,600 HMQ   a) The maximum number of users to receive token emission is 162,858,600 HMQ / 500 HMQ = 325,717. The maximum number of HMQ there will ever be is 5*162,858,600 HMQ = 814,293,000 HMQ. With the conservative assumption that every user will have only about 500 HMQ, the maximum number of total users is: 814,293,000 / 500 = 1,628,586. Only 1.6 Million users. You are advertising of targeting 2 Billion users. How can this fit?  b) Why are the numbers of Etherscan and the contract different? Was there already an emission of 184,190,414 - 162,858,600 = 21,331,814 HMQ? To who? With an average of 500 HMQ per user, this would mean already 42,663 are using your app. But there is no app, yet.

This answer makes no sense at all. In fact, given that you're outsourcing a fair amount of your dev work, I would think that you need a source code control system even more.  All of the teams that you mention are more than capable of using git.  The more time that goes by without meaningful code beyond some old smart contracts, the more of an issue this is going to be.

Humaniq please check  I will ask the questions thru this forum, and hope Humaniq picks them up. And knowledgeable people here can answer too :  1. TECHNOLOGY : Humaniq success depends on  biometric id capability, based on facial, gesture and voice recognition (and not the more mature fingerprinting and iris scans). How mature is this tech (do you have patents / done deep R&D and developed a fool-proof algo ..?). Since free coins will be issued you can be sure there will be Sybil-like attacks, people assuming multiple identities to earn coins. I know you will link it to the phone, but is that sufficient ?  2. USERS : How do you decide who gets to use the Humaniq app when released? Is it universally available for all who download and fulfill  pre-requisites (registration, proof-of-face etc...)? In other words, how do you ensure that the needy / poor ( in Africa etc ) are the ones who benefit from the app? Is there a qualification process / criteria / geo limitations etc.?  3. INCLUSIVENESS : While you state that the un-banked will get on to the banking system without the need for government ids, the fact is that they will only be part of a closed Humaniq  / HMQ eco-system and not the conventional banking system. Till this eco-system develops or you partner with banks, there is only so much the un-banked can do with free HMQ. Where is the gateway to local fiat currencies for the App users (surely not crypto-exchanges !)  Looking forward to some constructive discussion / answers",False

I completely agree with hmq_dave on the fact that communication from the development team is really lackluster. The simple fact is that in order to succeed as a cryptocurrency you have to be active in engaging with the people that are holding your coins/tokens. Not only is it unfair to people that invested in the ICO, you will just not get new peopl that are interested in your project.  I definitely think that your project is a very interesting one but the success will most likely rest on being able to effectively communicate your goals and roadmap to your supporters in the community. The issues and questions raised in this topic are very valid and even though you as a development team may think they are irrelevant (as you probably know the answers to them) they are relevant to those that are scanning these fora.  At the moment the only news in this thread seem to be the people that keep mindlessly saying 'oh yes a rise is coming' and 'thanks for your cheap coins'. A community needs more reassurance than just a message that there is nothing to worry about.",False

I think everyone can agree that if properly executed the potential of a project like this is staggering.  What we are talking about is the fact that it seems there is little to no communication from the dev team regarding questions raised by community members here, and that is a very serious issue. Considering the fact that they have raised quite a bit of money with their ICO I think it would only be reasonable that they employ one or two people to manage the crypto-community while they focus on the development and roll-out of the product.

Many will be used for incentive-based distribution to penetrate new markets.  If I recall correctly, as you use their platform there are milestones that warrant ""bonus"".  For example, create profile, send some HMQ, receive some HMQ, etc.  The bonuses decrease over time, so users are incentivized to sign up early and use frequently.  A key point here is to recognize that there are only about 200mm tokens in circulation at the moment, and that there is a pretty well described PLAN for how the other tokens will be circulated in the future.  I've not seen a smart contract codifying the distribution, so it's just a whitepapery promise at this point, but I think that dumping 4x the circulation in tokens to ""screw investors"" seems pretty stupid.  I'm betting (and I've bet a fair amount) that Humaniq is in this for the long haul.  Also, as others have pointed out, the apps are running on test-net at this point.  Mid-July is the planned release of the first full app running on the ETH blockchain.",False

There's a fair amount of P&D bullshit there too, but a few humaniq employees actually seem to know what the hell is happening.  Have also gotten direct responses from founders on my questions.  To answer some of your specific questions:  - There is a planned web site refresh in the next week or two.  Most of the team has been focused on some heavy showing at blockchain expo for the last week or so. - It seems that there is some pretty heavy weight backend block chain development and testing happening at the moment, including whether to use ETH ledger directly, or to use a private node with private node block verifications being cross posted to the public ETH ledger. - Sounds like they're dropping support for iOS, as the target market for their customers is squarely in the Android camp.  This is good news, as it allows them to focus dev/outsourcing efforts on the platform that really matters (there's never going to be $20 new iPhones for sale in Africa).  Hope this helps.",False

Currently more towards 1k at the moment with how things are looking..  It all depends on the professionalism of the team and if they can deliver without any more mistakes  I'd be having my buy orders at 1K - 900 sats per HMQ. Regardless of the mistakes, fuds and condemnation of HMQ project by some people in the community, I believe If the team is serious, They can achieve their set goal and deliver banking access to the unbanked.

The meeting was quite good, and progress was made on several fronts. Resolving legal and compliance aspects of the project is key for both the Humaniq team and potential investors, and Alex was happy to announce that progress has been made on this issue. I’ve known Natalya for some time from the fintech industry, and she was able to cover a lot of ground quickly regarding the next steps we need to take moving forward, and to ensure that we’re taking all appropriate measures to be in compliance with international regulations while also protecting our intellectual property. Alex was also introduced to the accelerator team that is helping make Luxembourg an international capital of financial technology. Silicon Luxembourg is dedicated to incubating both domestic startups and international startups that choose to headquarter in Luxembourg. This was an introductory meeting, but Alex felt it had a lot of value in laying the groundwork for future partnerships. LHoFT has had a lot of success and they’ve attracted the kind of expertise and talent that can help guide a project like ours to success. We discussed the Humaniq project, our goals, and they were optimistic about our future and very positive about what we’ve achieved so far.

Thank you for supporting us during the whole campaign and ICO.  We have some announcements.  The first thing - you can remove your signatures with Humaniq.  Signature and avatar campaign is over. You ll get your tokens soon.  The second thing is concerned newsletter Bounty. Emails from spreadsheet of forum were not in use. The problem is with this spreadsheet. The list is full of multiplied profiles and strange emails of bounty hunters. So we made a decision that part of newsletter Bounty (10% from 3% for Bounty) will be distributed within signature and avatar campaign. We suppose that it's fair decision and you will support us with this idea.  So thank you to everyone for being with us! The campaign is over. You ll get soon your tokens!

A few claims are made:  1) Humaniq balances will be integer-only.  2) Total Humaniq tokens created will not exceed ICO tokens sold, times 5.  3) Humaniq is superior to Bitcoin because ""the number of satoshis in circulation is insufficient"".  Some back of the napkin calculations make it appear to me that something on the order of 150,000,000 HMQ will be sold during the ICO. That would mean a maximum supply of 750,000,000 eventually. Very rough estimates, but I don't think they're off by orders of magnitude.  Another claim made (on the website) is that there is the potential for $4.2 TRILLION in new deposits from currently unbanked persons. But let's be more reasonable, and make things simpler for the bath, and say that $75 billion in new deposits could be made. That translates to a vale of $100 per token. And the tokens are indivisible.  Does the Humaniq team have any plans on how to deal with rising token values, and limited supply caused by a finite supply of indivisible tokens?",False

Mathematics on caps must be way more clear as to what your top tier cap is. If you have not already worked this cap out I cannot understand how it's viable firstly as a product and as an ICO - even with a flexible cap you must work out forward caps. It’s simple. The number of tokens are/will be linked to a certain amount and it will not be changed after whatever time and whatever circumstances.   2.) Who holds the address that can deploy more tokens? Humaniq team   3.) Who holds the address that can stop transfer of tokens and otherwise? Humaniq team   4.) Who and what specific definitions are these accounts under - is it one person of multiple people? One person. We are moving forward to establish an escrow that will be controlling migration to a new smart contract.   5.) Who is auditing this cap scale if there is no scale in the first place. Please break down in simple mathematical terms what are your scales and project scales. In simple mathematical terms, the scale of the emission is represented in the whitepaper. So ICO + pre-ICO amount is 100%. The second phase of emission mints that amount until the cap of 500% is reached.   6.) What are the current problems in this smart contract that needs changing apart from the issues that were pointed out? For you to transfer and migrate to a new smart contract. Currently there are no issues in smart-contract that needs to be addressed, but due to stage of heavy development there is always a possibility for migration to a new smart contract that actually delivers new features.   7.) Does the above create a new level of token issuance? No, emission model is clearly stated in our whitepaper and will never be changed.   8.) Knee Jerk reactions are not a part of the due diligence process - what is part of due diligence is processing the smart contract you and your team made. Knee Jerk reactions are represented in conclusions that were made from the due diligence and not in the due diligence itself.   9.) With regard to offchain transactions how is this verified if you are not using the blockchain technology itself? Again questions must be asked about this. Actually there are no offchain transactions. Offchain is the way we migrate to a new contract, i.e. we process blockchain for every user balance in the current token and create a new token with the same set of user’s balances. This action can be validated by a 3rd party observer, so the offchain migration is fair way to migrate to a new token.   10.) Why is there a switch in the emission address? What is the rationale for this - this address should be owned by the team or otherwise - that is why who holds it is extremely important. So the emission logic during the ICO differs from the emission logic after the ICO, when new tokens will be granted for every new user who passed biometric identification process. That is why we need a contract function that allow us to change the contract-emitent of the tokens.   11.) No-one has framed you as malicious or untrustworthy, the due diligence has been done on code. Code is what you create it is not about personal opinion or otherwise. Personally I really liked the Humaniq project until this issue was brought to me. The reason code is open source is because there should be audits on it to protect the crypto community / your userbase and otherwise. We are frankly thankful for your time spent on the audit and pointing this out.   12.) If you want to go with a centralized distribution model thats fine with complete control of your team and organizational members - but please announce this because that in itself is not decentralization. Distribution model is clearly stated in the whitepaper of the project. The one who have carefully read the whitepaper can easily be assured that we act totally aligned with our previous statements about emission.   13.) Why not use an independent escrow for cap baselines. This is one of possible solution that our team is considering at the moment.   14.) Why no 3rd party audit of this smart contract before launching and otherwise? As we said before, there are no bugs or mistakes in the smart contract, but there are decisions that were made to deliver a best tradeoff between speed of moving forward and openness to the community. Our team’s actions are fully auditable by 3rd party observers and cannot go unnoticed by the community.   Finally Humaniq team would like to thank ICOCountdown for the time spent on asking those questions. We hope our answers satisfied both ICOCountdown and their subscribers and we will continue our work and implement our plans presented in WhitePaper and RoadMap.  Thank you.",False

Every crypto has been called a scam by someone at some point. It's a waste of valuable development time to address FUD. If it was my coin I would delete FUD, not address it. lol.  Same reason you don't see developers and engineers commenting on any forum very much. Whether it be a game, a crypto, or a major corporation. Ain't nobody got time for that.  Also, they already have contributions from many people. If it is a scam, then it has already been successful and there isn't anything you can do or say to change that. Before investing people should do their due diligence and remember, only invest what you would be willing to give away. Whether it's a scam or not I have already accepted that my money is probably gone. I do not regret my investment, even if it turns out to be a scam. Oh well, on to the next one.  90% of the time I would spend more money(in time) on due diligence than I would invest, anyways. It makes more sense to me to earn more money in that time.

Advantages:  - A promising market direction of the project. Regions with the weak financial infrastructure have been monitored by traditional financial institutions and young fintech companies for a long time. - Founders have effectively solved the user identification problem in the regions with low literacy rates by introducing bio identification tools. - Infrastructural nature of the service opens great prospects for its development, by the possibility of connecting a potentially huge number of fintech services that will serve the users of the network. - The founder of the project has extensive experience in the fintech and the blockchain industry. - Huge scalability potential the project due to its infrastructural nature of the project and a huge number of people that are not covered by financial services. - A detailed motivation system for ambassadors. - Potentially serious competitive advantages. - Successful Pre-ICO. - Experienced team of technical specialists: Etherion Lab wrote smart-contracts for Waves and Ethereum ICO; VisionLab is a one of leading developer of bio identification solutions.  Weak points in the project include the following:  - Financial motivation of investors is based only on the long term growth of the token market value. There are no other types of reward for investors. - Since the project is non-profit in nature, the model of further monetization of the platform is still poorly developed. So far the project has only a general outline of ideas, such as creating online jobs with charging fees for transactions by employers that offer remote work for the network users, for example, for viewing or editing content. - The value of the network, and as a therefore of the tokens, will grow as the number of active users increases, so there is no expectation of an ""explosive growth"" for the token value. Humaniq is a long-term investment project. - The introduction of bio identification for the ease of use has weakened the security of users’ funds and the network itself (standard passwords and authentication means are currently more reliable than bio identification), it will be necessary to develop new solutions to protect the data and prevent illegal release of tokens.  At the same time, it should be noted that the growth potential for the token value is of a long-term nature. So investors shouldn’t expect an active growth after the start of the secondary trading and the speculative potential in this case is minimal. As the user base of the project grows, as well as the number of projects connected to the infrastructure, their exchange value will grow, which in the long term can be very profitable.  Due to the long-term prospect of potential growth of the exchange value of tokens, the question whether to buy them during the ICO, or at the secondary market is quite natural. While there is no need to expect a strong price drop at the beginning of the secondary trading, the bonus system at the start of crowdsale gives quite significant benefits to investors.  The fact that the project aims to solve real and objective issues is a substantial advantage as well as a clearly defined target audience.  The potential of the market not covered by financial services is being discussed by both traditional financial institutions and fintech companies for a long time. It was only a matter of time before the first project, that aims to solve this problem would appear. It is not surprising that it came from the blockchain industry since the technology of the distributed database itself solves many problems that prevented traditional players from entering this market.  In our opinion, the team has all the necessary competencies and experience to implement the announced goals of the project.",False

Recently there was a post on Reddit regarding our ICO and some questions about our emission model were raised. We want to answer this question and reassure everyone we are doing things as stated in our whitepaper.  In the audit conducted by a commentator on Reddit, a number of points about the emission system were brought up and we are actually pleased that members of the community found some problems at this stage.  The first point is, we have the ability to change the logic of the emission model and this was a conscious decision to set it up this way. There is no cap for the number of tokens emitted during our ICO, and it’s purely dependent on how many tokens people purchase.  After the ICO we are putting in the cap, since the total number of tokens that will ever be emitted is capped at 5x the amount emitted during the ICO and Pre-ICO. We have used different contracts and therefore there is the possibility to switch the emission addresses in the Token contracts was required. Also, as mentioned in the Humaniq whitepaper; token emission will continue after the end of the ICO, until the cap is reached due to our process of minting new tokens for each new user. Other new contracts will be responsible for the logic described in the whitepaper. As a result, a function that can change the emission address was added. Of course, technically it can be used for some malicious purposes, however such actions cannot go unnoticed by the community, because all information about balances are public and available for everyone.  Pertaining to the locks in the Token contract, it is a feature created to make migration possible. Despite the absence of a special migration function, there is no problem to implement it off-chain. Even though all balances are stored in mapping, emission of new tokens is only possible via the issueTokens() function, which emits a new event with every call. These events consist of investor addresses and the number of tokens they received.  In the Humaniq tokens contract, we have considered the possibility of locking function in order to implement off-chain migration to another token. This is what the migration procedure will look like: Lock the possibility of token transmissions in the contract from which the migration happens, Deploy a new contract, Transfer users’ balance from the previous contract to the new one (All details of token crediting in the new contract are reflected on our blockchain platform), Unlock token transmissions in new token contracts.  Moreover, due to the provided functionality of balance migrations, it is possible to replace a current token with the new one, which will be more secured and contain fixes for discovered lacks. At least, adding a high bound for the token number according to the whitepaper is the most sensible solution.  Some in the community have sadly and unreasonably framed us as being malicious and untrustworthy. But we can assure, that there was no malicious intent in our emission architecture and the way we designed it.  One one hand it’s a great that we as a community can crowdsource intelligence and collectively help each other out, but on the other, knee-jerk reactions by some in the community assuming the worst in people and ideas is not good for anyone or any new projects in the cryptocommunity.  Every project deserves the benefit of the doubt and at least some time to respond before being convicted guilty - particularly this one, because it’s the first ICO that is focussing on humanitarian issues and publicly shaming it does no good for us inside the community and those looking from the outside in.  We’re happy to discuss these things publicly. We have a defined migration process for the tokens and for attaching a number to the total amount we’ll allow to be emitted once we get final data from our ICO. Anyone who has expertise in Blockchain technology and Ethereum are welcome to join Humaniq on Slack or leave feedback at GitHub. On Github you’re welcome to open new issues or send us a pull request. We’re open to all feedback and happy to discuss the solutions you propose and potentially implement the ones aligned with community opinion.  Humaniq Team",False

Extra due diligence done by Jack from ICOcountdown Telegram:  Okay, where do I start? As first - there are no critical vulnurabilites, like 0-day or something like that, so nobody in perspective could hack the contract and get out whole funds or something, but it is still have some malicious functions, which I will describe.  https://github.com/humaniq/ico-contract/blob/master/contracts/HumaniqToken.sol  As first - look at line 88 /// @dev Function to change address that is allowed to do emission. /// @param newAddress Address of new emission contract. function changeEmissionContractAddress(address newAddress) external onlyFounder returns (bool) { emissionContractAddress = newAddress; } it is mean that they can set any new contract in here in any time and get infinite emitient at they will. Plus, as we see, it can be not just another crowdsale contract, it could be literally any address, which means that they can set me as emissionContract and I can mint myself as many tokens as I want. And in fact it is malicious. This problem could be solved by different ways, for example you can set iterator of changing emissionContract and set the final number of all future ways of crowdfunding rounds - in this case you can do, for example, 3 rounds of crowdfunding and emission waves but no more.  Other simple proposal to solve this problem - is specifiy type of emissionContract, therefore people can see that only real crowdfunding contract could emit new tokens and no one else could.  Locker problem. In fact, when you proceed your ICO you should forbid your buyers to transfer tokens before ICO ends - it is okay. In this case you can firstly set a phase modifiers in enum format like enum ICOPhase { Created, Running, Paused, End } and change state of the contract when it handle some events, or it can be just simple boolean modifier like lock = true In conract of Humaniq it can be found on 42 line (modifier), and this modifier lock ALL transfers of token (line 73,80). You could say - okay, so what is problem? The problem in that their token contract have function on line 98 function lock(bool value) external onlyFounder { locked = value; } Which allow developers to lock all transactions manually in any time.  I repeat - it is not holding the ico contract, which could be useful in some kind of situation, it is lock all tokens transfer and could be used in any times even when ico is done.  When I've asked developers - why do they need this functions and why they need to use it exactly this way - in any time and not only an ICO - they have answered to me, that ""it is need to migrate. when we will create new tokens contract - we will block old one"".  Yes, that is exactly they have said, that they will just block old contracts with all balances when they developed new contract of token's. And that how we finde another problem.  Migrate function is actually doesn't exist. As you know - all balances in token contract is stored in mapping structure and you cannot just pull it out from contract - you need to use getter to get value of balance of specific address. So, as I supposed, they must have some migrate function (or at least prototype of it) which allow them to secure transfer balances from one contract to another. It is a pretty difficult mechanism of two-sides function which must be work on both contracts - ask old one of balance of msg.sender, add this value to balance of new contract and delete same number from old balance - in this case user could choose themself migrate to new contract or not, plus, such desicion allow continue normally work of each contract without blackmailing.  What I have heard from developers - they said that ""we will not transfer balances in smart-contract logic at all, we will have non such migrate function"" - but wait, it is not even possible to do offchain cause of balances data structure - I mean really - I think many developers tryed to pull out mappings, and we are all know, that there is impossible without using of getter, and moreover - you can't do it without knowing of each key of user... so how they actually want to do this?  And all of it just for humaniq token itself and not for ICO contract.  ICO contract - https://github.com/humaniq/ico-contract/blob/master/contracts/HumaniqICO.sol  have also such function as function changeTokenAddress(address token_address) at 201 line - which is really strange thing. I don't even know how to comment it. It's like they can change token contract address in the middle of ICO and so will crowdfund two token contracts? Totally mess, I'm really don't know for what this need and how it could be exploited, it could be a real chaos with such things.  Founder's address Common problem - ico is managed by single account but not of DAO or multisig - have a possability that if key from single account will be stolen - all funds will be stolen as well.

We don't believe in waiting - we believe in action. If we can prove what we doing is viable then we can prove to them it can be done. Then we are more than happy to partner with the likes of the UN, World Bank, and Foundation such as Gates. But saying that we should push a proposal forward using a yet untested technology at these kinds of institutions is a waste of time. They have safer, less risky investments to deal with. These are risk averse sources of funding, they are not VC.  Quote The main technological value I see you may develop is doing secure cryptographic signatures in a smartphone, more precisely, storing a private key securely, even if the device was stolen or lost and the memory was removed and sniffed. Also an app can be reverse-engineered, so your app needs to be resistant to that. Those are security problems that are unsolved unless you use a long password and encrypt the private key with it, I don't see how you are securing a private key without a password here. The software to do facial and voice authentication is definitely valuable, on my own searches I haven't found 3rd parties that do this well which is part of the reason pretty much no one is using facial and voice authentication on money apps. Iris and fingerprints are more common but less secure that a password.  Agree. To a point. We secure it on a central server until we have the technology to do otherwise. And that does not exist yet.  Quote In the paper I read that this is not a charity, therefore (1) how do I make money as an investor in this token? Why are you pushing a new currency when these communities live in countries with an established fiat currency, (2) Wouldn't it make more sense to just digitize that already accepted currency?. (3) How are you going to finance this development after you burn through the pre-ico and ico money, do you have a business model? (no business model found on the paper). And finally (4) What smartphones cost $10-$20 and how are these going to be distributed or sold in developing nations.  Actually the project will be run out of a foundation - which will control and hold all the core software stack similar to Ethereum or DECENT. There will also be a 'profit with a purpose' corporation which will develop and fund development via an accelerator and incubator programme investing in Blockchain startups to build on top of the stack to create more services for the end users.  Quote From my experience living in a developing country, one that is dark in the maps shown in your paper, the only communication infrastructure that many villages and small cities do have is cellular. So these people can call and text on pre-paid telephony plans. Most of them have access to basic phones with no internet and wouldn't afford a wireless internet plan if they had a smartphone. So I'm guessing that for this to work on a massive scale you would need to partner up with telecommunication companies so they give these people access to data related with your app/domains for free (which is what internet.org is doing) and sell them a smartphone for the price of a basic phone that shows their native currency in the app. A way to withdraw those electronic funds in cash would also be good for the money in the app to be accepted as money. For now, I think cash works very well for these places.  Personally I have thought about this alot. And when I was in Nairobi in Kibera, I realised we could be at the mercy of telcos in the country. However, I also know that we are months away from using k-band low orbiting satellite solutions with cheap receiver technology such as Kymeta (Bill Gates backed) which can allow us to bypass the telcos and pull in broadband via the sky. There would be perhaps some regulatory issues - but it's also a chance for Gates to put his stamp on it if we use Kymeta and let's see them fight that war. Telco has their lobbyists in Nairobi in government and all governments but strangling the people from lower cost Internet is a losing war.  If we were to do Kibera - Africa's largest slum, I would come in with a dozen receivers, empower the huts selling mPesa and give them one along with the banking function to convert HMQ to Kenyan Shillings and they become de facto broadband suppliers as well as bankers.  That's just an idea. It's not in our milestones or set in stone. It's one way I have been thinking about how to tackle this.  Best  Richard Kastelein Interim CMO Humaniq",False

For example the UN or the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation ($40B+ fund) is more suited to give $10 to 2B people, they could actually pay for it.  The main technological value I see you may develop is doing secure cryptographic signatures in a smartphone, more precisely, storing a private key securely, even if the device was stolen or lost and the memory was removed and sniffed. Also an app can be reverse-engineered, so your app needs to be resistant to that. Those are security problems that are unsolved unless you use a long password and encrypt the private key with it, I don't see how you are securing a private key without a password here. The software to do facial and voice authentication is definitely valuable, on my own searches I haven't found 3rd parties that do this well which is part of the reason pretty much no one is using facial and voice authentication on money apps. Iris and fingerprints are more common but less secure that a password.  In the paper I read that this is not a charity, therefore (1) how do I make money as an investor in this token? Why are you pushing a new currency when these communities live in countries with an established fiat currency, (2) Wouldn't it make more sense to just digitize that already accepted currency?. (3) How are you going to finance this development after you burn through the pre-ico and ico money, do you have a business model? (no business model found on the paper). And finally (4) What smartphones cost $10-$20 and how are these going to be distributed or sold in developing nations.  From my experience living in a developing country, one that is dark in the maps shown in your paper, the only communication infrastructure that many villages and small cities do have is cellular. So these people can call and text on pre-paid telephony plans. Most of them have access to basic phones with no internet and wouldn't afford a wireless internet plan if they had a smartphone. So I'm guessing that for this to work on a massive scale you would need to partner up with telecommunication companies so they give these people access to data related with your app/domains for free (which is what internet.org is doing) and sell them a smartphone for the price of a basic phone that shows their native currency in the app. A way to withdraw those electronic funds in cash would also be good for the money in the app to be accepted as money. For now, I think cash works very well for these places.",False

Our announcement post has been updated  If you scroll back to page 1, we've revamped it with new information.  Additionally, a lot of you have been asking who our team is.     Our new Chief Operating Officer is Diana Biggs.  https://www.linkedin.com/in/dianabiggs/ She's got a lot of experience with the business and project management side of the startup, and we're happy to have her with us to move the project forward towards our next milestones.  Our current Chief Marketing Officer is Richard Kastelein, who introduced himself earlier in this thread.  https://www.linkedin.com/in/expathos/  Dinis Guarda is a big name in the Blockchain community, and he's one of our chief advisors. https://twitter.com/dinisguarda   We've also recently released a very early Alpha version of our app to begin testing user experience so we can iterate and refine.    Humaniq tokens, HMQ will be traded on the https://spacebtc.com/  exchange after the ICO, and we're working on deals with other exchanges.   Some people have questions about security, how they believe that facial and voice recognition is easy to spoof etc.  We absolutely understand these concerns, and we're not hiding from them.  We're actively working on these challenges as part of the development process, so we're not going to release the app into the wild and then work on security.  We politely ask that people remain rational and analytical.  You're on a bitcoin forum so you're not an unsophisticated user.  Anything can be hacked, everyone knows this, so talking about hypothetical vulnerabilities will result in a never-ending conversation of ""what if"", ""someone could"", and ""script kiddies can..."".  I have a question for you though.  If you're a hacker with the sophistication to break facial and voice recognition, are you going to risk exposing yourself so you can steal $20 in cryptocurrency from someone in Africa? If you trust in the Ethereum blockchain, then you should believe in us, since that's the backbone we're using. In the event that one of our users does somehow get hacked, we'll identify the vulnerability that was exploited and patch it...like every single other software company does. The beauty of the biometric ID system is that there is no email, social security number, passport number, or other data that can be stolen and then perpetually re-used against someone.  I'd to thank everyone for their interest, and for contributing to this thread so far.  We love hearing feedback, positive or negative, because that's how we learn what your concerns and needs are.  Remember, April 6th is the big day for Humaniq's ICO.  ",False

""iamnotback"" might have his faults but the points he has made need to be clarified because they expose points of failure in humaniq's design which  could result in their customers LOSING ALL THEIR MONEY   quoting ""iamnotback"":    if that mobile device is lost, stolen, or accessed even momentarily by a hacker (even if they just extract the keys and device ID perhaps even remotely and don't perform the attack over the user's mobile device), then the attacker only needs to fool the face and video identification system in order to steal the user's funds. They could for example exchange them for Bitcoin and be gone.   Secondly, if user loses his device he has lost his keys. So the only way those keys could be recovered (again meeting your requirement that users don't have to ever mess with keys or store them in a paper wallet) is if some centralized service is storing the keys and can perform a recovery process that identifies the user. But again the attacker can game this recovery process, perhaps unless it is administered by a real human interrogator. And the centralized service becomes a huge attack surface for a hacker to steal all the users' keys (Bitcoin exchange failures show it is a serious risk). And of course as you admit on page 20 of your whitepaper, then it means the biometric identification is not decentralized on the blockchain, but a centralized service.  1% or even 0.1% rates of theft would still be unacceptable.    so spare me your indignation, okay mummy....",False

Blockchain banking app Humaniq has pushed back its ICO (initial coin offering) to a new date in April. Citing restrictions on bitcoin withdrawals from Chinese exchanges, Humaniq’s rescheduled the ICO to take place from April 6th to April 27th. “I’ve been in close contact with our Chinese partners, and our internal information shows us that there is strong interest in this ICO among Chinese blockchain community members,” stated Humaniq founder Alex Fork. “Therefore, we’re going to show some solidarity and good faith to our friends in China, and push back the ICO so that they don’t miss out on early investor rewards.” Fork further clarified: “We’re not pushing the ICO date back due to any organizational challenges. Our team is ready and moving forward as normal. The only reason we’re pushing the ICO back is to see if the Chinese government changes their stance, and for our potential investors from that country to shift their digital assets so that they’re in play to be investors when the ICO launches.”",False

(Additionally I have recently explained that the 10s (coming to 100s?) of ICOs being launched every year now because of this Ethereum smart contract nonsense which enables rapid prototyping of 1000s of hair-brained ideas that will probably never achieve any serious adoption, because again Ethereum can't scale and another smart contract attack means all smart contracts become untrustable, means we likely have a coming ICO graveyard where our ecosystem has died. Thanks to greedy developers who want to cash out after making a fancy presentation and thus don't develop first and launch without an ICO and really don't have much incentive to develop anything at all after they raise $millions to party with, especially young guys who have a lot of energy for conferences, dinners, parties, fancy hotels, etc.. What happened to my generation of startups where we developed them from our bedroom while living at our parents' hose.  The low marginal cost of preparing the snazzy website, whitepaper and perhaps even a barely functional smart contract demo is minimal, perhaps < $5000 or even less. Yet these ICOs can easily raise 100s or 1000s of BTC. So the supply of ICOs rises to meet the demand from gullible speculators who all ""want to buy earlier than each other"" so they all end up buying ICOs, thus none of them buy earlier than each other and the ICO developers walk away with the Bitcoins and the speculators will be left penniless in the coming ICO oversupply graveyard because all the demand will have been transferred to ICO developers who don't buy in the aftermarket.)   NEW PROBLEM!  There is also an inconsistency in the HumanIQ design as expressed on pages 6 and 19-22 in the white paper and the wallet features section of the website.  Firstly, you claim that users will only need to use their face and voice and do not need to deal with passwords. But then you tie the user to one device and also to signing keys stored on their mobile device. So if that mobile device is lost, stolen, or accessed even momentarily by a hacker (even if they just extract the keys and device ID perhaps even remotely and don't perform the attack over the user's mobile device), then the attacker only needs to fool the face and video identification system in order to steal the user's funds. They could for example exchange them for Bitcoin and be gone.  Face and video identification systems are theoretically reasonably easy to fool with synthetic methods, and I expect that to be true even against automated challenge-response:  https://engineering.cmu.edu/media/feature/2016/12_01_facial_recognition_eyeglasses.html http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.461.7360&rep=rep1&type=pdf#page=6 (see Figure 9)  Secondly, if user loses his device he has lost his keys. So the only way those keys could be recovered (again meeting your requirement that users don't have to ever mess with keys or store them in a paper wallet) is if some centralized service is storing the keys and can perform a recovery process that identifies the user. But again the attacker can game this recovery process, perhaps unless it is administered by a real human interrogator. And the centralized service becomes a huge attack surface for a hacker to steal all the users' keys (Bitcoin exchange failures show it is a serious risk). And of course as you admit on page 20 of your whitepaper, then it means the biometric identification is not decentralized on the blockchain, but a centralized service. Centralized blockchain concepts will never scale out. The world won't trust a system that depends on one centralized service. Sorry.  HumanIQ is ostensibly obviously lacking the skills of a qualified, experienced CTO on its team. Afaics, the HumanIQ design is irreparably/insolubly flawed and has apparently not been properly vetted by an appropriately skilled technical person.  Note it is possible to utilize face and voice biometrics stored on a blockchain to prove that the users are all unique within the false positive tolerance of multimodal biometric identification, e.g. perhaps to within a few percent false positive rate for synthetic attacks (at current state-of-the-art) and even better if supplemented with real human interrogation (which would be retroactively objectively verifiable from the blockchain data in the future as the state-of-the-art advances). But for automated logins and identification of users ongoing usage of the system, the false positive rate is currently too high because it would be the theft rate. I suppose you were looking at service providers such as the following and just assumed the EER rates were acceptable without reading the research:  https://www.onefacein.com/faq.html http://www.voicetrust.com/solutions/voice-login/ https://playground.bioid.com/BioIDWebService/LiveDetection https://www.keylemon.com/oasis https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-face-detection-APIs/answer/Ben-Virdee-Chapman  So I also do not understand why the white paper implies we can't store a (hash of a) video on a blockchain. Surely we can.  Please do point out any misunderstanding or mistake I have made in my analysis.   Note that although via deep learning of deep neural nets the state-of-the-art research on face recognition accuracy has reached as high as 99% (and do look at how close to indistinguishable the errors were even to a human observer such as yourself) and state-of-the-art research on voice identification has reached as high as ~1% EER (i.e. roughly 1% false positive with a 1% false negative if compared to a 2.33% EER on page 5), these performance figures do not include data sets where the attacker is trying to game the system. So refer to the links I provided above on synthetic attacks to get a better idea of the risk of theft with multimodal biometric face and voice identification. The state-of-the-art is advancing rapidly because a 2014 paper only cited a 7% EER, but the datasets and training criteria are not probably not comparable.  1% or even 0.1% rates of theft would still be unacceptable.",False

Friends and followers!  We would like to make an announcment about changing of ICO dates.  New dates ICO - 6th of April  - 27th of April 2017!   This decision was made due to situation in chinese trade market. As you know the two biggest exchanges stopped withdrawals of cryptocurrencies. For Humaniq this means that some portion of potential ICO participants who were planning to join our crowdsale won’t be able to participate due to the inability to withdraw bitcoin. Therefore we’ve made a decision to move start of our ICO to 6th of April.  Also as you know 6th of April will be the final day of Blockchain Oscar Startup Competition which we are making with Cointelegraph in Munich  http://events.cointelegraph.com/start-up-competition/  For Bounty Campaign it means it will be longer in 3 weeks and you ll have more time to participate in it!",False

See article here. https://medium.com/@Alex_Fork/richard-kastelein-joins-humaniq-as-cmo-f03feba685ae#.a6fm02naf  I will bring my large network and marketing acumen as well as the full backing of Blockchain News to this project, to help ensure their ICO is a massive success.  Why?  The reason I decided to spend my time and energy in Humaniq is not just because I believe Alex Fork has the knowledge and the Network as Russia's leading Blockchain expert, but I believe in the cause.  For almost a decade I have been lending money via http://www.kiva.org to scores of entrepreneurs in emerging economies because I believe that empowering people (particularly women) with loans to build businesses can lift them out of poverty. And I like to believe I have - by lending my money to many of them to buy extra stock for their little shops or a new cow so they can breed and expand their small farm.  But what makes Humaniq revolutionary is that we have the ability, using Blockchain Technology, Banking 4.0, Mobile Devices and Biometrics - to potentially empower millions of people and bring them into the world of digital commerce and lift many more people out of the horror of poverty and the destitution of living on less than a few dollars a day.  Over two billion people in the world don't have bank accounts. Over three billion people live on less than $2.50 a day.  I believe in Humaniq because it's an organisation that believes in profit with a purpose. It's not like a fat NGO with a CEO on a million dollars a year - doling out free money at people - but rather - Humaniq aims to empower them by giving them economic tools via mobile devices that have rock solid security and identity management features built on the Blockchain.  It's like the old saying:     We also think this will help deal with other issues such as the immigration influx in Europe. Humaniq can help lift people out of poverty which can allow them to stay with their family, their friends and their loved ones rather than having to try to improve their economic prospects by giving what little money they do have to smugglers, risk their lives by getting in a small boat, and cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe. A Europe which is being overwhelmed by millions of economic refugees... putting a strain on European social welfare systems, inciting xenophobia and causing the current rise of the populists - putting European politics on a dangerous path, regressing to ideologies we have not seen since the 1930s.  So yes. Humaniq is more than just banking. To me at least. It's a mission. It's a project that can truly have huge impact across the globe with the support of you and many others  Richard Kastelein Interim CMO Humaniq http://www.linkedin.com/in/expathos (feel free to connect on Linkedin)",False

The problem that we intend to solve - is how to connect the world’s two billion unbanked to the global economy, with all the benefits this provides them. Humaniq has a brilliantly innovative model and we think you’re going to like it.  Humaniq will provide blockchain-based financial services and access to the global economy to users in emerging economies via a mobile app.  We believe this app can create a huge network of users who will access services such as insurance, P2P lending, remote work, and small business loans, all provided by third party companies who will plug into Humaniq’s API.    Let's be very clear: we are not talking about a generic mobile app for a traditional bank, nor are we going to be yet another mobile bitcoin wallet. At Humaniq, we are creating an entirely new financial ecosystem, built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.  And this is truly a win-win - the end users have the opportunity to lift themselves out of poverty, and engage in the digital economy, and the supporters of the currency will have a token that will have stability and longevity - as well as have utility.  http://i.imgur.com/cH7EwlX.jpg Humaniq President Alex Fork, hosting conference with Vitalik Buterin in Moscow   MERGING BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY, SMART PHONES AND BIOMETRIC IDENTIFICATION TO CREATE A NEW PARADIGM  We identified three key questions that Humaniq needs to answer to be successful:  How do you create a fair and equitable system for all users?   How do you eliminate the hardware and energy requirements of mining for new users?    What if many users do not have access to formal identification and are unfamiliar with email and 2FA?   Humaniq is using the well-established architecture of Ethereum, rather than a proprietary blockchain, as the basis of our platform. For this, we are creating our own exchange-tradeable token - HMQ. In addition, our system will also be able to handle transactions in ether, bitcoin and possibly other cryptocurrencies.  We’re using a new concept called Proof of Face (PoF), a radical departure from the energy and computationally intensive PoS and PoW methods used for most blockchain currencies. New tokens will be generated by user actions, such as opening an account, inviting friends, and carrying out other one time actions, so that every user will start with a limited amount of HMQ that they can use to begin interacting with the Humaniq economy.  To eliminate the need for formal ID or emails and complicated passwords, Humaniq is using biometric identification to both register new users and to verify transactions. It will be the first network where every user is guaranteed to be unique.    After discussing this idea with many blockchain and fintech experts and following their very positive feedback, we are now proud to present to you: Humaniq, a new financial ecosystem whose focus is on connecting the unbanked and underbanked, worldwide.  Usage Case 1-  P2P and Small Business Lending A user has an idea to do something productive, but needs capital.  They select the P2P lending function on the Humaniq app and negotiate a small loan with another user.  Usage Case 2- Insurance A craftsman wants to send hand-carved figurines to an international buyer, but the nearest international shipment center is hundreds of miles away.  The seller finds an insurance provider through the app and insures their items so that they are compensated in the event of damage or loss during transport.  Usage Case 3- Remittance Payments A worker overseas wants to send money back to their family, but neither of the parties have bank accounts.  Rather than pay an excessive fee to go through a transfer agent, the worker converts his currency into bitcoin and sends it to his family member, who uses a mobile cashier service to convert bitcoin to the local currency.    Usage Case 4- Remote Work A company has easy online tasks that are difficult to automate, yet not cost-effective to hire locals for.  A Humaniq user selects tasks that they can do, and makes a small amount of bitcoin, HMQ, or ether for their work. Tasks can include things like rating products, providing reviews, or moderating videos.  http://i.imgur.com/FxTOjsc.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/AGuqZfi.jpg   WE VALUE THE COMMUNITY'S FEEDBACK  We are looking for honest, reliable feedback and welcome your suggestions.

You are also welcome to join the discussion on our Slack   A FAIR PRE-ICO TO ACCELERATE THE PROJECT  In December, with little fanfare and a small team, Humaniq more than achieved our pre-ICO funding goals.  The enthusiastic response of our supporters has allowed us to expand our team and begin working on our roadmap. We recently passed a significant milestone by releasing the early alpha version of our app for testing on both iOS and Android.   Total token supply during pre-ICO: 27 914 393  BTC collected: 99.002855  ETH collected: 3122.362977   APRIL ICO  Humaniq’s ICO will start on April 6th and last until April 26th   April 2017→ Buy the smart-contract →Get 1000 Humaniq Tokens for 1 ETH  The ICO will feature a time-sensitive bonus system. People who invest within the first 24 hours will receive a 49.9% bonus on their tokens, while those who invest within the first week will receive a 33% bonus.  The second week will give out a 20% bonus, the third week it drops to 14%, and then falls to 7% during the fourth week.
