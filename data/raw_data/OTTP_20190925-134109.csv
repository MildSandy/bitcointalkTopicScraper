It allows us to recognize a user and display their balance, statistics and give them an opportunity to make bets and interact with the website. Ethereum Wallet provider in this case acts like a bridge between user and Ethereum blockchain, website just helps to address requests to specified smart contracts. Honestly, you can use any Ethereum Wallet provider, e.g. Metamask, Parity, Mist, etc. In the future we plan to open a limited functionality for users who do not have Ethereum Wallet, however they could only watch global statistics and how other people play with each other. To make a bet they have to use any Ethereum Wallet provider.",False

Not posting detailed instruction on how to get in game. We as developers know it by heart now so it skipped our minds completely in all the hubbub of lately. Just tried it on my friend and he ragequit in 3 minutes. Sorry guys. I put a quick instruction how to get in game for you.  1. Basically you need MetaMask plugin installed in your browser, easiest way is to just go to their site https://metamask.io and it will auto-detect your browser and offer correct version. all you need is press install and follow instructions (scroll down agreements and press ""Yes"", memorise (write down) code phrase. etc...)  then goes the following... Looks like a wall of text))) but it's all quite simple really.  To see the whole demo process of the game and play on virtual Eth, You will need: • In the Metmask Plugin, select the ""ROPSTEN TEST NETWORK"" mode (Ropsten Network is completely similar to the real Ethereum network, but with artificial Eth). • Click the "" BUY "" button (buy), • in the next window, click ""ROPSTEN TEST FAUCET"". • A new ""METAMASK ETHER FAUCET"" window will open in the browser where you can request a test Eth by clicking the green ""request 1 ether from faucet"" button in the ""FAUCET"" column, one click sends a request for 1 Eth, the transaction takes 15 to 45 seconds. We recommend to request 5-7 Eth for a comfortable game. • In some cases when the transaction is not displayed correctly we recommend to refresh the browser window by pressing F5. • After receiving the test Eth you will be able to make virtual bets using the Ropsten network, for this, with the active Metamask plugin go to the website of our game https://bets.1to2.pro • Click on the icon with your avatar in the upper right corner. • In the window that opens, in the line DEPOSIT, specify the required value of the replenished wallet, with the value of Eth. there should be no more than the amount you have in MetaMask. For a comfortable game, we recommend leaving 0.1-0.5 Eth in the wallet as transactions are paid from the main wallet, at 0 balance transactions will be rejected by the Ethereum network automatically. • Click the SUBMIT button and confirm the transaction. • Wait for Eth to transfer to your game account (the waiting time is the time of the transaction and is usually between 15 and 45 seconds). • After the funds are credited to your game balance, all the ""bet"" buttons on the tables are automatically unlocked. • After clicking “BET” Metamask notification window will appear, it contains all the info about transaction and the cost of the transaction which will be charged from your main test wallet, click the green button ""submit"" confirming your agreement. • Bets on other tables are automatically blocked until the end of the transaction, to avoid disorientation of the player in the gameplay. • After the transaction, you will be put at the table reflecting the current state of the players. If the draw has not yet passed, you can click the ""exit to the lobby"" where you can bet on any other table • If you missed the draw and won in it, you can see the replay by clicking on your avatar in the upper right corner, you will find yourself in your account where you can see a list of all the games you have won, by clicking on it you can see the replay.

After we get hooked. When I first played dice, even I was confused to be honest, I didn't understand how house edge worked, or even how payout correlated with win chance. But dice was so simple to start with x2 at almost 50/50 chance, and from there, as I loved it and played it more, I learned more.  So for something more complex, the 1-min video would be so useful to hook people.  Algorithms, yes, of course. Serious gamblers on Bitcoin/crypto want to know provably fair, and how it works.

Quick example on how it works - if you feel 50/50  Let's take ""1/2 Table""  - Number of players   2 players - Bet per player   0,05Eth. - Bank total   0,1Eth.  The order of the draw: There’s only one spin at the table for a total of - 0,09Eth. - Each player is issued with the number 0 or 1 (in order of connection, the probability of winning does not change) - Number is drawn by random number generator (0/1). - The winner is the player - whose number coincides with the number of the drawing. - Thus, the probability of taking away 0,09Eth for any player - 50% probability of losing - 50%. - Chance of a player to win - 50%.  If you feel more cautious there are always x/x tables for example 4/4  - Number of players 4 players - Bet per player 0,32Eth - Bank total 1,28Eth  The order of the draw: There’s four spins at the table for 0,288Eth each. (4 times rinse and repeat steps 1-3)  1. Each player is issued the number 0,1,2 or 3 for the drawing. (on order of connection, the probability of winning does not change) 2. Number is drawn by random number generator (0/1/2/3). 3. The winner is the player - whose number coincides with the number of the drawing. 4. The probability of winning in this case, equals  68.36%, the gain ranges from 0,288Eth to 1.152Eth. 5. The calculation of probability: the probability that in each drawing the player did not win 3/4 * 3/4 * 3/4 * 3/4 * 100% = 31.64%. The probability of winning (1-3 / 4 * 3/4 * 3/4 * 3/4) * 100% = 68.36%. 6. Total: Chance to win for a player - 68.36%.  The results of the lottery and its distribution: - Players winnings   1,152Eth - Jackpot Fund   0,0256Eth - Fund for attracting new players   0,0256Eth - Investments recovery fund   0,0128Eth - Dividends for investors   0,0384Eth - Project developers   0,0256Eth  EXAMPLE: 4 draws - 0,288Eth  The first draw the number of the first player - 0 the number of second player - 1 the number of the third player - 2 the number of the fourth player - 3 Number of the first drawing: 1 RESULTS: The second player has 0,288Eth. The other players 0Eth.  SECOND DRAW the number of the first player - 0 the number of second player - 1 the number of the third player - 2 the number of the fourth player - 3 Number of second drawing: 3 RESULTS: The fourth player received 0,288Eth. The other players 0Eth.  THIRD DRAWING The number of the first player - 0, the number of second player - 1, the number of the third player - 2 the number of the fourth player - 3 Number of the third drawing: 1 RESULTS: The second player has 0,288Eth. The other players 0Eth  FOURTH DRAWING The number of the first player - 0, the number of second player - 1, the number of the third player - 2 the number of the fourth player - 3 The number of the fourth drawing: 2 RESULTS: The third player got 0,288Eth. The other players 0Eth.  TOTAL FOR THE GAME: The first player has received 0 Eth. The second player has received 0,576 Eth. The third player has received 0,288Eth. The fourth player received 0,288Eth.   About “provably fair” we think we did what we think is best to prove it - we removed “House” from the table completely, we – developers, earn only 2% from each table no matter who wins, and last, but not the least, don’t have The Server or any hardware in the game, to remove any suspicion that game is tinkered with somehow after audit at GitHub. Well this post (in short) is already mile long and atm I struggle how to squeeze it into short video, while idea is awesome, and you gave me quite a creative challenge )))  There are also questions about “Why not games of skill” to put in it.
