Again I appreciate your due diligence.  As I said before there are new contribution addresses every 20/30 users, the two you have are 2 of the addresses that have been assigned to you.  Many ICOs do this for security purposes, for example Quantstamp undertook a similar method for their ICO.  I agree the telegram channel is quiet at the moment, I believe everyone is patiently awaiting the ICO's conclusion.   And lastly, our association with the bounty manager in question was unfortunate for this projects reputation. However, he did do his job well for this project and all the bounty funds were distributed to participants upon it's conclusion. As for his other projects we don't have any comment as we are not involved in any of them. If you have issue with him I would recommend taking it to him directly.   EDIT: The likely reason for the number of bots in the channel would be people taking advantage of the telegram channel airdrop we are currently running. It is an unfortunate side effect of running such a promotion but it has helped with the popularity of the project.",False

I appreciate your intrigue, it's great to see people doing due diligence on projects they are interested in  The Keyrpto ICO is structured so that every 20/30 users have a unique contribution address, so the address you are viewing is the one you have been assigned to, but is definitely not indicative of the total contribution amount.  KYC is required if investors contribute more than 10ETH to the ICO. When contributing less than 10ETH the investor still needs to accept the conditions of the sale before receiving the contract address. This is based on advice received from Keyrpto's legal team.   If you have any other questions feel free to ask",False

Moreover, there’re stock exchanges. There’s no great difficulty, thanks to KeyPRTO, for example. People need a convenient platform against the background of the growth in the volume and popularity of payments. This is what KeyRPTO offers. As for exchanges, it’s necessary to have some skills, at least basic ones. There’s big choice for currencies on the exchanges, but what are there on the basis of a platform for exchange?  At the moment there’re the main ones, such as bitcoin, Eth and other basic ones. There’re no local currencies yet, but it’s planned to add them. However, we need to evaluate and understand the demand for them. What does the service give to work with crypto currency? What advantages? KEYRPTO creates an environment between the seller and the buyer for the exchange of products with crypto-currencies with the minimum risk of fraud. This worries everyone and is a key priority for today.  But isn't that a service that Bitpay is already providing? Correct me if I am wrong please.  Bitpay integrates itself into already existing websites, so it's a little bit different. They also only accept bitcoin, where Keyrpto will accept all major cryptocurrencies. Keyrpto will be creating the entire e-commerce platform specifically for crypto based on the blockchain instead of overlaying wallets on-top of existing websites.  That being said we do have competitors in the space, but that's no surprising given the size of the e-commerce market. We fully expect there to be a number of crypto based e-commerce sites in the near future the same as there are many fiat based e-commerce sites currently.  Sounds like you have reasonable expectations about competition and so on. I like it and it's good to have a team that doesn't make unrealistic claims or promises. Thanks! The team are extremely knowledgeable and have certainly done their due diligence in the area.  Quote from: mrjoy15 on February 14, 2018, 09:36:48 AM Look upon over the product.

Does it mean that this is just one more similar project? Are u sure of its financial effectiveness??  It isn’t “one more project”! KeyRPTO is a revolutionary platform for e-commerce rather than for protection of transactions only. It’s created for small enterprises on the base on blockchain in order to let them trade goods and services basing on the basic cryptocurrencies. This allow to stand out. What’s the uniqueness of this project? It’s in safe environment between the seller and the buyer for exchange of products and cryptocurrencies. Moreover, the project’s app offers a possibility to seek for necessary services and goods and KeyRPTO’s operation algorithms are simple and reliable. By the way, i don’t think that such features are provided anywhere else. How is it possible to make purchases for cryptocurrency via the app and a platform? Which algorithm is used?  It’s carried out with the help of KeyRPTO escrow procedure. As for payment, it takes place in Escrow only after the delivery is confirmed. The procedures are simple and transparent. How is Escrow carried out? What is this procedure necessary for?  Escrow is carried out on the blockchain through a smart contract. It is necessary to ensure that all transactions are safe and secure from fraudulent activity.",False

Quote from: SixFigures on January 31, 2018, 09:27:04 AM Quote from: hollybit on January 31, 2018, 07:01:16 AM Quote from: slavonicpl on January 31, 2018, 06:58:03 AM The project’s gonna to reach the level of largest e-commerce platforms. There’re e-Bay and Amazon mentioned. Is it really possible to reach such result working with crypto currencies?  Look, crypto currencies arent different from traditional currencies in terms of circulation. The only difference today is that they’re less liquid and locally distributed. When more trust is generated and received, they will be able to match the traditional ones. In this case, the goals from your example can be quite achievable.  But there will most likely also be only one Amazon, too. Any platform with a native currency that is dependent on the overall business activity will die along with its currency if it gets outcompeted. Although our token has its own ecosystem within the platform, the platform itself can utilise a number of other major cryptocurrencies. Users of the platform do not need to only use KYT tokens, although using them does come with many benefits.  Quote from: gavrosh on January 31, 2018, 08:47:58 AM How will the store be based on the platform? What will you need to provide as materials?

The ecosystem is essentially made of merchants and consumers, which is managed by the Keyrpto team",False

Quote from: ber68dclass on January 28, 2018, 02:16:09 PM According to the WP, in case of fraud there will be a thorough investigation. What tools does the platform operate on? What can be done in this case?  As mentioned above all the funds are held in escrow via a smart contract, so if fraud occurs we will be able to investigate the claims of both parties before releasing the funds to the correct person.

If it's an idea from dev, I'm sure this big project will be getting better, because from logo alone it has a very high success impression. Hopefully smoothly for this great project Thanks Tony!!  Quote from: app2endad on January 28, 2018, 11:47:56 AM Does the mobile app of the startup involve any specific requirements for gadgets that are used?

As for the exchange of crypto currencies and fees, it’s clear to me. But will the buyer and seller be protected? First, both of them are protected in a certain sense by the basis of the project - the blockchain, which allows you to know everything about the participants of the ecosystem and individual transactions in the long term. There’s 100% protection against unsuccessful delivery, incorrect delivery, lost cargo, incorrect goods, the goods that dont correspond to the description implemented for the buyer. I’m acquainted with blockchain. What about protection of the seller? In this the first role if played by protection from fraud on the part of the seller, as well as transaction monitoring, encryption, which doesnt allow falsification, conversion of crypto currency. Yeah, as i understand, the company took care of both sides! i’d like to try it out or find the reviews of those who has already done it. I forgot to add that in case of disputes there will be an investigation and full support will be provided at each stage. The company is focused on the client and it is commendable. Do creators have a desire to add any other related services to this project?  Good discussion guys! At this stage we are focusing on the e-commerce platform essentials, we will add other features as the project develops",False

When you compare projects side by side you will see a lot of different features within the token metrics, fee structure, platform design, back-end technology, partnerships and advisors, etc.  For example, we implement a token burning metric utilising a portion of our collected fees, where others do not. Our platform will also feature special events and deals for our token holders and platform users to encourage use and create an enjoyable shopping experience. Another notable difference will be our search engine optimisation algorithm for use within the platform which will enable quick and easy searches and also the option of shops to increase their standing within each search.   It's easy to look at 2 projects in the same market space and say they are similar but when you look close enough there will always be differences, and these differences are what creates diversity within a sector. In e-commerce some people simply prefer the user interface of one platform over another, or they prefer the stores/products available through a certain website, etc. This personal preference is why there are many e-commerce sites currently running concurrently around the world.  We are not bold enough to say we will be the one and only crypto based e-commerce platform in the world, but we are willing to say that with our plans moving forwards we will be one of the best.",False
