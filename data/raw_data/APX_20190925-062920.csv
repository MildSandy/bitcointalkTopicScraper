My name is Richard and I will be assisting the team with physically running the mining aspect of APX. Ace has asked me to give you an update on the mining operations side. For those of you that are unaware, I own the Misty Mountain Mining farm that APX will be purchasing a small stake in initially. To address some concerns about mining ROI that I have seen, I can confirm that I actually achieved this goal last year mining Ethereum. Mining Zcash and Zclassic since their respective launches has also bought me double ROI and everything in between has been bunce. In addition, we expect to ROI within such a fast time (3 months) because of the good deals we have managed to negotiate for the equipment and our strategic mining selection together with the expertise of myself, Ace and notsofast. To conclude, whilst the goal is lofty it is more than achievable and we like a challenge.  However, there is a bigger model here than focusing on just ROI and drip feed future income alone. In the current system within Crypto and as we see in bitcoin, miners and users do not work in the best interests of one another but they share the usage of the same network. Miners can hold the network to ransom and the users end up counter attacking and it generally ends up being not healthy or beneficial to the system. We need to look no further than Bitmain and Core/Charlie Lee for BTC and LTC respectively.  Now what about another system, whereby the miners work for the users. More specifically, the users 'own' the miners and the miners work to provide new minted cryptographic assets that will be paid back to the users (APX holders).  For example, Misty Mountain offers a smart contract whereby an APX owner and only an APX owner can rent hash in BTC to mine a coin like Zcash for a set period e.g: 24 hours. For this, an APX holder would pay an amount of 0.095 BTC into the smart contract and receive 0.10 BTC worth of Zcash after the 24 hour period (effectively a 5% discount).  The miner is partially owned by the APX, he doesn't mind taking a 5% hit on his margins, especially if the machines have already paid off the initial investment. He also has the guarantee that his fixed costs for those 24 hours are going to be paid by the APX holder which mitigates his risk significantly. APX holders then get a 5% bump on their mining proceeds for the day which will effectively create a yield which would only come from owning APX tokens.  This is a new principle that is not seen elsewhere in Crypto (even holding physical gold comes at the cost of storage and zero yield) and the system only works if the miners and the coin are run by the same group of people. Rather than minting new coins like a Proof of Stake system and creating market sell pressure, effectively the value will come from other coins. A variant of a Robin Hood inspired system, take from them and give to us. Combine this with a deflationary model and you have an asset whereby the supply decreases and you also have the ability to attain a yield through discounted mining smart contracts.  The journey ahead will not be easy, there will be setbacks and trying times but we intend to weather the storm. Our first goal is to confirm that our ROI estimates are indeed realistic and this will serve as a testing period. Pending successful results we will scale the mining operation accordingly by increasing the hashing power proportional to the number to APX users before we expand the offering. This theory is not a done deal, we have hurdles to jump over first but if all goes well this is the big vision for the mining operation side of APX.  Today I am unpacking and assembling a 5 x RX 470 mining rig as a test machine to run performance and energy consumption numbers on multiple coins. Next week I will post my results and a few pictures too as we near the ICO launch date for APX. Questions are welcome and I suggest joining the APX telegram where you can chat to the team directly.  - Richard   Link to Official Telegram for APX Ventures",False

We are not trying to outcompete already existing mining operations. However, as our mining operation scales up, this might be a possibility.  2) Although places like China may provide for lower maintenance costs, our competitive edge comes from our ability to negotiate good deals for the mining operations along with the expertise and experience provided by The APX Team and its advisers. We will be actively managing our mining operations so this is not your typical mining operation where you just set your miners to mine just one coin the entire time. Various strategies will be employed to accelerate ROI. This will involve mining both large cap and lower cap coins.  3) APX Ventures is willing to take a small cut in profits in order to provide further use cases for APX. We will be integrating APX into our mining operations in the future. Before we take another step we want to confirm that our estimates are indeed accurate through our short testing period. We will be scaling up mining operations accordingly after the testing period.  This post from notsofast should provide some more insight as well...  Quote from: notsofast on April 21, 2017, 02:56:27 PM In some cases, to preserve speed and knowledge advantages, I won't even have time to disclose what is being mined until the play is complete. Much like I do personally with my own mining now.  The basic mining program will attempt to speculatively mine single coins that have a good chance of price growth that would beat current multipool baselines. From time to time, as opportunities arise, I will be pulling some or all our available hashpower into time-critical mining plays.  The 3-month ROI is a very tall order Ace has given me to fill, but on a small scale like we're starting with, it's not impossible. The last mining unit I bought, I ROI'd in just under six weeks. I researched and mined a coin that was fundamentally undervalued and out of the spotlight to do that. There are plenty of similar opportunities out there.",False

Thank you.  If you have any questions, please join our slack or telegram.  We will be providing easy to follow video instructions for how to participate in the crowdfund and how to move your $APX token   Please note that slack and telegram are our main methods of communication    FAQ   Q: How will APX be issued?  A: APX will be an ERC20 issued on the Ubiq network. Ubiq is an alternative to Ethereum with lower inflation and some technical improvements.  Ubiq currently has the highest valuation of Ethereum alternatives after Ethereum Classic. An easy to follow step-by-step guide will be released before launch in case anyone experiences difficulties.   Q: How do I get APX?  A: The crowdfund will run for approximately 21 days beginning May 1, 2017 at 11:00:00AM PST and ending on May 22, 2017 at 4:59:59PM PST or until hard cap is reached. This will take place through Bittrex Exchange.   Q: What is Ubiq?  A: Ubiq in one page   Q: Will APX be listed on exchanges?  A: Yes, APX will be listed on Bittrex one day after the donation period ends. Furthermore, the APX Team will look into the addition of APX on additional exchanges. The crowd fund will conclude if the maximum is reached or on May 22, 2017.   Q: What can I do with my $APX?  A: The APX Team will be working to continuously provide $APX with various use-cases. We will be buying back and burning $APX acquired through our buyback program. Our first project, which is the Crypto Review platform, will accept $BTC and $APX for access to any premium features. Any other projects funded by APX Ventures will also integrate $APX usage in a similar fashion. There will most likely be a slight discount if paying with $APX to incentivize users to pay with $APX. This is further down the line but another use case for $APX is that we will be exclusively accepting $APX for discounted rental contracts for our mining farm. These are only some of the use cases for $APX, we have several more that we will reveal in due time!    Q: How does voting work?  A: The APX Team will issue parallel voting tokens by airdropping them to accounts holding a minimum of  500 APX. These parallel voting tokens will be strictly used for voting purposes. New tokens will be issued for each voting round.  Step-by-step instructions will be provided for this process.   Q: Will there be escrow?  A: The crowd fund and escrow will be conducted via Bittrex Exchange.   Q: What will the APX Team do in case of a hardfork for Bitcoin?  A: Please refer to our statement regarding potential hardfork. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1879453.msg18683920#msg18683920   Q: Are there any more details about the mining operation?  A: Please read this   Q: Are there any bounties?  A: Marketing is not a large priority for this project but we do have a small bounty program for Twitter which can be found here.",False
