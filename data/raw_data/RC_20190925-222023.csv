How can we stop this tyranny? Are we slaves to this paper. Must we file it and transport it all over the world? Millions are trees and millions of gallons of oil are turned into receipts so that we ultimately throw them in the garbage. Wouldn’t it be amazing if all our digital filing was done for us and all those precious trees saved at the same time? On top of that if we can better track where our objects are we can make better use of our resources and waste less. These are reasons for product tracking, ownership tracking, on ReceiptChain.   ReceiptChain is an enhanced digital receipt injected into the BlockChain that only the current owner can edit. ReceiptChain is a Smart Contract standard much like the ERC20 token. It is the REC10. Using IPFS, state channels, and side chains we can implement images, document proof hashes, any supplementary data to define the identity of an item or purchase. The difference with ReceiptChain is that we are creating a public standard and scalable receipt standard.  The other main consideration of is the ReceiptChain app where consumers will be able interact with the blockchain directly bringing the blockchain to the people. Anyone should be able to create Receipts for their goods. Anyone should be able to track, trade, and verify their goods again and again like craigslist for non-fungible goods. This is the purpose of the ReceiptCoin token to help end users add digital records to the block chain to encourage the re-use and tracking of the products we already have. This will create more efficient use of resources and less waste on our planet.  The primary product is the ReceiptChain application. ReceiptChain is an application to create and manage digital assets. This will create a global asset tracking system as well as a new category of property. Competitors we will disrupt are Amazon, Ebay, Craigslist, OfferUp and LetGo. While these companies provide sale, they do not provide inventory services or ownership tracking. This new service provides customers with a way to inventory, catalog for insurance, catalog for accounting, find, share, auction, authenticate, and re-sell goods. This product is marketed to everyone.  The revenue model for the application is fee based. Most services in the application are free but blockchain interaction requires a fee. For example changing ownership costs around $0.10. This cost may also be covered by a ReceiptCoin token.  There are other logistics tracking companies on the Blockchain. Walton Chain and VeChain both track logistics for companies internally. Neither of these companies uses a public blockchain or provides interoperability or universality of goods tracking. They also have the problem of insecure blockchains. A private blockchain may be more easily counterfeit than a public blockchain. ReceiptChain data is verified by a network of thousands of computers all sharing an identical copy of the Ethereum blockchain. That copy would have to change on every computer in order change past data. The Ethereum blockchain has only been rolled back once and this event was very public and disputed. A private blockchain has no such restriction and may be rolled back without the permission or visibility of the community. On a private blockchain only the company involved would need to roll back the data. Being on a public blockchain is essential to verification and authenticity.  Our second product is a business to business API designed to allow other businesses to consume our data. This will allow other applications to pull ownership and metadata into their applications. This allows applications to provide better information about products or buy and sell products without creating their own copy of the product meta-data. A sneaker application might want to display if a sneaker was at some point owned by Nike. We also plan on partnering with companies to create official accounts. These accounts would be the first owner of goods upon manufacture. This product is marketed to businesses. The API is to be used for a fee per bulk quantity of transactions.   www.receiptcoin.io Youtube Telegram Discord Slack Twitter Github Android wallet Iphone wallet coming soon Reddit Whitepaper Explorer Quanstamp audit Facebook Medium Logo  Trading:   Idex.market Tokenjar.io ReceiptCoin ForkDelta",False

Almost all modern Point of Sale receipts are printed using an inkless process with chemically treated paper. That paper is usually doused in plastics scientists now believe may be harmful to human health.  Not just humans, these plastics affect animal health as well and in similar ways. Since most animals are smaller than humans, the effect can be even greater. Waste water deposited into oceans, rivers, and lakes brings these chemicals to even the smallest creatures.  ReceiptCoin aims to eliminate the paper receipt once and for all. ReceiptCoin makes the receipt completely digital, traceable, verifiable. A modern receipt for a greener world.

ReceiptCoin replaces Enterprise Resource Planning, Warehouse Management Planning, and Manufacturing Execution Systems with one inventory system. A system that tracks goods from inception to end of lifespan nearly effortlessly. A system that will reduce waste and inefficiency using the power of the blockchain.  REUSE Once a product is sold to a consumer, ReceiptCoin continues to track it using the power of the blockchain. Soon, ReceiptCoin intends to implement a Letgo / OfferUp style marketplace as a demonstration of this capability. ReceiptCoin will be able to verify and track previously owned goods with exceptional accuracy and efficiency.  RECYCLE Once goods end their lifespan, they can be recycled — if they can be located and sorted. The promise of ReceiptCoin is to have already located and sorted items ready to be recycled. Using the transparency of the blockchain, ReceiptCoin has the power to transform recycling into the norm, rather than the exception.  THE THIRD INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION  “[Economist Jeremy] Rifkin’s vision is already gaining traction in the international community. The European Parliament has issued a formal declaration calling for its implementation, and other nations in Asia, Africa, and the Americas are quickly preparing their own initiative for transitioning into this new economic paradigm.” — https://www.foet.org/books/the-third-industrial-revolution/ Economist Jeremy Rifkin, favorite of Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, posits a Third Industrial Revolution. Rifkin’s Third Industrial Revolution happens when modern data meets energy efficiency. The Internet of Things, and the data they generate, will enable huge energy savings, boosting productivity exponentially, completely transforming the way our world works. “Then, if what we do produce is shared: Share the cars; Share the homes; Share the toys. We’re distributing a circular economy over and over. Nothing needs to go to the landfill. Every resource is always there for us.” — Jeremy Rifkin  ReceiptCoin is a key component of Rifkin’s Third Industrial Revolution. ReceiptCoin interfaces with the Internet of Things, exponentially increasing energy efficiency, helping preserve the natural environment. Both ReceiptCoin and the Third Industrial Revolution are about eliminating waste and improving efficiency. ReceiptCoin is a part of Rifkin’s future and all our futures.  “Your generation is moving from ownership to access, from markets to networks, from consumerism to sustainability, from market capital to social capital…it’s a revolution.” — Jeremy Rifkin",False

In the life cycle of a product you can categorize these services as before point of sale and after point of sale. This is where ReceiptChain steps in. ReceiptChain tracks the complete product life cycle saving everyone who buys, sells, lends, and uses the product time and money.  ReceiptChain is the software, to authenticate, upon inception, track through logistics, sell in the initial marketplace, and then resell for customer. Although the owner may change hands many times, the product information remains the same. This is the identity of the product. Placing the identity of this product in many data silos requires the reproduction of this data over and over again. This can be improved by storing that data in one place. For ReceiptChain that data is stored on the ReceiptChain blockchain and then audited by the Ethereum main chain to ensure it’s history is immutable.  Like Waltonchain and VeChain, at ReceiptChain we have software for enterprise to efficiently store vast amounts of ownership, custodial and other descriptive data during the supply chain and logistics phase and then use the same or parts of that data in marketing. Our backend tools can add bulk quantities of products to the blockchain with private key encryption that verifies the source of the data. NFC Chips and RFIDs can be used as physical identification. Popular ERP, inventory and tracking solutions can be easily modified to read ReceiptChain blockchain data. At this point our phone app and website can be used to track the products. Unlike Waltonchain and VeChain, ReceiptChain is based in the United States and has usable software today.  Like VINChain, this data can then be reused by the customer to make purchase decisions. Our phone app. The phone app shows displays the history of the object from inception and displays the registered logo of the authenticated creator in the application. On point of sale the ownership of the product is transferred to the customer and shown in their inventory. Unlike VINChain our software is not limited to automobiles and available now.  Like Syscoin, soon the customer will also use the ReceiptChain app to find and purchase the product. This creates a global search engine for things. Like Ebay and Craigslist, secondary products may be bought and sold. Unlike Ebay and Craigslist item descriptions don’t need to be re-created each time the item is made and the history of the item is known. Products can be paid for using cryptocurrency like Ethereum and Bitcoin. Your bank won’t freeze your account when you need to withdraw $3,000 and you won’t have to walk around with it in your pocket at 2AM.  Unlike any other product the customer has a personal inventory of their items for insurance, location tracking using NFCs, popular Bluetooth chips, or reselling later. This data can be used to lend and rent products efficiently keeping track of the owner and user. These records encourage products to be reused, resold, and recycled.  Many of these new blockchain projects are valid and note-worthy, but we believe at ReceiptChain that they are limited in scope. Blockchain technology can be used as a universal data silo. It can be used to create a single identity for individual products or titles. This identity can be used for all the purposes that we use products. We have built this universal tracking blockchain and it is functioning now. You can try it for Android and iOS at ReceiptChain.io.",False
