I do from time to time ride my mountain bike in the summer and enjoy it, but if I could somehow report my activity to the app and be rewarded for it, well, then it would do it for me. I hope this project succeeds. It has a great hard-working team behind it and already a app in the works that is going to be released soon.",False
