Worldwide Point-of-Sale and Mobile Payments platform based on Blockchain technology and a 100% asset backed crypto currency making Wyrify the only really usable Blockchain payments tool in the world! Wyrify is a fully regulated public listed company, under name change from Stockholm IT Ventures AB, on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, making this one of the most reliable and trustworthy ICO's.  We have changed the core of cryptocurrency to make it useable in the real world. Weâ€™ve removed mining by using a non-diluting transaction protocol. Weâ€™ve speeded up transaction times to match those VISA uses. Weâ€™ve increased security and increased anonymity, but also opened for users to conform with KYC/BSA regulations should they desire to do so. Weâ€™ve constructed apps, software, hardware and usage solutions for both merchants and users, making something never seen in crypto currency before. Weâ€™ve created a team incorporating some of the leading companies in their representative sectors of cryptography, payments and point-of-sales developments. And combined it in one platform â€“ Wyrify.  Want to join? You can actually be part of this fantastic project right now! Join our ICO and invest in a public listed company where participants will jointly get 30% of the company's net profits for 5 years! Don't miss this great opportunity to be part of something revolutionizing. We accept both BTC, ETH and regular oldschool card payments and have placed 200,000,000 tokens available for participants who wish to make money now...

However I am not entirely sure how a so-called ""bounty campaign"" here on this forum works? But to make things easy we offer unique URLs for anybody who believe they can attract investors, so anybody signing up through that URL will automatically assign a 10% bonus to the referer. Just email us for details.   Do you anticipate getting listed on any exchanges? Yes after the ICO is concluded we will be listing the WYR Tokens on exchanges.   A publicly listed company could issue shares and bonds as well to fund it's plans.... Giving up future profit for instant capital is very much how the bond works. What is the reason you go to the ICO way rather than the traditional and trusted way?
