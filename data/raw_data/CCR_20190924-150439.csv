But then we felt that anything to everything in this cryptocurrency ecosystem needs the support of cryptocurrency community to succeed. What could be just better than getting the whole community involved.  Usually our backers will be the one who are already active with cryptocurrency exchanging and ICO investing. Which means our backers are automatically our potential users. People do share what they back and believe in.  Our clients receive cashback, our token holders receive rewards, participating crypto-firms(exchanges, icos) pays nothing until the client makes business with, this makes it a win-win  situation for the whole community. In this way the service truly becomes for the community by the community.  As of now we don't have a private investor and the project is backed by the founders of Kapsus Technologies Limited. In case of crowd fund not reaching the soft cap, we will be left with two option: 1) The founders will fund in the difference or 2) Contributors will be refunded.  In order to make sure of the soft cap target to hit we are coming up with 3 month long active marketing campaign to spread the word. Keep in touch.  Best Regards.",False
