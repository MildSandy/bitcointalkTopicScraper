We actually expected such amount of investment, as we didn't pay a lot for advertisement and were a bit short of time, we didn't attract promoting agencies, we implemented everything by our team starting from brainstorming. However, we're proud of our current result and now we have enough funds for a huge marketing campaign and to provide a finished product (working word.expert platform) before ICO to convince investors contribute more to our project. Yes, we already have one company who will invest in our project after PRE ICO. We'll inform everyone about it!",False

I already contributed to this pre-ICO a decent amount but I am seeing that so far there is only $26,000 and by checking about other ICO's of other cryptocurrencies I find that they all raised from$200,000 to $100'000,000 and maybe 20,000 backers instead of the 129 on this one so far. So I know this is just starting and not only there are still 5 more days to go on the pre-ICO but then there is the actual ICO. Is the amount expected to go much higher once the actual ICO kicks in? Are the bigger companies waiting to invest a lot only when the ICO kicks in or something?

During PRE ICO we collect funds for development of the future platform WORD.EXPERT and for marketing expenses during ICO. That’s why during ICO we’ll show the platform and hold a tremendous PR campaign. The interest to WORDCOIN will increase and its minimum price will start from $1. 2. WORDCOIN cost during PRE ICO is much cheaper. During this stage its exchange rate into dollars will be defined, counted by the total contributions amount/2 000 000 WORDCOIN. At first day of PRE ICO the exchange rate of WORDCOIN reached 2 cents. That’s 50 times less than initial rate of WORDCOIN during ICO stage. 3. 2 000 000 WORDCOINs will be automatically distributed between all investors of PRE ICO in accordance with smart contract conditions.  This means that during PRE ICO investors will receive a large amount of WORDCOINs, which price is much lower than 1$ 4. As the finalized version of WORDCOIN will be presented and more tremendous PR campaign will be organized at ICO stage, we plan to attract the main part of contributions during it. By the way, all the PRE ICO participants will receive 3% from the contributed funds at ICO, which will be distributed proportionally to their invested amount.  5. We can’t influence all the mentioned activities, as they’re totally automated and are locked into smart-contracts. Investors receive all bonuses and transfers in a decentralized way according to smart contracts conditions. The contract is posted on GitHub, and everyone can check its details and understand that all the contributions are secure and profitable.",False

We have a few points to think in a different way. Why? Because there're no similar freelance platforms in the world, which can provide such a multiplyer effect, as ours. For example, there're lots of translation services, but to proofread it, you have to find an additional resource. To post the translated article on the controlled websites, you need to order service in the third place. And the total comission can be really significant! Our platform combines all these services in one place, users don't have to waste time on registration on many resources, they'll get the needed cumulative result on the same platform! That fact automatically excludes PR agencies fees, which can reach 60% of order price. It's not profitable for companies to register on a few resources, they'd better use PR agencies services and overpay.   Our future users will already get their rating before entering Word Expert platform (I mean current bounty participants). Newly-registred users will also get bonuses for registration! The addtional advantage is that the problem of international transactions and currency convertation will be solved. WORDCOIN has no limits and doesn't depend on legislation of different countries. This fact and the fact, that there will be translation options into more than 60 languages, will make Word Expert more attractive on the global level and no similar platforms in the world can provide the same advantages!",False

We accept that there're many similar ICO projects on the market, but regarding Blocklancer and BitJob we still have found a few significant differencies:  Bitjob  Bitjob is a really great project, but it has a few differences from us: - it's aimed to students market, which is very narrow; - student don't have enough experience for implementing many kinds of works, reducing the number of clients; - it's possible to use both tokens and fiat money on their platform, leading to insufficient demand of token, which influences its rate growth.  Our platform combines complimentary freelance services with the market volume more than 1 trillion dollars. And the only payment method will be WORDCOIN, issued in 100% amount. Because of its decentralization, WE platform excludes agents' fees and resource owners profit with the help of smart contracts. That's why clients pay less, and authors earn more (at least +30%). This fact and an active PR campaign will allow to attract 10 million users within 1 year. Taking into account WORDCOIN rate will grow 150 times.  Blocklancer - In Blocklancer project a token is a share in the company, in WORDCOIN it is the cryptocurrency, supplied with services; - Blocklancer platform has the possibility for centralization, WORDCOIN is totally decentralized platrform; - In Blockchainer docs it's not mentioned which freelance services will be provided (in which field, I mean), WORDCOIN mentions the field and the services, which provide multiplier effect, being combined together. WORDCOIN team has experience in the providing the mentioned services around 12 years; - In Blocklancer token owners can take part in disputes between clients and authors, WORDCOIN uses rating and review system, which will not waste the time of our token owners and let the argument being resolved between two parties (clients and authors).  - In Blocklancer it's not clear whether the services will be provided globally, In WORDCOIN the services will be avaiable in more than 20 languages. - In Blocklancer investors may be interested in getting profit from 3% comissions, in WORDCOIN case the investors can predict the rapid growth of WORDCOIN rate, as more and more users will keep joining the platform, and it will become more and more popular.  Both projects are really nice, we hope them all the best!",False
