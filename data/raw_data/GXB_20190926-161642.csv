GCBIB will bridge the gap between emerging and traditional financial services by being the first fully compliant crypto-friendly bank having the necessary regulatory framework and technology infrastructure. Though there are other financial institutions, banks and crypto-exchanges operating in the same space, many are not fully compliant with prevailing banking laws, while some lack a strong technological backing.  At GCBIB, we are establishing a Cryptocurrency-based financial institution like no other. We are breaking the mould, creating a seamless conversion between Fiat currencies and cryptocurrency with our GXB token, which is ERC2O compliant and hosted on the Ethereal Mainnet blockchain platform. Weâ€™re bridging the gap between traditional and emerging financial markets, enabling a cryptocurrency holder to liquidate their holdings in a secure and compliant ecosystem. Weâ€™re also empowering markets and businesses to accept cryptocurrency payments. All together, we arenâ€™t just leading the way in cryptocurrency-based financial services, we are creating the future.  ICO STAGES: 2 ICO DATES: 20 Nov, 2018 - 31 Jan, 2019",False

And you will charge interest on debit savings? Will it be based on the current exchange rate for the dollar or for cryptocurrency? For example, in Bitcoin, I open your deposit at 20 percent per annum. And at this time Bitcoin from the current 3863 during the month rises to $ 15,000. How will interest be calculated?",False
