However, as most of these organizations are using centralized ledger systems in which all of the financial information are gathered and controlled exclusively by central system, fundamental problems are inevitable in managing costs such as information security cost, hardware purchasing costs, branches and manpower costs, etc.  Under this circumstance, financial organizations are imposing more and more fees on users. In addition to transfer fees and exchange fees, some banks not only impose fees on opening new accounts but also require deposit as security.  These problems on banking and financial systems cause users increase of financial expenses. As the result, 40% of adult population in world became financial exclusion who can not open any bank account.  Problems on current Blockchain  There have been aggressive efforts to create ecosystems utilizing existing Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies. However, it is still not easy to apply Blockchain into and to use Cryptocurrencies in everyday life  It is because Cryptocurrency itself is an evolving new industry and more importantly because most Blockchain and Cryptocurrency technologies have two defects that don’t fit into daily life. The first defect is transmission speed.  Real-time high transmission speed is critical in order to use Cryptocurrencies as payment means, however there are big inconveniences because it takes at least 10 up to 30 minutes in using representative Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum for paying in shops or for transmitting between users.  The second defect is the high transmission fee. Transmission fee is 4 dollars for Bitcoin and 6 dollars for Ethereum. It may not be a big problem when transmitting big amount, however having to pay fees at 4 dollars or 6 dollars when transmitting small amount like 10 dollars in daily life is certainly a big problem that acts as an obstacle in becoming a payment mean.  Many Cryptocurrencies are trying to solve these problems, however, due to the ever-increasing block size, no solution has been introduced yet.   Aaron Platform  Objective/Goal  Aaron System’s Aaron Platform is to solve these defects so everyone can have free and easy accesses to banking & financial services and can exchange each and every nation’s currencies, Cryptocurrencies and furthermore digital currencies such as mileage and reserved points, at fast and convenient level.  By applying new decentralized banking technology, Aaron Platform can drastically save banking and financial management cost, and through utilizing MultiBlockChain technology that use EveryCoin as key currency, it can ensure convenient exchange of each nation’s currencies, cryptocurrencies and digital currencies.  Composition / Structure  As a decentralized financial platform, Aaron Platform runs based on the following 4 systems.  (1) TabiPay  The first system is TabiPay that enables free banking service. With TabiPay, a Cryptocurrency, Aaron Platform provides the safest and the most convenient deposit, withdrawal, exchange and transfer services.  - Everycoin Standard System, Baht Deposit  TabiPay is a Stablecoin that operates as a consortium Blockchain type allowing only designated nodes to participate in consent.  TabiPay is Everycoin Standard System that is based on EveryCoin. This means that EveryCoin should be deposited at the same level of issued TabiPay. It is like that certain level of gold should be deposited in order to issue dollars.  Also, cash from sold TabiPay will be kept in bank in THB to guarantee 100% exchange security. Thus, more use of Tabipay results higher demand of EveryCoin. This means that although TabiPay stays at fixed value level, the value of EveryCoin goes up.  - Usability  Furthermore, TabiPay can be used in an easy and convenient way in daily life.  Any person who does not have bank account can open Aaron System’s account by downloading TabiPay APP and can deposit and withdraw money at Aaron System’s dealer shops and partner shops. Also, with smart phones, TabiPay can be transferred at any time 24/7 without fee through TabiPay APP.  TabiPay has been fully developed now, and is planned to launch its service in Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia from the first half of 2019. Then, the service will be expanded within 10 Southeastern nations and later to global level, allowing real-time free transfer service around the world.  TabiPay has already launched Prepaid Card Service with which card holders can use anywhere in the world and withdraw money from it.  (2) Eco-Chain System   Ethereum created an ecosystem with a platform that can generate various tokens based on Smart Contract technology.  Developing one-step further from Ethereum technology, Eco-Chain System of Aaron Platform provides ecosystem in which Blockchain can be used for not only cryptocurrencies but also digital assets.  We have various digital assets besides cryptocurrencies around us.  Various marketing tools such as mileage systems of airline companies, reserved points of online shopping malls, reserving points systems of franchise companies, and game moneys and items of game companies are all subjects of safe and convenient digital assets when applying Blockchain technology.  The estimated size of global digital asset market is approximately 200 billion dollars and it grows rapidly every year.  Eco-Chain System provides services with which any corporations and individuals can set up and manage digital asset management system at minimum cost level by allowing them to easily issue and manage Blockchain based digital assets.  Within Eco-Chain System, digital assets can be easily issued and distributed so various benefits such as safe trade, increase of value, exchange to other currencies, etc. can be realized. Also, Eco-Chain System will contribute to increase value and usage of EveryCoin acting as a SideChain of EveryCoin.  (3) Aaron Markek  The third system is Aaron Market.  - Concept  As a global exchange market for cryptocurrencies, Aaron Market will be open in the first half of 2019, in accordance with “digital asset business law” of Thailand.

Through TabiPay and EveryCoin Base Market, Aaron Platform can achieve double benefits of safe trade using the fixed value currency characteristics of TabiPay, and profit realization of EveryCoin.  - Withdrawal Strategy  Lastly, withdrawal service around world.
