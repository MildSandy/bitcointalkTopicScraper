Pre-sale is a period when a blockchain-based project sells coins of tokens ahead of “the main event”, and participants usually receive a deal, a discount for starting early.  Many of the pre-sales are grouped by categories representing predominantly trading, investing, finance and gaming industries, with some exceptions. Not a single one falls into the category of “home services” or even services in general. Except for one.  Taskfair positions itself as a “decentralized, on demand home service platform with a mission to revolutionize the gig economy”. The company, which was started by a duo of entrepreneurs Pavel Popov and Vadim Volgin in 2016, has built its platform prototype for p2p ordering of handymen and home improvement specialists in the United States. Popov and Volgin are already thinking big – in a little over two years they want to launch the app and the service in 24 markets in North America, Europe, Asia and South America.  Popov and Volgin are proud of Taskfair, their beloved child. With Taskfair, anybody can turn to blockchain, they are saying, from your suburban housewife to your favorite electrician. They are convinced that projects, such as Taskfair, can popularize the blockchain, which was the mecca for only geeks and speculative investors some six months ago....",False

Today we are extremely pleased to announce that we will be integrating Taskfair with the Origin Protocol to further our mission of a fair and efficient blockchain-powered marketplace.  Origin Protocol enables both traditional marketplaces and fractional-use or sharing economy marketplaces to function in a completely distributed way using Ethereum and IPFS. We are excited to be collaborating with the talented Origin development team, which is based in San Francisco. Origin is a highly pedigreed company — they are backed by Pantera Capital, and the founders have a long track record of success.  Partnering with Origin and their development team will allow us to get to market faster and the shared network effects of being an Origin partner will make user acquisition and adoption easier.  We’re very much looking forward to tackling the complex technology and product challenges in achieving our vision. Together, we will build a more fair, price-efficient, safe, and censorship-resistant home services on demand market.  “Taskfair is a great example of a project that is trying to create a more fair and open marketplace for gig economy. We are very excited that Taskfair has decided to implement the Origin Platform and we look forward to collaborating with Taskfair and their team.”  — Josh Fraser, Cofounder, Origin Protocol.  “We are very exited about partnership with Origin. Together we can build a better future for gig economy. ”  — Pavel Popov, Cofounder, Taskfair.
