You are here because Cryptocurrency, blockchain and ICO capture your attention. Just like us, you are crypto enthusiasts who see colossal prospects and potential in new technologies.  Our mission - supporting the pioneers of brilliant ideas in quickly implementing them.  We have combined the principles of crowdfunding, ICO and accelerators, when the authors of ideas receive the most comfortable conditions, allowing them to quickly put up their companies for discussion and fund-raising, and provide a convenient platform for everyone who wants to support them.  ""The author of the idea is like a kid who is just beginning to walk, he stumbles and falls, gets up and goes again. We tell him to keep his eyes on the ground, be persistent, focus on the goal, draw the right conclusions from the falls, that in life one needs to take responsibility for themselves and that it's no one's fault when you fall, but your own. We direct him with advice so that he successfully reaches the goal. And when he's able to walk by himself, we watch and admire his success""  This document describes the platform that runs in test mode in English and Russian languages, and the plan for the development of the Idea Jump project from 2017-2026.  We identified 7 main problems that are typical for crowdfunding and ICO platforms in many countries around the world, and offer their solution: 1. The ICO is not regulated legally. 2. Slow publication of projects. 3. Most platforms are not multi-lingual. 4. There is no identification of token buyers, and persons who acquire them for cryptocurrency, may not have proof of legality of its origin. 5. There are risks of theft of funds by dishonest project authors. 6. There are difficulties in converting large sums from various cryptocurrencies, raised on the ICO, into fiat currency by the project authors. 7.  There are no legal mechanisms for obtaining funds from the project authors and token buyers during the ICO.  A partnership program is implemented on the platform, which allows everyone to earn money.  To help our project, participants need to buy the ""iJproject"" tokens, which are released on the waves platform.  We invite you to participate in five stages of selling tokens: 1. The first stage: the sale of tokens worth $ 100 thousand will be held in December 2017 2. The second stage: the sale of tokens worth $ 1 million will take place in January 2018 3. The third stage: the sale of tokens worth $ 10 million will be held in February 2018 4. The fourth stage, the Pre-ICO: the sale of tokens worth $ 100 million will be held in March 2018 5. The fifth stage, the ICO: the sale of tokens worth $ 1 billion will take place in April 2018  * The timing of the 2 - 5 stages of tokens sale can be changed, based on the results of the first stage.  Goals by the end of 2026: Idea Jump 2 platform be created and additional resources supporting 103 languages 256 branches of the Foundation are opened and effectively working in different countries of the world implemented ideas through the platform in the equivalent of $ 192 billion  All those who support our project will be part of the change in the entire crypto economy towards a speedy legal development, bringing it to a whole new level.
