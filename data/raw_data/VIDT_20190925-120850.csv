Blockchain-powered, on-demand, secure verification of any digital file.  Rotterdam, September 16th, 2018 An unfortunate consequence of our increasingly digital lives is the risk of fraud, manipulation, and tampering of digitized files. This risk is mitigated through the advanced V-ID data validation service and authenticated on the DigiByte blockchain.  The V-ID concept began in the WIDIDI software studio, a UK/NL based company that has been building secure online platforms for sensitive information management since 2008. These days, V-ID is a separate company. V-ID has a minimum viable product (MVP) and is currently in use by several organizations such as, Airbus Defence & Space, WildRadar Fauna Management Platform, fiber network Vitrumnet, JWC Superyachts and the Maritime Cyber Alliance.  Once validated, the documents can freely be copied, distributed and renamed, while still keeping their verified status. Recipients can verify that the contents of the file are exactly the same as the originally published document. V-ID is also compliant with recent GDPR guidelines, as it does not store the actual digital file or require personal data for validation.  Marnix van den Berg, Lead Development at V-ID: “The DigiByte blockchain will empower the V-ID corporate services with great transaction speed at low costs. Combined with the immense spread of the DigiByte network, it is a superior store of publicly accessible and timestamped V-ID data”  According to Rudy Bouwman, Chief Marketing Officer at DigiByte and Co-Founder of the DigiByte Awareness Team: “Enhancing Cyber Security and making the Internet a safer place is a long-term mission of the DigiByte blockchain. We are excited to see the DigiByte foundational protocol being used by companies like V-ID who require fast, safe, and highly decentralized transactions. The ability to authenticate digital files without a third party will not only reduce fraud, but open the door to new opportunities and innovation.”    About DigiByte and The DigiByte Awareness Team (DGBAT)  DigiByte is the fastest, most secure and most decentralized open-source blockchain. The DGBAT is a community driven marketing and education campaign to promote awareness and utilization of the DigiByte blockchain. For more information about DigiByte please visit www.digibyte.io. For additional information about DGBAT, please contact info@dgbat.org or visit www.dgbat.org.  About V-ID  V-ID uses blockchain technology to end all document fraud. The V-ID validation service allows organizations to validate the identity of their documents. Those documents can then be verified on the blockchain.   Read more about V-ID’s validation process here: https://medium.com/@pim_vee/v-ids-file-validation-process-explained-fc592782e14a  Recipients know that the content of the document is unaltered and exactly as originally published. V-ID’s utility token, called VIDT, is the backbone of their business process. VIDT is currently available through their token sale, and will be listed on at least one exchange before Q1 2019.

The first steps were taken in the past year, now the market introduction follows.   “Digitization is also taking place in the notarial profession. Blockchain-based certification of diplomas is a logical step in the provision of services . The possibilities of blockchain technology offerings in combination with the reliability and service are a logical combination.“ according to notary Christian de Kok.   “It is easy to copy or modify digital documents, and there are daily reports of fraud or manipulation of documents. Because it is seen as time-consuming and costly to validate documents, proper validation is hardly done. Verification is also absent for the same reasons. For example, when applying for a position, diplomas can be submitted, but establishing authenticity is a laborious process.“    Therefore, the combination of the blockchain-based V-ID platform and the notary practice is ideal. This makes new forms of services possible, which means that, for example, authentication can also be done at more accessible locations without sacrificing reliability. After all, De Kok has identified this party in person before a he or she validates a document in the blockchain. “This is old-fashioned notarial control in a new way.”  eKo Notaris will start offering V-ID powered services for document validation, validation of documents of identification. They combine those services in 8 packages with his notary-specific offerings, like legal document audits.  “Blockchain technology still is new and has had some start-up issues. V-ID is one of the first blockchain applications that are practically applicable.”  Validating documents with V-ID is easy and cost effective. Also verifying documents is simple and fast: you can check the integrity of the file within 5 seconds with a normal internet browser.   “This is a significant improvement in the current and poorly secured methods with digital signatures, passwords and cumbersome actions in Adobe Acrobat” says De Kok.   Nowadays it is very easy to distribute files on a USB stick or through the network. With V-ID, these documents can be validated in one click. As a result, verification will actually be done much more often in practice than is currently the case. This is a logical step towards further fraud prevention.   With V-ID, documents can be validated without the issuer having a copy or register. This makes it easier to comply with the new GDPR privacy legislation and the legislation surrounding the retention periods for documents.  The V-ID Token Sale is now live!

We check the organisations that publish these documents (KYC). Our software extracts a 'digital fingerprint' of each document using advanced hashing functions developed for the NSA and US military.

The increasing digitization brings us a lot of benefits, but also risks, including document forgery and identity fraud. V-ID offers a breakthrough solution with which the authenticity of documents can always be determined.  Student Sports Management and Entrepreneurship, and also professional footballer at Sparta, Sander Fischer, is the first graduate whose diploma is recorded in the blockchain. Sander has followed the bachelor’s program especially for top athletes, that is offered in cooperation with the VVCS-Academy.    “Super fun! Blockchain is the future and this is how I learn about interesting new applications, plus I am the first graduate bachelor student in the Netherlands whose diploma is recorded in the blockchain.” Says Sander Fischer.  Arjan Ebbinge (VVCS), Han van Gorkom (HBO Drechtsteden), Sander Fischer (Sparta) en Pim Voets (V-ID)  HBO Drechtsteden issues certificates and diplomas for successful students and course participants. By storing the digital fingerprint of these documents in the blockchain, diploma fraud is prevented. The diploma can always be checked for authenticity.
