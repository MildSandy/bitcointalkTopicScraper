There shall be many.  It's all still in the works but I'm always open to suggestions if anyone comes forward with something neat, novel and presentable/functionable. Anything that gets the word or tokens efficiently out there, will be considered.  But please, no spamming with stuff like offers for running a banner in your signature or lame stuff like that which ANYONE can do. I'm not running that sort of bounty program. I really need people to bring quality stuff to the table. You wont just be collecting a bounty. You will be building a rapport with the founders and team for future projects. Meaning, I'll keep you in mind for the next project when or if it comes along.",False
