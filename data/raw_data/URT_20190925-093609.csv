And the answer is we really don't think it's so niche â€” employee rewards and recognition are HUGE in corporate america and in many other countries. Also, there are no competitors in the space, it adds real value while solving an existing pain-point.

I am sure you can understand that I would point out also that these people I am talking about probably do not even have a phone,,, maybe old nokias is maximum I know because I see it myself,,, or internet. I know the project is good in the sense that it rewards employees and recognizes them for their contributions. But a lot of those hard workers, especially those who are not recorded (I guess projects call them unbanked) would not take advantage. The employees you speak of are in urban cities, where they do outsourced work. But I am talking about the sweatshop workers who are not even on the books of these large US companies you talk about.  Great idea yes, but I just feel employee ideas can be even more disruptive and reach out to even more people,,, of course I know the world cannot change Maybe one day I will ping on Telegram.",False
