XchangeCoin (XCC) is an exciting new crypto currency that allows users to exchange their crypto currency for legal tender/government issued currency at all XchangeCoin outlets within minutes. Users can also send crypto currency to family and friends that can be picked up in any currency desired at convenient XchangeCoin locations.  WHY XCHANGECOIN/PROBLEM TO BE ADDRESSED & THE SOLUTION  Current problem Unlike in America and Europe where there are numerous options allowing users to change their cryptocurrency into fiat, Asian and African customers have far fewer options. Currently, the most popular option is using exchanges which usually take up to 10 to 15 days to process and gain access to your funds. This option also requires the customer to have a bank debit card or credit card.  This process is lengthy process & time consuming & it discourages new users from entering the cryptospace. The hostile regulatory environments and conservative institutions have made it harder for people in Asia and Africa to access the exchanges.  Solution At XchangeCoin we want the user experience to be quick, efficient and easy. Our goal is to have our retail outlets made available in major cities across Africa and India, in convenient locations such as mall kiosks, along with retail shops in every major city.The concept is very similar to Western Union or Money Gram.  EXPLAINER VIDEO    XCHANGECOIN REVENUE MODEL  XchangeCoin revenue model allows for a 10% service fee for all cryptocurrency conversions. Once a customer provides cryptocurrency to XchangeCoin our proprietary reselling software, Payment Integration 2.0, immediately sells the cryptocurrency on the leading crypto-exchanges which offer the highest currency rate. This prevents loss due to coin fluctuations or market corrections. XchangeCoin will accept the top 100 Market Cap coins allowing for customers to have a variety of choices on the coins they can use.   OUR ROAD MAP     CORE TEAM       OUR PARTNERS  ",True
