The development of the Golder Platform will allow GLDR to be used for other games. Our founders expect that the continued interest in the WAR FIELD game (with development of additional battlegrounds) and the development of the Golder Platform and extension of it to new games will create additional demand for GLDR, leading to their appreciation.  Our vision is to use the Golder Platform to offer new games in the future that would use the same GLDR token, meaning we expect the Golder Platform to continue into the foreseeable future and beyond. We are investing 60% of the funds raised during the Token Sale Event into the best damned marketing campaign you’ve ever seen. We will also be adding new features to the WAR FIELD game and, in time, adding new games to the Golder Platform, allowing coins not only to be withdrawn and traded, but to be moved between games, as well.  Once the Token Sale Event ends (Mid-November), GLDR will be fully tradable like any ERC20-compatible tokens, and will be listed on major exchanges. More information will be announced before the tokens are unlocked and become fully tradeable at the end of the Token Sale Event.",False

I'm not sure that there are no cheats for browser games, and after all if the game becomes popular, then with such an economic platform, the cheaters probably will come  Every game is recorded and monitored. Our system automatically flags unauthorized alterations and actions for review. We will also review any complaints we receive. If we determine that cheating has occurred, the responsible player or players will lose their GLDR and be banned. Any winnings received on that basis will be refunded from the responsible player or players’ account.

Yesterday we released the game (it was available for people who lives in the territory of Continental Europe, Great Britain, Ireland, Eastern United States and Canada), it was a bit delayed, due to some last minute testings, which took us a little bit longer than expected. Apologies for the delay. We collected all the reports from our warfielders who tried the game, we looked thru their notes, suggestions and issues they experienced during the first launch. It is very important for us to follow that information, so that we could improve the game here and now, and make it even more attractive to players. At the moment, the game is not available again, since we are making some updates from technical side. These updates expected to be finalized by 8 AM GMT, and the game will be on again. However, please, be patient, because if we see any kind of issues, we will have to update the game again and it will not be available till we finish the updates. Please, understand this process as a natural thing while building something incredible because it takes some time and we do care a lot to make it as good as possible. In the future, the graphics will also be improved as well, same as some extra features added. Don't underestimate the team of 8 people, who knows what they are doing, who does it with all their hearts and really works for it, and not only takes place in a team. As one of you mentioned, video games are an art. Yes, we agree with that. But people do get money while making the art, so why not to get money while doing what you love -playing the games?

In this game of “kill or be killed”, there’s a price on your head in real cryptocurrency. Real stakes heighten the intensity and mean skilled players get real rewards. Every player is required to choose an amount of GLDR tokens to stake on his or her life. This amount represents an initial “Life Cost”. When “injured” in gameplay, a player loses (surrenders) a certain amount of the GLDR (s)he has staked. A player gains GLDR from another player by “injuring” or “killing” that player. Every “hit” from a bullet or other weapon causes “injury” to a player's character and a certain amount of GLDR is transferred to the player who has caused the “injury”. If the balance of GLDR a player has staked as his or her or “Life Cost” reaches zero, the player’s character “dies”. In the event of “death”, gear that a player has purchased is not forfeited. It remains with the player and can be used for new “Lives”. WAR FIELD matches players based on skills and equipment to ensure fair chances for all. Battlegrounds according to their level of skill, weapons, and other hardware.
