Thanks to the transparent, fast, secure, auditable, and tamper-proof nature of data transfer and exchange on the decentralized ledgers that form the backbone of blockchain systems, businesses and industries of every type have benefited from this cutting-edge technology. From transportation, logistics, and secure identification protocols to fintech, healthcare, and governance, few industries, if any, have not yet launched blockchain-based initiatives of their own.  However, one standout industry that has yet to leverage the benefits of this new technology is the world of cosplay. That is, until now.  The term ‚Äúcosplay‚Äù was coined in the early 80s from the words ‚Äúcostume‚Äù and ‚Äúplay‚Äù. It involves people dressing up as characters from video games, television shows, books, or movies. Cosplayers sometimes even act in character while in costume, making their cosplay part dressing-up, part performance art....",False

You may want to check the following threads:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3443147.0 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3488441.0 https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3597531.0  The thing is that:  1) Anon11073 sent 30 source merits to announcement threads, including 10 sent to cosplay token threads. 2) Anon11073 participated the signature campaign on 6th April. 3) Anon11073 counted his/her posts between 2nd to 5th April before wearing the signature to make his/her post count in the first week to reach the minimum 10 post requirement.  The issue 1) conflicts with his position as a merit source, who is supposed to award the source merit to high quality posts in the forum.  However, Anon11073 sent the source merits to his/her favorite coins:     Clearly, Anon11073 is using source merits for personal uses, which is inappropriate way of using source merits, though he claims that he didn't receive money from devs.  Furthermore, it looks like 3) is a scam by Anon11073 exploiting his position as a bounty manager.  But Anon11073 claimed that this counting is usual and applied to all the participants.   Quote from: Anon11073 on May 05, 2018, 03:18:33 AM Well, I will repeat. In this bounty campaign, past postings of the participating week are also counted. This was the same for other participants.  However, it turned out that Anon11073 is the only person who benefits from this rule, and the rule does not apply for all other participants.  Nevertheless he/she still claimed that it is no problem:  Quote from: Anon11073 on May 05, 2018, 03:18:33 AM There certainly was no other user applicable, but posts when not signed were also counted. I did not add a rule. If I do a bounty campaign in the future, it will count in the same way.  A trusted Legendary member LoyceV, who has been in the forum for 3 years with green Trust [11: -0 / +2], wrote that such a counting is actually unusual:  Quote from: LoyceV on May 08, 2018, 11:04:56 AM Quote from: cotiniber on May 06, 2018, 09:29:50 PM He claims that posts before wearing the signature should be included; in this case his posts made between 2nd to 5th April, even though they were posted before wearing the signature I've never seen or managed any campaign that counts posts like this.  Moreover, from the very beginning, 2) itself, the fact that Anon11073 participated his/her own campaign, was questioned by many people.  In general, it is not recommended for the bounty managers to participate their own campaigns as it's a conflict of interest:  Quote from: LoyceV on May 08, 2018, 11:04:56 AM Quote from: mangkanor on May 06, 2018, 11:14:55 PM The bounty managers are  normally shouldnt be in the spreadsheet,because the ICO developers would pay these people weekly and having those accounts in the spreadsheet is clearly an abuse Even if it's all according to the rules, it's a conflict of interest. I've excluded myself from entering any of the (Bitcoin) giveaway campaigns I've managed in the past, even though Admin told me I could join too. Conflicts of interest can lead to biased decisions, or at least it can appear to be biased. As a campaign manager, it's in your own interest to prevent that from happening, and I choose being neutral over a quick buck.  Quote If this is something the person paying for the advertising is okay with there is no issue here. It is not your place to tell others how to conduct business. As a campaign manager, I would strongly advise against this if a company asks for it. So far I haven't read whether or not they knew about it.  We would suggest you guys to check the above threads and consider these issues on Anon11073 carefully...",False

COT is aimed to become the token of the cosplay community, used for both online and offline (e.g. cosplay events) trades among cosplayers, photographers, prop makers, fans, event organizers and companies.  The platform has an international community with more than 720,000 members in 180 countries. Available in 12 languages, the platform has more than 6.5 million images and up to 430,000 people follow the platform‚Äôs official social media accounts.    Watch the video   Cosplay growth graph:   Cosplay Industry  The cosplay industry is growing at a rapid rate. The growth is evident by mainstream adoption, large-scale involvement, popularity on social media websites and conventional media as well as growing revenues and the increase in the momentum of development.    Cosplay Token Crowdsale: https://cot.curecos.com/token-sale/  **This ICO excludes US and Japan.   *The total amount of COT including your bonuses will be distributed after the Crowdsale.    COSPLAY TOKEN ON QRYPTOS   Participants can ALSO purchase COT on QRYPTOS here: https://www.qryptos.com/ico/COT   Problem and solution  Since the onset of COT service, the community platform has identified five major challenges facing the economy within the cosplay-sphere, which it intends to solve ‚Äì  Sharing of content revenue ‚Äì Allocating smart contracts for better revenue management. No copyright issues or revenue sharing hiccups. Access to settlement accounts ‚Äì No need for additional settlement accounts or bank accounts. Quicker fund access. Transparency and trust ‚Äì Better identification, evaluation and safe exposure. Value actualization ‚Äì Receive evaluation by users and perfect your craft. Valuable market insights that actually garner praise. Globalization of information ‚Äì No loss in translation and a true globalized sharing platform for all arts. Better global structure of art-sharing.  Additionally, using the Cure WorldCosplay ecosystem, players will be able to create and distribute their own personalised coin. This unique feature will help bring power back to cosplayers, enabling them to monetize themselves and their art. Using these coins, the interested audience can tip players, make purchases, and allow cosplayers to develop deeper relationships with their fanbase.  Currently, the ecosystem plans on issuing coins for payments, tips, incentives and reputation‚Äìmaking the platform a one-stop shop for cosplayers and fans. The approach also steers clear from third-party platforms and gives the power to the artists and the creators.
