After speaking with the team behind Qryptos, Quoine, and hearing about their plans, we were particularly impressed with a number of the aspects of their business and operation.  Qryptos are one of a handful of exchanges to meet our stringent requirements of security, regulatory compliance, and user experience. We were particularly impressed with the approach Qryptos takes in securing user funds, utilising cold-storage BTC multi-sig wallets coupled with dedicated private servers, effectively mitigating security concerns that plague many other exchanges. We are also satisfied that that the order matching engine and user analytics provided are best-in-class, providing a highly streamlined user experience during trading.

The first is quan- titative, dictated by the efficient market hypothesis, that an asset’s trading market value is intrinsically linked to the microeconomic performance of the asset. The logic behind this driving force is so simple as to be almost trivial – that the collective action of every trader taking a position in an asset will encapsulate  all  information  about  that  asset,  thus  driving  it  to  an  equilib- rium reflecting its true value.  However, traders do not take positions based on  their  belief  of  an  asset’s  price.  Traders  do  not  take  positions  based  on their belief of an asset’s future price, either.  Traders take positions based on their perception of what other traders believe about an asset’s future perfor- mance.  This nuance leads to the second force responsible for determining price action in stocks: participant sentiment.  Read more: https://sharpe.capital/whitepaper.pdf",False

The first hedge fund was created in 1949 by A. W. Jones, whose contributions to the field foreshadowed modern portfolio theory.  Jones suc- cessfully ’hedged’ his positions by taking long and short positions to insu- late his fund, and utilised leverage (borrowed capital) to increase his returns. Arguably  one  of  his  greatest  achievements,  however,  was  foreseeing  what cognitive  science  and  behavioural  psychology  would  only  come  to  under- stand half a century later:  that participant or traderemotionscreated trends in  asset  price  action.   Jones  argued  that  price  increases  generated  opti- mism (or confidence) in an asset, fuelling further price increases, resulting in  a  positive  feedback  loop  causing  an  asset’s  price  to  deviate  from  its  in- trinsic value, such that these trends could be identified from following price action.  Jones quickly realised that to determine the best long and short positions,  he  should  not  rely  on  chart  watching  alone,  but  should  source sentiment from those with a stake in market performance. Therefore, he cre- ated a system whereby he invited brokers to select their favourite long and short  positions,  simulating  running  live  portfolios  from  these  stock  picks. Jones utilised these predictions to select stocks and positions for his hedge fund, rewarding brokers in proportion to the value of the predictions they provided.   Through  this  method,  Jones  was  able  to  achieve  substantially improved returns on his investments.",False

It allows any party to instantly purchase or liquidate the smart token in exchange for any of its tokens it holds in reserve. The price of that token is continuously calculated according to a formula which balances buy and sell volumes.

Indeed, as a security the value of SCD is a direct function of the performance of the underlying fund. SHP, however, provides an income stream of ETH with no potential loss of SHP (unlike prediction markets), simply for using the sentiment platform.

While 2017 has seen some enormous raises through token launches, and we were optimistic of reaching our original $60MM target, the market landscape has undeniably changed. One of the many things that sets Sharpe apart from the rest is that when the community speaks, we listen, and we act. We’re fortunate enough to have the benefit of hindsight from many recent ICOs with extremely large caps, and while raising enormous sums of money, in the process this led to a saturation of demand during the crowd-sale period, and subsequently, a supply-demand deficit in secondary markets once tokens become tradable on exchanges. These problems will only be exacerbated when company tokens vest and enter circulation during an already bearish market.'",False

From what I've seen out there, nothing exists like this project. Here's why...  If you are comparing Sharpe Capital to projects like Numeraire (which there have been many comparisons); Sharpe is very different to Numerai for 2 reasons. Firstly, Sharpe will run their own proprietary quantitative models on a cloud-hosted architecture. Numerai is ""crowdsourcing"" models in an attempt to reduce overfitting, this probably wont work - what if all of the models are really overfitted?  Secondly, Sharpe offers an additional way to earn ETH, by providing forward-looking asset sentiment. Did you see the recent blog post with the Sharpe mobile app designs? By linking the sentiment to proof-of-stake and reputation, they are basically able to ensure they are sourcing the highest possible sentiment. Checkout section 6 of the whitepaper for more detail on this.  The sentiment gives Sharpe other revenue streams, such as selling data feeds to hedge funds, something I'm not aware Numeraire are doing. Quantitative modelling alone is not good enough to predict future stock prices, without a way to accurately measure investor sentiment. Taking into account investor sentiment essentially solves the problem.  A few other noteworthy competitors to mention: (1) Santiment; (2) Xinfin. In regards to Santiment, some of their revenue streams are comparable to Sharpe's. Sharpe seeks to capture investor response to consumed media at a cognitive-behavioural level, as opposed to merely infer 'posifive' and 'negative' sentiment from that media. In reference to Xinfin, they are offering an enterprise grade private Blockchains. Sharpe plans to offer this too, only it's being built on top of the Trustless Ledger System (one of the golden nuggets in this project), to offer blockchain based internal auditing/transactional solutions.

So, contextual frame analysis (CFA), is one of the more hypothetical elements of the platform. It is not necessary for its operation, but we believe it would serve to further reduce risk and increase returns by improving accuracy as compared to the more standard sentiment analysis approaches - of which there are many.  In the simplest terms, CFA is an attempt to capture how language use (contextual frames) drives decision making. The seminal example given is the 'Virus vs Beast' study by Thibodeau and Boroditsky (2011), in which an identical article about a crime wave - except a one word difference - is shown to two groups of people. One article used the word 'beast' and the other used 'virus'. The consensus of the group that saw 'beast' was that punitive action should be taken against the criminals, however, the group that saw 'virus' leaned strongly toward rehabilitation. When the people in these groups were asked to justify their decision, nobody mentioned the virus/beast word usage, and quoted data/statistics from the article.  (See pp. 28-29 in our white paper)  That is, people came to opposing decisions while justifying them with the same data, driven by the contextual frame in which they saw the data. We are working with Mieke, a linguistic & expert in frame analysis, to develop a strategy that enables us to determine whether these 'contextual frames' are more likely to drive an investor toward 'bullish' or 'long' vs 'bearish' or 'short' when consuming news media and other data sources from which they make their investment decision. Underpinning this theory is the concept that decision making is, to a significant extent, emotional - even when investors insist their actions are data driven, they are ultimately slaves to the cognitive decision making processes we all evolved with.  At the moment we are developing a manual CFA process based on 'traditional' linguistic frame analysis as a proof-of-concept on a relatively small number of news articles, as this is a novel idea in both investment and linguistics. Once the relationship between frames and responses is established in a few key examples, we will quickly scale it to operate on a large scale using natural language processing techniques within artificial intelligence and machine learning, such that our algorithms can learn to optimally identify contextual frames based on historical data. We aim to have this operational along with the rest of the platform - however, this is a scientific endeavour, and as such may be subject to further development before we release it in the wild.  It is probably the most exciting of the linguistic analysis approaches we're taking, but it is not mission critical to operation of the fund - it will simply serve to enhance it.  Let me know if you have any more questions. If you're interested in the linguistics side of things, Mieke hangs out in the Telegram group.  James",False

Most of whom have said they will keep an eye on our crowdsale, and make a decision once they are able to gauge demand for the token. We have recently launched our pre-sale registration form, which is helping us gauge demand before the sale actually opens, and also gives those who wish to contribute to the pre-sale some piece of mind that their contribution is guaranteed (https://sharpe.capital/tokens#pre-sale).  A key part of our strategy, though, is also to provide intrinsic liquidity via the Bancor protocol. We have committed to allocating any funds raised over $45m USD to Bancor/liquidity reserves for SHP tokens.  Finally, we're open to considering other decentralised exchanges (e.g. 0x), however this is not part of our main strategy at this stage, as liquidity on these exchanges is typically not as good as it would be via Bancor/an actual exchange.  Thanks,  Lewis",False

There will be a reputation score system that will constantly update itself as the user provides sentiment feedback.  For a more in-depth explanation and an example refer to page 34 of the White Paper:    In equation 1, Rcurrent is the users current reputation score, calculated weekly based on how accurate the provided sentiment was. R is linearly modulated by a scalar constant, m (equation 2) positively for each correct prediction and negatively for each incorrect prediction. That is, for each correct prediction the reputation score is increased or decreased by multiplying the user’s previous reputation score, Rprevious, by m, and adding this to Rcurrent. This is repeated for incorrect predictions, but by reducing R by R · m instead of increasing it. The maximum value of R is 1, and the minimum value is 0, as stated in equation 3.  The impact of predictions on a user’s reputation score is perhaps best demonstrated by example (let us assume that m = 0.05):  • A user has R = 0.5, and provides 6 correct and 3 incorrect predictions. Their new R is (0.5 + (6 ∗ 0.5 ∗ 0.05)) − (3 ∗ 0.5 ∗ 0.05) = 0.575. This represents an increase of 7.5 percentage points for all rewards received by this user for correct predictions. • A user has R = 0.2, and provides 6 correct and 3 incorrect predictions. Their new R is (0.2 + (6 ∗ 0.2 ∗ 0.05)) − (3 ∗ 0.2 ∗ 0.05) = 0.23. This represents an increase of 3 percentage points for all rewards received by this user for correct predictions. • A user has R = 0.5, and provides 3 correct and 6 incorrect predictions.

By paying rewards to holders of our tokens (SHP), linked to proof-of-stake, proof-of-work and proof-of-reputation, we ensure we capture the highest quality sentiment possible, and fairly reward those that help our fund generate better returns, with bi-annual Ether payments.  I would encourage you to read section 6 of the white paper, which describes the dynamics of crowdsourcing sentiment in great detail. The ultimate premise can be broken down into two points:  1) when there is something at stake, people will work harder to improve the sentiment they provide 2) when this information is provided by ""the crowd"", the quality & accuracy will far exceed that of any individual  Perhaps the most novel element of our crowdsourced sentiment analysis is the fact that, unlike prediction markets, there are no odds and you can never lose the SHP you have staked. Because the ""reputation score"" is calculated on a rolling basis, bad sentiment only serves to reduce any future rewards that sentiment providers may earn. Of course a low reputation score can be improved by providing more good sentiment in the future.  We appreciate our concepts aren't the easiest to grasp, but I heard a wise man once said: the hardest things to understand are usually the best",False

There is no evidence to suggest that technicalism out-performs the market, on average. There are undeniably historical patterns to some extent, despite the well-known observation that future performance cannot be predicted by historical prices. These patterns emerge as a result of the collective cognitive behavioural processes of traders. We go beyond looking at simple positive and negative sentiment, by not only crowd-sourcing actual opinions from those with a proof-of-stake (instead of merely attempting to infer using Natural Language Processing), and we are combining this analysis of social and 'old' media to infer predicted 'investor responses' to the media they consume.  To quote the white paper: ""Investor sentiment, whether rational or irrational, causes an asset’s market trading value to deviate from its ’intrinsic’ value as determined by fundamentalist microeconomic indicators. That is, trading is fundamentally driven by human decision-making based on individual traders’ beliefs, perception and confidence levels."" - It is this process responsible for technicalism, and therefore we incorporate these processes at a far more fundamental level.",False

We're implementing a $10m USD hard-cap for the pre-sale, with the crowdsale hard-cap being undisclosed. The reason for this is that we're implementing ""dynamic ceilings"" during the live-sale, as pioneered by Status, to ensure an even distribution of SHP ownership and to make sure our governance and voting mechanism is not compromised by a concentration of SHP tokens in a few hands.  Therefore, we're advising larger contributors to join in the pre-sale, of which the first hour will be uncapped. We can tell you that the hard-cap of the crowdsale, and therefore maximum market-cap, will be between $60m and 90m USD.  We have committed to using anything raised above $45m USD for token liquidity. SHP tokens will be backed by the Bancor protocol, and we will calculate the exact reserve once we know how much we've raised. If there are excess funds above $45m USD and the Bancor reserve, we will reserve these to be used for additional liquidity in the future, as required.  Thanks,  Lewis",False
