'Short' is the term that professional traders use for investments that are profitable when the market drops. This is opposed to investors buying 'long' products. ‘Long’ is the term for traders that make money out of price rises hoping that in the long run the asset will continue growing in value. Professional investors have access to financial products that can still make money even if the market as a whole has moved southwards. This is one of the things that maintains the gap between professional investors and regular investors.  However, now ShortLyCI offers regular investors an easy opportunity to make money out of downward price movements; this is a first in the crypto market.

This is not a decision from Lykke's team but rather as explained before a consequence of LKK being considered a security. No crypto exchange that I know of is licensed to list securities (a lot of them can't even deal with fiat). Recently Kraken has delisted Iconomi as they are undergoing a token swap apparently (the new tokens represent true equity in the company from what I understand) which is a similar situation. This could be interesting to follow and see how it develops.  As you said it will be very beneficial from a marketing point of view to be listed in other exchanges because of the exposure alone. Regulations are becoming clearer globally and while many predicted 2019 would be the year of security tokens but things moved quite slowly as we are close to the end of the year. There were some interesting acquisitions and move towards this from big actors so I'm hopeful this will be a reality soon, not only because how it could affect LKK as an asset since I'm not here to speculate on that but because tokenized equity is definitely a huge addition to the industry and certainly take it to another level.",False

Lykke will become an equity shareholder in Nxchange in return for contributing investment capital, blockchain technology, crypto asset trading infrastructure and financial engineering expertise to the partnership. Nxchange will bring the regulatory expertise in compliance and governance around the listing requirements to facilitate safe and regulated trading. This will make it instantly easier for any company to offer their securities to a much wider investor market while simultaneously granting investors access to a far greater and more diverse variety of financial assets. The proprietary Lykke Nxchange wallet will provide the storage vehicle through which users will be enabled to access and trade their digital assets on the exchange from anywhere in the world, whenever they wish.  New blockchain technology and smart contracts used in the crypto markets becomes vastly cheaper, quicker, more accessible and more secure compared to traditional methods of exchange such as the incumbent stock exchanges and trading platforms provide. By the use of a new infrastructure to handle transactions between two parties, investors will become fully empowered to take control of their financial strategy. This partnership will see the potential for any asset or security – equities, bonds, loans, investment products, etc. – to be tokenised and traded on the blockchain infrastructure all within an MTF regulated and compliant environment. This will provide all on-boarded users with the peace of mind and trust required to invest in previously inaccessible assets, complete with embedded smart contracts to guarantee the rights of all users (e.g. dividends, asset ownership, voting rights, etc.) all within a securely regulated environment.  Nxchange has recently announced their collaboration with large institutional partner ABN Amro clearing bank in developing the first blockchain bank account where transactions can be settled real- time against fiat currencies while these are held in the safe custody of ABN Amro clearing bank.  Richard Olsen, founder of Lykke and of globally renowned futures commission merchant OANDA, says “This is a historic day - not only for Lykke and Nxchange as companies – but for our broader shared vision that is targeted at a more equitable and democratic financial world. The increasing acceptance of digital assets and blockchain infrastructure as the technology of the future correctly comes with a greater emphasis on regulation and compliance. This partnership envisages to satisfy all these things while still bringing all the benefits of transformative technology to any individual who wishes to access or exchange anything of value.”  Marleen Evertsz, CEO and founder of Nxchange says: “We believe that the time has come for a more modern form of capital market transactions: efficient, real-time, 24/7, transparent, and supported by compliance procedures that assure maximum security.

Three years ago, Lykke was born as a movement of people united by the inspiring idea of democratizing finance, led by Richard Olsen, formerly co-founder and CEO of OANDA. For these three years, we have been experimenting with new financial technologies and exploring the world of blockchain in practice. This would have been impossible if our community hadn’t supported our trailblazer’s spirit throughout these years. To thank you for your support, we wanted to celebrate our birthday involving our community, the movement of people who share our vision. During the entire birthday week, everybody could participate in our social media campaign that ended with a raffle on October 3.  According to the rules, the campaign was held across three social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) and a random winner was drawn in the raffle. It was a single campaign with one winner across the three social media platforms.  We are delighted to announce that the winner is Edmund Chew. Congratulations!    Said Edmund Chew.

Those are big names and obviously great news, it will only make the current infrastructure stronger and that's exactly why Lykke has always welcomed competition. In a time when some companies are being questioned in terms of transparency and accountability this is hopefully a breath of fresh air, bringing more legitimacy to the industry. With that being said, this industry does still have a lot of intrinsic obstacles and setbacks, traditional companies could have a lot of work to do depending on the products they offer. The learning curve is not as easy as it seems for more established players and that involves fields like user experience, customer support, security and so on. Lykke and other startups have plenty of experience navigating the waters, and that's a clear advantage in my opinion if I have to name one.",False

Regarding colored coins here is a good sum up on Lykke colored coins and fiat deposits: https://www.reddit.com/r/lykke/comments/6bzehz/what_does_it_really_mean_the_1usd_in_my_lykke/dhs0ub6/  Also a related question was recently answered here: https://www.lykke.com/city/blog/2018-04-qna-exchange  Q: Are fiat assets stored in Lykke wallet protected by European Deposit Guarantee Scheme? If not, what do you have in place? Richard Olsen: They are not protected by the European Protection Guarantee Scheme, which applies to banks. In the new world of crypto, customers of Lykke can convert any fiat assets into BTC, ETH or cryptos as moment's notice. Users do not have to wait for 2 business days to transfer their funds to another broker or bank as is typical for the traditional banking system. This reduces risk. Medium-term, we want to explore how we can provide insurance coverage.  I will try to put it into simple terms, many (if not most) crypto exchanges work like this, as exchanges, and keeping a tight balance sheet and segregated funds are the tools in place to avoid any mismanagement. Lykke also presents annual audit reports. I won't personally get into speculation about how Tether operates since there are many articles but I can say it's still not quite clear on how exactly are backed (Lykke colored coins are only redeemable on Lykke Exchange so that's a less complex operation).  As regulation moves forward, demands are higher but also a clear landscape appears too on what is required by law or needed to protect consumers. Sadly some regions move faster than others and many alternatives would need to co-exist.",False

It will work in the same way as it works in the ETH private wallet now. All transactions in the bitcoin blockchain are handled by the distributed network of miners. The miners collect, verify and bundle transactions into a block and add it into the blockchain. The miners are incentivized by the money the users pay for each transaction as the transaction fee. As a result, transactions with higher fees are prioritized. Choosing the right transaction fee can be a complicated question impacted by multiple factors.  Time: How quickly do you need the transaction to be confirmed? Do you want to spend your BTC as soon as possible or do you have time to wait?  Network load: The bitcoin network overall load can vary greatly. When many users want to send transactions simultaneously, the demand for the limited supply of blocks increases. As a result, fees that would normally be competitive for miners can suddenly become insufficient to have the transaction confirmed within a reasonable timeframe.  Transaction Size: Transaction data size impacts the fee - and not the amount of BTC transferred as many think. In short, when users frequently receive many small transactions, the size of their transaction tends to become larger.  To choose the right fee, there is a variety of online tools you can use. If you are interested in the current bitcoin blockchain statistics, such as network load, average and suggested transaction fees, and transaction execution speed, you can check bitcoin statistics page.  https://www.lykke.com/company/news/2018-07-btc-private-wallet-update-choose-your-transaction-fee",False

The company also unveiled its goals for 2018–2019.  Key among the successes of the previous year was the posting of profits for both Lykke Corp and Lykke Group. Lykke Corp, consisting of Lykke’s Swiss entity on a standalone basis, showed a profit of CHF 2.2 million in 2017; while Lykke Group, which includes all international interests, posted consolidated earnings of CHF 4.6 million in the same period. As discussed in the coinholder meeting, Lykke is emerging from the transition period that began in 2018 as a newly retooled Lykke 2.0, which emphasizes global branding, lean development practices, a centralized leadership team, and institutional procedures for maximizing outputs. These four pillars will provide the foundation and organizational structure for continued growth into 2019.  “One aspect of Lykke that hasn’t changed is our pursuit of and commitment to aggressive goals,” said Richard Olsen, Lykke founder and CEO. “We’re rolling out redesigned versions of our free Lykke Wallet mobile app and our web trading platform. We aim to truly democratize finance through an ecosystem of apps that are accessible, reliable, easy to use - more information about the new products which are now in a concept phase will be shared before the end of the year. As for our new projects in 2018, one of the most exciting and innovative is the AlgoStore, which will help to democratize algo-based trading.”  The AlgoStore, which is expected in Q3 2018, enables any Lykke member, regardless of technical expertise or formal financial background, to find and experiment with trading algorithms using imaginary funds. After achieving a comfort level with the algorithm, the investor can begin trading with it using actual funds. It is hoped that the AlgoStore will pave the way for an entire ecosystem of reliable, easy-to-use, highly accessible financial apps, all bearing the global Lykke brand.  One of the challenges for online exchanges in general is liquidity. Lykke plans to implement liquidity improvements over the coming year, including a smart fee structure for trading professionals, increased marketing, and integration with other online exchanges, along with a continued focus on Lykke’s automated trading algorithm and market-making engine. Another continuing challenge is the global trend toward regulation of crypto assets. Lykke views this development as a net positive, despite the current state of flux of regulatory requirements in certain markets, including the United States. In the meantime, Lykke has made demonstrable gains with regulators in other key markets. The company’s trading entities have provisional approval in Cyprus through the CySEC CIF license; in Singapore as a Stored Value Facility; and in Australia as a Digital Currency Exchange. None of the challenges in local regulatory environments affect the continued operation of the Lykke Exchange in Switzerland.  “It’s an exciting time to be a part of Lykke,” said Dr. Olsen. “Maybe even the best time.”  More information at: https://www.lykke.com/company/news/2018-07-coinholder-meeting  Additional materials:  Meeting video Slide deck Audit report 2017",False

We have come full circle on the fee debate and will remove taker fees for trading through the Lykke API. On May, 7 at 9 AM CET API taker fees would be disabled. Maker fees for trading through the Lykke API will remain 0% as they were, so this step will abolish all the fees for API traders. In future, we may reintroduce the fees for professional traders who consume liquidity, when liquidity is already sparse and the price overshoots.

It occurred on August 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash features an adjustable block size, which significantly improves the ability of the network to scale. By default, Bitcoin Cash sets the block size at 8 MB—eight times the size of the bitcoin block. This larger block size increases the speed of transactions, while the adaptability of the design contributes to the long-term health of the network.  “We’re excited to bring Bitcoin Cash to the Lykke Exchange,” said Richard Olsen, Lykke founder and CEO. “We’re equally excited about the way that we’re able to do it. The constantly emerging innovations around the bitcoin project and the rapidly changing protocols can lead to considerable confusion among investors and create a significant impediment to adoption. Moreover, hard forks often lead to hard choices about which branch to follow, which encourages division. But this isn’t a concern on the Lykke Exchange. Our traders can easily and transparently choose among all the existing protocols and blockchains and invest on either side of the fork, all from a single point of entry.”  Those members who held BTC with Lykke at the time of the fork are retroactively entitled to the equivalent amount in BCH. This occurrence is an effect of the fork. Previously, members of the Lykke community could withdraw Bitcoin Cash to external wallets only. Now they can withdraw BCH to their Lykke trading wallet and trade BCH on Lykke Exchange. See BCH withdrawal manual for iOS and Android for complete details.  https://www.lykke.com/company/news/bch-listing",False

The problem with LKK (and derivatives like LKK1Y and LKK2Y) is that they are considered securities (as they represent true equity in a company, something very few other tokens or crypto assets do). This of course make other exchanges hesitant to list it due to regulations concerns. In the recent YouTube AMA, a new designed utility token named LKT has been mentioned although the details are not yet defined. The idea is for LKT to add visibility as you mentioned and add value to Lykke.  If we take Binance for example, BNB is certainly an utility token and that's fine but I would personally love to own equity in the actual company. So in the space there is room for different dynamics. The migration to ERC20 tokens (from colored coins) will also help in order to be listed in many ETH based decentralized exchanges, although I'm just speculating here.",False

The topic about exchanges listing has been discussed many times.

Plus they will be basically adding a token from the competition which is not very enticing for them unless the volume is huge.

Lykke started to actively expand the list of assets from the beginning of February, 2018, and has added more than 30 new tokens since then. Litecoin is one of the top five cryptocurrencies in the world by value, with a market capitalization in excess of $2 billion. It is renowned for its faster transaction speeds relative to bitcoin and its ability to handle higher transaction volumes.  “The maturation of the Lykke Exchange continues apace with Litecoin,” said Richard Olsen, Lykke founder and CEO. “This important expansion to our offerings brings an investment opportunity to our community on a par with Ethereum and bitcoin. We’re especially proud of the Litecoin integration. Thanks to the modular software architecture of our platform, which provides an abstract integration layer, bringing Litecoin onto our exchange was a smooth and painless process.”  This ingenious integration scheme enables Lykke to adapt new cryptocurrencies to the Lykke Exchange through partial automation. The integration layer handles common tasks across blockchains, including cash flow operations and client wallets, so that Lykke can incorporate new assets on the exchange simply by deploying the appropriate software connectors. Following in the success of Litecoin, five additional blockchain integrations are currently in the testing phase with the support and participation of Lykke’s crowdsourcing community.  Litecoin is just one of more than 30 new additions to the Lykke Exchange. For the most up-to-date listing of tradeable tokens and coins, visit https://www.lykke.com/cp/tokens-and-coins-traded.

On poloniex and other exchanges its bitcoin price but not traded directly with usd. When its traded with usd I am noticing the price is much higher for it.

Shaping the communication culture inside the community is always a challenge for a company that follows the crowdsourcing ideal. On the one hand, we want to give everyone the opportunity to express their minds, share their experiences, and add missing parts to the information puzzle. On the other hand, crypto is changing so fast and embracing so much new energy that no project can incorporate all the new ideas. Sometimes, the information torrent has to be actively moderated and shaped. Sticking to the initial values and principles of the company is a big challenge in itself, but it’s a challenge that helps us to grow.  A Zen proverb says, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” We want to start our journey by updating our Slack and Telegram channels. We have been analyzing the activity on these channels, and we have discovered a sad thing: Slack is dying.  On February, 1 we want to delete the Lykke public Slack channel. That will give us the resources to focus on the channel that’s living and growing: Telegram. We plan to create a number of new Lykke channels on Telegram to help you navigate in the modern sea of information and help us to be more responsive and connected with the community. The details will follow in the coming announcement.  Another change will take place on Twitter: from now on the official Lykke twitter is @lykke.

More importantly, it’s just plain fun.

This development has affected many companies, including Bitwala, BitPay, Cryptopay, and London Block Exchange, as well as Lykke. It’s sad to say, but we must temporarily delay issuing the Lykke Card while we work around this short-term challenge.  There are no plans to cancel the Lykke Card.

As you may have heard, mining fees and transaction times have recently skyrocketed, and the whole industry is now scrambling to find solutions to make blockchains more efficient. Let’s talk numbers: since Lykke Exchange was launched in June 2016, we’ve seen Bitcoin transaction fees increase by more than 24,000%. In first three weeks of December 2017 alone, Lykke has paid more 45 BTC (around USD 740,000) in fees for offchain settlement channels.  Even with those extreme fees, Lykke is breaking even this year, but we could be channeling these funds into new features and products and delivering returns to our investors. Lykke is currently the only exchange to be semi-decentralized and to offer 0% commission to its users. Both of these are core to our philosophy, but right now our main priority is ensuring that Lykke Exchange is functional and accessible to everyone. These considerations led us to decide to switch our exchange to a centralized model.  Full read at https://www.lykke.com/company/news/Lykke-Changes-Operational-Mode",False

For many others projects this would be bad news because they tried to circumvent the laws, not Lykke, Lykke always worked close  to regulators, this takes a lot of resources and time  but I'm sure it will be very worthy at the end. After that answer the path will be clearer. Perhaps Poloniex won't be able to list it but another type of exchange could (not even a crypto one).

One of the things we've been up to recently is exploring hashgraph technology. We invite you to join us in this research, explore multiple applications of hashgraph, add your comments and participate in our Lykke Streams competition.  Hashgraph is a recently emerged technology that is often said to be able to dethrone blockchain. In a very simplified way, its principle can be explained as a network of computers communicating with each other randomly, in a decentralized way, and incredibly fast. For all operations, such as, let’s say, a money transfer, they create ‘events’ and exchange the information they possess about these and all the previous events within the network. This process is called ‘gossip about gossip’: you not only tell others your news, but you also gossip about what you’ve ‘heard’ from others. This is a very simplistic explanation, obviously, this information is encrypted, and not subject to biased ‘gossiping’, to stick to the same metaphor.  Hashgraph technology stands out for having found a practical application for the Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) protocol, that guarantees absolute security of operations. Consensus about what events have truly taken place is reached almost instantly through cryptographic verification of all the ‘gossip about gossip’ and virtual voting. Mathematics excludes the ‘events’ that don’t correspond to the records of the majority of users, this is how the Asynchronous BFT protocol works. The high speed of transaction verification within a hashgraph allows for a much wider variety of applications than that of blockchain.

This means that Lykke doesn't take possession of your assets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Colored Coins). Most decentralized exchanges do this too but the user experience is quite subpar, that's why Lykke still need to be trusted with match the trades correctly (and that's why it's not a fully decentralized exchange).  Bittrex on the other hand is a fully centralized exchange, exposed to hacks and other vulnerabilities but also not offering direct ownership of your digital assets. That doesn't mean that it's bad per se, it just serves a different purpose (although currently it does not offer proper fiat gateway, either for deposit or withdrawal).  I suggest to do your own research as here's plenty of information available about Lykke at the official site alone or join our communities at Reddit, Telegram and/or Slack.

Even the best teams are not perfect, there will always be setbacks and delays etc., but good teams work and work and figure it out - they don't give up. Neucoin was a master-example of the opposite - they didn't only give it up but it wouldn't even have been possible to get it back on track because of it's economical design. That's why it was a safe prediction that it had to go down and I really felt sorry for those who have been unexperienced at that time but believed in the hype.

The discrepancy between App and Blockchain-Explorer is because Lykke implemented Offchain-Settlement. In very short words:  The trading-wallet is a multi-signature wallet (customer holds one Private Key, Lykke holds the other one) and you can imagine Offchain-settlement this way: Lykke deposits Coins in the multi-sig-wallets of customers. And let's say you want to buy, the balance is just updated. That speed things up and is cheaper than settling all trades on-chain. Your App shows your balance but the Block Explorer shows balances of both parties until now. In future the Explorer will be improved to differ between both parties.  You can find more infos about it here: https://www.lykke.com/city/blog/lykke_offchain_settlement (especially questions 7,8,9)   If you should lose your App, let's say because you lose your phone or it's damaged, you should have stored the 12 words seed safe.   Ether is not displayed on the Block-Explorer because the Lykke-Explorer only shows Bitcoin and colored Coins (Colored Coins are technically fractions of a Bitcoin, so they also run on the Bitcoin-Blockchain). Colored Coins are LKK for example but also all Fiat-Currencies on Lykke are represented as colored Coins.",False

There's tonnes of other coins out there where the ""founder coins"" are counted, but LKK coins aren't.

In Lykke (but also several other projects) there is already existing supply that is theoretically on the market, because technically it is not locked up, but because it is in the hands of founders, team-members, board-members, seed-Investors, practically it is not on the market. That makes things more complex for a site like CMC of course, especially if they try to find the one rule that fits for all (to differ between circulating and total supply).  And like in some other projects that have different economical designs than Cryptocurrencies, that can lead to some controversy. Some are critical because the total valuation of Lykke is higher than how it is calculated on CMC with circulating supply, some are critical because the majority of supply is not in public hands, but I'm very sure that some also would be critical if that would be the case, because that would seem as if company and founders simply want to sell LKK fast to make money.

But while I believe Lykke's US rep went so far as to anticipate imminent US regulation in the months ahead during the online AGM (from his laptop at the airport), I view this as unsubstantiated, unprofessional and misleading. He doesn't know IF AND WHEN US regulators will give him approval. What if they do not? What is Lykke's business case then?  This is how a lot of regulators I know work: You apply for a license. They examine your application, and if they're favourable or unfavourable they'll give preliminary written feedback, which of course is market sensitive information and will be immediately released by the company in question. Then later the regulator usually - not always - follows up with a final determination granting or not granting, as the case may be.  Lykke has ""got people on it"". How we get from that to publically stating likely timeframes within periods of months I don't know - or rather I do: that's what the person promising speedy regulatory approval hopes for. What you hope for isn't likely, and shouldn't be presented to investors as such. I think Lykke's hopes of licensing is an example of this. But let's look at another example, the Winklevoss brothers ETF application. It was rejected. Then a whole lot of ""news"" outlets in the crypto space started reporting the ""news"" that the SEC will ""review"" its decision. This isn't ""news"", it's a statutory obligation the SEC must offer to ALL applicants whose applications are not frivolous.  I do not like Coindesk, Cointelegraph or whatever manipulating the true nature the situation (eg. the SEC rejection of Winklevoss' ETF) to paint a picture not really aligned to reality.

Quote from: playingpoodles on July 11, 2017, 03:32:25 AM I've been warning people for two weeks LKK was overvalued and will correct down.  Now it's down to 27 cents. Now given the altcoin sell off which I warned of has been faster and harder than I anticipated, I can see LKK shooting down below fair value, theoretically even below 10 cents, but certainly 10-15 range.  Thing is that everything is down. If you look here, it's deeply red: http://coinmarketcap.com (only 3 exceptions in the top 100).  Kind of funny is that USDT is up above $1. That shows how much money flees into Fiat.  My personal opinion is: After the hype of the last months in the whole market, that totally ignored the trouble Bitcoin is still in, this is an overreaction into the opposite direction. Unfortunately it's very rare that Crypto moves ""normal"" ;-) But whatever scenario will realize in Bitcoin, finally things move and there is potential again. Bitcoin is still the biggest ""money-mover"" that gets Fiat into the markets or pushes it out.

Now, yes, the whole market has joined in the fun. I mean, there's probably other things more overvalued than Lykke, my point is Lykke is one of the obviously overvalued coins (based on present lack of any regulatory approval and tiny userbase less than 12000).  Personally, I feel that Lykke management has a very, very high degree of control over the Lykke price because there are no limit orders, and so Lykke is the only entity taht can determine its own price - I believe that has  has been used to (manipulate OR stabilise, choose your preferred word) the LKK price and counteract the natural sell/downward pressure that exists. For example, often the system rewards purchase of LKK but penalises sale of LKK for USD - for example the more LKK you sell for USD the less USD per LKK you get, and the more LKK you buy for USD the more LKK you get per USD.  I think the manipulation to keep Lykke's price up against natural market sentiment is not going to work, there's more blood in store for LKK (and yes, like you say every other altcoin, everything except Bitcoin and USD).

You can see it in the high volume and sharp drop off, that has been temporarily leveled.  Interesting theories... But Lykke went down like others did and is simply following the market as a whole. You don't see that pattern in Bitcoin and others? Bitcoin goes down below $2200 and is above $2300 now, others also seem to find at least a temporarily base but in Lykke it's an intervention from ""Brother number one""?

I give informations, I reply on questions, I also defend Lykke if somebody tries to spread misleading informations like you try that with your talking about a scheme, your focus on the price and saying LKK would have gone down before everything else and so on. And especially that point is really interesting if we look at one of your favorites: Zencash and when it was dumped and how hard (from about $19 to $4) and on your reactions on it. ;-)   Quote   It never rings true to me when everything someone says about something is positives with ne'er a single negative.    I just replied on your posts. If you want to know if I'm 100% happy: No, I'm not. There have been several delays for example. Limit orders are not there yet or the web-based-terminal, Ethereum-implementation caused some trouble, support sometimes was overwhelmed etc. I've never said that Lykke is perfect. It will need a lot of improvements and that are no secrets.  But is that in any way unusual in this space or software-development in general? I don't think so. I know a lot of good projects but not a single one without delays, setbacks, tech-problems, rolloercoaster on the market etc.    Quote You can't tell me who owns the 2 wallets - Lykke can't tell us who or why 2 wallets own most LKK, great transparency.  I've asked and they'll publish a list of holders, executive team and board members.   Quote No, I don't really consider a Vanuatu brokerage license ""approval"" for our purposes - it's a few steps ahead of ""I got approval from my mum"" but not that many. (No offence to Vanuatuans, my point is, what's Vanuatu got to a Swiss based crypto trading startup?).  The regulatory topic is not really what I'm very familiar about. Feel free to see that how you see it and not to invest and not to use Lykke. Still interested why you said ""good investment"" above.   Quote   I already stated my views about LKK risking big drops well before the price crash these two weeks. Who knows about price in cryptoland - it goes up, it goes down, up, down - personally I do think short-term Lykke is falling to 10-15 cents, with dips below that being buying opportunities. I'd certainly buy under 10 cents.   Yes, not new to me. You've spread that over and over again on Bitcointalk and reddit.   - I will also buy Lykke - less than the 23 cents it is now - or cheap (less than 10 cents would be definitely cheap!) - Me too, I definitely think 8 cents will be a buying opportunity. - I see 10-15 cents a real possibility now, with drops below 10 cents being heavily bought. - I'm expecting 10-15 cent LKK, with potential dips below being aggresively bought. - LKK is going well below 20 cents, hold your horses to 10-15 cents - I see 10-15 cent LKK short term. - Now I'm predicting 10-15. There's way more downside to play out yet. - since the altcoin crash I see LKK going to 10-15 cents  https://www.reddit.com/user/playingpoodles  ....only reddit-quotes about the price, not even all, and only about 24-48 hours. And what I find revealing is that you mix that up with your theories about Richard Olsen and Lykke to be a ""scheme"", claims the price would be backed by him, claims LKK would have gone down before the whole market went down, all your other concerns - but still: you want to buy and call it a ""good investment"".  I think it's obvious that I also have a theory about you, right?  Let's see if it will help to get it cheap. ;-)",False

Userbase growth I'd expect to continue its upward creep (though not fast enough). However regulatory approval, in particular in US states, isn't a quick or easy thing to achieve.  I think there's a degree of realism in the market now that has replaced the early exuberance when it comes to Lykke. Lykke was a great buy at 6 cents. At 41 cents, it was substantially overvalued at some $600 million plus in marketcap. To give you perspective Coinbase was talking about raising a funding round that valued itself at $1 billion http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/bitcoin-start-up-coinbase-aims-for-1-billion-valuation.html  Coinbase in conjunction with its exchange GDAX has regulatory approval all over the place, including UK, Canada, most of EU Europe, and most or all US states (probably most not all). It has insurance for both crypto, and for US folks FDIC insurance of USD deposits.  Lykke on the other hand according to its annual report has ""a Vanuatu brokerage license"".  https://www.lykke.com/Annual_Report_2016.pdf (see page 3 and from page 19)  It is ""applying"" for lots of licenses, with keys being the US and UK. Applying for a license and having one is a very different thing. Lykke really has no licenses at this point, although they'll likely get some as time goes on, and anyway they appear to be allowing transactions without a license certainly with cryptocurrency, which they can probably get away with since everyone else is doing that. Not having any US license is a massive thing, and I'm not sure with a Swiss firm in competition with US incumbent Coinbase how enthusiastically and quickly US authorities will be in granting them licenses.  Lykke's userbase according to its recently released annual report is 11,442 users as of 1 June 2017. https://www.lykke.com/Annual_Report_2016.pdf  (Page 5).  I couldn't get exact stats out there on Coinbase, but it seems like it's got anywhere from 6 to 10 million users. https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-user-base-surges-coinbase-adds-1-mln-users-in-1-month http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/03/01/bitcoin-exchange-coinbase-surpasses-6-million-total-users/  Lykke is sitting currently at just under $480 million in total market cap (that is marketcap including coins held by founders and not in free float, which is something like 80 to 90 per cent of them).  My point is, how could Lykke possibly be worth half of Coinbase, that has 6 to 10 million users, worldwide regulatory approval, including the key US market through approval in US states when Lykke has less than 12,000 users and no real regulatory approval? (I'm not suggesting Vanuatu is not a ""real"" jurisdiction, I'm saying it's not an important one for the purposes of cryptocurrency markets).  My conclusion is it can't. That's why the price is off over 10% at 36.5 cents, but I think the price correction has only just begun. Segwit 2x will activate, and, when it does, Bitcoin will go up like crazy. No one will want to miss out on the action, they'll dump lots of things to free up liquidity to ride the ""Bitcoin has finally scaled"" wave up, they'll dump Ether, and they will certainly dump Lykke - especially early investors who are already sitting on lovely, acceptable 7x profits. I easily see a correction down to [edit, I see a larger LKK correction in light of today's altcoin route, 10 to 15 cents] in the next couple of months, which is probably closer to fair value anyway.  The big upside risks are (1) US regulatory approval and (2) substantial userbase growth. The big downside risks are (1) rejection or delay of US regulatory approval (2) Bitcoin scales and everyone dumps everything including Lykke to buy it.",False

I especially agree with your last conclusions about potentials and risks, because a lot will be about regulations. At the same time: Lykke is pretty much ahead when it's about that topic and may have some advantage over competing projects with similar goals.   In general, value and how people evaluate ""something"" (not only Investments) is one of the most interesting topics in my opinion - and what I believe: There is nothing objective to find. Out of individual perspective it's very personal, in last consequence it's about personal and subjective interpretations of informations that have a context nobody is able to fully overlook, plus the context of an individual situation. It's about beliefs. In short: Nobody is able to have all informations and nobody is able to interpret any information he has other than subjective. Individual decisions are significantly based on 1) personal beliefs and 2) the absence of informations.    And then there is the sum of individual views and decisions, the collective, the market(s). And that is a feedback-system: Individuals react on collective expressions (buying, selling, communicating) but the collective (part of) also reacts on individual decisions (whenever a ""whale"" shows his financial power the rumors start, and whenever a ""VIP"" communicates own opinions it has influence).  In the end it's very much about time. Moments form facts, everything else is subjective. That leads into the paradox that it would be possible to say that a price at a certain point in time is objective, because it is a fact. It's also possible to say that there is absolutely nothing objective because what has lead to it, in time, are 100% individual and subjective decisions while no participant is able to see the full picture. But many, maybe even a majority, tend to objectify collective agreements, especially if the time-frame is long enough.    When it's about Lykke and Blockchain-projects: Of course one can analyze a project, also compare it with others and it's possible to find facts about the status quo. Those facts are basically the results of the decisions of those who build a project. In my opinion, when it's about value and potential, it's very much about the teams behind. The same idea wouldn't be worth $10 if I would start it with some friends. But if the team behind Lykke should be able to develop the platform how it is meant to be, and of course that will always be an ongoing process, it might become a multi-billion-dollar project.  And nobody has ever bought anything else than future potential.   Btw, the question about Bitcoin and 1) what the result of the current controversy might be in time and 2) how it will effect other markets, is also very interesting and very complex. I consider 1 as nearly totally unclear. I only believe that there will be a lot of volatility because I don't believe that there will be something like a safe status quo anytime soon. But if something like a best-case-scenario should realize, new and more potential for the whole ecosystem and the price goes up etc.: Sure, it's possible that many would sell other Crypto-assets for Bitcoin. But what also should be taken into consideration: More people would be attracted and more money would flow into the whole ecosystem. A strong Bitcoin and a rising price of Bitcoin would be helpful for Lykke, also because even if Lykke is far from being fully developed, there is one fact: It's already pretty good to buy Bitcoin.

If you compare:  1) Ripple and Lykke - of course Ripple is worth more, already very successful and indeed banks are obviously interested. 2) XRP and LKK - what exactly is the connection between Ripple and the currency?  I know that for LKK: It represents ownership - 100% of the supply is 100% Lykke. But I have no idea why XRP should be at a billion-dollar valuation, I don't even know for what it's needed and the Ripple-team didn't care much about it. I also don't believe that Ripple as company is already worth $25 billions.  And no, I also don't want to say that Lykke, the status quo, is already worth $425 millions. But if Lykke should become successful it could be 1) much more interesting and valuable than Ripple and 2) like already said: LKK is directly connected to the value of the company.   Value of blockchain-projects in general: There is no project that is not overvalued if we focus on the status quo. There is no project that already could be seen as kind of established. At the same time it's also true that this space has huge potential in general.   Quote Why not compare it to Bitcoin that's worth over 40 billion, or ether's 25 billion? Why not compare it to Amazon with 300 billion or whatever it's worth? Because the only reason to do this is your reason and that is that you are an LKK holder and you want to instill irrational exuberance to make Lykke's price inflate beyond fair value.  I know that's not a reply on my post, but it's an interesting point: Of course it's part of the game that those who are invested write more positive and those who are not more into the other direction. But the question about valuation and what is rational or not is not that easy to reply on. I'll give you my favorite example: Factom. In Factom it's possible to calculate what the price of 1 FCT should be, because whenever Entry Credits (necessary to use the system) are bought, Factoids are burned. Once Factom will be fully developed one could say: The price of 1 FCT should be at least at a level that not more Factoids are burned than new created over the protocol. The price is at $25 right now and that is totally overvalued if we focus on the status quo. It already was overvalued when it was $2.5. Was it irrational to buy it at $2.5? Obviously not. Is it irrational to buy it at $25? That question can't be answered because it will depend on the future and if I wouldn't be invested in Factom I would buy, because the possibility that Factom will be used for billions of entries per month or maybe even per day at some point is absolutely there.  Same is true for pretty much all projects. If they should fail they are very overvalued. Those projects that will succeed are most likely not. And measured on the status quo - I know of no project that would not be overvalued.   Quote Sorry to tell you, that's already happened, which was my point. Could it rise on further irrational exuberance? Of course that's always possible. That's not happening now, LKK continues a slow decline. (It can't decline fast, because Lykke is its only market for itself and doesn't allow limit orders).  Limit orders would mean that there are more orders on both sides, more buy-support included. To say that Lykke couldn't be dumped because users can't set limit orders yet is not correct. Of course the price could fall hard if a big Investor would sell 100% in one moment.  Regarding price-decline: We have seen a hype over the last months that had impact on pretty much all projects. I've seen pumps of projects that are not even in development anymore, ""walking deads"". LKK moves a little bit slower, is not that ""over-sensitive"" like others, but of course: also LKK was bought up and corrects now.  I believe one important aspect is the Bitcoin-situation that brings some uncertainty into the whole market - Bitcoin might have more up-potential if things go right but also the opposite if a bad-case-scenario should realize. And most of the newcomers, who came into this space because the ongoing hype attracted them, bought high. It's natural that they are highly uncertain now because 1) they bought high and 2) they can't overlook the situation.   Quote   My point is when an asset's price is grossly in excess of its proven value the downside risks magnify. An idea, a Vanuatu brokerage license, 11,442 users and a nice iPhone and Android app don't make something worth $460 million (last time I looked, LKK has probably gone down since then).  To imply that there would be something like a ""proven value"" anywhere in this space is not right. If I should be wrong, it should be possible to point on a blockchain-project and say ""yes, that is already worth it's valuation"".  Regarding 11k users: That's the status of early june and has doubled since. The vanatu-license is only the beginning. In my opinion it's never about the status quo at all but about the question if the tendency is positive, basically about the questions:  1) what is planned for the project? 2) can those plans be seen as high potential? 3) do I believe the team behind is able to deliver?  And everybody has to come to own conclusions, but in my opinion it's yes yes yes. If the team delivers and builds a platform how Lykke is meant to be in future, we are talking about a billion-dollar-company  - all risks included of course, like in all projects. Nothing is safe and I'm still the opinion that there is nothing objective to find.",False

There is the perspective on the status quo, what I said in my last two posts, and then yes: it's valued too high. But also important: I don't know of any blockchain-project that is not overvalued if only focused on the status quo.  More realistic and also more rational in my opinion is to focus on the question of future-potential. And of course that is about the question if the concept of Lykke has potential as profitable usecase, and if the team has all what's needed to realize it. I believe yes, but of course we are not speaking about facts. Investing is about anticipating the future.  If we focus on the market-situation right now: I don't think that it's possible to predict short-term moves and that is also very connected to the whole situation in this space, especially Bitcoin is likely to be a rollercoaster until the situation becomes more predictable again (in whatever way, split-scenario included) and of course that will/would have impact on all markets. It already has impact - high volatility and uncertainty on all markets that have some volume.  Quote   I'm not ill disposed to Lykke, I picked it up in that period when it was floating around issue price for a couple of months.  My issue is, not everything is necessarily up to the Lykke team. Whether and when US state regulators grant a license to a Swiss competitor to US incumbent Coinbase is very much up to those regulators, and I don't think Lykke help their chances when they skirt or flout lots of legal regulations like giving fiat money transfer to US and UK nationals without license approval. I am nervous at the push of Lykke to act like they're Coinbase already, everyone wants to act like Lykke's got regulatory authorisation, and Lykke sort of acts like it has, but really it hasn't.  Yes, absolutely right. Not everything is totally under control of the team and even if: Since everything is new, all teams have to learn a lot. But if a team is good, the unknowns are mainly about time-frames.  I'm not that uncertain about the question if it will be possible to get the necessary licenses because that doesn't seem to be that much about conflicting interests in general. Countries want to regulate, even if there is no clear path yet.  What is not the case is your impression that Lykke would act as if there already would be regulatory approval. US-citizen can't even download the App for example. Or Margin Trading: It's in demo-mode for most countries.  Again the most interesting question is how to look at limitations like that. One could say: Lykke is still very limited. Technically it's far from being finished (no limit orders yet, no web-based-terminal etc.) and regarding the regulatory status it's the same. Especially users could say ""Lykke is not that attractive until now if compared with other exchanges"" and I'm sure that many see it that way. At the same time it's already pretty nice to buy Bitcoin or ETH for example.  What would be a rational perspective of somebody who thinks about the question if LKK is a buy? My approach always was and still is not to overrate current limitations, but to find an answer on the question if I believe that current limitations will be overcome in future, because if yes: It's pure potential. That becomes obvious if we see it the other way around: If Lykke already would be fully developed, already would have all necessary licenses, but still only 20k users - something would be wrong then.  And sure, the question about future potential is about anticipation. That is why I always focus on teams, on the question if the people behind have everything what's needed. In case of Lykke:  - If Lykke gets all needed licenses, especially that is huge potential - If Lykke releases limit orders - it already will make the whole platform much more attractive. - If Lykke releases the web-based-terminal - same - If Lykke adds more wanted assets - same - If Lykke releases the debit card - same - If Lykke is able to connect into the existing financial system - same  ...and so on. With other words: If somebody believes that the team is able to deliver, all current limitations can be seen as future potential. If somebody has too much doubts about that, he will decide not to invest, at least not now.",False

And I've done this here and on reddit. And if you read my previous explanations here and on reddit and this post of you: You can only continue this way by ignoring pretty much everything what I've explained and that is what you do. You want to place your message with a megaphone and you don't want to get answers on questions. You want to state your personal assumptions as facts and it's not that much of a secret that you want to convince others to share your very personal view.  In the beginning I didn't agree with you but I understand that you, and maybe also others, might have questions, maybe even be concerned. But you are the only one who makes such a drama out of the website coinmarketcap.com, that you call ""industry standard"" (what is kind of funny, isn't it?) and you are the only one who tries to attack that hard with a focus on integrity and credibility and the paradox is: You make moves here that are very dishonest, manipulative attempts and you can keep on with that, but pretty much everything also tells a story about yourself.   Quote   Olsen has made a bold move and its a high risk move. He is doing it to correct a mistake because he even says so...      1) That can be your personal conclusions, but it wouldn't be bad to word it that way 2) Arguments are missing 3) If you claim that Richard Olsen ""says so"" you should be able to quote where he exactly says that. Is that possible?    Quote   Here is the statement from Olsen:  Quote Thank you for all the comments about the valuation of Lykke.  Coinmarketcap computes the market capitalization of Lykke based on the coins that are held in the trading wallets and does not include the coins held in other wallets. When Lykke was founded and started the first rounds of fund raising, the coins were issued to other wallets, because the trading wallet was not yet developed. In June we will move all the Lykke coins to the trading wallet. If the price of LKK does not change and remains at 0.374716 USD the total market capitalisation will jump to 481,772,471 USD.  Every buyer of LKK needs to be aware that the Lykke project is high risk – we are reinventing finance and build an emergent organization that is inspired by the principles employed by nature and where all the software and knowledge is open source. We will make mistakes and these mistakes can be costly, so there is risk and any investor should only buy LKK, if he can afford to lose his money.  Last question again: Does he say that he is doing that to correct a mistake?   Interesting is that you ask questions and then you give the answers yourself - what does that tell me about you? ;-)    I'll quote them together - your questions, your answers:  Quote 1. Why is he talking about a jump if the market cap is already $481mn?  1. Its because the market cap isnt $481mn..its $50-60mn, according to the calculations agreed between Olsen and coinmarketcap.   He refers only to coinmarketcap.com and that also was the context of the discussion. And I've explained over and over again that also coinmarketcap.com changed over time. Maybe you don't know that, since your account is pretty ""fresh"". But what always was displayed as well is the total supply. That was never hidden, Lykke has never made a secret out of anything but it was explained before how it is calculated and one consequence is: If LKK are moved out of the trading-section, the number goes down and the other way around. Actually that's not that bad, it can be an interesting indicator. But if people don't know that they wonder why both charts (price and circulating supply) may not correlate in certain situations. Or to be more precise: It needs the information how it is done to recognize that it's not that bad. But because not everybody is good enough informed (not meant critical) it can lead to questions of course.  But most important to know are some infos and explanations, I've already given you here and on reddit - but you didn't pay any attention!      Quote 2. Why is he saying lykke is a high risk investment?  2. Its because he's making a high risk move  He said several times that Lykke is a high risk investment, independently of this super important coinmarketcap-site. What you try here is to turn his openness and honesty against him.    Quote 3. Why is he saying they will make mistakes along the way?  3. Its because he's correcting a mistake  Same here - again you try to use something against him that is in fact a quality: Honesty! He does not try to hype Lykke. He does not try to paint a perfect picture of Lykke. He simply reminds about a fact: Nothing and nobody is perfect.    Quote This is from his own words....he has said the valuation would be jumping, that there is high risk, and they will make mistakes.  Please don't forget that the first part is only about coinmarketcap.com. Please don't forget that he said that an investment in Lykke is high risk before. It's a startup in a high risk sector. Please don't forget that Lykke is built by humans and if you know any human without making mistakes, let me know. If you know any company that didn't do mistakes let me know. But you also said that he said it was a mistake how it was done on coinmarketcap before - and that is not true.     Quote It is circulating supply which matters and this is what was agreed between Olsen and coinmarketcap to agree the valuation..  But what is the circulating supply? Lykke is transparent about last crowdfundings and about the distribution and about all important numbers. Pretty soon they will publish an actualized financial report. But also this one from February gives a lot of infos:  INFORMATION BROCHURE FOR COINHOLDERS FEBRUARY 2017 https://forward.lykke.com/files/Memorandum.pdf  What is important to understand: Lykke has sold LKK to Investors. Instead of doing one hyped up monster-crowdfunding like some other projects, Lykke has done smaller sales without much advertising and PR. And those LKK's are obviously circulating supply. But there are also founders and team-members and the company itself. Nothing of that is locked up. Lykke is meant to be flexible and maybe you and maybe also some others would prefer some kind of ""lock-up"" of supply - but those who would need something like that to have enough trust will stay away anyway.    Quote The way to resolve the issue with the market cap would be one of 2 ways:  a) Declare that pre-investors would have their coins in a separate wallet from the circulating supply system, to avoid confusing the figures. This is taking the XRP and Ripple route by keeping pre-investor coins separately to avoid flooding the system, and would protect the current price and market cap (the $50-60mn one). Flooding the system doesnt mean there would be big sell orders. Flooding the system means changing the circulating supply unnecessarily to inflate the agreed market cap valuation.  This was the initial route which Olsen took. The circulating supply of coins bought on the exchange is what counted towards the market cap - which is why the agreement was made between Olsen and coinmarketcap. Otherwise why not just make all the coins - the full 100% count to the market cap from the start?  Why did Olsen not add all the coins into the market cap at the start then? Why was the agreement not made for this? Its a mute point to say just because the coins weren't on the trading wallet, that they shouldn't contribute if that's the argument someone wants to make.    Somebody like you could attack both whenever he wants. You can be critical about how it was done in the past. You can be critical about how it will be done in the future. And in fact you are.  I tell you what you could have done: Due diligence and getting your informations directly from Lykke. It's all there. And it's possible to ask questions. It's possible right here, on reddit, on two chats and even directly per mail. But you don't ask and if you ask you give the answers yourself.  And really, it's kind of interesting that you come up with that again and again but you ignore all explanations I've given before.   Quote The answer is it was an intentional decision to not add all the coins into the market cap. The private pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be part of the circulating supply to influence the public market cap.  b) The 2nd route is putting all the coins into the trading wallet so that all the coins are counted in the valuation figure. This is the route that Olsen has taken, which means its a U-turn. He made a mistake to say only the coins bought on the exchange should count to the market cap. To correct this mistake and to end any debate about the valuation, this move is being taken. It creates transparency and stability for the long term.  And again: It is up to anybody personally what one prefers. And also again: Coinmarketcap also changed how they display such things. For them it's not easy to find the best way that fits for all projects. But the total supply was always displayed there. And Lykke has shown transparency about numbers all the time.   Quote He is saying lykke is high risk because he's making a high risk move. Nobody knows what will happen when the valuation jumps to $481mn in his own words and because of this u-turn...It could fall, it could rise etc.  What you try is called spreading FUD. ""Oh no! Nobody knows what will happen! It's a high risk move!""  But no, he is not saying that Lykke is high risk because of that. Lykke is high risk anyway. Find a project that is not high risk. Find any investment that is not high risk. Oil maybe.   Quote A change in valuation also means my ROI will be less. There is less growth % when the market cap is 500mn than if its 50-69mn , making it unattractive to many investors.  You criticise that it would have been misleading in the past but now you are critical that it might not be misleading enough in future and your ROI would be less because of that. That's the whole point, isn't it? You haven't done due diligence but believed that only a fraction of LKK is free and the rest can't be moved and is locked up. And thing is: Technically that is not the case. Practically you can think about how likely it is that founders and company will act less carefully with the market than they've done it in the past.  Thing is: I know how you really think - you only think about what other Investors might think and if an obvious high valuation might deter Investors who also don't do due diligence. Right or right?      Quote -----  The breach of trust thing is because the initial idea was for the coins bought on the exchange to be the circulating supply, and this was the basis for the market cap figure in coinmarketcap. The pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be on the circulating supply at all. I honestly dont think Olsen is stupid enough to make a schoolboy error in not including the pre-investor coins in the circulating supply. It was INTENTIONAL to not include the pre-investor coins in the circulating supply initially because those are private coins linked to an internal valuation of the company.  Olsen is smart...the pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be in the circulating supply, which is why he didnt include them at the start. The reason they're doing it now is because Olsen believes the market cap figure is misleading (hence the debate on reddit and previously in this thread). He has done a U-turn to create transparency for the market cap figures and to end the market cap debate once and for all.  Please decide what you want to be critical about. I've already explained that it's not that simple to find the best solution that makes everybody happy, is precise and fits to how coinmarketcap.com handles such things.  But actually it is simple: If somebody believes in the potential of this project he might consider it as a buy. And the question if this has potential is the question if the people behind are able to build this and also will act carefully on the market. Those who believe that founders and team are dishonest and only want to make a quick buck: Don't buy.  You've made your decision and I respect that. What I don't respect are your megaphon-attempts to spread your manipulative attempts.    Quote My investment in Lykke was based on the understanding of circulating supply and visible market cap being just the LKK bought on the exchange, and that the pre-investor coins bought wouldn't contribute to the public market cap (not the internal valuation which is different). We saw that Olsen made the agreement with coinmarketcap to include just the exchange bought LKK...so my understanding was correct. Now though hes adding the pre-investor coins into the circulating supply, which is doing a U-turn. That to me makes this investment a lot less attractive.  It doesnt matter if the market hasn't reacted...it just means to me Ive sold my LKK and there's much better investments out there. The higher valuation (if it holds) is very off putting. I can make a higher ROI on smaller techs with a lower valuation.   My suggestion would be always to do due diligence. If you feel misleaded about how it was done in the past I can tell you: Read this thread and you'll find out that it was explained and I've replied on all questions about it and others as well. Same on reddit. Sergey and others did that on telegram and slack. There is also a blog-post in which it is explained that also gives a lot of additional informations and tips how to get interesting informations. Nothing was ever hidden.",False

Of course Olsen isnt going to directly say he's correcting a mistake - that would be stupid of him to do. If you're expecting that from him then I would be asking serious questions about you and what you actually know about the basics of positioning  He is alluding to the mistake by talking about it...its called positioning to put a positioned spin on the situation whilst maintaining a professional attitude.   Last question again: Does he say that he is doing that to correct a mistake?  Interesting is that you ask questions and then you give the answers yourself - what does that tell me about you? ;-)  Yes, he is alluding to saying he's correcting a mistake...its called positioning - something that you aren't understanding because sorry, I can see you lack the ability to ""read between the lines"". No offence intended. Nobody is going to go out and say he made a mistake..that would be suicide for him to do.   He refers only to coinmarketcap.com and that also was the context of the discussion.

But most important to know are some infos and explanations, I've already given you here and on reddit - but you didn't pay any attention!  This is confusing the issue. Lykke coins being or not being in the trading wallet shouldn't affect the market cap. This is called playing games with the system and making a mockery out of it, thinking Lykke can just make up the rules for itself as it goes along  Yes, the market cap counting all the coins wasnt hidden...so why is Olsen only wanting the circulating supply to display a lower market cap on coinmarketcap?? You have literally no answer to that whatsoever.  I am just putting that in red to emphasis it. The full total supply market cap is well known, so why does Olsen put only the circulating supply and agree with the industry-leading coinmarketcap to show a lower valuation?  You are digging a bigger hole for yourself with this...those are the FACTS of the situation..total facts.   He said several times that Lykke is a high risk investment, independently of this super important coinmarketcap-site. What you try here is to turn his openness and honesty against him.  You're missing the point completely. He is talking about a chain of thought of related themes...all which are relevant to each other within the context of the post.  He's saying its high risk because he's just made a high risk move. If you aren't intelligent enough to notice this then that's something you'll need to deal with yourself, its nothing to do with me.   Same here - again you try to use something against him that is in fact a quality: Honesty! He does not try to hype Lykke. He does not try to paint a perfect picture of Lykke. He simply reminds about a fact: Nothing and nobody is perfect.  You are getting massively confused here. Nobody is saying Olsen is dishonest or that honesty is in question here.  He is saying those things to maintain a professional attitude to the mistake that has been made. Otherwise why is there such a big question about the valuation of lykke?? Why do other coins not have this issue? (and please dont point out specific cases of coins where there are issues..im talking about the overall general market. Most coins and techs dont have these glaring massive issues with their valuations due to technicalities)  Olsen is making the mistake that XRP and ripple have managed to avoid. By ripple and XRP declaring that their held-XRP won't be added to the free market, they have given investors assurance. On the flip side, Olsen is flooding his coins onto the market in an attempt to resolve valuation issues, whilst the technology is still at an early stage. Though better for the lykke project long term, this isnt an investor assuring move.   Please don't forget that the first part is only about coinmarketcap.com. Please don't forget that he said that an investment in Lykke is high risk before. It's a startup in a high risk sector. Please don't forget that Lykke is built by humans and if you know any human without making mistakes, let me know. If you know any company that didn't do mistakes let me know. But you also said that he said it was a mistake how it was done on coinmarketcap before - and that is not true.  Sorry, but it appears you dont understand why he's talking about mistakes in that context. You are lacking perspicacity and an ability to read what is really meant by statements. You are lacking the ability to understand positioning.   But what is the circulating supply? Lykke is transparent about last crowdfundings and about the distribution and about all important numbers. Pretty soon they will publish an actualized financial report. But also this one from February gives a lot of infos:  INFORMATION BROCHURE FOR COINHOLDERS FEBRUARY 2017 https://forward.lykke.com/files/Memorandum.pdf  What is important to understand: Lykke has sold LKK to Investors.

Well...you tell me what the circulating supply is...its what Lykke is playing about with to show a lower valuation in coinmarketcap!!  By playing games with the circulating supply and saying one coin counts and another doesn't...its causing clear issues with understanding and calculating the valuation.

""Oh no! Nobody knows what will happen! It's a high risk move!""  But no, he is not saying that Lykke is high risk because of that. Lykke is high risk anyway. Find a project that is not high risk. Find any investment that is not high risk. Oil maybe.  As I've said you aren't able to read what's really written there and why things are being said in that particular context. Its clearer than daylight, which tells me you aren't in the same league as me, sorry to say.   You criticise that it would have been misleading in the past but now you are critical that it might not be misleading enough in future and your ROI would be less because of that. That's the whole point, isn't it? You haven't done due diligence but believed that only a fraction of LKK is free and the rest can't be moved and is locked up. And thing is: Technically that is not the case. Practically you can think about how likely it is that founders and company will act less carefully with the market than they've done it in the past.  You're getting confused here. In simple terms, the transparency could be better and Olsen realises this. By putting all the coins into the circulating supply, he is making an attempt to end the debate on the valuation   Thing is: I know how you really think - you only think about what other Investors might think and if an obvious high valuation might deter Investors who also don't do due diligence. Right or right?  I take into account a lot of things when investing, and how the market perceives a technology is obviously something I consider as well. That's not the only thing I consider though...   Please decide what you want to be critical about. I've already explained that it's not that simple to find the best solution that makes everybody happy, is precise and fits to how coinmarketcap.com handles such things.  Its simple. A) Put all your coins into the circulating supply at the very start and declare that as the contributor to your market cap or B) Say the 90% coins won't be put into the circulating supply and will be managed separately. All issues are solved there and then.  There is literally no complex issue or ""we can't make everyone happy"" problem here at all.  All of these issues are lykke's own making because its playing technical games with its valuation. Its simply made up its own rules as its gone along and now has changed it again.   But actually it is simple: If somebody believes in the potential of this project he might consider it as a buy. And the question if this has potential is the question if the people behind are able to build this and also will act carefully on the market. Those who believe that founders and team are dishonest and only want to make a quick buck: Don't buy.  You've made your decision and I respect that. What I don't respect are your megaphon-attempts to spread your manipulative attempts.  I believe lykke ultimately will be very successful. However what Im interested in is my ROI. My ROI has been decreased because of this move and so it's been time for me to sell. Simple as that. If you didnt understand it, you need more investing experience, end of story.   My suggestion would be always to do due diligence. If you feel misleaded about how it was done in the past I can tell you: Read this thread and you'll find out that it was explained and I've replied on all questions about it and others as well. Same on reddit. Sergey and others did that on telegram and slack. There is also a blog-post in which it is explained that also gives a lot of additional informations and tips how to get interesting informations. Nothing was ever hidden.  Thanks for the suggestion.  My suggestion to you is you need more investing experience with higher ROIs and an ability to understand positioning.    I've done a lot of due diligence on lykke and have been following this whole thread for a very long time. Olsen has made a move which reduces my ROI and so I've sold. End of story.  As for nothing being hidden, answer to me again why a smaller and wrong market cap is showing in coinmarketcap? That is hiding the true valuation right there. Why show a lower market cap there if its not the rightful market cap?",False

Something like an overview about the Coinmarketcap-controversy to put things into perspective:   When Lykke was started and LKK was distributed to founders and Seed-Investors and Lykke as a company, the App was yet to release. And when it was released it didn't include the trading-section. This was about one year ago in June 2016:  ""Lykke, a Swiss fintech startup building a blockchain marketplace, has released a beta version of its cryptocurrency wallet app for iOS mobile devices. Some features included in the wallet are: tracking asset prices in real time for FX, BTC and colored coins; checking balances, transaction history and blockchain details at a glance; depositing and withdrawing bitcoins via QR code with no fees; and remotely disabling access if the phone is lost or stolen."" http://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/exchange/oandas-richard-olsen-launches-lykke-wallet-for-ios-devices/   During September/October 2016 there was the ICO which ended with these numbers:  ""Lykke, a Swiss Fintech company building a global blockchain-powered marketplace, concluded its initial coin offering (ICO) at midnight, October 11th, with the sale of 23,226,753 coins, raising 1,161,338 CHF."" https://www.lykke.com/company/news/blockchain_powered_exchange   When Lykke was added to Coinmarketcap some time after the ICO, the number of 30 million LKK was displayed as ""marketcap"". If Lykke would have said: Total supply = marketcap it would have been incorrect and misleading, because while the supply in hands of seed-Investors, founders and Lykke as a company is technically not locked up, it's also not on the market like the supply of public Investors.   Coinmarketcap later changed it's procedure and displays ""circulating supply"" since. And that is connected to the trading-section. The advantage is that it's very flexible and can be an interesting indicator. If LKK is moved from private or coinprism-wallets into the trading-section the number goes up and the other way around.  But one disadvantage is of course that it doesn't necessarily correlate with the price. It is possible that a lot of LKK's are bought and the price goes up, and if the supply then is moved into private the number of ""circulating supply"" goes down. Since many read ""circulating supply"" as ""marketcap"" it also can lead to a distorted impression about the total value of Lykke.  What is important to understand: Coinmarketcap lists hundreds of different projects that are very different by design. The site once was designed to display Cryptocurrencies with a fixed ""payout"" per day (mining or staking) like Bitcoin. But others have sold a fix number in an ICO that raises over time because of the protocol. Others have put a percentage of Coins on the market while a majority of supply is held by the teams and they use it to pay for development and so on. Under the line it differs a lot what is displayed on that site and there is no way for them to find the one perfect procedure to be totally correct for all of those projects. Factom for example sold 50% of the total supply to the public while 100% is displayed as circulating supply. That is also not really correct because the supply held by Factom-Foundation is not on the market. Sometimes that is used to attack Factom as well. And in Factom's case that number even goes down because the more it is used the more Factoids are burned while there is no inflation yet (also not fully developed) - very confusing for those who don't know the project but look at the numbers.   And Lykke moves supply into the trading wallets so it will be displayed as ""circulating supply"". At the same time that will also not be totally correct because founders and company and also those who invested very early won't simply sell. But it will give a more precise picture of the total value of Lykke.  And just btw, one advantage will also be that Lykke will go up in that list and become more visible.   My favorite site is https://bravenewcoin.com/lykke#Trading-Pairs, because it's much more precise regarding the chart. One can move over it and it shows different pairs and the volume per Currency etc. Regarding supply they keep it simple and display Total supply * price = marketcap.   Important is also: Moving supply does not mean that it will simply be sold. Founders and company, team-members and seed-Investors have zero interest to damage the price and the valuation of Lykke. And they've always been transparent!  This document of February gives a lot of details about the company, supply and distribution:  INFORMATION BROCHURE FOR COINHOLDERS FEBRUARY 2017 https://forward.lykke.com/files/Memorandum.pdf   This blog-post of april gives a lot of informations and useful tips how to get informations and how to read the Blockchain-Explorer:  Why does Lykke Coin price go up? https://www.lykke.com/city/blog/why_does_lykke_coin_price_go_up   This is the Asset ID: https://blockchainexplorer.lykke.com/asset/AXkedGbAH1XGDpAypVzA5eyjegX4FaCnvM  It shows a list of Shareholders, distribution and even makes it possible to get informations about the past. One can click on the date and type in a past date and it will show how it was at that time. The number of Coinholders is 3992 right now. 30 days back it was 1834.  That's an increase of 117% in just 30 days and it's accelerating what is also an aspect why the price went up like it did.   That said: Lykke will keep on being transparent. A new financial report will be published soon. I haven't seen it yet but I have no doubt that it also will include all necessary details.",False

Coins that are locked, reserved, or not able to be sold on the public market are coins that can't affect the price and thus should not be allowed to affect the market capitalization as well. The method of using the Circulating Supply is analogous to the method of using public float for determining the market capitalization of companies in traditional investing.""  Lykke is making up its own rules about market capitalisation and trying to apply them to the market. That's because Lykke isn't operating under the free market and so its valuation is bogus.  A true valuation and free market is where buyers meet sellers. Buyers set a price, and sellers set their price, and where the meeting happens between them is what sets the actual price of the token. This isn't happening with Lykke at all. People can't even set limit orders!  You can see very clearly on reddit and even on here that many people are saying the valuation is bogus - you should take that on board. Olsen has taken that on board and what's why he's moving the 90% pre-investor coins into the trading wallet.  Lykke attempting to dictate its valuation to the market has had the market pushing back. Therefore Olsen is moving towards greater transparency to try and solve the valuation issues.  Last point is..Olsen made an AGREEMENT with coinmarketcap that this is how the valuation would be done for Lykke. There is a meeting of the minds there so Olsen is complicit in this. If Olsen thought the valuation was completely wrong, he doesn't have to agree with coinmarketcap at all. He has agreed, but now he's attempting to change the valuation by moving the pre-investor coins into the trading wallet lol  Anyone who has been in crypto long enough knows this is called flooding the market.

I personally don't even get why it has so much meaning for you.  2) That site makes ""agreements"" with all projects. Most likely they simply ask what might be best. And in no way it can be precise for all projects and all times.  3) It's not possible yet to set limit orders on Lykke, because Lykke is a project that is not finished yet but under development, like other projects in this space. No project is totally ready, not even the father of all: Bitcoin.  4) But Lykke also doesn't make it's own rules, it wouldn't even be possible to do that. Potential Investors make decisions to buy at a certain price or to stay away. Those who already are invested make decisions if to sell or to hold. If Lykke wouldn't care about that but set the price too high nobody would buy anymore. If Lykke would set the price too low it would be bought out and they have zero interest to sell ownership at discount.  5) Of course one can say that the valuation is too high. But that question is not that much about the status quo but about future potential. Those who believe that Lykke has the chance to become a billion-company, and I believe that, won't say that it's expensive now. Another part of the story is the context: Please show me one project that is at a valuation that couldn't be seen as overvalued at this point of time.  - Ripple is at $10 billion, only what is on the market. And XRP is not like LKK, not a share of the company. At the same time the company holds billions of it, in Dollar. It's just a bridge-currency and nobody seems to know why it needs to exist. The decision to lock up supply was made 1 month ago and years after Ripple was started in 2014.  Ripple Pledges to Lock Up $14 Billion in XRP Cryptocurrency - May 16, 2017 http://www.coindesk.com/ripple-pledges-lock-14-billion-xrp-cryptocurrency/   - Bitshares is at $796,550,979  - Monero ist at > $600 million  -  Augur is at $319,358,600 and is a smart contract  - Waves is at $502,451,000 (a decentralized exchange running on an own blockchain - that has pro's but also some con's)   ...to give only a few examples. If you believe that all those projects are valued in any way objective but Lykke is not - maybe think about it.    And to say this:  ""Anyone who has been in crypto long enough knows this is called flooding the market. Its an attempt to game the market capitalisation by increasing the circulating supply of coins.""  ...is interesting in a lot of ways:  1. How long are you in Crypto? Your account is pretty fresh (April 14, 2017). I'm long enough in this to know these kind of games. Of course you are not new. So, please let us know more about your intentions to use a newbie-account and to use a megaphone here and on reddit. There is nothing wrong to express concerns and critique, to ask questions and so on. But to attack how you do it, to confuse things intentionally, to misquote and to act so dishonest - that tells a story.   2. Moving supply that was distributed before the App even existed is not ""flooding the market"". If they would want that they could have done that in the past. If they would have intention to act dishonest they wouldn't speak about it openly and be that transparent as they are.  See, that is what makes me personally really angry. You try to use Richard Olsen's honesty against him and the team. They've always shown transparency, replied on all questions, they are working all the time as if they don't need any sleep. They give their best to be in touch with Investors and Users - and you are very engaged in your attempt to turn that all against them.

If Lykke would have started on other exchanges I believe that it would have pumped and dumped over and over again. People call it a free market and that is not wrong, but manipulation is part of the game, especially on Poloniex. That's one reason why LKK started on Lykke. Another reason is that it leads to a better base - those who invest in LKK-shares on Lykke are likely to be real Investors who care about the project instead of being short-term-gamblers with the trollbox as only source for ""informations"".  That said: It is planned to get LKK on other exchanges as well. Advantage would be a more of attention and it also would avoid theories about Lykke being too dominant.

In other words, lykke is artificially setting the price of the LKK token which isnt using free market forces. In baby terms...it means their gaming their price to their advantage.  LKK isnt trading on the free market ie on bittrex, polo etc so of course the LKK pricing system is biased. As a private company, lykke is entitled to do that obviously, but investors need to be aware that they're paying a substantial premium for LKK tokens than if it was on the free market.  Its a clever pricing strategy resting on centralisation and a special technical angle  Quote There's a big difference between putting coins in circulation, and putting sell orders out for tonnes of coins.  What they're doing is simply giving the existing shareholders the ability to sell IF they wish. This means the angel investors, founders, institutional guys, and people who believed in Lykke can sell their original distribution if they wish.

In other words, lykke is artificially setting the price of the LKK token which isnt using free market forces. In baby terms...it means their gaming their price to their advantage.  LKK isnt trading on the free market ie on bittrex, polo etc so of course the LKK pricing system is biased. As a private company, lykke is entitled to do that obviously, but investors need to be aware that they're paying a substantial premium for LKK tokens than if it was on the free market.  No. This is false. The market is setting the price of LKK based on the constraints of the algo bot. If nobody is buying, and people are selling, the bot will drop the spot price for buys. That's how it works.  Lykke will be added to other exchanges, however, lykke is an exchange, it's going to be directly competing with the likes of polo and kraken. Once limit orders are in place on like (set as a near term goal so should be very soon), this issue will evaporate.  If you don't like the way the Lykke market is currently set up with the algo trading bot. Don't buy. It's pretty clear and simple. Nobody is forcing you to.   Quote There's a big difference between putting coins in circulation, and putting sell orders out for tonnes of coins.  What they're doing is simply giving the existing shareholders the ability to sell IF they wish. This means the angel investors, founders, institutional guys, and people who believed in Lykke can sell their original distribution if they wish.

The remainder 90% were already purchased / owned by the founders, angel investors, etc. who originally funded the project. Their shares were never on the market to begin with, so private wallet / trading wallet for them is irrelevant, as their stakes were locked as per shareholder agreement.

And there is no real difference for the market. It won't be simply dumped what also wouldn't make any sense because it would be dumped into Lykke-Buy-Orders since User-limit-orders are not possible until now. There also won't be a super-huge-sell-wall.   Quote Which tells me that the project will be overvalued in many people's eyes (the free market), leading to a substantial drop in price  But if that should be the case, that people right now believe the valuation is below of what it really is, you should see it as a push for transparency and not the opposite. And while this move is not a secret but openly told the public and discussed by the community here and on reddit and also on Slack the price did not drop until now. I believe the reason is that the high valuation never has been a secret. I've communicated it here several times, and also on all other places (I'm Ph03n1xII on reddit btw). And the total supply is also one ""focus-info"" on all places and official documents.   Quote I am selling all my LKK immediately and will wait until the dust settles before re-buying again. There is no need to flood the market with so many coins whatsoever  That is everybodies own free choice. And sure, it is possible that some or even many Investors might be kind of scared or expecting others to be. Until now that is not the case. The price did not go down but even more up.  And I personally don't believe that this will have much impact on the price while I believe that if the price should go down it will be profit-taking, a usual price correction. But I often believed that to happen in the past and all corrections until now were pretty much short-term and the price recovered very quickly.  Quote This move isnt respecting the investors who bought LKK on the Lykke trading wallet..its making a mockery of them  See, there are early Investors who bought LKK before there the APP existed. And there never was a sell-restriction while the supply that was displayed on coinmarketcap as ""on the market"" was not precise but only displayed the ICO of Sept/Oct 2016 if I recall it correctly. Then Coinmarketcap changed it to ""circulating supply"". And in Bitcoin for example that counts all BTC that are in existence. In Ripple it counts all XRP that are not locked (Ripple as company made the decision to hold back a certain amount they control). In Lykke it's about the difference of trading wallets and the other options (private or coinprism).  If compared to Bitcoin: All LKK's are already in existence so all could counted as circulating supply If compared to Ripple: There is no such sell-restriction in Lykke. But at the same time LKK's represent ownership and founders and company will not just be carefully with that because they don't have any interest in damaging the price and the value of the company, they also have no interest to sell their ownership cheap - they founded this, they are the ones who work hard to make Lykke successful.  Out of Investor-perspective LKK has much more advantages than XRP that is just a bridge currency without much base or connection to the success of the company behind. And it's everybodies free decision, based on own conclusions, to decide if one wants to buy and to participate that way in the potential but of course, it's also putting money at risk - and that is true for all Investments. And Richard Olsen is very open about it and says:  ""Every buyer of LKK needs to be aware that the Lykke project is high risk – we are reinventing finance and build an emergent organization that is inspired by the principles employed by nature and where all the software and knowledge is open source. We will make mistakes and these mistakes can be costly, so there is risk and any investor should only buy LKK, if he can afford to lose his money.""  And that is not the first time he states that.   Quote     I believe Richard Olsen realises he made a mistake and is trying to correct it before the situation gets much worse  I believe it would be a big mistakes not to communicate it but to do it. And it would even be worth if they would do that in a hidden fashion, slowly over months and thinking Investors would be too stupid to recognize it.",False

If the valuation was $450mn+ already, he wouldn't say that the valuation of the company would move to $450mn would he?  He would say the valuation was ALREADY $450mn...he wouldn't say it would move to that!! You are busted - read what he said on reddit  Here it is:  If the price of LKK does not change and remains at 0.374716 USD the total market capitalisation will jump to 481,772,471 USD.  ^He says it will JUMP to $450mn - why doesn't he say it ALREADY IS $450mn??? Because he wasnt being transparent from the beginning and gave the wrong figures to coinmarketcap to mislead investors...that's all he's done.  Now he is attempting to correct his mistake before it's too late.  This nonsense that ""oh its not in the trading wallet! It doesnt count!"" is chronic bullshit. The coins were bought and so they have value.

There is no reason for this decision, unless the initial plan was for the 90% not to be added to the trading wallet at all. Read that again as its very significant. The initial plan was to not make the 90% get added to the trading wallet, which is why the agreement was made by coinmarketcap not to add them However because so many people are questioning the valuation and the figures showing, Olsen is more or less changing his track and his mind.  Whereas before the 90% coins weren't to be in the trading wallet, due to investor disgruntles he is now putting them in the trading wallet for transparency.  He has decided one thing, and then backtracking to change his mind.  The issue with that is its a breach of trust. Its like ripple and XRP making an announcement that they wont flood the market with their XRP, and then going ahead and doing it.  It seems to be Olsen thinks he can do whatever he likes and people wont notice it.  Last thing: If your arguing that the 90% coins dont need to be sold, then that again means they dont need to be on the trading wallet.  ---------  Again, Ive sold all my LKK as there's been a breach of trust...everyone else make up their own minds.",False

I think Tempus posted about that in a shorter form above  Its complete and total nonsense to only use trading wallet coins in the valuation - makes no sense whatsoever.  There is something you don't get right here and I don't yet understand what it is. Please think about it out of Lykke-perspective. We can put it this way:  - They've sold LKK to the public. They know how much and they are transparent about it. And what is safe to say: That is free floating and therefore it is part of the marketcap of course.  - They own the majority of shares themselves and that was never a secret. It's also logical because Richard Olsen put the most money into Lykke, is it's biggest Investor but before all: They do all the work. LKK represents ownership and I would be concerned if they would make an attempt to sell that out at discount prices. That would also be bad for future funding and Lykke is not cheap to build, especially regulations but also all the salaries are some money.   So let's say they would have said: 100% of the supply is free floating. Would that be true? No, of course not. It's not locked up but it's also not really on the market. If they would have said that 100% is marketcap people would also be critical and assume that Lykke only gives a percentage on the market while holding the rest back to get a higher cap. And as long as coinmarketcap displayed the supply as marketcap (while the total supply always was displayed as well) the number was what was sold to the public in the ICO.  The decision to display ""circulating supply"" and to connect that with the trading wallets is more precise but it goes up and down, dependent on individual Investors. Let's say some whales move their money out of the trading and into private section - the cap would go down, or the other way around. The information given on coinmarketcap would never be really precise.  And now there is the decision to simplify that and founders and company move their LKK into the trading-section that also will prevent an up and down of the marketcap-line that might be not necessarily connected to the price.   Under the line it's simply about finding the best way under given circumstances.    Quote Olsen again lied in reddit saying they didnt have the necessary infrastructure to make the 90% coins available so thats why it previously didnt count. The issue though is that if any transaction takes place, a trade has taken place. Doesnt matter if infrastructure is there or not.    Let's take a look at what he says:  ""When Lykke was founded and started the first rounds of fund raising, the coins were issued to other wallets, because the trading wallet was not yet developed.""  I didn't know Lykke when it was started. I found it in august 2016 or so. But there was a time that Lykke already was there but without any App. I believe LKK's were managed about coinprism. That is not a lie.  And no, not all transactions are trades. A lot of transactions doesn't change the ownership-status - if I transact Bitcoin from Polo to Lykke it's also not a trade.    Quote Coins have been bought and the coins have been traded no matter what ""status"" they're in. But not all coins have been sold and they will never sell out and simply give up their ownership. It's really important to understand that LKK represents that: Shares of the company.   Quote Just because the coins are in or not in a ""trading wallet"" doesn't mean trades for all the coins haven't taken place Again - only a percentage was sold.    Quote The bottom line is: Olsen has been misleading people and it's clear here...he's trying to fix this issue and that's a good thing. I dont believe its intentional, but it is predatory for sure and has led to an unnecessary breach of trust to correct the problem.  Again: I would suggest that you state as opinion what is in fact opinion and not as fact what is only opinion. You come up here with pretty hard accusations and it's some work to reply on your rants and put things into perspective. You are free to believe whatever you believe. If you've lost trust in Lykke now I won't even try to convince you otherwise. But don't state things as fact that are no facts.     Quote No other coins have this issue with their market cap (except the dodgy coins like XRP lol), so go figure  That's not true. Two projects I'm also invested are Factom and Antshares. In Factom the total supply is counted as circulating while also a huge amount is held by the foundation and team and is in fact not really circulating. There has been critique in the past that the lower supply that is practically on the market is misleading while about 50% or something like that is not on the market. I don't know the actual numbers but their ICO was a decision about the total supply and if I recall it correctly only 50% was put on the market.  Antshares: Total supply is 100,000,000 ANS while circulating supply is stated as 50,000,000 ANS. That is precise because the team has given itself a sell-restriction until later this year. But what it needs: trust. If they would be scammers (I'm sure they are legit) there wouldn't be a way to prevent them breaking the rules.   And there are other projects as well that are not displayed precisely. There is no way to find a way that is perfect for all.        Quote ----------  Here's what Ive just posted on the reddit:  The real question is: Why would Olsen agree with coinmarketcap to only show trading wallet coins in the market cap then? There is no reason for this decision, unless the initial plan was for the 90% not to be added to the trading wallet at all. Read that again as its very significant. The initial plan was to not make the 90% get added to the trading wallet, which is why the agreement was made by coinmarketcap not to add them However because so many people are questioning the valuation and the figures showing, Olsen is more or less changing his track and his mind.  I've tried to explain the procedure above - not only Lykke has changed over time but also coinmarketcap. And yes, it is about finding the best way. But not to mislead Investors. The question is what is best to give precise informations. And again: People also would be critical if Lykke would state that the total supply = marketcap as if it would be on the market (and coinmarketcap displayed it that way in the past) it would be said: Lykke acts misleading because the marketcap gives the impression as if the whole supply would be in Investor-hands.  Since some time Coinmarketcap displays circulating supply instead of marketcap and the decision was made to connect that to the trading wallets. And that is more precise but since that can change in a short time, people are totally free to send Coins from trading to private and forth and back the circulating supply chart wouldn't be necessarily connected to the price. And now the majority of the total supply will be transferred into the trading-section and both charts will correlate in future.    Quote Whereas before the 90% coins weren't to be in the trading wallet, due to investor disgruntles he is now putting them in the trading wallet for transparency.  And that would be bad? I know that they've thought about how to do it some time ago. It's not a decision that comes up without thinking about it. Richard Olsen even talked to me on phone about it and that was in april. But let's say it only would be a reaction on feedback: Why would that be bad?  Quote He has decided one thing, and then backtracking to change his mind. Oh boy... First of all: Richard Olsen is not the ""dictator-decision-maker"" you obviously seem to see in him. Actually he is more a man who asks a lot of questions, who involves the team and even small guys like me to find the best way. And sure, it's not possible to do things perfect and make decisions that everybody will like for all times. But why are you so critical if you can see that a team tries to find the best option under changing circumstances that are not under own control and that are communicated openly and honest?    Quote The issue with that is its a breach of trust. Its like ripple and XRP making an announcement that they wont flood the market with their XRP, and then going ahead and doing it. If you believe that Lykke has the plan to sell out - sure, in that case it's understandable that you move your money out. But there is no plan to do so and it's also not announced that way and Richard Olsen didn't say that.  And just btw: There might be others who are not happy about this move while there also might be others who were not happy how it was handled before. Maybe there are more who are concerned. But until now I don't see that it's a big drama. If that would be the case the price would have been crashed because a majority of Investors would have reacted with selling. The info is out since days and you make some noise on two platforms: here and on reddit. It's not meant critical btw, I just want to say: The topic got some attention now but the price doesn't reflect the trust-issue you imply.   Quote It seems to be Olsen thinks he can do whatever he likes and people wont notice it. If he would think that he would do it without saying it, right? He does the opposite. He is totally open about it and again: He is not the only decision-maker at Lykke. That you constantly pointing fingers on him, in combination with some hard accusations, makes things already kind of wrong.   Quote Last thing: If your arguing that the 90% coins dont need to be sold, then that again means they dont need to be on the trading wallet.  But that is not what I said. Lykke sells LKK whenever people buy because until now there are only Lykke-Orders on Lykke. Limit orders are likely to come soon but are not there yet. But how much Lykke sells is not only a question of demand but also a question of funding. They have to find a most possible best way to be well funded, not sell out ownership at an early stage of the company, to meet demand that is there and increased significant over the last two months, also to serve Investors and to give informations what includes other sites of course, like coinmarketcap.     ---------  Quote Again, Ive sold all my LKK as there's been a breach of trust...everyone else make up their own minds.  If you say that you've lost trust you can say that is a fact because nobody else could know that better than you. But you say that ""there has been a breach of trust"" and that implies that it's true for others as well. And while that might be true for some others, maybe even many - we both can know that until others say it. What we both can see as fact: The price doesn't reflect a collective breach of trust.

He is doing it to correct a mistake because he even says so...  Here is the statement from Olsen:     Few things you need to be aware of:  1. Why is he talking about a jump if the market cap is already $481mn?  2. Why is he saying lykke is a high risk investment?  3. Why is he saying they will make mistakes along the way?  The answers are:  1. Its because the market cap isnt $481mn..its $50-60mn, according to the calculations agreed between Olsen and coinmarketcap.  2. Its because he's making a high risk move  3. Its because he's correcting a mistake  This is from his own words....he has said the valuation would be jumping, that there is high risk, and they will make mistakes.  It is circulating supply which matters and this is what was agreed between Olsen and coinmarketcap to agree the valuation..  The way to resolve the issue with the market cap would be one of 2 ways:  a) Declare that pre-investors would have their coins in a separate wallet from the circulating supply system, to avoid confusing the figures. This is taking the XRP and Ripple route by keeping pre-investor coins separately to avoid flooding the system, and would protect the current price and market cap (the $50-60mn one). Flooding the system doesnt mean there would be big sell orders. Flooding the system means changing the circulating supply unnecessarily to inflate the agreed market cap valuation.  This was the initial route which Olsen took. The circulating supply of coins bought on the exchange is what counted towards the market cap - which is why the agreement was made between Olsen and coinmarketcap. Otherwise why not just make all the coins - the full 100% count to the market cap from the start?  Why did Olsen not add all the coins into the market cap at the start then? Why was the agreement not made for this? Its a mute point to say just because the coins weren't on the trading wallet, that they shouldn't contribute if that's the argument someone wants to make.  The answer is it was an intentional decision to not add all the coins into the market cap. The private pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be part of the circulating supply to influence the public market cap.  b) The 2nd route is putting all the coins into the trading wallet so that all the coins are counted in the valuation figure. This is the route that Olsen has taken, which means its a U-turn. He made a mistake to say only the coins bought on the exchange should count to the market cap. To correct this mistake and to end any debate about the valuation, this move is being taken. It creates transparency and stability for the long term.  He is saying lykke is high risk because he's making a high risk move. Nobody knows what will happen when the valuation jumps to $481mn in his own words and because of this u-turn...It could fall, it could rise etc.  A change in valuation also means my ROI will be less. There is less growth % when the market cap is 500mn than if its 50-69mn , making it unattractive to many investors.  -----  The breach of trust thing is because the initial idea was for the coins bought on the exchange to be the circulating supply, and this was the basis for the market cap figure in coinmarketcap. The pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be on the circulating supply at all. I honestly dont think Olsen is stupid enough to make a schoolboy error in not including the pre-investor coins in the circulating supply. It was INTENTIONAL to not include the pre-investor coins in the circulating supply initially because those are private coins linked to an internal valuation of the company.  Olsen is smart...the pre-investor coins weren't supposed to be in the circulating supply, which is why he didnt include them at the start. The reason they're doing it now is because Olsen believes the market cap figure is misleading (hence the debate on reddit and previously in this thread). He has done a U-turn to create transparency for the market cap figures and to end the market cap debate once and for all.  My investment in Lykke was based on the understanding of circulating supply and visible market cap being just the LKK bought on the exchange, and that the pre-investor coins bought wouldn't contribute to the public market cap (not the internal valuation which is different). We saw that Olsen made the agreement with coinmarketcap to include just the exchange bought LKK...so my understanding was correct. Now though hes adding the pre-investor coins into the circulating supply, which is doing a U-turn. That to me makes this investment a lot less attractive.  It doesnt matter if the market hasn't reacted...it just means to me Ive sold my LKK and there's much better investments out there. The higher valuation (if it holds) is very off putting. I can make a higher ROI on smaller techs with a lower valuation.",False

Here's my take on your questions:  1. Why is he talking about a jump if the market cap is already $481mn? I think there's insufficient info given in Olsen's reply in that reddit thread, and will personally wait for more details (an official announcement on their blog, hopefully). It seems like what wasn't tradable in the past is now tradable, so logically speaking it should contribute to the market cap. Why now though, that's a valid question but I'd rather wait for the answers than to jump to conclusions.  2. Why is he saying lykke is a high risk investment? Because it is? Would you have preferred him to not say it, or to say that Lykke is a low-risk investment? In either case, given your underlying belief that Olsen and the Lykke team are dishonest, there would have been an argument from you anyway, right?  3. Why is he saying they will make mistakes along the way? I think it's actually very respectable for Olsen to say something like that. It shows transparency. Of course, you can also view it as him given himself an escape route.  It's all about perspective, and we all make decisions based on part facts and part beliefs.

Let me clarify:  The chief guy who is extremely busy doesnt go on reddit to write about stuff that isn't relevant to the discussion.  He is mentioning certain things because they are relevant to the points discussed.  The points discussed are market valuation and its calculation, high risk and mistakes, which is exactly what he's mentioned and is talking about in that post. Add those all together because they are relevant to each other, and you'll understand better what he's saying...they are related within that context and are relevant to each other.  What you're doing instead is taking each of these in isolation and seeing them as separate, resulting in you ending up missing the actual meaning.  In simple terms you're showing inexperience and lack of insight to interpret things correctly. Olsen is an entrepreneur and entrepreneurs will understand him better than the average layman.  Re: Why is he talking about a jump if the market cap is already $481mn?  What this question means is: you wouldnt be talking about any ""jump"" if your valuation was already $481mn. He is talking about a jump because the valuation is NOT $481mn at the moment.  This infers that the actual market cap he is talking about is not the total coin supply market cap (ie 90% coins + exchange traded coins) which would give the $481 mn, but the circulating supply market cap.  The market cap reference he is referring to is the public market cap. You don't talk about a jump unless your talking about the public market cap in this context...not the private valuation (the $481mn one).  The calculations given by Olsen to coinmarketcap are the valuations of the public market cap and is how it was supposed to go. Now he's changed this...can't get any simpler than that.  Re: Why is he saying lykke is a high risk investment?  Look at the context of his post. He isn't talking about high risk for the sake of it...there's a time and place to talk about certain things and a busy CEO doesnt just come out with random statements for the sake of it. He is talking about high risk because he just made a high risk announcement.  Re: Why is he saying they will make mistakes along the way?  Again, look at the context of his post and the thread he posted it on. He is talking about mistakes because it was a mistake to only include the exchange traded coins in the total market cap calculation. This is really simple for anyone who has been following LKK closely to understand...  Olsen doesnt just add this in randomly you know. There is a time and a place to talk about mistakes, and he is talking about mistakes specifically in this context because he realises he made one. He is positioning it well and moving on.  ------  I dont think Olsen is dishonest at all..he's made a legitimate mistake and he'll learn from it and move on. He's creating transparency through this move and that's totally fine for the long term viability of the project, which ultimately I believe will be very successful. However, as I've said its going to cause some investors to sell....because now the ROI is much less than it would have been, had Olsen stuck to his initial strategy.  Quote 1) I've replied on all of your points to be precise. If I am I would appreciate that you do that as well instead of simply writing down another long text.  2) What I really don't like is how you combine your concerns and opinions with given informations to come to conclusions that are often also only opinions, even hard accusations, that you state as facts.

There is enough I should reply on, because I wouldn't like to see all the accusations without putting things into perspective (again).  Sorry, i'd love to reply in detail but im far too busy, so i'll be brief:  Everything I've said is based on what Olsen himself has said.....I havent just come up with something random out of the blue.  Olsen himself posted on the reddit post and you can see clearly what he wrote. There is no mistaking that whatsoever. That is the basis for this whole discussion and everything else is just assumption.  Within the context of that thread and discussion, he is very clearly talking about the valuation of lykke, the high risk nature of lykke and mistakes that will be made. The CEO doesnt just say that out of the blue and in a random way. All of these points are related - he made a mistake with the way the valuation was calculated (the public valuation) and now he has done a u-turn (a high risk move) to give a more transparent valuation. In the long term it will be better for lykke of course that the mistake is corrected now. And yes, I do believe the lykke project will make a lot of money and will ultimately become highly successful.  That is total common sense to me....if you can't see that, then that show's you lack a deeper insight...no offense  I've sold my LKK and am moving on...if your just looking for an average profit then LKK might be a good investment for you...but that's not for me. (and Im talking long term investment for the average profit, who knows what will happen when the market cap updates...also it depends on the timescale that existing investors are looking at for their ROI).",False

Richard Olsen made a post about the supply and how it's handled, also about the value on reddit:   ""Thank you for all the comments about the valuation of Lykke.  Coinmarketcap computes the market capitalization of Lykke based on the coins that are held in the trading wallets and does not include the coins held in other wallets. When Lykke was founded and started the first rounds of fund raising, the coins were issued to other wallets, because the trading wallet was not yet developed. In June we will move all the Lykke coins to the trading wallet. If the price of LKK does not change and remains at 0.374716 USD the total market capitalisation will jump to 481,772,471 USD.  Every buyer of LKK needs to be aware that the Lykke project is high risk – we are reinventing finance and build an emergent organization that is inspired by the principles employed by nature and where all the software and knowledge is open source. We will make mistakes and these mistakes can be costly, so there is risk and any investor should only buy LKK, if he can afford to lose his money.  What is the appropriate valuation of LKK? LKK is not just a normal crypto currency that can be used to make payments. LKK is also a share participation in Lykke Corp and entitles to dividend payments, when Lykke earns a profit. 1 LKK represents a share participation of 0.0000000778% of Lykke Corp to be exact. Lykke is more than a regular stock exchange, because we will be one of the liquidity providers on the exchange and will ourselves offer investment products for our users to invest. In addition, we have our accelerator business, where we help incumbents to retool their business and move to blockchain. We are acquiring the regulatory approvals to turn the Lykke marketplace into an industry strength organisation that institutions can use. There is a lot of upside for the Lykke business model. An increase of the LKK price is positive for us, because it makes it easier to fund our expansion plan and attract top talent.  Lykke does not have any shareholder agreements, etc. preventing investors to sell their LKK. This strategy is in line with my approach to build a fragile company – my reasoning is as follows: If investors can at any time sell their coins, then selloffs will be spread out over time and are helpful warning signals for the company. We have seen a few early investors selling, which has slowed the upmove of LKK but was easily absorbed by other investors. We are observing a rapid increase of daily liquidity in LKK (yesterday 1 Mio USD). This is a healthy development that will cushion strong sell offs."" https://www.reddit.com/r/lykke/comments/6fvxqc/50m_market_cap/dipmw4u/",False

Lykkes trading is currently managed by a trading bot. You can check out how it works on their website.  There's a big difference between putting coins in circulation, and putting sell orders out for tonnes of coins.  What they're doing is simply giving the existing shareholders the ability to sell IF they wish. This means the angel investors, founders, institutional guys, and people who believed in Lykke can sell their original distribution if they wish.  The only thing that's happening is levelling the field between current LKK holders, and original shareholders.

LKK/EUR rose by +114% in the last month. Yeah, that is more or less average taking into consideration the big boom of the last 2 weeks. But remember when everything, BTC and altcoins, decreased by 10-30%? LKK was completely unimpressed by this and just continued rising. Thats also observable in the second graph LKK/BTC: Compared to BTC, LKK rose 15% and it didnt even drop a little bit when everything crashed. I think it is really interesting that LKK seems nearly (!) completely unrelated to the changes of the Bit- and Altcoin Market. Yes, it increases, but more due to the improved products of Lykke itself, not because the market is booming.

Of course Bitcoin price was not as high but we've seen huge increases for many other projects going 4-5x in terms of BTC (let alone in fiat).

Of course Lykke being the only one offering LKK is also the only market maker but if there were no buyers the price wouldn't move. There has been a big increase in users coming on board lately and the communities at Slack, Reddit and Telegram are very active.  Having a fully regulated global platform where you could trade any type of assets is very exciting in my opinion, I can't name a lot of projects similar to Lykke especially ones offering actual equity in the company and not just tokens or software/platform licenses as I like to call them . Equity is very different since a lot of other stuff come into play and I would say makes the projects more easy to estimate a value, that's why I think it has been a more stable investment so far, there's less speculation.  I would say Bitshares or Waves are similar somewhat, even ShapeShift, the problem always boils down to fiat ramps and usability which are to me huge questions marks in these projects.

Especially during the Bitcoin-hype the number of users is increasing.  - The community has a lot of trust into the team behind  - Lykke has a lot of potential and that becomes more and more obvious  - LKK1Y: the decreasing supply on the market, because more and more LKK1Y-Investors settle their LKK1Y's while an increasing number of ppl is interested in investing, leads to a higher price.

Well, a couple things to my eye. Lykke is not really a currency like so many of the other coins. It's actually a token system representing shares in the company. Lykke is a company, and one with pretty high goals.  The founder is the previous founder of OANDA, a FOREX company that's doing very well today: http://fairreporters.net/economy/largest-forex-brokers-by-volume-in-2015/ being one of the largest FOREX companies in the world pushing over $10 billion in trade volume every single day.  Lykke is looking to move in on initially the FOREX / crypto marketplace as an exchange house, and then on the longer term roadmap move onto securities.  This is where things get very interesting, as these kinds of businesses are very very valuable.  This is unique in my mind as it's one of the few ""coins"" discussed here that has some serious substance to it.  Quote And what do you expect the price to be by the end of 2017?  No idea, and honestly it doesn't matter. If this company does what they are planning on, it's 2020 / 2025 when it'll matter. And if they get where they're aiming the valuation might be one of the biggest (I'm talking more than bitcoins current market cap).  Everyone should at the least have their eye on Lykke.",False

But, independently of Lykke, I would suggest to think about all this more realistic and practical and less ideological, also to be able to come close to your high ideals. What I mean is: Total freedom is not for free. There would be a price to pay because humans are not necessarily saints and especially honest people would become victims of those who would mis-use ""total freedom"", especially when it's about money. That already happens each single day, in small and big (also institutional).  And if you want to be totally free and protect your data, you need to know how to do it, because while Lykke needs to do a KYC-process, there are many other providers that collect your data and know more about you than your closest friends while you are maybe not even aware. If you use Google without VPN - they do psychological profiles. Amazon and all big retailers do the same. Social networks are very interested in all what you express. And if you use a smartphone and maybe even a messenger like WhatsApp (which is Facebook btw) - think about how much and what you give them, maybe even without thinking about it. Fact is: Without hiding your IP you are tracked all over the internet and with each single click you give data away about you.  And if you say: ""NO ID! How about that, I'll stick to Satoshy's bitcoin!"" - you should know that the blockchain is not anonymous. It can be tracked and I personally have not much doubt that it's already done. If you want to be consequent you shouldn't even use Bitcoin, or you need to do a lot and follow some rules to be anonymous. If you want to use exchanges it becomes complicated then, because there won't be many options, especially if you want to stay totally anon but also to use Fiat. And even Crypto-only-exchanges start with basic KYC-requirements once a User wants to move more money - take a look at Poloniex or Bittrex.  That said: I understand idealism and I'm all for privacy and data protection. But it's also about being realistic and in most of all cases it's also about a look into the mirror. Only a minority is really consequent when it's about self-responsibility and data-protection.",False

The KYC-process also reflects that approach. It's meant to be easy to do and also to be fast, while avoiding the risk that ppl mess with it. The guys behind this project are not naive but smart, and they have to be, because Lykke needs to be safe on the legal side to reach it's high ambitions.

As its site mentions, they could release these shares the old way as regular companies do to make it ""official"" but the whole philosophy of Lykke is that regulators and companies should meet halfway.

Currency trades were the first implemented include cryptocurrency trades. Next up is supposedly music rights and carbon emissions. Multisig wallets require two keys before a transaction occurs. Transactions are thus approved by partipcants and the exchange. The transactions utilize the bitcoin blockchain which is secured by all the hashing power of bitcoin. A colored coin is attached the blockchain and allows the transactions to occur and be ""notarized"" by the network""   2) Points he is critical about:  - ""I really don't like these colored coin models but a decentralized exchange sounds interesting.""  - ""I really don't like these projects that use other blockchains . Factom is another in this group. However a decentralized exchange is a fantastic idea. I wish it was developed on its own chain.""    It's a fair post in my opinion. While it's not totally correct that Lykke develops a decentralized exchange because it's semi-decentralized (or semi-centralized), his explanation of Lykke is not a bad one. Fair is also that he doesn't hide that his conclusions are in fact subjective opinions - he states that ""he really doesn't like (...)"".  But: It would be interesting to know why he doesn't like the colored-coin-protocol and why he doesn't like projects that utilize other blockchains (Factom runs its own blockchain btw - but additionally anchors in Bitcoin).  Interesting is that he points on a key-aspect why it makes sense to use the Bitcoin-Blockchain: ""which is secured by all the hashing power of bitcoin""   I consider the author as somebody who will lykke it ;-)",False

It can also be applied to equity indexes where the storage costs are essentially zero however there is an associated time value of money (risk free interest rate) and possible dividends.  When the interest rate is higher than the dividend the market is in contango. We have been more or less in backwardation since the GFC in 2008 since the interest rates went to zero (or even negative in some countries) while the dividend yields actually rose in some cases.  https://www.quora.com/Are-S-P500-futures-in-contango-or-backwardation-through-most-of-their-history-Why-if-possible  However, you are correct in saying that contango does not apply straight off the bat to Lykke 1-year forward, its a bit more involved. You see the Lykke 1-Y is a future which has an upfront payment whereas futures are usually settled at the expiration. So the cash flow timing is different. On top of that there is an option built into the Lykke 1Y forward, which is the trigger. The option should in theory have a premium the value of which will depend on the volatility of the underlying asset (which is the LKK), as this is used to measure the probability of the asset increasing or decreasing in price over a period of time.  In financial theory, to get the volatility of an asset you can calculate that from the option price and other variables. However, in practice (in the markets) it works the other way round. What you have is the option price which is derived from the natural market forces of supply and demand and what you do is you back calculate the volatility (in which case it gets called as the implied volatility).  You see by having the Lkk1Y traded on the Lykke exchange, the Lykke team is essentially able to backcalculate the implied volatility. This is a much more accurate number than any volatility derived from theory using the black scholes or binary or any other option pricing model. So the Lykke team has been able to raise funds and at the same time cleverly able to derive the implied volatility - you need that to come up with pricing of other derivatives on Lykke they may need to list on the exchange in the future.  In short, I would expect the price of the LKK1Y to be higher than the Lkk merely due to the time value of money (measure by the risk free interest rate but complicated by the upfront payment) and the premium on the trigger option. Assuming dividend in the next 1 year will be zero which is a reasonable assumption to make for Lykke.

The other way to make profit is the possibility of an increasing LKK-price over time of course.   Quote What do you think is the advantage of this project over other similar ones?  I don't know all other projects deep enough to say much about them. But I've looked into some of them and decided not to invest because I'm always very concerned about teams (abilities, experience, honesty) in general and a project like that is very ambitious. And while there are many teams that start with big promises, often also believe in their own abilities (if not it's even intended scam), after some time it often comes out that there is a lack of expertise and experience. That is often a point in which even projects that were started legitimate (with good intentions) become shady because of different reasons (running out of money is one). It needs a lot of different kinds of abilities to not only get a project started and to do a successful ICO but to really develop it.  That said: One advantage of Lykke over those projects that try to do similar things is that there is a really skilled and experienced (and honest!) team behind this one. And it's a big team and as far as I can say: They are never bored. With other words: Since I know Lykke and have some insight I'm even more critical/concerned about some other projects with small teams of ""youngsters"", because Lykke somehow makes obvious how much it needs to get such a project to success.  What I also like: They focus on being effective. Instead of developing a ""Lykke-Blockchain"" they use Bitcoin and in future also other blockchains (Ethereum), and instead of doing it totally centralized, what would bring also some disadvantages, they combine the best of both worlds: the high security of a decentralized system plus the performance of a centralized system. In my opinion that is the best approach with the highest potential.  Plus: In comparison to others they are very good in developing user-friendly stuff. Without that the chance to be successful is near to zero in my opinion.  Quote   The only reason I'm interested is that the Oanda co-founder is behind this. I used to trade Forex on Oanda...

From the moment on you settle your LKK1Y they are locked up for 365 days. After that period you'll get LKK for your LKK1Y (1:1).   Advantage if you do it now instead of in 6 months: You'll get your LKK earlier since the 365-day-period is always the same once you make the decision to settle them.

Yes, the Bitcoin-blockchain is not very fast but very secure. And what needs to be considered when it's about: The matching-engine is centralized and very fast while settlement is decentralized to ensure a high level of security - quote out of the Whitepaper:  ""Exchanges for cryptocurrencies can be organized with a different degree of centralization. Typically, centralized exchanges are much more efficient, whereas decentralized exchanges are more secure as they require less trust in the exchange. Due to their higher efficiency and simplicity, most volume is currently traded on centralized exchanges such as BTC China, Bitstamp or Bitfinex.8 A trader on such an exchange must entrust all assets in his trading account to the exchange. History shows that this is not without risk, with the most famous examples being the collapse of MtGox (more than 600’000 Bitcoins disappeared) and the most recent hacking of Bitfinex (120’000 stolen Bitcoins). Exchanges such as Bitcoin.de and LocalBitcoins are more decentralized and restrict themselves to organize trades and offer escrow services, but let the traders execute the actual trade bilaterally, whereas traders on LocalBitcoins often even meet physically. This naturally limits the achievable speed of trading to the speed of the underlying payment system (e.g. SEPA or moving bank notes). These exchanges can achieve a much higher trading frequency without having to resort to client deposits by restricting themselves to cryptocurrencies that can be exchanged instantly. Examples of such exchanges or whole cryptocurrency systems that include built-in decentralized exchanges are Omni, Counterparty, and BitsharesX - none of which achieved the same commercial success yet as the aforementioned centralized exchanges. These exchanges frequently try to even decentralize the matching of trades, which is problematic as it is fundamentally hard to enforce rules in a decentralized system, especially when timing is crucial. For the design of our exchange, we opt for a system with centralized matching of trades, but with direct bilateral exchange of assets, trying to combine the best of both worlds. One should also note that, when trading particular colored coins or any other issuer-backed asset, there is exposure to a centralized point of failure anyway, namely the issuer.""  (...)  Generally, all received coins can immediately be reused in a new trade. Thus, trading can be as fast as the connection between a trader and the exchange permits (normally in the range of 10ms - 100ms). Temporarily, the number of trades can exceed the limits given by the Bitcoin blockchain, as this just leads to a delayed settlement.   Plus:  ""To mitigate capacity limit, Lightning Network13 and Micropayment channels14 are the perspective approaches. Instead of broadcasting each single transaction on the blockchain, parties deliver coins by sending signed transaction messages offchain with subsequent net settlement on the blockchain.""  https://www.lykke.com/Whitepaper_LykkeExchange.pdf   Here you can find a graphic of how the exchange works: https://www.lykke.com/technology",False

No fees along with how hard it will be to get the regulation needed (networking which Olsen has) to trade a variety of commodities and assets will take down competitors. We are talking about trading anything. Olsen even said houses. If we want to move to China and someone wants to move to Europe on lykke they could actually trade houses. Envision it as the Amazon of exchanges and Olsen is one of the few that can actually do it. Its why I believe it can surpass everything on the crypto currency market right now because hes making it in a way he will have a big moat around any competitor. Look at the stock price of Amazon. It has gone up so fast blowing past any sort of investment. Its market cap is through the roof because no competition. Just think of the traffic of combining centralized and decentralized traders into one exchange that can trade pretty much trade anything they want. It is almost hard to imagine. It has to much potential for him to actually sell it to another business. I honestly don't think someone else could run it as good as he can.,False

First: Lykke is currently in the process to get regulated in the USA and during that time no new customers will be verified. If you are from the USA it's possible that it won't be possible to deposit Fiat. I don't know right now if new US-citizen are totally blocked or if it's only about the verification-process (Selfie, Photo of ID, photo of address).  If you are not from the USA you would need to the verification-process first to be able to deposit and withdraw fiat. But it's simple: If you click on the + next to Euro (or CHF or other FIAT) the verification-process should start. It will take some time (maybe 48h) and you should get a confirmation-mail.   To buy and sell etc. you need funds in your trading-wallet (you have bitcoin now if I understand it correctly). You can type on ""exchange"" and you see all pairs that are available until now (more will follow, like Chronobanks Time-token, Ethereum and others). You can type on one and the rest should be pretty much self-explaining. With the next release of the App it will be even more intuitive/easy.  A very good overview about the current version as videos is this:  Tour of Lykke wallet https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFsI6QgZunI&list=PLk9DrzhaS5AjlYColQnvU6R17MNNNhihK  And here a demo-video of the next release - focus on margin trading: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUwhxfc3fi0    Colored Coins are technically Bitcoins (but very small units of BTC) and can represent different assets. Lykke-Coins for example are colored coins = small units of Bitcoin as representation of Lykke-shares. Same can be done with pretty much every value one can think of. Like Lykke also other companies could give out colored coins as company shares, colored coins can also represent fiat (that's also done on Lykke) or gold or even houses etc.  A good explanation is this: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins   Yes, a web-based-terminal is in development and a desktop-client is also planned. Lykke will change and grow dramatically over time. The App is just the beginning.     LKK1Y are forward contracts of LKK. Recently Lykke did a crowdfunding and sold LKK1Y-tokens for about 20% discount to LKK-shares. There are basically two possible scenarios:  1) To lock the LKK1Y-tokens up for 365 days. After 1 year LKK1Y will be swapped to usual Lykke-shares. 2) To trade the tokens as contracts (and a buyer could lock them up for example).

If you choose not to you can sell them back to the market. But if you do hold them you get 20% discount after the year is over the shares are released into your account. As for colored coins I believe they are bitcoin that turn different colors based on the contract you go into. If you want to sell a house the color of the coin might be one color. If you want to start a business it might be another colored coin. I am not sure exactly how it works but I do know a lot more can be done with a colored coin they a regular bitcoin.,False

Investors have the choice to trade those tokens as contracts or to lock them up for 365 days and after that they will be swapped to LKK-shares. Since it's unlikely that all Investors pull the 365-day-trigger at once they will slowly reach the market.  The majority of LKK is in the hands of founders, team, angel-Investors and company and of course it's in their own interest not to hurt the market price (that would lower the value of the company). If Lykke should start to make profit soon it's likely that they won't sell that much more. If funds should be needed there may be another crowdfunding like the recent one.

Didn't recognize that part.  Main-business of Lykke will be market-making --> using the spread. One can think of it as a flexible fee and goal is a very thin spread of course. The whole market is always adjusting, but I couldn't explain how it's done. Richard Olsen, but also Sergey Ivliev and some others, are true experts when it's about market-economics.  Once they have a little bit more time I'll suggest that somebody will write an article to explain it all in layman-terms ;-)  But, Lykke will be about many aspects: financial products, payment system (plus debit card), p2p-lending, maybe also prediction market, information-system, crowdfunding-platform and they also build software for other companies but I don't know any details about that.  Key will be volume. Lykke will be much more attractive once it's fully developed and once they'll add pretty much everything what's significant in Crypto and beyond, forex-trading and shares and so on.

BTC went from about $600 in Sept/Oct to an ATH and now there is the correction because of the ETF-disapproval and all the drama because of an anticipated hard fork and split. Reason Nr 2 may be that Lykke is in an early stage. Only those who recognize it's potential to grow are already attracted.

Right now I don't hold any BTC. I was nearly sure that the ETF wouldn't be approved. Regarding all the trouble: It's of course a bad situation, on the other side it speaks for some decentralization. I mean, Bitcoin is not govern like an Altcoin with a fix group behind. It's more a fight and over time that could turn out as healthy. It becomes a real problem if nothing happens. It needs movement.  Regarding Mining: It's more decentralized now than it was 3 years ago. In 2014 Ghash was multiple times at about 50% of the mining power. That looks more healthy now.
