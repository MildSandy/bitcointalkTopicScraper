However, the soft cap was unfortunately not reached and this results in refunding all investors as per smart contract rules.  Zabercoin had a very solid and useful product offering and a very promising potential but in the same time it was also a learning curve for the team especially in terms of requirements and rules to follow that will ensure ultimate ICO success.  The intension of the team was to combine smart contract one into the second smart contract version in order to compensate the bounty hunters and pre-sale investors. After in-depth consultation and advice from various third parties it was confirmed that this was against the smart contract rules and therefore not possible to adhere to. Since honesty and integrity are key corner stones of Zabercoin, the CEO, in his personal capacity, vouch to compensate the hard working bounty hunters of the first ICO with his own tokens of the second ICO. That is a truly remarkable gesture that has never been done before.  After long but fruitful brainstorming and strategic planning sessions, the team is now more than ready to plan a new and more exciting ICO! The Zabercoin team had such good intensions and confidence in their product that they invested over 1m USD in their personal capacity in the first ICO. However, paying these enormous school fees, enabled the team to gain key and invaluable ICO knowledge and irreplaceable and vital relationships with various stakeholders in the blockchain community. The team is now even stronger and much more equipped to ensure that the second ICO will be nothing less than a great success!  ALL CURRENT INVESTORS CAN CLAIM REFUND FROM SMART CONTRACT AS EXPLAINED IN THE FOLLOWING TUTORIAL: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O4Bf-UOJ0sRQ1hJUKNvxHPT1sjCehx848fZ7U8qWLB8/edit# KINDLY NOTE THAT PAYPAL INVESTORS WILL BE REFUNDED MANUALLY.

Zabercoin is an utility token but purchasing real estate will make out only one leg of our very resourceful and goal-oriented business plan, namely: 1.   High yielding property purchase – intrinsic value cryptocurrency 2.   Cost effective decentralised open source bookings eco-system 3.   Decentralised blockchain based property ledger 4.   Approved payment method for transfer duties on property The Zabercoin investor will enjoy added advantages and have life-changing experiences, namely: Money transfer. The Zabercoin user can conveniently, safely, privately and cost-effectively transfer money all over the world.  Peace of mind. Zabercoin investors will have peace of mind knowing that their investment will grow over time. Warren Buffet said: “Always invest for the long term”.  Cheaper holidays and accommodation. With Zabercoin tokens, users will be able to access blockchain decentralised open source bookings eco-system to pay for renting their hotel rooms, private properties or other accommodation. In comparison to existing cost structures, Zabercoin will charge only 4% (instead of the current 6 – 12%) for a guest and 2% (instead of the current 3%) for a host.  Receive incentives. Zabercoin has developed an attractive incentive model. For example, investors will receive incentives by means of the management of properties on the decentralised Zabercoin account portal by using 50% of the revenue earned through the decentralised open source bookings eco-system.  Access to records. With the decentralised blockchain based property ledger, Zabercoin property owners and potential buyers will have access to an accurate and seamless record of valuations and property ownerships.  Pay transfer duties on properties. Zabercoin tokens can be conveniently used to pay transfer duties on properties.  Value for money. Zabercoin developed a very attractive bonus structure for investors. The standard price (without any bonus) of Zabercoin (ZAB): 1 ETH = 35 ZAB. During the first week of December until 8 December at 11:00:00 UTC investors receive a 50% bonus. 1 ETH will then give you 52.5 ZAB. The bonus decreases by 10% each week. For example, when you invest in the second week of December between 8 and 15 December at 11:00:00 UTC you receive a 40% bonus. 1 ETH will then give you 49 ZAB, etc.  Sound investment. Zabercoin investors buy into a very good product offering with very little competition from other ICOs. Zabercoin demonstrates boldness, innovation and uniqueness in terms of its offering in the blockchain real estate environment.  High expectations. The potential for growth and success of Zabercoin is indeed promising. For example, the sustainable growth via rental income and the huge demand in Sub-Saharan Africa for more property space, just to name a few. As blockchain renting marketplace, Zabercoin has huge potential by offering the same product at a third of the existing price. Currently a company like Airbnb has a market cap of approximately 30Bn USD.  Kindly refer to our website at www.zabercoin.io for full details.

Purchasing lucrative property in especially emerging markets (EM) with great valuations. Although the focus of Zabercoin management will be to buy property within emerging markets, other profitable and lucrative projects outside EM will also be considered in its investment plan. Zabercoin makes use of all legal tax incentives like Article 13 Sex of the Income Tax Act of RSA to ensure sustainable and profitable rental income and maximum growth for the investor right from the start. Our investment philosophy in brief: At Zabercoin we strive to add value at each stage in the investment process which targets under-priced markets expected to maximise performance for a given level of risk. The management team adopts a top-down asset management approach. This means that a variety of economy-wide phenomena (macroeconomics) such as inflation, price levels, growth rates and unemployment of a country will be thoroughly evaluated before considering any prospective project. We strongly believe in a value investing style where the interests of the company and the investor always take preference in decision-making. Good asset selection, and active management are fundamental drivers of investment performance. 2. Developing a decentralised blockchain based property ledger which will record all real estate contracts, registrations and linked bills. With this ledger, Zabercoin will be able to provide property owners and potential buyers an accurate and seamless record of valuations and property ownerships. In comparison with Windeed, a centralised South African service provider, Zabercoin will be unique in providing a decentralised global service by effectively making use of the blockchain. 3. Developing a decentralised open source bookings eco-system for renting hotel rooms, private properties and accommodation using blockchain technology making it more cost effective for the host and guest and incentivising the users. AirBNB currently has a market cap of approximately 30Bn USD. They charge a guest between 6-12% and a host 3% after a successful stay. They expect to generate a revenue of over 10Bn USD by 2020. In comparison, Zabercoin will charge only 4% for a guest and 2% for a host. Half (50%) of above revenue will go to the users by managing the properties on their decentralised Zabercoin account portal as an incentive. By incentivising users there will be no need to market and by using blockchain technology administration costs will be very low. If Zabercoin, at a third of the price and incentive model to users/agents as well, can obtain only 10% of the market share of AirBNB it will value Zabercoin at 3Bn USD on this basis alone. If Zabercoin can raise 30m USD it will result in a 100x return on investment! 4. Using Zabercoins as payment method for transfer costs on properties. Barnard Inc Lawyers already approved this as a payment method. South Africa alone has over 80,000 transfers per annum and we intend to incentivise users as well. Bitcoin is seldom referred to as “digital gold” – an industry of 8.2 trillion USD. Zabercoin aims to become a digital real estate token – an industry of more than a 200 trillion USD. Sally Krawcheck, a digital financial advisor said: “Greater diversity drives better business results”.",False

Zabercoin believes in a Top-down value investing approach and thus first assess the EM country and macroeconomics for investing before getting involved in the project itself. Value investing has outperformed all other investment styles (momentum, size, quality etc) over time and forms the foundation for our investment decisions. The Zabercoin management team demonstrates specialised property development expertise and has excellent knowledge of the changing real estate market environment with extensive experience in large-scale, complex transactions, both locally and globally. Zabercoin maintains a “hands on” asset management philosophy. The team is involved in all capital investment decisions and is expected to interact regularly with property managers and other service providers protecting the interests of our investors. We believe superior cash flow and long-term returns can be achieved through active, “hands-on” strategic asset management. Zabercoin combines a “hands on” investment strategy with an experienced team to maximize results for our investors. Ÿ Investor focus Our approach to investment management focuses first and foremost on the Zabercoin investor, and integrates the experience and resources of the team managers to maximize investment results. We provide investment opportunities for both institutional and individual capital. Therefore, whether you are an institutional or a private investor, Zabercoin has the investment option that will meet your needs. Our team managers maintain focus and discipline when carrying out investment plans allowing them to reassess investment strategies in the light of both changing market conditions and evolving investor objectives. Our investment philosophy focuses on research and analysis as well as added value to the investor. · Research and analysis We will be guided by the application of forecasts and thorough qualitative and quantitative research and analysis of relevant data. We believe research provides a disciplined and consistent framework for making informed investment decisions. All investments are thoroughly screened before and after investment to assess their potential. We understand real estate as a financial asset, and apply techniques to analyse risk, and to identify and take advantage of market mispricing. Investment strategies are monitored annually and reviewed as market conditions evolve. · Added value We strive to add value at each stage in the investment process which targets under-priced markets expected to maximise performance for a given level of risk. The team believes in a top-down asset management approach. This means that a variety of economy-wide phenomena (macroeconomics) such as inflation, price levels, rates of growth and unemployment and the growth domestic product (GDP) of a country will be thoroughly evaluated before considering any prospective project. The gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the best ways to measure a country's economy. We strongly believe in a value investing style where the interests of the company and the investor always take preference in decision-making. Good asset selection, and active management are fundamental drivers of investment performance. Real estate investment is unusual in that value can be added after purchase, and we seek to maximise these opportunities. · Emerging market focus Emerging markets are defined as economies with low to middle per capita income and are usually considered fast-growing economies. The core business of Zabercoin is to focus on the acquisition of well-located and lucrative properties in emerging markets (EM) that will generate significant income and escalate in value. Although the focus of Zabercoin management will remain with the acquisition of property within emerging markets, other profitable and lucrative projects outside EM will also be considered and accommodated in its investment plan. All properties acquired in both EM and other markets should at least have: · favourable long term prospects, and · sustainable competitive advantages The key to the success of Zabercoin lies in obtaining good properties that can be bought at attractive prices and holding them over long periods of time. Our goal is to beat the market over time. We believe emerging markets are well placed. For example, as these economies and real estate markets improve, buyers enter the market and drive up acquisition prices. · Competitive advantage In a nutshell Zabercoin offers a significant competitive advantage to the potential investor based on key drivers: · Dedicated and proficient management team · Integration of our quality research outputs into the investment process · Proven track record in investment management · Responsible investing · Standardised processes · Internal control systems and integrated risk management Since real estate investment generally represents a long-term investment horizon, this means that our investors can rely on Zabercoin's commitment from the beginning, taking responsibility for the full life time of the investment. · Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) The Zabercoin management team is convinced of the growing importance of sustainability in terms of being able to offer investors a good return compared to the market. In pursuing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), a company makes conscious choices to find the right balance between the economic, social and environmental aspects of all internal and external business activities. Being a responsible investor means we are committed to incorporating key principles of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) into our organisation: · Responsible investing – At Zabercoin we strive wherever possible to reduce the environmental impact of the assets we manage and accentuate sustainability in our communication with investors. · Ethical business conduct – We pursue CSR-driven decision-making and seek transparency throughout all our business operations. · Sustainable operations – We embody the change we wish to see in the world by creating the best possible working environment and conditions for our employees and seek to reduce the environmental impact of our business operations as much as possible. · Commitment to society – We strive to contribute to society by donating to and sponsoring social causes as a company, and encouraging our staff to do likewise. · Focus on green energy for the environment in housing projects – one of Zabercoin's team members wrote a thesis on renewable energy in real estate for his Master's degree at Tshwane University, Pretoria, South Africa. VALUATIONS AND POTENTIAL IN EMERGING MARKETS (EM) An emerging market is defined as an economy with a low to middle per capita income and is considered to be a fast-growing economy. On an earnings yield basis, which speaks more to the equity side of local listed property, the South African listed property market currently looks marginally cheap, as the current earnings yield is above average. We refer to this as the “equity side of property”, as most of the commonly accepted valuation metrics for equities, are closely linked to underlying earnings.",False

I would like to emphasize the potential of growth on phase 2 alone:  Developing a decentralised open source bookings eco-system for renting hotel rooms, private properties and accommodation using blockchain technology making it more cost effective for the host and guest and incentivising the users. AirBNB currently has a market cap of approximately 30Bn USD. They charge a guest between 6-12% and a host 3% after a successful stay. They expect to generate a revenue of over 10Bn USD by 2020. In comparison, Zabercoin will charge only 4% for a guest and 2% for a host. Half (50%) of above revenue will go to the users by managing the properties on their decentralised Zabercoin account portal as an incentive. By incentivising users there will be no need to market and by using blockchain technology administration costs will be very low. If Zabercoin, at a third of the price and incentive model to users/agents as well, can obtain only 10% of the market share of AirBNB it will value Zabercoin at 3Bn USD on this basis alone. If Zabercoin can raise 30m USD it will result in a 100x return on your investment!  https://twitter.com/zabercoin/status/932940683081633792",False

If I understand your question correctly it must be noted that there is a difference between ROI and ROE. Simplified version - ROI is leveraged and ROE is not.  example:  If person X buys property for 1m USD cash his effective return will be lower than purchasing the same property with debt and financing via a bank.  If person Y for example bought a 1m USD house and only used 100k USD as deposit.  Person Y`s return would be higher as his return is calculated on 100k and not on 1m USD.  Theoretically not completely true but in principle.  There is a thin line between leveraged to achieve maximum growth and being over leveraged to risk loss of capital.  We at zabercoin would never use more than 50% debt/equity ratio assuring investors of a sound investment.  The principle is seldom better demonstrated with CFD`s(contract for difference shares).,False

As per our WP that is phase 2-4 of our project.  We have done immense research and the development of such apps is not complicated as you know.  Although the app is still in development we know it would be more cost effective by means of blockchain technology.  Beside Frikkie we also do  have a developer that has developed apps for Emirates and Nedbank(one of RSA`s largest banks).  Funding an idea is the catch 22.  Do you believe there is a demand for a token that give liquidity to real estate?  A means of payment/transfer that is a third of the cost of a 30Bn USD company?  etc.  Would you invested in Facebook if someone gave you the idea?  I will leave you with this thought:  Bitcoin is seldom referred to as “digital gold” – an industry of 8.2 trillion USD. Zabercoin aims to become a digital real estate token – an industry of more than a 200 trillion USD.,False

Purchasing lucrative property in especially emerging markets (EM) with great valuations. Although the focus of Zabercoin management will be to buy property within emerging markets, other profitable and lucrative projects outside EM will also be considered in its investment plan. Zabercoin makes use of all legal tax incentives like Article 13 Sex of the Income Tax Act of RSA to ensure sustainable and profitable rental income and maximum growth for the investor right from the start.  Our investment philosophy in brief:  At Zabercoin we strive to add value at each stage in the investment process which targets under-priced markets expected to maximise performance for a given level of risk. The management team adopts a top-down asset management approach. This means that a variety of economy-wide phenomena (macroeconomics) such as inflation, price levels, growth rates and unemployment of a country will be thoroughly evaluated before considering any prospective project. We strongly believe in a value investing style where the interests of the company and the investor always take preference in decision-making. Good asset selection, and active management are fundamental drivers of investment performance.  2.   Developing a decentralised blockchain based property ledger which will record all real estate contracts, registrations and linked bills. With this ledger, Zabercoin will be able to provide property owners and potential buyers an accurate and seamless record of valuations and property ownerships. In comparison with Windeed, a centralised South African service provider, Zabercoin will be unique in providing a decentralised global service by effectively making use of the blockchain.  3.   Developing a decentralised open source bookings eco-system for renting hotel rooms, private properties and accommodation using blockchain technology making it more cost effective for the host and guest and incentivising the users. AirBNB currently has a market cap of approximately 30Bn USD. They charge a guest between 6-12% and a host 3% after a successful stay. They expect to generate a revenue of over 10Bn USD by 2020.  In comparison, Zabercoin will charge only 4% for a guest and 2% for a host. Half (50%) of above revenue will go to the users by managing the properties on their decentralised Zabercoin account portal as an incentive. By incentivising users there will be no need to market and by using blockchain technology administration costs will be very low. If Zabercoin, at a third of the price and incentive model to users/agents as well, can obtain only 10% of the market share of AirBNB it will value Zabercoin at 3Bn USD on this basis alone. If Zabercoin can raise 30m USD it will result in a 100x return on investment!  4.   Using Zabercoins as payment method for transfer costs on properties.  Barnard Inc Lawyers already approved this as a payment method. South Africa alone has over 80,000 transfers per annum and we intend to incentivise users as well. Bitcoin is seldom referred to as “digital gold” – an industry of 8.2 trillion USD. Zabercoin aims to become a digital real estate token – an industry of more than a 200 trillion USD.

However, the soft cap was unfortunately not reached and this results in refunding all investors as per smart contract rules.  Zabercoin had a very solid and useful product offering and a very promising potential but in the same time it was also a learning curve for the team especially in terms of requirements and rules to follow that will ensure ultimate ICO success.  The intension of the team was to combine smart contract one into the second smart contract version in order to compensate the bounty hunters and pre-sale investors. After in-depth consultation and advice from various third parties it was confirmed that this was against the smart contract rules and therefore not possible to adhere to. Since honesty and integrity are key corner stones of Zabercoin, the CEO, in his personal capacity, vouch to compensate the hard working bounty hunters of the first ICO with his own tokens of the second ICO. That is a truly remarkable gesture that has never been done before.  After long but fruitful brainstorming and strategic planning sessions, the team is now more than ready to plan a new and more exciting ICO! The Zabercoin team had such good intensions and confidence in their product that they invested over 1m USD in their personal capacity in the first ICO. However, paying these enormous school fees, enabled the team to gain key and invaluable ICO knowledge and irreplaceable and vital relationships with various stakeholders in the blockchain community. The team is now even stronger and much more equipped to ensure that the second ICO will be nothing less than a great success!

Purchasing lucrative property in especially emerging markets (EM) with great valuations. Although the focus of Zabercoin management will be to buy property within emerging markets, other profitable and lucrative projects outside EM will also be considered in its investment plan. Zabercoin makes use of all legal tax incentives like Article 13 Sex of the Income Tax Act of RSA to ensure sustainable and profitable rental income and maximum growth for the investor right from the start.  Our investment philosophy in brief:   At Zabercoin we strive to add value at each stage in the investment process which targets under-priced markets expected to maximise performance for a given level of risk. The management team adopts a top-down asset management approach. This means that a variety of economy-wide phenomena (macroeconomics) such as inflation, price levels, growth rates and unemployment of a country will be thoroughly evaluated before considering any prospective project. We strongly believe in a value investing style where the interests of the company and the investor always take preference in decision-making. Good asset selection, and active management are fundamental drivers of investment performance.     2. Developing a decentralised blockchain based property ledger which will record all real estate contracts, registrations and linked bills. With this ledger, Zabercoin will be able to provide property owners and potential buyers an accurate and seamless record of valuations and property ownerships. In comparison with Windeed, a centralised South African service provider, Zabercoin will be unique in providing a decentralised global service by effectively making use of the blockchain.     3. Developing a decentralised open source bookings eco-system for renting hotel rooms, private properties and accommodation using blockchain technology making it more cost effective for the host and guest and incentivising the users. AirBNB currently has a market cap of approximately 30Bn USD. They charge a guest between 6-12% and a host 3% after a successful stay. They expect to generate a revenue of over 10Bn USD by 2020.  In comparison, Zabercoin will charge only 4% for a guest and 2% for a host. Half (50%) of above revenue will go to the users by managing the properties on their decentralised Zabercoin account portal as an incentive. By incentivising users there will be no need to market and by using blockchain technology administration costs will be very low. If Zabercoin, at a third of the price and incentive model to users/agents as well, can obtain only 10% of the market share of AirBNB it will value Zabercoin at 3Bn USD on this basis alone. If Zabercoin can raise 30m USD it will result in a 100x return on investment!     4. Using Zabercoins as payment method for transfer costs on properties.  Barnard Inc Lawyers already approved this as a payment method. South Africa alone has over 80,000 transfers per annum and we intend to incentivise users as well. Bitcoin is seldom referred to as ""digital gold"" – an industry of 8.2 trillion USD. Zabercoin aims to become a digital real estate token – an industry of more than a 200 trillion USD.
