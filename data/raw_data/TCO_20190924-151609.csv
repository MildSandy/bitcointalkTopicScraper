Remember, ThinkCoin (TCO) is a utility token for the TradeConnect network and NOT a crypto currency to be used in other ecosystems or to be speculated on, there would be NO benefit to listing the token at this time just for the sake of listing. Our main project and achievement from the early beginning has been to be able to develop TradeConnect. ThinkCoin was our way of funding it - if you read our Whitepaper you would already be aware of this.  There's no reason to spread FUD about our ICO being a scam or that this will take a year, I do get that you have less hope in this as we have delayed the project for some time, but we are now strongly focusing on deliver on our exchange network that we know will make a difference to the current market and contribute to more efficient, transparent, cost-efficient trading on the blockchain.

Untrue, they were also going to share 5% of their .2% trading fees let's break that down.  100,000,000 volume * .002 = $200,000 in fees if everyone shares the same fees (unlikely) * 5% = $10,000 divided amongst all of the sold out tokens....  10,000 / 500m, sorry that's incorrect they changed their total supply to make it look like it sold out.  10,000 / 21m = $.0004 per token held, which will decrease as bonus tokens get released.  So let's assume $ .00015 daily per token held, that's pretty good, then costs of sending that over drops it to $.0001 per day per token still pretty good except 100m volume must be achieved at a .2% trade fee rate.  In reality:  It'll look more like: 5m * .002 * .05  = 500 / 21m = .000002 USD per token held.",False

GMEX Fusion’s suite of capabilities will be combined with the TradeConnect multi-asset trading network, using ThinkCoin, the bespoke digital trading token unit of exchange.  GMEX Fusion will be integrated with TradeConnect’s mobile and web front ends. This will deliver options for both decentralised and centralised trading solutions, including CLOB and RFQ matching models, liquidity management, the ability to connect to third party crypto exchanges and a comprehensive set of market data options. The GMEX order execution API will be combined with TradeConnect’s matching model to create a sophisticated and agile trading solution representing the best of traditional centralised and blockchain-powered decentralised solutions.  A multi-asset blockchain-based exchange that will enable the trading of cryptocurrencies, equities, FX, commodities and more, TradeConnect will replace commissions with a levy on all trades that will be rebated to network participants in proportion to their participation.

Our partnership with GMEX builds upon last month’s announcement that we would be working decentralized cloud storage experts 0chain, and adds a major component to ThinkCoin and TradeConnect suite of solutions.  GMEX’s Fusion platform combines GMEX’s traditional centralised trading systems, which are currently live in multiple exchanges and post-trade venues, with the latest blockchain technology offering the best of both worlds for exchanges, clearing-houses and other institutions.  GMEX Fusion’s suite of capabilities will be combined with the TradeConnect multi-asset trading network, using ThinkCoin, the bespoke digital trading token unit of exchange.  GMEX Fusion will be integrated with TradeConnect’s mobile and web front ends. This will deliver options for both decentralised and centralised trading solutions, including CLOB and RFQ matching models, liquidity management, the ability to connect to third party crypto exchanges and a comprehensive set of market data options. The GMEX order execution API will be combined with TradeConnect’s matching model to create a sophisticated and agile trading solution representing the best of traditional centralised and blockchain-powered decentralised solutions.  A multi-asset blockchain-based exchange that will enable the trading of cryptocurrencies, equities, FX, commodities and more, TradeConnect will replace commissions with a levy on all trades that will be rebated to network participants in proportion to their participation. Traders will be connected with each other by an AI-powered scoring and matching model that will ensure the best trading conditions.  GMEX’s solution will be melded with the deep institutional experience and extensive IP of ThinkCoin’s platform and whitepaper. This combination will significantly enhance liquidity within the trading network’s ecosystem, enabling the network to achieve scale far faster than any other blockchain trading solution: factors that will together encourage uptake at a rate never before seen.  Here’s a word from our CEO and CO-founder, Nauman Anees:  “All of us at ThinkCoin are enormously excited to begin our collaboration with GMEX. The company’s culture of innovation and solution-oriented thinking is hugely impressive, and we look forward to together exploring the full potential of on and off-chain solutions to realise the promise of blockchain technology.”",False

To put it in really simple terms, having the entire trading platform on the blockchain isn't feasible with where Ethereum is currently at. In the future it may be possible though. Think of it like this, every trade needs two separate smart contracts, one for the offer, and one for the person matching (with both needing to be mined on the Ethereum network). Scaled up to tens of thousands of contracts, it's too much load.  The hybrid approach solves this. All finalized trades are recorded to the blockchain, giving the security and immutability. Before trades are finalized, the system uses an offline blockchain, which can handle almost limitless trades.  By combining off and onchain we can get the best out of both systems, overcoming the scalibility limitations of Ethereum currently. With plasma that will likely change, and we may be able to move our entire platform on to the live Ethereum network.  We hope this helps! Any questions, please feel free to ask!",False
