Given the number of ICOs popping up day in, day out, why should you invest in our ICO? This is what you are wondering right?  Reason 1: n'cloud.swiss AG is not a start-up – it's a fully functional business operation with real customers, revenues, profits and a successful track record. In other words, 17 years of IT experience and 9 years in cloud computing as one of Europe’s cloud pioneers with our own cloud platform since 2009. Reason 2: Buy NCU tokens now and benefit from many advantages. As a customer, NCU tokens enable you to use them for discounted purchase at n'cloud.swiss AG. Reason 3: Last but not least, exchange the NCU tokens into NCS tokens later this year and sell them on selected exchanges or exchange the NCU tokens into NCS tokens and benefit from long-term perspectives such as profit sharing or increasing token price.  There are many other reasons but I would say those three are the ones that speak for themselves. Do not hesitate to get in touch if you have further questions.

Buyers of NCU tokens are eligible to exchange their NCU tokens into NCS security tokens, once this programme is in place.

The initiator of n’cloud.swiss AG - Netkom IT Services GmbH - is a Swiss based IT & cloud provider with a proven track record of 17 years of successful operations in various countries. Founded in 2001, the company has gone through several transformation processes itself or with its customers. In the early 2000’s the company operated mainly in the field of IT-Strategy and Technology consulting for well-known large national and international companies. As the team was growing more classic IT- and virtualization projects were realized for SME’s. In 2009 the decision was taken to launch n’cloud – one of Europe’s first IaaS/SaaS cloud platforms – into the marketplace. With the well established n’cloud products, Netkom became one of the cloud pioneers in Europe. n’cloud.swiss is therefore already a successful cloud platform running in one of the world’s most secure data centers in Switzerland with existing customers, transactions and success stories in Switzerland, Germany, India, Russia, Pakistan and Ukraine.  https://i.imgur.com/n6Cs2bIh.png  Vision  The Vision of n’cloud.swiss is to become the SWISS alternative to the major five cloud providers.  https://i.imgur.com/F8dmnrml.png  Mission  The n’cloud.swiss ICO with its NCU token has been launched to successfully expand and roll-out the existing business operations into 60 additional countries around the world.  https://i.imgur.com/DkDW9oS.png  The cloud market revenue doubles in the next 3 years up to 162 billion USD  The target for n’cloud.swiss is to grab a substantial market share in the global cloud market for IaaS, PaaS, SaaS services in the next 5 years. The revenues in this market double in the next 3 years from 89 billion USD in 2017 to 162 billion USD in 2020.  https://i.imgur.com/tjG2t8Rl.png  The cloud competition in the world – USA versus the rest of the World  Today more than 65% of the cloud computing market is occupied by a few leading giant providers. The Top 4 major cloud platforms are originating from the US, while No. 5 - Alibaba Cloud - comes from China - the remaining 35% market share is in the hands of thousands of cloud providers scattered around the world.  https://i.imgur.com/OagblX1l.png  The product offer – Make your own Public, Private or Hybrid cloud  n’cloud.swiss heralds a new era in cloud computing and is capable to address and serve all cloud deployment requirements such as private, public, hybrid or community cloud. It also contains all cloud service models such as Infrastructure-, Platform- or Software-as-a-Service models with the same product.    n’cloud.swiss ICO – THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY OF SUPPORTING A PROVEN BUSINESS CASE TO GROW GLOBAL AND BECOME A REAL CLOUD ALTERNATIVE TO THE MAJOR WELL ESTABLISHED CLOUD PROVIDERS IN THE WORLD  A total of 600 Mio. tokens are released and called NCU.  https://i.imgur.com/xacAiD5h.jpg  The presale of NCU tokens will begin on April 14th, 2018 at 09:00 (CET) and end on April 29th, 2018 at 21:00 (CET). Total number of NCU tokens in the pre-ICO phase is 32 Mio. NCU tokens which equals 2 Mio. NCU tokens per day. The price of 1 NCU token during the pre-ICO is starting at CHF 0.10. The final price in the pre-ICO will be CHF 0.25. Due to fees and exchange rates, the minimum amount to purchase NCU tokens is CHF 50 per token-buy-transaction. Pre-ICO can be completed ahead of schedule in case of attracting the necessary amount of investments before the end of the pre-ICO period.  NCU tokens are created on the Ethereum blockchain-platform under the ERC20 token standard. There is no reissue of tokens after the financing is completed. Tokens are accepted as a payment for n’cloud.swiss services. Tokens being used as a payment instrument will expire. All undigested and undistributed tokens will be distributed/invested in country and technology partnerships or as an incentive for new or existing staff members.  https://i.imgur.com/dZVhw0Gh.png  Distribution of NCU tokens and benefits for investors  NCU utility tokens will be accepted as a payment instrument earliest 6 months after the ICO is terminated.  - NCU tokens are accepted as a payment instrument for all n'cloud.swiss services and products - For payments by NCU tokens, an additional 5% discount is granted - Payment balances of up to 25% per invoice can be paid by NCU tokens  After completion of the last ICO stage at CHF 1.00, all NCU tokens will be valued at a price of CHF 1.50 per token. The earlier a token has been bought during the whole ICO the more purchasing power a NCU token displays.  https://i.imgur.com/e0p58wHh.png  Bounty campaigns  We would like to reward users who will buy in and support the n’cloud.swiss ICO campaign before and during the ICO stages. For this we’ve reserved 167 Mio. NCU tokens which equals almost 30% of the total number of tokens in play. The bounty campaign is active during the pre-ICO, scheduled from April 14th to April 29th 2018 and the main ICO, which will be started on April 30th 2018 to July 8th, 2018.  The bounty categories are as follows and will be presented in detail in a separate post dedicated to our bounty campaigns:  https://i.imgur.com/cPKsEUGh.png  Compliance with all applicable laws and regulations of Switzerland  We're commited to compliance with all applicable laws and regulations of Switzerland, therefore all technical market standards (e.g Blockchain) as well as any legal or regulatory guidelines by Swiss law will be regarded. Due to new guidelines by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority regarding ICO activities from February 2018, n'cloud.swiss has decided to launch two ICO rounds.  1. Launch of the NCU token as a pure utility token and therefore run the campaign as a pre-financing ICO with excellent incentives, purchasing advantages for n'cloud.swiss and all its products and services, as well as an increasing utility value of the NCU token.  2. Launch of the NCS token as a security token which demands for specific tightened legal requirements and obligations. This process shall be prepared during the NCU ICO and its start shall be in Q3/2018 with a higher pre-ICO starting price than the last stage of the NCU ICO. The NCS token shall grant even further advantages and shall be listed on digital stock exchanges.  A new ICO with a security token called NCS will start in Q3/2018. NCU token buyers will then be eligible to exchange their NCU tokens into NCS tokens and benefit from further advantages. Buyers of NCU tokens are eligible to exchange their NCU tokens into NCS security tokens, once this programme is in place. The NCS token will be launched to higher purchasing prices, so this gives also further incentives to NCU token buyers.  Distribution of collected funds  The amount of attracted investments during the pre-ICO is CHF 5.600.000 and the maximum amount of attracted investments during the ICO is: CHF 65.370.000.  https://i.imgur.com/02zBcZqh.png  Roadmap https://i.imgur.com/RsMLjUNh.png  Our Team  Our team consists of highly skilled professionals from the fields of Cloud Architecture, Development, Infrastructure, Security up to specialists being at home in the Technology and Service Environments such as Docker/Kubernetes, Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data or Analytics.  n’cloud.swiss AG - BOARD OF DIRECTORS https://i.imgur.com/3O0DgCul.png | https://i.imgur.com/hIPdK0Il.png | https://i.imgur.com/zxiWMpVl.png  n’cloud.swiss AG - TEAMLEADERS https://i.imgur.com/DrP558Xl.png  READ THE WHITEPAPER  https://i.imgur.com/tpmoJJZh.png  Website | Bounty Program | LinkedIn | Twitter | Facebook | Xing | Telegram Channel | Telegram Group",False
