In the second half of 2019, 'TouchCon', a cryptocurrency platform, will launch a ‘TouchCon QR’ beta service, an Ad scan random reward app based on Blockchain technology.    ‘TouchCon QR' Beta service, which runs from August to November, will concentrate on making 'TouchCon' to become a real bridge between O2O Advertisement and QR Code system.   The TouchCon is a platform for randomly rewarding the cryptocurrency by acquiring and scanning the Smart QR code (SQC) used in the O2O advertisement. The TouchCon will be rewarded directly to the e-wallet as it is stored in the Blockchain not as a form of a traditional points. The rewarded TouchCon can be used to buy goods, remit money, and exchange into cash directly on the app. In short, it is aimed at the platform to implement One-Stop service for its users.    TouchCon is scheduled to be released as an official app ""Touch Random Scan"" next year after successfully completing Beta service in the second half of this year. In the TouchCon Random Scan, a Big data is created in which individual information and scan information are matched. In addition, service development supporting Airdrop of other cryptocurrencies is also performed.     Moreover, TouchCon has been in the final process of selecting for a total number of about  60 online and offline advertisers wanting to participate in the platform. Initially, small-sized Indonesian companies  including Korea and Japan, are expected to participate. However, this year, TouchCon will be distributed free of charge through the Airdrop so that competition among companies is expected to be very intense.    Junbeom Lee, director of the TouchCon foundation, said, ""TouchCon has a tremendous power that can fundamentally change the essence of a cryptocurrency ecosystem. In a sharing economy platform that will be introduced in 2020, the TouchCon will be evolved into the first real cryptocurrency that can be used in the real world."" TouchCon will be used in a new concept of sharing economy app, and this will realize the dreams that cryptocurrency should also be valuable in the real world.""    Furthermore, TouchCon has been developing the first O2O Ad Scan Random Platform through three domestic and overseas developers. In December last year, TouchCon has developed a total of 840 million coins. Of the 840 million in total, 62.46%(524 million) were incinerated, and the remaining 6%(54 million) of the coins paid to foundations and developers were locked up for two years to increase the transparency and credibility o  TouchCon projects.",False

Thank you for your interest. You can check the 'TouchCon WhitePaper 2.0' from the [WhitePaper] menu.

The platform called 'TouchCon QR' launched by TouchCon will reward the TouchCon randomly by scanning the SQC used in the advertisement. A variety of online and offline stores will utilize SQC to gain strong sales and brand promotions.  SQC is a QR code that is randomly encoded with the value of the TouchCon and is designed to be rewarded at random through QR Code scanning. Once it is scanned, the QR code cannot be reused. Advertisers subscribed to the TAA can purchase and use SQCs annually. TouchCon will provide all services such as creation, payment, remittance and selling of TouchCon as a one-stop service through 'TouchCon QR' application to be launched in second quarter, 2019.  [Coin feature]  1. TAA (TouchCon Advertiser Alliance) is an abbreviation for 'TouchCon Advertiser Alliance' and is an alliance of companies all over the world which will use SQC as a means of advertising and promoting. They can utilize SQC for their products and services, as well as receive Big Data services on customer consumption trends to be analyzed by TouchCon AI. SQC will be allocated to TAA advertisers through strict screening process. If two or more companies apply for the same industry, only one company will be selected through the voting. The amounts of TouchCon to be issued annually are limited to 10 million TOCs and will be operational for 10 years starting from 2019.  2. The Ad Marketing Reward Program (AMRP) is a powerful ecosystem rewards program that feeds SQC proceeds sold to TAA advertisers back to the TouchCon community. AMRP distributes the total proceeds divided into four areas. Each year, the Exchange purchases TouchCon and distributes them to each holder wallet. This will increase the value of the TouchCon.  3. TJS (TouchCon Juror System) stands for the ‘TouchCon Juror System’ which is a very powerful system for decentralization and has a function to supervise TouchCon ecosystem. A total of 23 jurors will be elected by community election, and anyone having a minimum of 100,000 TOCs will be eligible to join. The term of the juror is two years and once elected as a juror, the person cannot be reelected. It is deeply involved in the TouchCon ecosystem as a whole, and also acts as a representative Node when the PoW agreement algorithm is switched to DPoS in the future. This system is based on the philosophical ideas of TouchCon for decentralization. They are entitled to use 3% of the SQC amount every year as their own funds.  4. TouchCon was distributed to ICO by 22.997% of the maximum issuing amount, 15.984% to foundation and developers, and 2.664% to global business. In addition, 31.714% will be generated by Ad Scan Reward for 10 years and 26.640% will be mined for about 30 years through the PoW agreement algorithm. Fifteen percent (15.984%) of the TouchCon for Foundation and the developers are locked up for two years and are used for TouchCon ecosystem in the future. Therefore, the circulation of TouchCon in the market will be around 80 million.  5. The TouchCon is a very strong business model for cryptocurrency. SQC, which is provided by 'TouchCon QR' platform, is a system that sells to online and offline advertisers and then returns sales proceeds back to the TouchCon Nodes. In particular, TouchCon platform has a business model(BM) that encourages the participation of the general public voluntarily by creating a system called Ad Scan Reward (Korean Patent Registration Application 2018-04) rather than simple reward. This will act as a catalyst to activate the ecosystem by acting as a bridge connecting the TouchCon to the real world.   [Field of application]   **Keyword: Creation of O2O advertisement media Smart QR Code, scalability of various Mining and Airdrop supporting platform, SQC & User DB Matching Big Data Service  O2O Advertising Marketing Smart QR Code: O2O advertisers can use SQC, which is made by encoding the TouchCon into the Smart QR code, for innovative products and services. This is new advertising marketing tool that encodes a cryptocurrency rewarding method to existing QR code, and it has evolved into a new rewarding method that goes beyond conventional mileage or points or cash back reward that does not change the essence value.  Mining through the TouchCon platform and expansion of the Airdrop: While the initial platform supports the TouchCon cryptocurrency, in the second round of development, comprehensive Mining of other altcoins and Airdrops can be extended to perform in O2O environment. This allows all cryptocurrencies to be provided with transparency, reliability, and a motif that can be achieved through decentralization.  SQC & User DB Matching Big Data: As users who are seeking random reward through the TouchCon platform are increasing, it is possible to acquire a DB that can grasp their consumption trend. By matching SQC information with User data and collecting and extracting it on the basis of Blockchain, various Big Data analysis becomes possible. The third round of development will not only expand the cryptocurrency ecosystem, but also act as a catalyst to fuse the cryptocurrency with the real world.   [Developer Information]   1.
