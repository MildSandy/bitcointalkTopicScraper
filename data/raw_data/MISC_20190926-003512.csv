The idea:  The innovative blockchain technology will ensure full transparency of the voting process creating a completely unbiased ecosystem for all the parties involved - investors, voters, and participants. Neither crafty admins nor advanced users will be able to spin the votes. The prejudiced jury members will be hog-tied as well.  With MISSCOIN’s philosophy, justice will finally prevail.  Coin: The coin is an ERC-20 token. Total supply:   1,000,000,000 MISC  ICO - GIVES EQUAL OPPORTUNITY  To ensure inclusivity, MISC Tokens have no pre-determined price; rather price is set by market demand. This mining imitation without giving potential unfair advantages to large purchasers.  The MISC Token distribution takes place over 150 days - 5 mln. tokens each day, which is expected to provide time for the community to familiarize themselves with the project, as well as participate in the distribution.  THE BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT.   Misscoin is the innovative project in beauty industry! Misscoin contest will compete with the world's current renowned beauty contests. The most important difference of our contest is going to be the full transparency of all its stages due to its full implementation on blockchain. The information on all the votes will always be publicly available. Each person interested will be able to compare the number of votes given to a participant with the number of tokens at her wallet's address. We have made every possible effort to attract a professional team of experts who have already worked in the sphere to organize and develop the contest. The organizers of our project have a vast experience in carrying out extensive events and the development of large scale IT projects. The contest we are creating is not only going to be completely trasparent but will also be organized according to all the international standards. Our main objective - is to make people change their attitude to the transparency of that how beauty contests are held and organized. We are very appreciative of our investors and will do our best not only to live up to their expectations but to multiply surpass them.    The Platform   The platform is built on the basis of a mobile application development for all major types of mobile devices, and on a web interface as well. This will make it possible to use the best experience of the classical model and add modern blockchain and smart contract technologies. Contest's platform will consist of several modules that are depicted in the chart. Interface module will consist of signing up via popular social networks, participant's personal cabinet, token wallet, participant viewing interface, and voting ( there will be various filters available such as sort by location, age and daily rating of participants). We also mean to introduce a chat to allow for interactive communication. Module of distributed data storage on blockchain will consist of a well-defined mechanism for decentralized votes storage and user data by means of IPFS technology (Distributed File System). Analytics and statistics module will be the best proof of the contest's transparency as it will reflect any token movements in the system All the modules will be opensource and will be uploaded to GitHub.
