SAVE team offers a buy-back system for cryptocurrency investors.  This is a niche service that brings peace of mind to skeptic investors and ""HODL-ers"".  What makes SAVE attractive is that the IOU type policy can be redeemed if the secured investment reaches a certain level that would render it bankrupt. In such situation, the investor gives us their failed investment and receive FIAT compensation. During the policy period the investor is allowed to manage their cryptocurrency as they wish i.e. invest it further, hold it for a period of time, sell'n'buy and so on.  The SAVE team is committed to the idea and trust that it will allow new time comers to the crypto market to invest and take advantage of the brave new world of blockchain finances.

Firstly, the service is aimed at attracting investors that are skeptical about the market. Our research shows that 86% of the people interviewed would be willing to invest in crypto if they could feel at least a bit more safe. That is where our coin comes in. We have received good feedback so far. Our service will also help existing investors who wish to ""HODL"" for a longer period of time. Furthermore, in order to create a more attractive offer, every SAVE portfolio come with a few SAVE tokens that are unusable for the period of the policy. This way, an investor would benefit from the increasing price of the SAVE token sparked by scarcity on the market (caused by locking the tokens in policies).  Secondly, we are working on better, more realistic offers based on the risk profiles of the portfolios. these changes will appear in our whitepaper soon as well.  We are committed to bringing value to the Blockchain economy and any feedback, such as yours will help us evolve our offering. While we are still in ICO period, we are focusing on the system working well, and during the period between the end of the ICO and the listing on exchanges, we will develop our offerings even further.  Regards,  SAVE Team",False
