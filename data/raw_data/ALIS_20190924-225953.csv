To elaborate a bit more on this, the team has indeed announced the platform is now officially in Open Beta. There is no full length official article in English about what this entails, so here is a brief explanation from me: In the open beta period, a total of 12 new features will be added to the platform in order to expand the test scope. The underlying motive for these functions are to make the platform more open to everyone, instead of catering to the community that has been around since the ICO and consists of crypto/blockchain enthusiasts (this last part is an assumption made by me personally).  Quote 1. Design overhaul (Done) 2. No more category restrictions (Done) 3. A token bonus system based on amount of tokens held in the platform's wallet 4. Alis platform wallet (ability to send and receive from and to the platform) 5. Text editor update 6. Account statistics (how many tokens you earned and by what means and which article, etc.) 7. Tutorial for new users (upon first login a tour of the platform) 8. Article ranking based on amount of tips received (as an addition to the other filters already existing) 9. OAuth for developers 10. Update of the Login/Register process 11. Ability to create articles that need to be payed for in order to read 12. Intricate referral program   Quote from: JSRAW on January 11, 2019, 09:00:16 AM ...

Not only the producers, but also curators of content get rewarder. However, both ALIS and Steem have a different objective. ALIS is focused on providing a platform where trustworthy people and articles are filtered from the junk, which yields a completely different platform with completely different content.  Edit: i just read this on steem. https://steemit.com/steemit/@yallapapi/why-steemit-is-a-giant-circle-jerk-and-how-to-make-it-work-in-your-favor  I can write a whole lot more about why ALIS is different from steem and why it has way more potential to be mass adopted in Japan than Steem by the English speaking internet.

Tokens are not a share of the company ALIS so it's not comparable with the shareholder principle of participation.  If a cryptocurrency (minable coin) would have a premine of close to 50% people would say it's worhtless.  And with tokens distribution it's the same, I disagree that some people pretend it's normal.  I'm experiencing this with a shitload of tokens. The creatorsshare is way too big after ICO with a majority of the tokens.  And that is not a good prospect.  I do believe in the company ALIS, let's be straight about that.  They seem reliable and I get the idea that they are putting the funding in the company.  With a stunning end product as result.

That's a relevant comparison.  Wheter you agree with the % they hold or not, they have been open and clear about it from the start. So it's not really fair to complain about this afterwards. You knew what you bought in to. And I wouldn't worry to much. I just saw their share is not part of the circulating supply. So they can't sell anytime soon, it's contractual limmited. It happens a lot. Check NEO, EOS, Qtum, OMG, everywhere you see total supply instead of max supply next to circulating supply at coinmarketcap.com. All successfull coins.

THE IMAGES ARE VARIOUS INFOGRAPHICS FOR ALIS   Introducing ALIS - Japan's First Social Media Platform Using Blockchain Technology  Website | Twitter | Slack | Whitepaper | FAQ  ICO 9/1 - 9/29 - NOW COMPLETE!  FIRST WEEK: 1 ETH = 2900 ALIS - Complete! SECOND WEEK: 1 ETH = 2600 ALIS - Complete! THIRD WEEK: 1 ETH = 2300 ALIS - Complete! FINAL WEEK: 1 ETH = 2000 ALIS - Complete!  THE ICO IS COMPLETE! THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO PARTICIPATED!  ALIS is Japan's first social media platform that directly incentivizes content curation and content deployment while utilizing trust, both in articles and individuals. ALIS incentivizes this behavior (detailed in the Whitepaper linked below) in an easy-to-understand way.  Japan has a highly interconnected culture that is difficult to commercially penetrate. Japan has seen a 130% market growth for social media since 2014, and is also home to the highest volume of Bitcoin transactions in the world, making it an ideal market for a social network like ALIS. Japan is also a unique market, and requires specific solutions to its social media needs. ALIS aims to address those needs.    While the ALIS team was inspired by some elements of STEEM - ALIS is not a clone and is fundamentally different. These are detailed in two Medium posts. Part 1 and Part 2  http://imgur.com/a/4UbmM  ALIS rewards both the poster and the first few people to notice and evaluate the content, this will help create a situation where the best iteration of a given piece of content rises to surface, and raises the user who posted it's User Reliability Score, while also rewarding those first few to discover the content and who help raise its visibility.  http://imgur.com/a/RbNi7  To help mitigate the possibilities for brigading as well as astro-turf campaigns, ALIS will value interactions in part by how long the interacting parties have individually held ALIS tokens  http://imgur.com/a/hnH6l  ALIS seeks to utilize the best of social networking - sharing content across diverse groups of people, rewarding interactions with more people above multiple interactions with the same person.  http://imgur.com/a/DO53I  ADDITIONAL IMAGE SHOWING THE ALIS TOKEN BUSINESS MODEL >>>>http://imgur.com/a/098YP<<<<   YouTube Video of the three founders briefly discussing their vision for ALIS LINK   ALIS has a three step plan for growth of the platform in Japan  Establishing market share in niche areas (cryptocurrency, blockchain, little known anime and manga, etc)   Expand to areas dominated in Japan by word-of-mouth and other reputation websites (restaurants, travel, diet, life events such as school admission, marriage, and purchase of homes)   Based on accumulated trust and a growing user base, begin expanding out into more diverse markets. Deploy new services targeted at those markets and continuing to leverage ALIS' unique system of encouraging authenticity and accuracy.      WEEK 1: 1 ETH =2900 ALIS - Complete!

Some of the differences between ALIS and Steemit include: ALIS' 1 currency vs. Steemit's 3, ALIS' reward structure values the first people to like/share a post that ends up being very popular much moreso than Steemit's. The ALIS token is more effective on our network the longer the user has held it (to help prevent people from loading up on ALIS tokens to do astro-turf marketing). On ALIS one's overall activity contributes to creating a User Reliability Score that other users can look to and see who is regularly posting interesting, reliable, accurate and authentic content. ALIS also has a system that rewards interactions with multiple users over repeated interactions with the same user, to also help prevent gaming the system on the one hand, and to help encourage more diverse interactions on the network on the other hand.     Social media networks that aren't a good cultural fit for Japan tend to not work out. Currently, Japan has the highest saturation of social media users (over 90%) in the first world, but less than 30% of them use Facebook, because Facebook's model doesn't properly fit the Japanese culture. Most Japanese currently use Twitter (~70%), because 140 characters goes much farther with the Japanese language. Simply adding Japanese language support doesn't guarantee that a product will be successful in the Japanese market.  Japan has a very specific culture and very specific desires when it comes to things like social media, advertising, marketing, authenticity and accuracy. Our opinion is that ALIS addresses those concerns directly, effectively, and in a way that will be easy-to-understand and use for the average Japanese consumer, in no small part because the team is Japanese, experienced in creating social media products for the Japanese market, and familiar with effective ways to draw in the Japanese user.

The ALIS tokens will be listed on Bittrex, Kraken, and JP Exchange initially (the team is currently communicating with those exchanges so that it can be listed shortly after the ICO completes) - so they should be easy to trade whether an investor is in North America, Europe, or Asia.

That's probably because it's a Japanese project so the initial interest has heavily leaned towards the East Asia region.    But in just a few short weeks their Slack has grown from less than 300 people to over 1,000 - and the team has meaningfully engaged with Japanese and regional media outlets to promote their upcoming ICO. If you can read Japanese their twitter handle - @ALIS_media has linked many of the recent articles/interviews.    Forum posts, like the one here or at cryptocurrency talk, or elsewhere, have been effective in their own way - but when a team's native language is not English, there is necessarily going to be some initial sluggishness in getting the message out beyond their native lingual sphere.
