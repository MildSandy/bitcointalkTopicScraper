As a measure confirming our open intentions and desires to create a decentralized storage of funds for all participants of the closed round there are special conditions for the purchase of tokens.  We advocate a “distributed system” of storage, available resources and funds that will be collected through ICO. Therefore, we propose to return the listed ETH back to the community member’s wallet.    The smart contract for this round provides for a reserve in proportion to the amount of ETH transferred by you, according to the AIOT course set for the ICO time for the address of the purse from which the transfer was made and the automatic return of the amount ETH at the end of the ICO.  The balance of purchased AIOT will be frozen, and the amount of ETH will be transferred to storage. The holder can be any member of the community on the balance, which will be at least 750 000 AIOT.  In this case, the holder is responsible for the safety and security of the funds transferred by the community. As far as financial resources are used, the community, represented by the community council, has the right to request transfer of funds for safekeeping to another participant, or reassigned to implement the plans and tasks of the community.  The holder is entitled, on his own initiative, to defreeze the AIOT at any time after ICO. Apply for a return of funds held in storage. After that, implement AIOT through an internal platform exchanger, which is fully operational, at the time of writing this memorandum.",False
