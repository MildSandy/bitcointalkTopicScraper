Finally, you can double your current token holding by participating in our bounty which we are putting finishing touch to.

When can we start collecting SUP bounties? We are currently working on SUP bounties claim page and will soon release update on it to the community when we are done alongside other announcements.  2. When do we receive actual SUP tokens? When we have release one of our dApps and that will be around march.  3. Is the expected exchange listing date Feb 28 2018 still in order? We are working towards it. We hope to meet our roadmap targets.  4. When is the expected release date of your Dapps and Pokereum? Currently, we are working on the feedbacks gotten so far from the pokereum demo-release review (demo.pokereum.io) and also working on some other integrations like Whisper(peer-to-peer communication over the blockchain), shadow poker engine(Mental poker solution). Our torrent media dapp will soon be demo-release too as the dev teams for the dapp are also working on it alongside the whitepaper release for public view. Reason for keeping our other dapp dark is to avoid a repeat of what happened during the early stage of our Pokereum development (plagiarism and idea-theft).  The communication from SuperDAO team is really scarce. The info from the devs comes once a month at best. We working on this and finalizing with a PR firm to help out. Announcement to be made soon. Partnerships, Site redevelopment and security, sales of remaining promissory tokens, DAO smart-contract still going on behind the scene to help us meet our targets so efforts are geared towards marketing mostly.",False

I like all that you are saying and find it promising, I acknowledge the fact that this is lot of work and time spent on communicating is not directly profitable as to the project itself. I also apologize for the terms I have used in 2 of my messages. The goal was to point out that communication is paramount, and until now you guys have not been really good at it (which does not mean you are incompetent on the programing part for sure) Though marketing and communication will in the end still be quite important, and if you guys are not enought for that well that's where the bounties and the community comes handy. I would personnaly play the game and try to promote in a reasonable manner this project as long as I have the ammos for it (not tokens but real dev infos, upgrades and roadmap checks) I looked for the bounty program and still quite don't understand what it is used for. I never used metamask so I will begin by this, but it might be cool to give some more precise informations. I guess the ""claim page"" will be what I am asking. Anyway quite surprised to have had such a complete answer from you, and hoping it will continue this way. The more we communicate here the more infos for everybody to read and have access to. good luck to you all",False

No marketing campaign nor media covers, no communication whatsoever for potential investors, delayed once, maybe a second time and anyhow they won't receive much ethers with such way of handling an ICO, very unprofessionnal, I am thinking this could just be a SCAM. I invested quite some ethers in January, enough to know that it will be taken to court and investigated if the team does not begin to show some moves, always traces to roll back and find the real identities and nowadays scammers should know they can get prosecuted for such acts. I am not saying that they are (yet) but this is all way too shaddy.  Or and it is maybe not reassuring neither, they just don't have a clue of what they are doing. The day I can pull out of this project I surely will do it in no time, if I have the chance to, even at loss which is almost inevitable considering ether's sharp raise.  I ADVISE ALL POTENTIAL INVESTORS NOT TO ENGAGE ANY MONEY IN THIS PROJECT AS LONG AS LIGHT HAS NOT BEEN MADE. It would be very unreasonnable and reckless. A little math just for the fun, number of coins, 100 000 000, price in dollar per coin is 16 now, which would make a 1.6 billion $ marketcap (Litecoin's marketcap is that amount in comparision) , just like that, with nothing solid, just a beta for one poker game... this is clearly fucked up. If those guys are not scammers then we have the most dumb team of the year award to give out. Go look at DAO Casino, they are real ( I met them) serious, motivated, media coverage, well advised, Vitalik and other eth developpers did look it up and they changed a lot after those advices.

Few points that I find important as to lack of communication and management: First, An ICO date must be respected or announced delayed quite some time before, not the case here (though I admit you finally changed dates on ICO sites but very lately, after the supposed start, and the start is now 3 months after, knowing this I would have invested later and less), people who invest don't necessarily want their funds to be blocked advitam eternam specially with the volatility which will lead to 2nd point. Many ICO's nowaday had the logic to modify their ICO prices when big moves like Ether had past few months, or pegged the price to dollar which seems lot more fair in comparison to a questionnable argument    I invested at a certain price expecting an ICO at  a given date after, and yes still undervalued, but 4 times less than originally, and the point of being early bird is to benefit from a potential gain. But I understand your point about early backers and your non responsability as to volatility, but it does change the deal even for future investors, and that may result in a potential fear of an over valued project and have your team gather less funds than anticipated.  (posts like mine don't really help, I totally agree, but transparency seems essential to me, a direct message has lot less consideration. No incentive as to bounty campaigns and visibility in the crypto environnement which will not help building a momentum even if july seems now pretty far. Not answering a bounty translation, or just creating a bounty program so people can know and get prepared, or begin part of the work if it is considered which is not an obligation from you, but clarity is important.  To all the newcomers, I am not saying this prject is a scam, just that it had some lacks and I pointed them out hoping it might change something, this is all. I wish this project has success.  And by the way everybody http://demo.pokereum.io/ the demo is coming out in 1 day now, and this is a great opportunity to test the client and see that this project is serious, concrete and hopefully of quality. Since this is a first iteration, changes or modifications and improvements will happen, and maybe the team wants some return from the people who have tested it. That's where community is important.

As you know we obviously don't control the volatility and the value difference is is non consequential since our current valuation is an initial market comparison minimum.

You can Imagine the demand for a token with multiple revenue streams, and with just pokereum itself looking to disrupt the gaming industry of more than $30 billion/yr in revenues  just by owning SUP?  So point is, SUP is not over valued regardless of the ether price rise. It is undervalued and considering our additional, market ready dapp to be released shortly after the pokereum demo.

Superdao enables  collaboration of  innovators and communities into strong thriving  forces. Superdao  is a collection of various entities, individuals and  autonomous agents  cooperating virtually without any geographical  limitations to achieve a common goal and enabled by open source, democratic software, built on  decentralized Ethereum blockchain. For   this specific implementation the goal is to create decentralized  disruptive dapp products and services alternatives, targeted at high value  industries while providing the highest value possible to end users of  such services.

As such, both projects have undergone considerable platform and branding changes. Moreover, SuperDAO’s core team has had ample time to iteratively innovate over DAO issues such as; tyranny of the majority, voting quorum or voter apathy issues and DAO product development efficiency risks. Some of the viable solutions invented by superDAO to solve the described problems are; dynamic voting, Internal core reputational voting, structured core contributions and bounty-impact based, mission aligned, arbitrary contributions.    Branding and Platform changes : Platform :: NXT - > DAO (Etc) / Dapps (Etc /Eth  Rootstock) Dapp Branding :: Nxtpoker -> Pokereum Oganization Evolution :: NxtPoker DAO -> Pokereum DAO --> SuperDAO   Governance mechanism: The SuperDAO multi-tiered organization onion model  provides for a cryptographic tokens layer and an internal  reputation-based layer called ""Merits"". The cryptographic tokens  sovereignly governs all affairs, while internal Merits provide for  efficient management and development. At the center of the layers is the  consititutionalDNA which carries the mission, vision and contractual  values of the Decentralized Autonomous Organization providing a system  of checks and balances wrapped up in a simple modular hub contract  called consensusX.   State Bootstrapping  the Superdao is a delicate  process necessary to gradually bring the DAO  from conception to full crowd governance. SuperDAO utilizes three defined smart contract  enforced states to indicate its stage of development evolution and governance modes:  isBootStrapped: isFunded : isLive : Learn More here :  http://www.superdao.io/#Superdao-nav      =======================================  DAPP PRODUCTS  =======================================    Pokereum    Pokereum Demo 1 : Pokereum Decentralized Poker Exquisite GUI User Experience Demo      Pokereum Demo 2 : P2P Multi-Party Computation RTC, Server-less Gameplay (under the hood)    Pokereum Decentralized Provably fair Poker is the first Superdao Dapp. It Provides a polished user experience alongside a provably fair solution to the mental poker problem using smart contracts as a component to a complex, multi-faceted solution. The research and draft papers were first made available before the advent of the Ethereum platform. While some teams are attempting to solve similar issues using cryptographic primitives and outdated techniques, Pokereum is uniquely positioned as leader and pioneer  and provides a solution that leverages cryptographic properties of cards games, smart contracts in conjunction with client side technology. Its updated solution ""Shadow Poker"" will provide any other similar project a viable solution for integration. the UX, state & event communication layer uses real time peer to peer telehash framework and is complete with poc 1( link ). Shadow Poker  is scheduled for release and review shortly after superDAO's membership driven crowdfunding is completed.

It also provides for a fraud deterrent solution which aspires to reduce click fraud to a point beyond concern. Dappsery has social and contextual advertising verticals in its cross hairs, but is currently focused on display advertising with a prototype in the early stages of development.
