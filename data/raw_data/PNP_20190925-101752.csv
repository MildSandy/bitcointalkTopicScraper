Two Main Questions Asked On Blockchain & Token Economy    How are you disrupting status quo with blockchain?  Existing standards in the logistics industry are fragmented and misaligned, inhibiting industry players from keeping up with the evolution of e-commerce. This results in poor efficiency in parcel delivery, frequent missed deliveries and lost parcels as well as poor employment benefits for logistics couriers. LogisticsX decentralized platform will transform the last mile delivery ecosystem by enforcing global logistics standards using smart contracts to increase traceability, transparency and ease dispute resolution, ultimately reducing friction between all logistics stakeholders and consumers. Through the use of a decentralized reputation system, LogisticsX will also enable economic empowerment by introducing the concept of freelancers delivering parcels on an adhoc basis (‚ÄúRunners‚Äù), as well as freelancers using their homes or shops to store parcels (‚ÄúParkers‚Äù).  Describe your token economy model  LogisticsX works on the principle of dual currencies‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäParcelPoints, which can only be used within the LogisticsX platform (the SideChain), and PNP tokens, as the publicly tradable coin. ParcelPoint serves as a neutral credit used to reward Parkers and Runners, and is created when parcels are received, and burnt on redemption by holders to PNP. As a neutral credit, it is unaffected by fluctuations in the price of PNP. To provide an easy avenue for cashing out their earnings to fiat, stakeholders can engage LogisticsX as an Operational Crypto-Fiat Exchange, where LogisticsX will perform the conversion of ParcelPoint to PNP to Fiat.  To ensure the trustworthiness of new delivery participants, a Proof-of-Stake system will be used. Each participant will be required to deposit a certain amount of PNP into a smart contract to increase their parcel handling capacity on LogisticsX. As their reputation improves (determined by the number of successfully delivered parcels in a given time window), the amount of PNP required to be staked will be decreased. Should there be issues with any parcel deliveries, their staked PNP will be forfeited and their reputation will be degraded.
