I don't think binance could be a wallet option, it's an exchange site so I don't think storing your gifto on there for a long time is safe for everyone but if you're a trader though then maybe you can just store it in binance for a short period of time.

The Forever Rose” Project  GIFTO and world renowned conceptual artist Kevin Abosch announced a collaboration to create a unique crypto-artwork, called “The Forever Rose”, which was known as “The world’s most valuable virtual art” worth US$1 million worth of cryptocurrency. The digital artwork was bought using two cryptocurrencies — GTO by GIFTO and IAMA by Kevin Abosch.  “The Forever Rose” was sold to 10 buyers on February 14. The US$1 million worth of cryptocurrency raised from the sale will be donated to The CoderDojo Foundation, whose mission is to ensure that every child around the world should have the opportunity to learn code and to be creative with technology in a safe and social environment.  We would like to thank and congratulate the 10 world’s first blockchain charity crypto art collectors!

I think it will be more like $5 or $6, it seems like the development is quite slow for this project but that's okay though steady growth is always better than a sudden growth so I'm not complaining about that. This project has so much potential so I really do believe that the amount that you're talking about is not impossible to achieve but right now it needs to be mass adopted first. Not a lot of people are familiar with gifto, it needs to go beyond asia and it really needs to be marketed properly. I'm not sure if they have a marketing team outside of asia but I think having one will really help the price grow and will definitely help move this project forward.",True

Please ping one of our admin’s for more information if you haven’t seen our Angel application form.  For this week, I’d like to give everyone a bit of history on our company behind the GIFTO project, Asia Innovations Group (AIG). As always, the future of a project is defined by the background and capability of the team behind it, and we are no exception.  Our history of innovation  We are very much unlike most of the project teams that are currently ongoing. AIG was started back at the end of 2013, in order to capitalize on the mobile innovations that we saw rising in Asian countries such as China, Korea, and Japan. Due to our team’s background in the biggest Eastern (Tencent) and Western companies (Google, Zynga), we saw a unique opportunity to build mobile social products that would be cross cultural and cross national.

The article dives deep into how the protocol works, and its potential to :offer a peer-driven solution to the inequitable revenue sharing model that digital advertising creates.”  3.

As a newbie in the crypto world, I have been humbled by the enormous goodwill and enthusiasm. This is the first of our weekly updates to the community, and we would love to get your feedback on how we can make this better to inform all of you.  As this is also the first update of 2018, I’d like to take a bit of time to reflect on 2017. We started this whole journey of blockchain actually in the beginning of 2017. I have to admit, we were too slow when we first started in researching blockchain. We were actually encouraged to research and implement blockchain technology by our equity investors, many of whom have already been involved in this sector for several years. At first when they mentioned that we should look into blockchain, we were skeptical, this is such a new technology that seemed to me still is so far from our sector, which is online mobile entertainment. But thankfully, we were curious and looked deeper. We realized soon that blockchain was made for virtual assets, which, in the shape of virtual gifts, are exactly the driving engine of our live streaming business. That was a very exciting revelation.  On the other hand, as our Uplive live streaming business rapidly grew, our streamers and users constant bombarded us with their questions and requests for more innovation and better service. One of the rising requests from many streamers is to get gifts OUTSIDE of Uplive. Yes, Uplive’s virtual gifts are awesome (you can see them again here: www.up.live), but streamers can only get them while streaming, at most an hour or two a day. Many of the hosts have fans on other platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Youtube, and they cannot monetize these fans. We then developed a Web-based gifting system for them to use on these platforms, outside of Uplive.  It is the confluence of blockchain technology and requests from our own business that drove the birth of GIFTO, the first universal gifting protocol. Unlike most protocols that just focus on the underlying technology, we are also building the full stack of user facing product, as that’s our strength.  Which brings us to the first update on the year. The goal for GIFTO in Q1 is to to get a commercial Beta for blockchain based gifts to Uplive’s now close to 100,000 streamers, and 30 million users, and of course, external influencers.  https://medium.com/@gifto/gifto-weekly-updates-8-january-2018-4b09c328926e",True

It seems like there are a lot of developments that will happen in the next few months, I'm glad that they are finally having an alpha test, that will really help this platform be introduced to a huge market all over the world not just in Asia but also in countries like the United States and England.

We have reached our private sale hard cap. We are humbled by your continued support. Please join us for the public sale by getting on our whitelist.  Asia Innovations Group (“AIG”), a leading mobile entertainment company in Asia, has proven through its popular live streaming platform Uplive that virtual gifting is an effective monetization tool for content creators. Virtual gifting not only generates significant revenue, but also greatly enhances social relationship between creators and their fans. Since launching in June 2016, Uplive has grown to 20 million global users and will achieve more than $100 MUSD revenue in 2017. The Universal Gifting Platform (UGP) is based on the Uplive experience and seeks to enable content creators to monetize virtual gifts on any content platform, not just on Uplive. Each virtual gift is implemented as a smart contract on blockchain, enabling the virtual gift to have sustained value across any platform and an ecosystem of participants to help create, review, and sell these virtual gifts.  Website  -  Facebook -  Medium  -  Telegram  -  Twitter  -  Kakao  -  Slack  - Github  -  Reddit    Problem: The Pain Point for Content Creators Global content and social platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook have allowed anyone to easily create content and build a fanbase. However, these content platforms mostly still rely on advertising to generate revenue. The key limitation of the advertising model places control of revenue generation with centralized companies, including content platforms, advertising networks, agencies and marketing firms. In addition, the need for advertisements to reach large viewer base greatly favors the top 1% of content creators who have the most traffic. These centralized companies determine how content creators are paid. As a result, the vast majority of the content creators globally cannot make a reliable living. This issue is also getting worse as advertisers have overwhelming power regarding content they deem appropriate to deploy their budget on.  Propose: Uplive Monetization model The flagship product of AIG, Uplive, has demonstrated that it is possible to generate significant, sustainable revenue for content creators via a sophisticated virtual gifting model. Uplive has been generating millions of dollars of income for 60,000 content creators every month directly from their fanbase, and the numbers continue to increase. This model has been used in gaming extensively and has proven to work for mainstream content creators. In fact, we have enabled what the South China Morning Post calls the “gig economy”, where a broadcaster can be self-sufficient based on just a few hours of broadcasting a day. Examples of Uplive’s gifts below, actual videos of these virtual gifts in action can be seen at here.  Challenge: Connect Uplive's virtual gifting system to the world Virtual gifts are digital assets that have significant economic value, therefore we must have a reliable way of keeping track of their value, properties, and transactions. Virtual gifts must also be defensible against damaging and self-serving actions by third parties and individuals, i.e., identity spoofing, simulating or duplicating a limited edition gift or falsifying a transaction, etc… A number of participants are required to operate the workflow of virtual gifts to ensure that they are of high quality, properly categorized, and appropriately priced. There must be proper incentives and penalties for participants to contribute effectively and for content and virtual gifting ecosystem to grow. A large number of these participants are needed to scale virtual gifts ecosystem to serve content creators and their fans globally. Fluctuation of currency values in different countries makes it difficult to offer universal gifting with fair pricing to content creators around the world.  Solution: Gifto Protocol powered by blockchain Gifto Protocol is envisioned to be a self-governing and self-sustaining ecosystem for virtual gifts to be created, curated, tracked, bought, sent and exchanged across any content platform such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, etc. For the protocol to truly be a self-sustaining ecosystem for all contributors, Gifto has the following components: Gift, Gifto’s Virtual Smart Gift, self-executing virtual assets based on smart contracts that live on blockchain. Gift Store, where a fan can buy a gift for a content creator. Gift Store will be displayed when a fan clicks on a gifting link for a content creator, and will show gifts customized by this content creator. Gift Inventory holds gifts for a user who can be either a fan or a content creator Gifto Tokens, an ERC20-compliant token used to buy/sell virtual gifts. Gifto Wallet, a wallet to hold Gifto tokens for a user Gift Portal, a management system for gifts to be created, curated, and managed by Gifto contributors.

There are many similar ICO. In fact, this system of gifting platform has been existing for a long time without the use of blockchain/ICO.  However, let me just share 2 information with you about Uplive.  1st: after its launch in June 2016, Uplive quickly became the highest monthly revenue international live streaming platform. As of August 2017, Uplive is receiving over USD 10 Million per month of gross revenue from millions of users across 50+ countries, and at the same time, generating millions of income for the 60,000+ broadcasters spread across these countries. In essence, Uplive is now one of the largest user-generated content platforms that is powered directly through user contributions, and not advertising. On page 16 of the whitepaper, there is a breakdown on the sales of the different gifts. So the company already have a well-development and working product with strong customers/viewers base. You can feel free to download the uplive app in playstore and itune.  2nd: The Gifto team is developing a protocol for gifting platform, so this protocol is not just limited to Uplive. In fact, any other company which wish to tap on this service can apply the protocol on top of their app. So the token usage is not just tied to Uplive and can expand to many other companies. The team hope that it can even influences other countries to have this gifting culture.  Let's spread the love.

Right now the uplive already have gifting function but it is centralised. So the objective is to design a decentralise platform and move the gifting function in uplive to the decentralise platform.
