After a successful ICO, the asset-backed mechanism is scheduled to come into force as soon as the asset-backed value (90% of the whisky portfolio value) has reached the value of the initial market capitalisation (after the ICO has ended), i.e. 100% coverage. If the market capitalisation is subsequently below the asset-backed value for one month, a buy-back is made. To this end, a part of the high-end whisky portfolio will initially be sold. From this proceeds, purchase orders are placed on the stock exchanges until the market capitalization is again above the asset-backed value. The tokens acquired through the asset-backed mechanism are destroyed in order to guarantee a sustained deflation and an increase of the value of WHISKY TOKEN ",False

If this is the case the asset backed mechanism could be activated in a year, starting from the end of the ICO.  Quote from: Z1pp4 on November 14, 2018, 08:20:39 AM I can only imagine the mass adoption of this token. For instance, if you want to buy a bottle of lets say my favorite Caol Ila, you have to pay taxes. If you import spirits, you will still have to pay excise to your local tax office. How it is going to work wit this coin?  Thats true we still have to pay taxes. But we already considered this in our calculations. The cost though is pretty high but not as substantial as it would break our business model. So in germany we have to pay 13,03€ per liter of pure alcohol so a 700ml bottle with 40% is going to cost us 3,65€ in Taxes. Since we are targeting high end whiskies the percentage ""lost"" diminishes the pricier the whisky gets. So if we bought Whisky for 30€ per bottle, the tax alone would cost us 12.1% of the value of the whisky. A 200€ bottle, however, only 1.825%",False
