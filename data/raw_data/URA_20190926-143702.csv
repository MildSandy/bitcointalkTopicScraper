Correct again. We have all seen this too many times before. ICO ends, projects throw their token up on the exchanges and forget about it. Luckily, we are not followers. We have learned from the many mistakes other projects make.  So.... How about another update? I don't want to jinx anything here but so far every large prospective partner or advisor that I've had my sights set on has eventually joined our team and/or closed an important deal with us. So, it's good to put these things out in the open. Makes me work harder towards the goal. I have been talking with the Pigzbe CEO. Nothing specific has been discussed yet but he mentioned the words ""exploring a partnership or merger"". If you don't know Pigzbe then I suggest looking them up. They are our European counterpart. A bit more funded and operating in a way more flexible region in terms of banking and finance. I like their work ethic and they are very professional. I see them not as competition, but as powerful allies. I pitched ""Trading Wheels"" to them too. This part of the process is painstakingly slow but we are marching forward still.

I've been in back to back meetings trying to find a service or solution to the scenario where our platform users could have a sufficient amount of options to spend their URA on. We are not delusional to think that that more than 1/1000 kids will actually want to hold their crypto rather than spend it on real world items or even digital game bucks for Fortnite or Rocket League.  That has been a major concern of ours since January. Today, I finally found the answer. I didn't find it, actually. One of our most trusted advisors and very good friend of mine introduced me to the opportunity and I couldn't be more pleased with the conversations I've had so far with this company.  If this works out, we will have no problem retaining our user base and they will be able to spend their tokens just about anywhere in the world. I am not too sure how they feel about me disclosing their name just yet. But the second I get the green light from them, I will blast it here.  I can give you a hint though. They are a branch of an established and very successful financial remittances company that jumped into the crypto space last year. They had a successful ICO in Nov. 2017 and since then they have been meeting their road map goals and have been in full development mode. They are also a card processor.  That's all I will say till tomorrow or the next day.  Still no word from Pigzbe. They are busy setting up their Kickstarter campaign so I understand that we are an afterthought. We are busy too and I haven't even had time to send that follow up email. I should be doing that now actually.... Bye.  P.S.

We left a little bit smarter though.  Next on the Agenda is...CoinAgenda!!! Otherwise known as the Investor's Summit.

The IMMO.Foundation, Ammeris Foundation, Share Internet Data(SID), BitWhite(BTW) and EventChain(EVC).

Let me begin by saying.... Did you guys miss me? This was the longest I was away without any updates. I have plenty of good explanations for my absence but why waste time with all that? Instead I will deliver some great news about our progress and new partners and upcoming events and more.... We have been very busy to say the least. To say the most......  We have decided to extend the sale for a minimum of two months but definitely no longer than December. I said from the beginning that the end date was set only to please the form fields of the rating sites and that we most likely will push the date forward. There are many opportunities that we can't miss in the next two months. I could ramble on in full detail but to make this much less painful for anyone that is in a hurry, I will make a long list of all the updates that have happened over the past few weeks and the things to come that we are very excited about.......We are an accepted form of payment for buying Share Internet Data tokens.   New Partners: 1.) ShareInternetData.io Here is a video in which SID’s Chairman explains why the URAllowance (URA) partnership is mutually beneficial. https://youtu.be/I1x6xp6XRx8 By the way SID Limited accepts the URA Token as payment method for the purchase of the SID Token (SIDT). Click here to purchase SID Tokens with your URA tokens: www.ShareInternetData.io. If you don't have URA yet www.URAllowance.com   We have many plans with the SID and URA platforms working together to incentivize users and cross promote in a way that joins our platforms together. This partnership doesn't end with SID.  2.) www.Ammeris.com Here is an article that went out to 1,000s of news sites and family magazines across the world. https://www.ammeris.com/announcement/ammeris-urallowance-form-partnership-to-bring-blockchain-and-smart-contracts-to-family-homes A quote from yours truly.... “The strategic partnership with Ammeris is a perfect fit. Ammeris understands that evolving is the key to not only survive, but to thrive in the fastest changing industry in history. URAllowance and the team that drives it lives by this principle, albeit at a smaller level focusing in on the evolution of families. The Ammeris and URAllowance partnership will work together to introduce an advanced level of technology along with a more responsible consumption of energy into the family unit. This is progress at its finest. The advantages of joining forces with Ammeris are magnified by both of our team's relentless pursuit of innovative societal improvements.” ~CB  Ammeris founder said..... “I have been talking to Chris for several months about his project and have been impressed by the passion and energy emanating from his team. The team and I at Ammeris believe URA’s project is an obvious fit for collaboration as there is no better way to get adoption and to educate our societies about DLT than by bringing cryptocurrencies and smart contacts into the lives of young people. We look forward to working with URA to assist in their rollout of their application throughout countless households.” ~ Paul Mears  3.) IMMO High1000. (ask for a link in PM if you're curious) I am proud to announce that I was among the first to be recruited into the High1000. This is an organization that understands macroeconomics better than any company out there that is also pushing for adoption of blockchain and cryptocurrency.    IMMO is one of our strongest partners and we are glad to have each other's best interest in mind. Contact me directly for any info regarding IMMO.  Events:(Don't worry, we wouldn't dare spend even one Satoshi of contributor's coins on admission. We are highly against using project money to attend these things)  All events I have managed to call in favors and pull some strings and get passes into all of them for free. We have already attended ChainExchange and Blockshow. We did not have any overpriced booths. We were able to meet great people and spread the word of URAllowance to many people. Our next to shows that we will be attending, we are so excited about. These are the two best shows of this entire year by a long shot.  HoshoCon @ The Hard Rock Hotel: https://www.hoshocon.com/ I just received my confirmation today. Passes for the whole team and I even got two for future partners(to be announced)  Once again.... We have not and will not pay for any events. I know of some companies that ran out of money because they attended too many of these things. I have enough clout in this space that I should be able to get into any that fit our purpose and schedule for free.  CoinAgenda @ The Mandalay Bay: https://coinagenda.com/ The blockchain investors conference. Compliments of our strategic partner Ashton Addison, CEO of EventChain.io  We are aiming to get into World Crypto Con at the Aria too. I will update on that venture soon.

Exactly. You understand the very essence of URAllowance and why we are doing this. It's not just about teaching kids responsibility. It's much more than that. When I was a kid, I was very respectful and fearful of adults. I believed for many years that all adults were infallible. It wasn't until my teenage years that I discovered parents and adults were also f**k ups at times. Excuse my language, but there is no putting it lightly here. I am a parent and I am not perfect. There are sooooo many things that I could've done better. My boy is 11 years old. I have at least 7 more years of mistakes to make. I wasn't taught how to properly manage my finances. Many other parents that I meet are in the same situation. I had to learn the hard way. I spent the first several years of adulthood being reminded to pay my power bill when all my appliances and lights would suddenly go out. I'm 35 now and I am confident in my ability to manage my finances. But what about our users and members of our community that have children but were not taught how to manage their finances responsibly? How are they supposed to teach their children these fundamental skills if they do not even know how themselves? The answer is simple.... Learn with them.

Sorry for my extended absence. I had some personal issues involving a tragedy in my family. I am back now and everything is going great. Over the past 1.5 weeks since I've reported to the community I have met some amazing, influential people that have pledged to help bring the URAllowance initiative into the mainstream. Thanks to our partner David Drake, we had a powerhouse meeting with some of the smartest people I've ever met in this industry. We met with Reginald Ringgold of Blockvest and is considered one of the top crypto minds furthering blockchain into worldwide acceptance, Eric Anderson of Rockstar Games and Demon Saw and Promether. My personal friend and business partner Yogesh of CryptoXpress, Mike Sheppard of Blockvest Exchange and of course Mike Martin, President of URAllowance. This all happened when we took over the halls of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino during the ChainXchange conference here in Las Vegas. The things that were discussed during this meeting were so inspirational that I have no doubt in my mind that we are on the right path. Success at this point is imminent.  To answer the question I quoted here. no we don't have the funds in our possession. They are locked safely in escrow and will be released shortly. Traditional money, traditional rules. We have to respect his way of doing business. The good thing is is it's not an investor its a contributor that is buying tokens and no equity is being taken. Furthermore, this deal, although private is creating a domino effect as we were contacted by another private buyer that wants to negotiate a bonus percentage. As hard as it is for me to do private sales and not reveal the buyer, I have to also respect their privacy. However, it is written in the contract that I will reveal the details of the sale including the amounts purchased and the bonuses provided. That was our non negotiable clause. We vowed to keep our community up to date and we will not agree to any deals that require us to give a larger bonus than the community is aware of. So far, 40% bonus is the highest we've offered. 35% is the highest we've actually provided. The terms changed and the offered 40% was lowered. That good news because that means more tokens for you guys.  Once again, please accept my apologies for my short leave. It was unavoidable. I'm back now and I can't wait to share more with you as there are many events planned in the near future.",False

I should use my position as the US Regional Officer for the MIDEX Exchange for this. I have access to the Midex devs. Part of my duties at MIDEX include forming partnerships and spreading the usage of MIDEX across the globe. We could simply put a link to MIDEX with instructions on how to use all their new fiat/crypto systems. Or we could go a step further and integrate a gateway that runs from inside our platform. I think if we trade any crypto pairs we become an exchange. Which is a no no in the US unless we are partnered with a licensed exchange. I've spoken with CryotoXpress Exchange about this and their lawyer said that it is perfectly legal. Not even a gray area. Just an American company doing business with an Australian company. In the case of MIDEX it would be China though. That's two possible solutions for this now. Thanks TunerDude.  I love this community! You all have helped us to brainstorm through some pretty complicated issues. Over the last 8 months we have come up with some great ideas and traveled down unforseen paths because of suggestions, criticism and debate from the URAllowance community. Thank you Thank you.

They have the ability to be backed by a bank, apply a debit card that is also backed by a bank and they can be insured to handle the transmission of money to and from their customers accounts. With blockchain and crypto, those luxuries go away. For now anyways. Soon enough there will be enough blockchain companies in our country that the legislators will realize that they must make room for us and blow away the cloud of uncertainty that they clutch onto so tightly. We think the addition of fiat and debit cards into our platform would be the best possible way to sustain the highest possible user base while also bringing in non-crypto users and making them more comfortable with using crypto and to understand blockchain a little bit better.

It is that if you aren't making mistakes and failing things on a regular basis, you aren't trying new things or taking any risks. To fail is to learn. If you have the right mindset anyways. People rarely evaluate themselves or their performance when they are winning all the time. Winning is easy. Winning is comfortable. To be able to enter into a situation that is uncomfortable, strange, and new and difficult knowing you may fail is one of the bravest ""Man vs. Himself"" events you can face. I still fear these situations every time. I catch myself still making  excuses to not push forward too. The example we are trying to set with URAllowance has been a huge motivator in helping me defeat these fears. After all, how can I be a provider of a platform that is teaching kids how to be successful, responsible, and proud of their achievements if I don't lead by example? For example...... Very soon I will be appearing on a few different T.V. shows and podcasts and radio and......up on stage in front more people than I want to talk to at one time.    I am not a good public speaker and I am tripping over the whole thing. But, I will climb my A$$ up on to the stage and do what I gotta do to get past that fear.

But the reality of parenting and homework is that sometimes you have to leave the kids to their studies or practicing of their extra curricular activities. That's why we are going to include the multi-sig requirement. The kids will set up their trades and complete the required tasks set by their parents, guardians or teachers then they will sign the transaction first. The parents will then review the choices made by the kids and if they approve, they will be the second signature and the orders will be submitted. This solution creates a bit of problem that still needs to be solved too. The problem here is, the crypto markets are always moving. If a kid enters his choices and it takes the parents several hours to be able to check, or even days, the market conditions will have changed and the kids would not receive an accurate lesson on trading. I have a few ideas though. The one that makes the most sense is to have the platform send a push notification directly to the parents device. If the trade that the student has chosen changes by a specified amount the order is automatically cancelled. What do you think.  Oh yeah the name of this feature is ""TRADING WHEELS"".

Regarding the average attention span of an a kid.... Here is how they used to calculate it.  ""According to Kids Growth, the attention span of a child or teen who is actively trying to pay attention is 3 to 5 minutes for every year of the child's age. As a result, a 13-year-old has an attention span between 39 and 65 minutes, while a 16-year-old is capable of paying attention for 48 to 80 minutes.""   That was back when I was a kid....... Today they say that the average attention span of a teenager is just 12 seconds!!!! While I don't fully agree with that statistic, mostly because they used time spent on webpages to extrapolate the data, but also because I have been around kids for many years. I would estimate it to be around two minutes. Which is the most watched length of tutorials and many other YouTube video genres. Times are changing. Evolution is happening.

Any trades that happen on the Kids exchange would actually happen on the real exchange just as if the kid was there making the trade himself. The difference is..... The kids exchange is full of hover pop-ups with explanations and most importantly..... The Trading Wheels. Each trade submitted from the kids side would require two signatures. One from the kid. and the other from a parent, teacher, or guardian. This way the kids will never be able to trade blindly or without instruction. Once the parent, teacher, or guardian approves of the kids choice of trade he signs it and allows it to be sent to the order book. This is just a brief summary of a brainstorm session. There are many more details",False

Now, post ICO, when we are sold out of tokens and need to market the URAllowance platform, NASDAQ would do so well as a Super Bowl commercial. At this time we will shift our marketing focus from token sales to product marketing through YouTube top influencers.

I wanted the first video he made to be a candid representation of how misinformed kids are about crypto. My wife, Lori Brown, and I have worked in different sections of the crypto industry for years. It's been over two years since either one of us earned a paycheck in USD. So, with CryptoKid only knowing what he has overheard his mom and I talk about, I thought he would make a hilariously misinformed video to support my position that kids don't know anything, yet. When he showed me the video he made on his first take with no script. I was seriously so surprised and extremely proud at how much he has absorbed. Kids have an uncanny ability to learn. Their minds are not polluted with decades of experience and preconceived notions and cynicism. They have this potential that knows no limits.

We are still experiencing heavy congestion on the ETH blockchain. We spent ALL DAY yesterday trying to slip our contracts in and we had no luck. We went so far as to increase our GWEI so high that if it would've succeeded, it would,ve been a 1.5 ETH transaction. I don't like to spend frivolously so that was hard to watch. Mike and I actually made the call to hold off until it calmed down a bit. But, Larron, our CTO was already several hours into that world that only coders understand and basically refused to give up. He pulled 1.5 of his own ETH out of storage and sent the transaction through at 67 GWEI. After 25 minutes it timed out and only ended up costing him about 8 bucks worth of ETH...... Twice. We are not going to try again today. We will try again tomorrow though.

Two, he has agreed to blast URAllowance out to that network in the form Articles, Syndicated news, social media, and my favorite part..... TV appearances!!! On freaking NASDAQ and CNBC!!!! Sorry about my language but this is very exciting. Another awesome thing David brings to URAllowance with him is his friends in high place. The highest places. Ever hear of Family Offices? Well it's a relatively new term to me but I know now that it goes hand in hand with success. I couldn't possibly list all the things this partnership has to offer. Just yesterday he was in Zurich discussing banking options for us. Mike recently asked him if he could help us to achieve one of our impossible goals of finding a debit card solution for URA. As we all know, debit cards and crypto had a nasty falling out last year and there are only a few left operational. If we manage to find a solution to this problem that ends with us having URA debit cards, the rest will be history. So we would like to welcome David Drake officially to the URAllowance team roster. This will be a mutually beneficial partnership that will yield incredible results. I would also like to brag a little if I may. David Drake has been asked to take equity and become partner to 80+ projects. We are the first he has actually accepted. If that isn't a confidence booster, I don't know what is.",False

We scheduled our launch for yesterday. We were right on time with our preparations. Then I pulled a noob move and signed a basic ""add owner address"" transaction 16 times. This little reminder that crypto has a sense of humor only set us back about one hour as the redundant sigs confirmed one by one.  As of right now and since yesterday the ETH blockchain has been sooooo congested that we are still adding owners addresses for the multi-sig. We have a 3-signature requirement for any and all outgoing transactions. I will post an example of this congestion below. On one signature we are already 9 hours and 25 minutes pending. So needless to say that our token launch is being delayed for hopefully just a few more hours.  However, I realize that I said 06/30/2018 was going to be our launch date and we figured out a way to make that a reality. You can still log into our website and fill out your KYC requirements so that when our token is live you will automatically get your tokens within 30 minutes to a few hours.  I also have some incredible partnership/ownership news to share. Please stay tuned for that announcement later today. It is very exciting and set in stone.  Check this out.... 5:30AM PST/GMT-8 https://etherscan.io/tx/0x450003c2f71a1e54c98cc9a173303f588cbe9b09f87a8b5c48bdbc28a2163eaf ...Very funny Crypto... Very funny.",False

One day he sends me this referral link to a project called Demicoin. I opened the site through his link and without question I sent 0.005 BTC for some Demicoin. Long story short this was the most obvious scam in the history of the world and I was probably the only person in the world that actually sent them anything. Lol. Shortly after the site went down and they disappeared. He never even went to the site himself. He did some phony airdrop or something and just sent me the link. I sent him a message that said something like ""Bro, you were supposed to be Due Dillinger. How could you send me to a scam site?"" He replied with, ""Do your damned due diligence dummy. So you think I will still my credit for referring you?"" That is how Due Dillinger was born.",False

You will never gain a single Merit Point for posting random things that don't address any part of the project or engage any of the members in one of the topics of conversation. You have no signatures in your sig space. Did someone pay you to boost a thread and you guys are not good with directions and ended up here boosting the wrong project? Please. if one of you answers this question, I will make you my honorary ""ANN-Spammer"" I might even site you as a team member.",False

In most cases, it begins with SPAM, then moves onto deleting the fud comments. That kind of thread building is against our core values. Mostly because SPAM and FUD are objective terms and that kind of vagueness gives the admins too much power in being able to decide that any comment that doesn't make them look good is FUD and gets deleted. This is a HUGE problem in most telegram groups. Thats why we use a bot in our Telegram and the only comments that get deleted are the ones from members that post a link on their first day.

How could I have forgotten... lol. I was just making sure you guys were paying attention. Well, long story short, it went better than I could've ever hoped for. Actually, let's go with a short story long..... The meeting started out with about twenty minutes of banter and chitchat about all kinds of topics. Then once we started in on the Q&A, Drake shooting the Qs while we were giving the As. Being the first time I spoke to David with our actual voices on a phone call rather than a chat platform, I didn't know what to expect. People are very different when your entire relationship has been over the internet with emails and chat apps. I'm no different. When I have a thesaurus and backspace ability, I can seem like I have mastered communication and might be super intelligent..... In person and on the phone, I am stripped of my superpowers and if caught off guard, become a stuttering, bumbling fool. Ok, digression over, back to the meeting..... Nothing is set in stone but we talked for about 45 minutes about several levels of cooperation before we both had to attend to our busy schedules. We picked up the conversation again the very next morning and we spoke for another 45 minutes. We ended the second call with an exchange of documents regarding the ways we decided we could be most beneficial to each other. We decided that becoming partners is a slam dunk opportunity for us both. We have another meeting scheduled for May 27th at 4:30 pm NY time and we will undoubtedly finalize the terms of our collaboration/partnership. When this happens, he will be bringing with him a strategic partnership with us that is too good to be true. I will not name it until it is either set in stone or a confirmed failure. Either way, I will be sharing the results. If I don't say anything by Monday the 28th of May then put me on blast again. lol Thanks for reading this. If you have in fact read this, I appreciate and respect your attention span.  ~CB",False

I'd like to invite you to check out our whitepaper and follow some of our sites sources to see that there is a huge market for this. Not only for families but for anyone who understands that money and greed are being phased out and are being replaced by value and transparency. This is why we are having a meeting tomorrow 5/14/2018 with a branding expert who may become our project manager and two acquaintances of our CTO from silicon valley to discuss a possible rebranding. The reason this discussion is on the table is because of the first impression people have been getting, exactly the opinion you expressed in your comment. We are creating something here that will be beneficial to so many people. The hardest part so far is getting people to look beyond a logo or read past a header. Everyone is so busy and the average attention span is dwindling down to nothing. We are in the right path, and beleive me when I say, comments like yours are taken very seriously and whenever there is common conception we have taken It into account and adjusted accordingly. Those of you that have been with us from the beginning already know this, but I'll say it again in case you are just getting here. We have been building or project under the scrutiny of the public and this community since before we had written Our first line of our whitepaper. Which was also written as a live document viewable by all from the very first line. All our progress has happened in plain sight. We have never pretended to be more than we are and we have grown faster and acheived more in a short period of time than we ever could've imagined. All our experiences so far have been shared as well, the good ones and the bad ones. When I make mistakes you probably heard about it from me first. All comments and suggestions from the community are taken seriously. We aren't just saying that like most companies. We are not just here to advertise and use the forum as a means to an end. This is our community too. Thank you.",False

Pre-sale and Sale Dates: Due to the fact that we have pushed back our start date 3 times, I'm reluctant to say. I will tell you that we have been aiming for a May 31st pre-sale start date. There are regulatory decisions we must make first. These decisions have been the hardest for us. We are a US based company and the only compliant way to conduct an ICO that involves US citizens being able to but tokens is to follow BS security laws that don't actually apply, yet. Which means we need to file for Reg A+. This cost is huge and out of our budget. We have not borrowed or collected any seed money. We are 100% self-funded and organic. As proud as I am to say that, I would love some debt right about now...lol. We can move forward with the sale and restrict US citizens and a few other jurisdictions from purchasing tokens until we have raised enough to file for Reg A+.  New Partnership Rumors: I'll tell you as much as I know. We pitched an offer to David Drake. Our offer was for him to take equity in our company and take on a more involved role as well as provide us with working capital. He's been a great advisor but we know of his resources and that he does not waste them on every ICO he advises. He has the experience, connections(and money) we need to take this project to the highest levels. We have passed his criteria checks of even being considered as a partner. We had a meeting with his investment manager and he advised David Drake to take equity in URAllowance and roll his sleeves up to get really involved. We have another meeting with both David and his manager. This could happen at any time. David called me two days ago for this meeting but I was driving and missed the call. If he says yes. We are set for an amazing launch. If he says no, we made it this far and we would not let a no from one person set us back or slow us down.  There it is. The pre-update on the big news.

But seeing as how our own government can not properly explain it, I don't think I will have much better luck. Mostly, this entire debate, no matter where it is taking place, is full of opinion and speculation. Not all tokens are securities. There are basic guidelines as to what makes a token a security.   The now Famous Howie Test is one such way to vaguely try and label a token a non-security. Another popular method I've been seeing for several months now..... I do not recommend this, by the way, I just find it rather hilarious..... Is when a company thinks that they can disguise their security token with clever verbiage and a list of ""no-no"" words that the staff and community managers must avoid at all costs. This route will come back to bite them in the ass later. lol.  We have a token that is consumable via our platform. We will also sell tokens from our platform after the ICO from our reserve pool that we have allocated exactly for this purpose. The price of our post ICO token will be $0.30, 10X more than the highest ICO price. This will make our reserve pool last much longer than if we sold them for $0.03. The reserve pool token sales is a necessary feature we have chosen to include to bring in all the parents and teachers that have no idea what an ICO or crypto is but really want to try our awesome platform because all the other parents, teachers and kids are using it.  Our in platform token sales, at first, will have to be USD purchased only. This is because if we allow for multiple cryptocurrencies this lands us in the exchange category. We wouldn't mind filing for whatever licensing we need to legally be able to exchange on our platform. For now, though, we have our hands full and must focus on development.  Luckily we are in talks with an exchange that is based out of Australia and they love our project and have offered to handle crypto:URA sales for us. More details to come on that.",False

Do I get it right? Initially, I thought that the parent does not perform the task, but instead the contract will check the execution automatically. For example, assigning a child: to transfer some items to another place. When the child takes the last item, under it there will be a note with the password that he will enter into the contract, and this will be an automatic check of the task. The parent entered this password into the contract before the task. Or the child was given the task to do the cleaning.

I was not even aware of the partnership with EventChain, it was a good project for me and it performed a good sale. How will this partnership bring benefits to URallowance? For them I'm sure it will be productive because URallowance has the potential to push them and give them more profits  Good question. I'm glad you asked. As of right now, Ashton is on tour traveling the world with EventChain and being the Keynote speaker at blockchain events. We hadn't ironed out the complete details yet but knew there was potential in partnership. Cross-promotional at first but getting into the development side I proposed that from our app and with URA, our users could purchase event tickets and also set up events for their schools, selling tickets for fundraisers. This is not set in stone and obviously, our devs would have to collaborate but the synergy is there and we are grateful have such a successful partnership that's been around for as long as he has.  Now for another update on this partnership. Nothing is set in stone but here is an offer I just proposed and another Use case for both projects. There is definitely relevance between our projects when you approach with an open mind. This is an excerpt from an email I sent to EventChain.  ""Every Year PTA’s raise millions. 19.4 million last year with 6.4% yearly growth rate. These funds are shared with partners and third-party vendors that facilitate these fundraising events. The PTAs keep a small portion. http://fliphtml5.com/dtoi/mkdg (pg.39) Less than half of that is raised through ticketed events. Each individual PTA rep. has the ability to customize the way they raise money. After talking with a few local PTA board members, they agree that if it were easier to create events and distribute and sell the tickets, they would hold more concerts, plays and even sporting events would be easier to manage. How do we get in this tightly knit community??? Glad you asked. Below are the conversation and invitations to the once a year, National PTA Conference where all the top educational and PTA influencers and decision makers will be. They are starving for innovation. ""  Now another email excerpt from the National PTA  ""From: Amaia Stecker  Hello,  I'm reaching out regarding awareness and advertising opportunities with the National PTA at our onsite, print and digital platforms. Take a look, I think there are several opportunities for synergy between our organizations' goals.  2018 Convention and Exhibition, June 21-24 New Orleans: All the details about the Convention and Expo can be found here: www.pta.org/2018expo At the National PTA Convention, more than 1,000 influential PTA state and regional leaders and influencers, representing nearly 25,000 local chapters, will be looking for innovative products and services for their PTAs. PTA leaders want to implement well performing fundraising programs, improve school and PTA operations, enhance student well-being and discover great new resources - as well as find brands that have ""feet on the ground"" in communities nationwide and who can become a trusted ally and partner for their specific PTA. Our members are interested in what you offer and eager to share your information with others within their schools and communities. Just about everyone and everything in the family or school market can have success with the National PTA Convention: new technologies, learning resources, school supplies, fundraisers, purpose-led nonprofits, consumer packaged goods, ""edutainers"" and authors.""   I would like to point out once more that EventChain has not yet agreed to this but I think it's a great way to get out there to the non-crypto world and spread some awareness and foster in some adoption for generations to come.

We have posted screens and given the link to the mock-up. I will have them added to the OP here so you don't have to go through and search them out. We are starting out with a mobile platform because it will be easier to promote and market. Phase two: URWorld will also be on mobile but to experience the full glory of what it will be and also access all the monetization options of URWorld, A PC or Tablet computer will be necessary. Then, of course, our most ambitious goal, Phase 3 URWorld: Mixed Reality edition will only be available from your desktop and Hololens. This phase will be focused on education in Mixed Reality and will be a catalyst between the URAllowance platform's foundation of familial values and the expansion of our company into new unexplored territories of combining education with advanced technology. We are prepared for the future. Books, pens, paper. I love them. I grew up reading novels in a paperback and drawing until my arm was covered in pencil lead and ink. But our kids and their kids will not know these things the way that we do. They are born with this tech knowledge in their DNA already. So it only makes sense to take their education into the advanced realms of technology that they are comfortable with. Imagine I sent you back to school with a feather quill, an inkwell, and some scrolls. Or a chisel and some stone slabs. lol Sounds crazy. That is what we are asking our kids to do when we send them to school with a pen and paper. They've evolved beyond that being normal for them. So, to answer your question.....

David Drake is officially on our advisory board! Drake is a cryptocurrency man of steel ladies and gentleman. He has been in this game since before most of us were even using the internet on a daily basis.  David Drake LDJ Capital  David Drake is Founder and Chairman at LDJ Capital, a multi-family office which deals in worldwide funds accessing over $1.5 trillion in assets, and maintains over 50+ global directors and family office partners.   More recently, Mr. Drake is also seen as a leader in cryptocurrency.  Mr. Drake saw the value of digital assets when everyone was avoiding it.  It all started in 2011 when Mr. Drake collaborated on the JOBS Act to create new laws underlying all fundraising in the U.S. for all ICOs.  He runs a $200M LDJ Cayman Fund focused on cryptocurrency, mining and ICO acquisitions.  LDJ Capital Credit also offers middle market bridge financing to seed upcoming ICO’s.  Previously he held a majority stake as a Managing Partner with Robert Hambrecht in an Alternative Energy Fund NewCommons Capital 2009-2010.  David Drake is the Chairman of LDJ Capital, a multi-family office with holdings in Victoria Partners, a 500 family office network based in London; LDJ Real Estate Group; and The Soho Loft Media Group.   Mr. Drake has been involved in TMT (technology, media, telecoms), realty, hospitality, cleantech, energy and social impact investments for more than 20 years. He is an advocate of innovative investing in private equity, capital formation policies and developments globally, and the US JOBS Act which he lobbied for in the US Congress and the EU Commission. Because of his leading work in this space, he represented the US Commerce Department at the EU Commission in Brussels and Rome in 2012 and was invited to the White House Champions of Change ceremony in Washington, D.C. and as a speaker at the UK Parliament in 2013.  His investment, The Soho Loft Media Group, produces and sponsors over 200 global conferences annually and his articles are syndicated in over 100 publications.  One such event was April 2013 for the institutional media leader Thomson Reuters, with speakers from Nasdaq, NYSE, KKR and Carlyle Group. He advances financial innovation through his work as an international speaker and writer. He has spoken in top universities like Cambridge, NYU, Cornell, Columbia,  and writes regularly for major publications like WSJ, Forbes, Huffington Post, Thomson Reuters. He is the co-author of the books Planet Entrepreneur and is the author of the upcoming books The Crowdfunding Economy and LIFEE: Life Instructions for Entrepreneurs and Executives.  Previously, Mr. Drake has acted as general partner in fund-of-funds, realty funds, venture capital funds, seed funds and hedge funds.  Mr. Drake’s holdings have media partnership with the European Business Angel Network, European Venture Philanthropy Association and Angel Capital Association of North America.  He sits on 4 angel networks and has co-founded two angel networks.  Privately, Drake has hosted the Harvard Business Club of NY at his home, produced Carnegie Hall concerts and raised funds for the charities Trail Blazers and Best Buddies for many years. His years in the performing arts as a former board adviser to the Washington Ballet reached an apex March 2015 with a board director position at the New York City Opera  Born in Sweden and fluent in six languages, Mr. Drake has an MBA in Finance and an MA in International Law and Economics from George Washington University, where he was awarded the Wallenberg Scholarship for academic merit.  In my opinion, Mr. Drake is a beacon of success. He is the most well connected and motivated people I've ever met. He is truly on our board to help us succeed. I'd say we are lucky but actually, this partnership did not just land in our laps. My brother, Michael Martin saw David at the top of the ""People of Blockchain"" list along with several other influencers. We like to aim high. Out of all the top people on that list, Drake had, hands down, done the most for crypto on so many levels. I won't get into detail, but I will say that more than a few of the ""top influencers"" in the crypto space are selling their names and faces to anyone with enough ETH and is also willing to give up a large portion of their tokens. I am a little bit saddened by how many of these people that we are supposed to look to for guidance and unbiased opinion were willing to join our advisory board without knowing anything more than our names.     Some even responded to a simple introduction email with three page, pre-written sales pitch and contract. No thanks. We agreed from day one that we will not shill, be shilled, or support that crap  in any way, shape, or form. Needless to say, David stood out. When he replied to us I didn't believe it. Not only was he attentive, he was already making plans for us it seemed. I'm not saying that whole list over there at ICOB is bad. There are many, many reputable people of blockchain that are doing great things for crypto and giving their honest opinions on ICOs. The ones I'm talking about are high up the list but are few in comparisson. I won't name names but you know who you are. My advice, to the ""shillers of blockchain"", greed has toppled empires. You have enough money. Rediscover your crypto roots, the reason you became a pioneer. Be happy with what you've earned and stop selling yourselves to shit projects. Thanks Drake, for keeping real all these years and not succumbing to greed. I know why you are always smiling. Because you are content.",False

When we first conceived the idea for URAllowance we did extensive market research and also searched high and low for other similar projects. There was one that came out several years ago, PiggyCoin. They still trade on the market but the project has not moved forward in some time. They were a little bit too pre-school for our taste and for the market demand. Basically, we found a huge hole in crypto that was the same exact shape as URAllowance. The kids up to this point have been largely overlooked. Crazy to think of all the mass adoption talk you hear about every day but nobody was pushing crypto onto the obvious group that will bring mass adoption. Even the gaming ICOs have all been leaning towards the adult crowd. Except for GameFlip, they hit the nail on the head. After all the research into the markets and the scouring of consensus reports and survey data, we found a rather large untapped marketization opportunity. Allowances are just the start. 41 billion on average is paid out in allowances every year in America alone. Now it might seem a bit strange to bring a third party like URAllowance into an already decentralized transaction between parents and kids. Not to us though. We see the ineffectiveness in the current structure of allowances. We will fix it by getting the whole family involved and hold everyone accountable for their part. Aside from that, there is a trillion dollar speculative market that has recently opened up over the past 15 years. Women entering the higher paying workforce has left many household jobs needing to be filled. I have all the data cited in the whitepaper regarding this new market that is waiting for a few smart companies to come in and stake their claim. We will be one of them.",False

Our meeting with Dmitry Machikhin was postponed due to his crazy traveling schedule. He did tell me that taking on an advisory role would be tricky because he is working on Midex full time. He couldn't yet commit to that title. I fully respect that decision. Some ICO advisors that I see on twenty projects at one time makes me wonder if they are really advising or just selling their profile picture and name. He loves URAllowance and is an advocate for education on any level. Great guy all around. While I was researching him I discovered he is also humble. He never mentioned that he has fought and won some important battles for cryptocurrency against regulation. We are lucky to have gained his interest. If he can't give us proper advisory due to his busy schedule, he will take on an ambassador role for us. Whatever is decided, our team is happy to have him onboard. Our rescheduled appointment is set for April 16, 2018.  2. The alpha version of our platform is in development and we are putting the finishing touches on the new website early next week. Unless we find time this weekend. We may surprise you. The new website will look much cleaner and professional. Our CTO is a wizard and never ceases to surprise me. I did an alright job on the current website but as any visitor will be able to tell you, I'm not a pro web designer. So stay tuned for that.  3. Partnerships. We have a few important meetings this weekend with two local (Las Vegas) companies that are crypto veterans. I won't give up the names just yet. If next week rolls through and I haven't mentioned who they are then we didn't come to any terms.  4. Our Team/website/whitepaper/business plan/SWOT Security Audit is apparently sitting in the outbox of CryptoCoinConnect and the results are looking very good. According to them. I still wait to see it with my own eyes. I will post it here not more than one minute after we receive it.  5. Token Contract/Crowd Sale Contract. Complete. Since we are 100% self-funded and can't afford an outrageously priced celebrity to audit our Smart Contract, we are first having it audited internally. We have full confidence in its security. It was written by our CTO and none of it was outsourced. However, We understand the importance of external auditing so we will be starting a very generous bug bounty prior to deployment. If necessary.  That is it for today.  One more thing. We are willing to negotiate with some Seed Investors and or Venture Capital to help us out with some of these increasing Pre-Sale expenses.

The way we prevent lack of discipline, for parents and for kids, employers, and employees, is simple. After a task is complete and the kid or employee marks the task as complete on their dashboard. This action initiates a timer that begins to countdown on the dashboard of the parent or employer. This makes it so that the parent/employer must stay involved with the whole process all the way to the end. There is even an option to give bonuses at the time of verification for extraordinary work. If the verification timer runs down to zero, the reward is transferred to the wallet of the kid/employee.

But the laziness of parents is an issue for sure. We have an option for a family news letter to go out weekly or monthly to the entire family. Grandparents, aunts, uncles, brothers, pastures, coaches, anyone that is considered close to the family can get one. It will include important dates and events. Perhaps on the front, we will include statistics of the parents and the kids. How many times the timer made it to zero and how many times the task was incomplete. This could motivate them all parties to follow through. If their loved ones are watching. Thank you, for the insight.",False

The Oracle problem I talked about before is something you will experience with URAllowance, id est: how do you translate a real life event into an accurate digital input for the smart contract? For example, when the job is to clean up their room, how do you make sure a dirty room does not result in a green check mark? In this case, the parents are the Oracles. Can they be trusted with themselves? The same goes with logistics projects on the blockchain. How do you make sure a package is indeed correctly delivered in order to signal it was a success to the smart contract? In that case, is the deliverer a trustworthy Oracle, or is there a possibility the deliverer fails to deliver the package while telling the smart contract it was received?  This becomes a lot easier when signals do not have to cross the border between the digital and analog world. For example, a job could consist of a math exam. The solution can be verified by a trustworthy Oracle, a calculator, and sent directly to the smart contract without any human intervention. In fact the calculator can be designed in such a trustworthy way, having no dependency on a centralized, possibly untruthful Oracle, one could say it is a trustless system, because no trust is required for the correctness of the system, other than the trust in the system as a whole.  That last bit may surprise you. Yes, even a trustless system requires a base level of trust. You could go as deep as not trusting 1 + 1 = 2.",False

The parents are the Oracles.  The modern use of the word oracle has sometimes become bastardized, meaning a good source of information.  In the classical sense oracles were not infallible at all, in fact, the priests deliberately misled people to influence politics, as the oracle's prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim - yet gibberish under the influence of chemical fumes, and the priests could interpret that gibberish as they pleased.  It is the classical sense of the word oracle, not the modern bastardization, I believe to be the correct meaning in the context of the Oracle problem. It is about the trustworthiness of the conduit, or like Michelle24 said, the interface, between the input and the output.  Bear with me. If you have ever watched an episode of Cesar Millan's Dog Whisperer you may notice he is not so much training the dog as he is teaching the handler. In most cases the handler is the source of the trouble, not the dog. Similarly URAllowance should be teaching the parents, not just their kids.",False

Furthermore, kids of today are genetically coded to better understand technology and can grasp these topics almost instantly. If you watch the CryptoKid videos we've been posting you will be surprised to hear that the first four videos that CryptoKid recorded were done from information he absorbed just listening to his mom and I and people in our network talking to each other.  I was amazed at how much he knew before I even started teaching him. The videos ""All about airdrops"" and ""Blockchain"" were recorded in two takes from his memory. Meaning he didn't practice it or have a script. It's basically him just talking about crypto and it is informative too.

The Family-Smart Contract is only the base layer of our project. The implementation of URAllowance and FSCs into homes, schools, Non-profits, community centers, and the workplace will be helped along by our very solid plan and planned partnerships with many non-profit organizations that are known for their involvement in schools, families, and the community. The partnerships with organizations like Boys and Girls Club, Boy Scouts of America, YMCA, PBS Kids, D.A.R.E. and Girl Scouts, and the National PTA all cost money. They are non-profits which means that their whole operation is funded by grants and donations from ""partners"" that must undergo deep evaluation before they will even consider taking a prospective partners money. We have started the process with all the organizations I just listed above at some level.Some I already have the forms for and others I am waiting to hear a response.

The info in the OP may need to be adjusted. We have not included a soft cap in the coding of the smart contract but it can be added in before our smart-contract is deployed and audited. Once deployed though, it will not be altered one bit. We have planned the development of URAllowance in three phases. Phase 1:, The Web APP and the base layer of which the other two are built on vertically. The first phase is nearing an alpha release and that would be what our softcap was based on. The other two phases will be funded either from the main round of the ICO or from revenue URAlllowance will be bringing in from the Premium memberships. Obviously the former would be preferred over the latter because it would be faster. So to answer your question, the project is already being realized.

Let's Say, for instance, a parent that has never used crypto hears about our app from their kids who heard about it from a famous YouTuber. Then they decide to try it out. We will offer them a way to buy tokens that are pre-loaded onto a digital or physical gift card. At this point, to them, we are offering just another in-app token with a funny name. Then they get more accustomed to using URAllowance and then.... B A M!!! They are now crypto users and they love it.

We are heavily marketing the parents:kids side of URAllowance currently. But, as you said, Our platform will be usable in other areas as well. One that we often talk about here at the office is ""Per-Diem"". For those of you not familiar with the term, per-diem means ""per day"" and is an allowance given to employees for every day that they have been traveling for work. It's common in the construction industry. Also, the Family-Smart Contract and the app (We finally see an alpha tomorrow) is just the foundation on which many levels of URAllowance is built and will tier upwards in features, price, monetization opportunities, and technological innovation.

We are making our rounds around the world with our reps presenting and pitching us at different venues across the globe. John McAfee gave us a door or at the blockchain conference in Dallas this week. Michel Louie introduced URAllowance to many big names of the crypto world at Anarchapulco this weekend. March 31 it's a blockchain and charity event in St. Petersburg sponsored by bankex, ICOBench and Eberhard Lindfordt. Misha Trubkin will be presenting us there. Lots more to come, including the official Ann Thread.  Actually, i don't like McAfee (probably he wants that most people don't like him) but having him in a very early stage has very good perks.  Joining a conference and a charity event which sponsored by big guns is very important also i like your project from day one, it can make parents life way easier.  By the way, when will pre-ico happen? And will you open a whitelisting?  These are good questions. I will start by saying when dealing with eccentric rich guys, I think they are largely disliked and most prefer it that way. Probably some kind of defense mechanism to protect their money. You don't have to like someone or even agree with their values or personal life decisions to be useful to each other on a business level.  The charity event will be great. It will also be televised and recorded in English. http://digitalexperts.tv/blago.html there is the link. you'll find us in the program on the first page.  The pre-ico, for those that have been following, has been changed from having a starting date to TBA status. This is good in a way because if we would have launched unprepared, it would have killed our company before it started. I know we made the right choice in postponing because I've been busy working 18 hours every day and the team is just as productive. We are laying the foundation for URAllowance to be built on and we are forming the right partnerships at every turn.  Note: If there is anyone that can't wait to be involved in the URAllowance project. Anyone that sees we are destined for success. We have opened a private pre-sale with very special conditions. You can fill out the contact form on the website www.URAllowance.com or you can contact me directly.  Thank You.

This is an exciting concept ensuring the future of the crypto world by creating a blockchain that directs its footprints. I wish you all the best in this novel concept alphabetized right from a meaningful and captivating title.  Wow, thank you for the kind words. I read them before but as I was scanning back through the first page I saw them again and wanted to say thanks. So far the general consensus from multiple communities, crypto, and non-crypto, is optimistic with a very excited overtone. We welcome all feedback and/or criticism. For those of you first seeing this thread, we have been conducting every part of our ICO under the watchful eye of the public. We don't like keywords and clickbait, it's just our rebellious nature, but here are a few unavoidable KYs for you. This document is a work in progress and over the course of our business development many changes will be made. Parts of this document will be removed and parts will be added. In the spirit of blockchain and transparency, we have been writing our whitepaper In a live document under the welcomed scrutiny of the community. To avoid any confusion that this method will undoubtedly cause, we have Included a version history of all changes made to this document starting from the completion of the very first draft. Yes. I copied that from our whitepaper. That's ok because I wrote them and I'm in a hurry. I have to get back to helping our team create something amazing.

The majority of our team lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, including myself. Weare grateful for Mikhail Trubkin for all that he has done for us. He started as an advisor to our ICO, I asked him to join the team today as a core member. He has shown great skill and dedication at every turn. He knows the importance of what we are doing and I think he will become an official team member. Our other advisors are all equally awesome but they are also running their own companies. Speaking on behalf of The URAllowance Team to our board of advisors, we are eternally grateful for the help you have given and could not have gained the forward momentum that we have right now without you.

After this meeting, we will have a definitive Road map and will launch our Pre-ICO, Pre-sale Announcement  So we had an interesting meeting this morning with our prospective developer. After a short but very productive Q&A session, we now have a list of better-defined goals and tasks that will get this alpha platform built, tried, and tested by you, the community. Upon release of the alpha version of our platform, then and only then, will we be ready to launch. We are ahead of schedule too.  Side note: If there is anything you would like to see present in the alpha, please let us know. We have plenty of time to take in your notes and suggestions and have them implemented into the build. Also, if you feel you have something unique or resourceful and want to contribute to the team, let us know. We may need you and not even know it yet. Thanks to the crypto community and your continued support of our project.   Quote from: TunerDude007 on January 25, 2018, 06:23:50 PM This is without a doubt an extremely exciting project.

Will look deeper into this project, because my daughter also slowly becomes interested in crypto, only because of my stories on the dinner table. Often we forget to think of our children, but they will definitely have to handle with crypto. The internet with all its dangers (aggressive porn, trojans, data collectors) came very fast and overran older and younger people. They are often the victims of cybercrime. So a basic knowledge will be the shield we can give our children to protect themself, thanks that you created this one.",False
