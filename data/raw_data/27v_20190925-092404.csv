From earning rewards to mediating reviews. We bridge the gap between customers, businesses, and the review platform they trust.  Instead of an ICO, 27v will be conducting a preferred share sale. Typically for a token to hold value in a traditional ICO the company must first successfully execute their business model, and second, even if a company is successful market volatility can still render a token’s value obsolete due to factors completely outside and investors control. 27v wants to change the way token sales work and give investors an actual piece of the company. With 27v’s redeemable preferred share program, the shares feature some unique qualities that benefit the investor as actual owners in the company. 27v offers a buyback program that allows for a shorter term, 3x return on their investment once the platform is rolled out. This keeps the investment between the investor and the company and leaves out some of the guesswork that exists with exchange traded mechanism.  The 27v Platform  When a user opens the 27v app or goes on the 27v website to review a restaurant, the app will match their location to the geo-fenced area with the restaurant they are seeking to review. The user can then rate their experience at the applicable restaurant with our simple five-star rating system, which will also include a short text box allowing them to further explain the review, leave recommended dishes, or describe their experience with the restaurant. In return, participating users will receive a token for their review. Users will then be able to visit participating restaurants and redeem their 27v tokens for free offered menu items.  https://i.imgur.com/GwfnOqj.png?2https://i.imgur.com/67kFliQ.png?1https://i.imgur.com/VbU2zjP.png?1  Preferred Stock Sale Timeline Date: Event: May 7, 2018 (“Commencement Date”) We will begin accepting information and documents to verify status to participate in the offering and subscription documents and subscription offers from interested investors. Once submitted, subscription offers are irrevocable and may be accepted or rejected in our sole discretion. July 6, 2018, 11:59 pm (EST) (“Offer Period Expiration”) By this time, all subscription offers must be received. July 13, 2018, 10:00 am (EST) (“Acceptance Date”) By this time, we will identify up to the highest 1,950 subscription offers and notify applicable investors. We will also not accept offers from more than 450 investors who are not “accredited investors,” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D. July 17, 2018, 11:59 pm (EST) (“Payment Deadline”) By this time, investors whose subscription offers are accepted must transfer the aggregate Purchase Price for the Shares. July 18, 2018, 10 am (EST) (“Closing Date”) The Shares will be issued by entry in the stock ledger for the Shares, which will be maintained by, or on behalf of, 27v. We currently intend to send a notice to all investors after the Closing Date identifying the total number of Shares sold.

To participate in the share sale is very similar to ICOs but rather than being issued a token you will be issued a share that hold similar characteristics to owning equity in the company. As we know, a token's value can fluctuate or lose its value entirely due to factors outside our control (government regulations, forks, etc.), but with shares they offer a 3x return protected by equity characteristics. We just uploaded a video to our website that it explains this into greater detail.  https://sale.27v.io  Please feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions!",False

If you know a little bit about tZERO they are launching a distributed ledger platform for capital markets. They ran their own very successful ICO last year. She has been a huge asset to our platform, and she will continue to advise us going forward.   Aside from that, we have accumulated many contacts in the software engineering space here in Silicon Slopes, Utah. We have 2 - 4 senior level software engineers, 1 - 2 project managers, 1 - 3 UI/UX Managers, 2 quality assurance professionals, 1 database architect, and many others ready to start as soon as we close this share sale. All of these people are the best of the best. I've worked and consulted for 5 companies in the past 5 years. That's a lot of people to know, a lot of engineering teams to grow close with, a lot of smart people to become acquainted with.

To clarify what the reviews will be used for, it's pretty straight forward. The data will be used to give other users insight to other good places to eat knowing that each review that is posted possesses a high level of quality and integrity. Since a user can almost be guaranteed that the review left for a company is legitimate and that both positive reviews and negative reviews have the same equal incentive, the overall ""score"" of the restaurant will be trustworthy. In a less perfect system, it's possible for a restaurant to tamper with their rating using review bots, unfair incentives, and even intimidation to suppress negative reviews and boost positive ones. Our platform levels the playing field for everyone involved. Users have a voice. They are rewarded for their work in leaving reviews. Restaurants get customers.   The application is in very early alpha, we have a prototype built, but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. The platform is built on Stellar, and we will be using blockchain to facilitate all the accounting with the tokens. We need a lot of pieces to fall into place before we launch, and we estimate approximately 6 to 12 months for a beta to full rollout.",False

It really covers a lot of bases. The process of mining tokens and earning free food is as follows: A 27v customer eats at a new restaurant. They enjoy the restaurant or dislike it. They leave a review on 27v talking about the food they ate and their experience. That review must pass an automated integrity check in order to be submitted to the blockchain. Once submitted, a token will be mined for the user and they will earn that mined token.
