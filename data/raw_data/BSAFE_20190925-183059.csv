After watching the demo for CryptoDefender in addition to watching the interview describe what it does and what it prevents, I am convinced it will work for me and for many other people.  For my cryptocurrency wallet I use and prefer the software wallet Trust Wallet.  I store my credentials offline as well but I like how I just click the app and can see my balance, then transfer coins as need be.  Usually my transactions have consisted of browsing online and finding ERC20 tokens that I want to invest from 0-.5 ETH in.  At that point that I am ready to send ETH either simply zero for a self drop or up to .5 if a token has a dividend or revenue share feature that I like.  However when I send the Ethereum to the token’s contract address I don’t do much, if anything, to verify that the address I pasted in to the send ETH box on Trust Wallet is the same one that was given to me to do so.  It is inconvenient and time consuming to do so and essentially I just want to check that the gas fee is low then refresh and see my new ERC 20 tokens.   For this reason CryptoDefender will work for me and I am convinced many others use their wallets in this fashion as well.  I also predict a great need for ExchangeDefender and BlockchainDefender as well.  All the best in the journey, I definitely want to participate!",False

Hello Mt. Dempo  That's correct. We certainly aim to do something that helps people instead of filling our OWN pockets. We understand it well that majority of the stuff available are trying to be QUICK hits, and therefore are struggling. So, we want to be something that's worthy to do with the CONTENT ALONE instead of showoff. And we can proudly say, so far we have managed that rather nicely and will continue working on it!
