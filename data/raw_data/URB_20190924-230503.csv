Business world is an ever-changing enterprise from the eyes of entrepreneurs, companies and merchants in general. But seeing the whole picture now, it is evident how much has changed in the world of finances, especially in terms of how we consume and produce. From the very first moment currencies where born, buying and selling became an affordable way of obtaining specific objects in a transparent, profitable way. Things worked out smoothly and the market expanded in return.  Logically, along with expansion came demand: we started owning more and more, and as things started to pile up, we thought it was clever to stack them inside a safe physical space for protection and started using words such as “property” and “building”: Immovable property exchange as a business.  That is Real Estate in a nutshell: A functional model that turned companies, investors and many individuals to market players in the business of property. So why change now? Is it not good enough the way it is? The answer is quite simple: The bigger the business is, the more complex and less transparent it becomes.  In the modern world where information is at hand, it would seem easier and almost a no-brainer to get into Real Estate. You need to know the basics of property, investment rates and ownership, all provided by online research. But as you progress, things start to complicate exponentially.  Most investors today are blown away by the amount of inconsistencies around Real Estate. Information gets trickier and even false as you progress. Perhaps you entered a blog post that suggested trying a certain course of action, and then finding out it was the other way around. It is a mess indeed.  This is where Urbit Data kicks in with one of the most innovative projects Real Estate has ever had in decades: Blockchain technology, the dawn of a new way to comprehend and access to Real Estate business.  So,where is Urbit Data trying to get with Real Estate through Blockchain? Imagine a big hub with chunks of transparent, safe and valuable information in the palm of your hand. An open source ecosystem filled with all you’ll ever need to become a player without the scams, expensive intermediaries and unnecessary clickbaits without any meaningful piece of content.  This open source allows researchers to earn income if they collaborate with useful pieces of data and high-quality services for any potential costumer in the blockchain. On the other hand, investors and companies of Real Estate will see profit from that information by paying affordable fees in the form of Urbit Data’s cryptocurrency.  As you can see, Real Estate old ways aren’t entirely a failure, they just needed some polish and adjustments to transform into something new. At the end, this whole enterprise will be comprised of people like you, whether you are a starting entrepreneur in business of Real Estate or you’ve sailed many times in the vast business of property, you’ll find a tailored spot to grow with Urbit Data.

The reasons for the deficiency in transparency could be:    No standard regulations and requirements (compared to equities and bonds for example). Very low trading frequency due to high transaction costs (10 - 20%) and to high prices in the assets. Unstandardized valuation of properties.    And excessive steps in the bureaucratic processes.    One of the biggest problems of real estate business is the amount of information shown in many scattered online platforms. For example, if you are living in San Diego (USA) and you are looking for a property in South Africa, the search process could be complex to do by reason of: Low knowledge about how that market works; difficulties evaluating the quality of the information; mistrust with the prices founded, differences between currencies used for rental, buy or sale; variabilities in the process how to get it. This situation generates a limited agility, because research needs to offer a global vision, especially at the international level.    In the other hand, it is detected several problems related with the real estate market as that continues to be managed in an outdated manner, such as: separate listing services result in inefficient searches, large volume of offline processes using a lot of paperwork, complexity to deal with verification of the contracts and documentations.    As result of that Urbit Data will offer you a complete ecosystem solution which includes all the parts, not contemplated so far, that need to be improved and updated now. In the image below, we explain all the processes of Urbit Data:   After reading different Urbit Data's solutions you could see some of this advantages to this revolutionary project: - Improve the access to search information of the properties around the world, all in the same platform. - Implement a smart contract to managed with more transparent and efficient way the purchases, rentals and sales.   - Include the price valuation tool which offers a more real and equitable price through comparison of several real estate data sources. - Increase speed, efficiency, and reliability avoiding the unnecessary paperwork. - Reduction of transaction time, making them cheaper and safer. - Incorporation of the Big Data software downloadable that feeds the Urbit Data database for the properties listed. - Reward with Urbit Data Coins to the users who contribute with quality information.    Beyond other real estate solutions, Urbit Data can offer advantages that would help to transform this industry which it will allow users to experiment the benefits offered.    Finally, public ledger distributed provides trust, even more when the access is universal to anyone from anywhere. So, Urbit Data offer will provide the basis for all information related to real estate objects around the world.  The kind of information stored in the public blockchain can be for example: - Property information (address, size, rooms, cadastral code, GPS location…) - Owner (address of the property owner). - Price evaluations of professional appraisers or banks. - Evaluations of tenants. - Transactions (short- or long-term rental, sale, usage as collateral…)    As you can see, Urbit Data will bring you a lot benefits and solutions that conventional real estate transaction don’t have, because of their antiquated methods.

Experts from Forbes state that the integration of blockchain is occurring virtually in every industry. They said this new technology offers the ability to see real-time cryptocurrency transactions in a digital ledger managed by a network. According to Blockgeeks, the benefits of blockchain are vast as it gives consumers a look at information that is accurate, easily verifiable and public.     On the other hand, the firm Deloitte ensures that blockchain has many opportunities and challenges. Experts highlight six use cases for improving purchase, sale and rent process through blockchain: - Improve property search process. - Expedite pre-lease due diligence. - Ease leasing and subsequent property and cash flow management. - Enable smarter decision-making. - Transparent and relatively cheaper property title management. - Enable more efficient processing of financing and payments.     For this and other reasons Urbit Data proposes to the real estate market a platform that combines the use of the blockchain with transactions related with purchase, sale and rental of properties, vacational rentals and valuation of properties. Urbit Data trusts with any doubt in blockchain since it’s a great technology to work, considering that is for sure a fast, safe and easier method to make a transaction in the real estate.     But the team of Urbit Data are not the only ones who see the potential of the blockchain in real estate. Specialists of Masion Global support this technology since they are aware of how complicated it can be to buy a property using the traditional method. Mr. Tickner who is the founder of Headland Holdings and Street said he started the company three years ago when he went through the slow and tortuous process of purchasing a Manhattan co-op. For him, the stress points came down to disclosing all his personal information to the broker, which was then photocopied 10 times and given to a building manager and photocopied some more and given to the board. He knew that the blockchain could speed things up and better and protect buyers’ anonymity.     In a Coindesk article an agency said about blockchain: “The technology will allow investors residing in Dubai and around the world to verify property data that is backed by timestamp signatures, enhancing the accuracy of data, the credibility of investment transactions and the transparency and clarity of the market”.     They also expressed that the use of this technology will allow tenants “to make payments electronically without the need to write checks or print any paper… within a few minutes at any time and from anywhere in the world”. Finally, in Newsweek, they tell about the experience of buying and selling an apartment with this technology. It was in Ukraine and it has become the first-ever property to be bought and sold using blockchain, potentially heralding a new era of transparent and efficient real estate transactions. Ukrainian developer Mark Ginsburg sold the Kiev property to Michael Arrington, co-founder of the tech news site TechCrunch, for $60,000 via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Blockchain, an online ledger first developed as the core technology behind the virtual currency bitcoin, makes transactions more transparent while improving the process of eliminating paper contracts and costly lawyer fees.     Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin recently told The International Business Times about the benefits of this new type of network infrastructure. Using blockchain technology, he said, transactions are safer, more secure and bypass fee-collecting gatekeepers. “There won’t be a single powerful entity that controls the system or controls gatekeeping into the system,” Lubin said.     After knowing all the positives reviews about blockchain technology in real estate market it is almost impossible to avoid a platform like Urbit Data, which is a revolutionary way to make business, forget about wasting your time making hard transactions and open the door to the future of real estate services.

Its goal is to create a platform that allows a clear and transparent online process for the valuation, purchase, sale and rental of properties. In order to achieve this, Urbit Data has created a client section that will consist of a set of desktop and mobile applications that will make easier the interaction of the platform. All applications will have a free version created for individual customers and a business version designed to banks, real estate companies and franchises.    The client section components have 3 principal functions: Act as a participant to verify and sign transactions within the blockchain, collect the information needed to feed the big data warehouse and provide final users with ways to interact with the services offered by the Urbit Data platform. Each of these functions will be implemented as a separate application but will be integrated in order to work as a real estate suite where information can be exchanged.  Urbit Data Finder The Urbit Data Finder will be the main application for data collection. The actions or resources that users contribute from this application will be based on a rewards system in URB Coins depending on the activity that each user performs.  Urbit Data Finder Free Urbit Data Finder Free is for individuals to access data and to participate in the construction and maintenance of blockchain and Big Data.  Urbit Data Finder for Business It is designed for companies or organizations involved in the real estate sector that can provide large amounts of valid data to the platform. It has the same goal as the free version, but it has much more sophisticated data integration and data validation tools.  Urbit Data Value It will allow users to take advantage of all the information available in the blockchain and the warehouse in order to generate precise valuations of their properties, both at a private level or at a business level.  Urbit Data Value Free Urbit Data Value Free will allow users to make property valuations and reports for free with the only limitation that they will only be able to generate a maximum of 10 reports monthly.  Urbit Data Value Enterprise The business version of Urbit Data Value is aimed at companies or organizations and the use of services will be valued in URB Coins.  Urbit Data Connect This will be a web application whose objective is to allow users to make sales, purchase or rental operations without the need for intermediaries for the negotiation process and is supported by the Urbit Data Value tools so that the parties can choose the best option.  Urbit Data Connect Free It will be a web application connected to the Urbit Data Service Gateway. This version offers users the following options: property publications, real estate search, purchase/sale and real estate rental.  Urbit Data Connect Enterprise Directed to companies in the real estate sector, the business version will allow its users to perform the operations of the extended personal version in order to manage many properties simultaneously.  Urbit Data Owner It consists of a registration and management platform for property titles in the blockchain, which will verify the ownership of a property and connect with other identity services to authenticate the owners.  The Urbit Data Wallet It is a standard Ethereum wallet for storing ERC20 URB coins. In the case that the Ethereum blockchain scaling issues are not resolved and a separate blockchain has to be used, this wallet would be implemented independently.

In today’s post you will find out how easy it is to get into it through Urbit Data’s ecosystem.    Real Estate is technically everywhere, whether you’re on the college’s campus or the neighborhood, you will find a potential property that might (or not) catch your attention. Unfortunately, that’s the moment where things get complicated, as you find out things weren’t as smooth as they looked like.   Experienced investors already know just how complex things can get when dealing with the industry of property, but beyond that, there are many inconsistencies with Real Estate, such as:    The need of intermediaries. Trusting your assets to a third-party individual is perhaps one of the main issues Real Estate has today. Done wrong, you'll end up losing more than you’ve actually earned. But even if you manage to find a trustworthy prospect, it is very likely to come with high prices.    Inconsistent regulatory requirements. Another big trouble about Real Estate is the lack of consistent information out there, due to the different requirements of each zone. This leads to confusion about what is standard and what is not.    Low trading frequency due to high costs. Due to high costs for each transaction, Real Estate often dissuades newcomers to try get into it. Property is a powerful asset, but intermediaries and extra fees can be too much for an investor’s wallet.    Lack of transparency. When dealing with business that require third-parties, there’s room for fraud. Information can be altered, fees increased to ensure and the list just goes on. Furthermore, investors are forced to pay higher fees just to ensure their procedures carry out transparently.    Seeing the big picture, it is evident that Real Estate needs a tool to turn things around and get back on track. Luckily, Urbit Data comes along with an innovative solution to all these issues.    With the addition of Blockchain in the process, things escalate to a whole different level in terms of transparency, agility, costs and research value.    Blockchain is transparent. Thanks to the qualities of this open source, every aspect of real estate will have a mark of transparency in the process. From research to payments, Blockchain becomes a transparent intermediary of the whole process; involving buying, selling, price valuations and renting.    A valuable ecosystem of data. With the addition of encrypted blocks, information will be verified by a team of professionals in the matter, which further increases the accuracy and credibility of data. Long gone will be those days of messy data spread across the internet.    Profitable and worth. Inside Urbit’s hub, every single asset will have a true value: no more speculation, overpricing and unnecessary intermediaries. It doesn’t matter in which position of Real Estate you are (investor, entrepreneur or researcher), every detail will be covered for you to access.   Fraud-proof. Blockchain proves to be an excellent shield from fraudulent activities, due to the characteristics of each block. Once data is in the Blockchain, it’s almost impossible to modify or tamper it.     Electronic payments are safter. Cryptocurrencies are as safe as they can be, leaving no room for frauds and scams. Their behavior is as strong as a solid, impenetrable brick.    Real Estate is the ultimate choice for those who seek for profit, both in short and long term. With Blockchain as a middleman, there’s no telling how much business will grow. You better start paying attention to what Urbit Data’s about to launch out there; an unique ecosystem aiming for success in the market!

You will not regret using Urbit Data’s platform as soon as you find out how safe and fast it will be to make transactions in the real estate market using blockchain technology. Maybe you are wondering why it is better to invest in a property through Urbit Data platform instead of keeping it in the traditional way. Well, there is more than one reason to try this option:    BLOCKCHAIN! It is the newest technology that presents a great environment to registering transactions. So, you don’t need a third party, like a bank, to be involved in your business because thanks to Urbit Data’s ecosystem, you can do all the negotiation inside the platform. This is the first step to end fraud and corruption in this market. By using blockchain, buyers and sellers are 100% protected, because this is an honest and decentralized way to negotiate your properties.    Urbit Data works like a conventional real estate market but includes other advantages. Doing the transaction with this platform you are going to save a lot of time and paperwork, that’s one of the main differences. Also, you can use a price valuation tool which offers a more real and equitable price in comparison with other real estate data sources.    You can negotiate a property in any country even if you are not there. Nevertheless, this platform protects the owner’s identity in every moment. It is revealed just where both, buyer and seller, make the transaction and this is because there is legal information that needs to be verified in the process.    Your personal information is not mandatory at first, because the property can be published in blockchain, as long as it can be validated in reasonable number of nodes and that is amazing, right? Do you feel like in a dream? Definitely not! Blockchain will be public, the information and transaction about an estate will be available through all the nodes. It is irrelevant where the property is located; it can be in different jurisdictions and still provide you information.    One of the main goals of Urbit Data is to create an ecosystem which provide and manages all the information. So, any person, company or institution that needs to have access to price valuations or is interested in selling, buying or renting could link all this information together through the platform  in order to get transparency, safety and high quality in real estate services.    Something important to know about blockchain is the combination of mechanisms of Proof of State and the Federated Consensus. The first mechanism will be used to validate the transactions in the blockchain. The second mechanism will be a group of nodes publicly reliable; these nodes will be able to sign and validate blocks.

Are you tired of going through long processes of purchasing a property? Well, after you meet Urbit Data, you will be happy and convinced of being one of their users.  Urbit Data is a project born with the idea of improving the real estate market.  In a so competitive market like this, the goal is to leave a trace in the industry introducing a new way of buying, selling and renting a property.  Urbit Data begins with the notion that the real estate market needs more transparency and, therefore, is working hard to build the biggest online service and real estate management platform in the world, betting for this winner idea to be like one of the most successful in the near future due to the use of blockchain technology.  It is well-known that technology is everywhere, and Urbit Data is not the exception. One of its main goals is to offer and manage all the information for any person, company or institution that needs to have access to price valuations, opportunities in selling, buying or renting; and also to link all this information together in order to offer transparent, safe and high quality real estate services with no intermediaries. With blockchain technology, all of this is will be more than possible; it will allow people to obtain as much information as they need of a property.  Due to the complexity of regulatory requirements in relation to the legally binding use of digital signatures in many countries (an area of law which is undergoing rapid change), the Urbit Data project will focus its main efforts in the technology development of price valuation, rent, sale and buying options.  Urbit Data can make your business something efficient, fast and safe; how? It will improve the access to international information about properties around the globe, all in the same platform.

It also increases in speed, efficiency and reliability using the Urbit Data software, avoiding the unnecessary generation of documentation.  2019 will be the year of the Urbit Data project’s internationalization, taking it far beyond Spain’s borders. 2019 is planned to be the year that, with hard work, commercial planning and governmental agreements will be positioned as the platform of reference for the real estate world.

Massive amounts of information and transactions are exchanged among users as you read this, but there’s more to now: the addition of a market of digital assets known as blockchain.     Through blockchain the possibilities are endless. All you need to do is to transform your business by embracing digital assets and cryptocurrencies; there’s no telling how much profit you’ll be earning from just investing.     As a businessman, the best thing to do is invest in the market of your interest. Urbit Data has already an ongoing market project you won’t regret getting into. One of the principal reasons of using the blockchain technology in this organization is because the real estate market lacks both transparency and efficiency, especially compared to publicly traded equities and debt securities. This creates asymmetries in the market and leads to inefficiencies.  Some reasons for the lack in transparency lie in factors like: - There aren’t uniform regulatory requirements (compared to equities and bonds for example). - There is a very low trading frequency due to high transaction costs (10–20%) and to high prices. - There are unstandardized assets (each object has different characteristics). - And excessive bureaucratic processes.     Therefore, due to the fact that market players need transparency, they are willing to pay high fees (10–20%) to real estate agents or intermediaries. These are precisely the reasons that make possible a project like Urbit Data, and thanks to the blockchain the purchasing of properties will be improve and better in a 100%.     Some of the improvements for the real market estate market would be: registration of real estate documentation in the blockchain; improving transparency, speed and security in transactions, making them cheaper and more efficient; reducing risk for investors and users; bringing together all real estate services on a platform that allows the verification of property data, improving the accuracy of the data, the reliability of transactions, and the transparency of the market; enabling electronic payments using cryptocurrency and creating a universal reference system to identify properties.     If you aren’t convinced yet, there is more about Urbit Data and blockchain. This technology provides free, abundant, transparent and safe data. In addition one of the great benefits is fraud avoidance, since the blockchain prevents anyone from going back in time and making records that do not exist.     Once data is stored on the blockchain, there is no practical way to falsify, modify or delete it. Blockchain offers a universal open source protocol for the purchase of property, transfer, registration, custody that can reduce costs, eradicate fraud, accelerate transactions, internationalize all markets and make real estate a liquid asset. Additionally, it reduces costs and time for all market participants because it eliminates the middleman in many situations and also reduces transaction fees.

Are you curious about Urbit Data? Do you want to know everything about this platform? Well, this is the perfect place to do it. Check it out, and discover the advantages of Urbit Data and everything it has for you.     If you are interesting of knowing the concept of Urbit Data, here you will find the essence of this organization. Urbit Data is a global solution applicable to people in any part of the world that engages in the global real estate business, and in consequence takes advantage of the accessibility, reliability and transparency that blockchain technology allows.     What is an organization without technology? Nothing! Actually, the intention of using it is helping to make procedures easier and faster. But, the technology presented in Urbit Data is not intended to completely replace the current processes of the real estate market. Instead, it aims to complement by making them more effective, accessible, transparent and reliable. Urbit Data’s platform will be available for individuals and companies who want to carry out transactions without intermediaries in the real estate market.     It is well-known that the nature of transactions in the real estate world is complicated and it lacks of transparency. This is why the blockchain technology presents an ideal environment to keep track of such transactions. The immutability of data, the security offered by the transparent, decentralized and corruption-resistant environment of a blockchain network will speed up real estate transactions protecting sellers and buyers. One of the more attractive things about Urbit Data is the fact that there is a web application whose objective is to allow users to make sales, purchase or rental operations without the need of intermediaries for the negotiation process and it is supported by the Urbit Data Value tools so that the parties can choose the best option.     Another advantage of Urbit Data is that users can search for a property in order to purchase or rent it in their locality of interest. These properties will be those published by other users or companies. Once the users select a property, they will be able to see the details of the property and the transactions carried out on it, thanks to the blockchain. What is much better is that the user will be able to obtain information of similar properties located in nearby areas.     In addition, a digital currency called Urbit Data coin — or URB coin — will be created, freely interchangeable among all participants. Market participants will either receive rewards in form of coins, if they contribute to the blockchain with data or services or they have to pay fees in form of coins when they take advantage from the ecosystem but don’t contribute. This ensures that all participants have an incentive to use the ecosystem.     These coins can then either be exchanged for fiat currencies, other cryptocurrencies, or used in the same ecosystem.     In the long run, it is believed that the Urbit Data ecosystem will not only improve efficiency and transparency in developed markets but also offer an alternative to do transactions in real estate market, especially in countries where cadasters records are not available or are not reliable.     Finally, another benefit of this platform is the application Urbit Data Finder because the actions or resources that users contribute from this application will be based on a rewards system in URB coins depending on the activity that each user performs. For instance, the information used for the valuations will be obtained from the data the Urbit Data Finder clients provide which makes it safer; this information will be stored in the blockchain or in the warehouse, depending on if it corresponds to a transaction or is complementary property information.     So, as you can see, making an investment through Urbit Data will be one of the safest ways of negotiation, because you will always be informed of each step during the process.

The issue is that traditional real estate is unreliable at some point and is characterized for being slow in the process of the negotiation. Most of the time requires much paperwork, therefore people opt to pay more than they need just to try to speed up the process.     For these and other reasons, Urbit Data offers the solution to avoid fraud during the purchase of a property. This is accomplished thanks to the blockchain technology that, according to many authors, is the solution for real estate.     The blockchain is a database validated by a community instead of a central authority. The responsibility does not relay on one single person or entity, like a bank or government; because a lot of people are in charge instead. Obviously, a paper database could never be managed by thousands of peers; this is where computers and internet come in.     Urbit Data trusts this technology blindly because it guarantees that not just one person has the total control over any data which is very important because thanks to blockchain it is possible to verify everything that has happened in the chain prior, nobody can go back and change the information that was already given. It means that all the information is protected.     Urbit Data warranties that you won’t need a third part to make a transaction because with blockchain it is possible to make a transaction in a safer way without intermediaries or opportunists.     Ian Kan, Forbes contributor and Featured Technology Futurist on CNN, refers to blockchain as a mechanism to bring everyone to the highest degree of accountability. He believes that it is going to avoid missed transactions, human or machine errors, or even an exchange that was not done with the consent of the parties involved. He also believes that blockchain helps to guarantee the validity of a transaction by recording it, not only on a main register but a connected distributed system of registers, all of which are connected through a secure validation mechanism.     Urbit Data proposes a whole different experience when making transactions in the real estate; this is thanks to the blockchain which offers a universal open source protocol for the purchase of property that can reduce costs, eradicate fraud, accelerate transactions and internationalize all markets. Additionally, it reduces costs and time for all market participants because it eliminates the middleman in many situations and reduces transaction fees.     The main improvements for the real estate market thanks to the introduction of blockchain can be summarized to: the increase in speed and reliability in the search mechanisms for real estate assets, the easiness of use for property sale and rentals throughout the whole process and a much more efficient payment system.     Having said all this, with Urbit Data it is possible to imagine a great revolution in the future of real estate, as it will provide more facilities than any other platform.

The Urbit Data blockchain proposal is based on real properties. Each property will be represented by a unique identifier and on this ""address"" a series of documents will be associated, data and smart contracts that represent the transactions on the property. The blocks of the network will be formed by the transactions made from the moment the property enters the network and is validated until it ceases to exist.      In Forbes magazine you can find an excellent review about the blockchain model used by Urbit Data. The combination of a platform like Urbit Data and the blockchain technology is simply amazing, working together in order to give an excellent option to people who want to make a transaction related to real estate.      Therefore, Forbes magazine brings the opinion of its experts, about this new technology and encourages people to try a new way of purchasing a property. The specialist state that the integration of blockchain occurs virtually in every industry as well as new technology that offers the ability to see real-time cryptocurrency transactions in a digital ledger that is managed by the network.        Seven members of Forbes Real Estate Council share their opinion about what they think are the biggest roadblocks to bringing blockchain to the real estate industry and what the professionals in the industry can do to help push it forward.     One of them is Larry Solomon; he talks about the issues with escrow services and the title registration, two natural areas where blockchain can add value. He believes that, in both areas, some combination of advocacy groups along with government intervention could make progress.      Michael Sroka states that is not only to try a tech because it is the coolest, but because it is the best software; he thinks that blockchain will be one of many things in the real estate tool belt that will make a huge difference.     More reasons to use blockchain technology? Well, Mark Bloom is devotee that people need to be educated about certain topics such as the criptocurrency to understand a technology like blockchain and how it can help the real estate industry. Another real estate council, Chris Ryan predicts that this style of investing is going to be the biggest game changer the real estate market has ever seen.     Colin Bogar talks about some issues that can be avoided by using blockchain: vested interests, equally affecting brokerages and multiple listing services. While Kevin Hawkins talks about the typically largest, legally complex and potentially riskiest transaction that needs intermediaries who make a negotiation that is, at some point, unreliable. This is definitely something than can be left behind using Urbit Data. Finally, Engelo Rumora supports the idea to leave behind the traditional and outdated way that the conventional real estate has, and he encourages leaders on the real estate field to open their minds to technology.     It is not a coincidence that Urbit Data founders have chosen to work with the blockchain technology; a platform that gather the principal needs of its participants. Experts in the real estate world support it and see it as a big success for this market. In addition, Urbit Data has started his launch having a beta version in live, in operation for the Spanish real estate market and the results have been extremely positive; but the main objective is to capitalize the project through an ICO in order to take it to a world scale.     The idea is to convert Urbit Data in a global solution applicable to people in any part of the world that can engage in the global real estate business, and thus take advantage of the accessibility, reliability and transparency that blockchain technology allows. Blockchain provides free, abundant, transparent and safe data.     Using Urbit Data is knowing that you will trust a technology as it is blockchain, which breaks with the typical real estate transactions.

The goal of Urbit Data is to develop a platform with which people can make purchase-sale or rental transactions in a safe and reliable way. However, one of the added values of the project is its property valuation tool called Urbit Data Value.     Urbit Data Value will allow users to take advantage of all the information available in the blockchain and the warehouse to generate precise valuations of properties, both at a private level or at a business level. These valuations are intended to be precise references of the value of a property in a specific area.     There is a beta version for the property valuation which offers a public real estate data from various real estate portals, public registries and other sources and combines them intelligently in order to be able to calculate the value of any real estate property in Spain.     If you want to make a valuation in Urbit Data the first thing you need to do is going to the website urbitdata.com, then click on “Values” and type the address of the property in the search bar.     So, you will get immediately access to very specific details regarding the property entered. You’ll receive information such as the postal code, surface, cadastral reference, year of construction and even a map with the exact location of the property will show. Other important information is shown like the evolution of the pricing for rental and for purchasing, and the different pricing references within the market for other addresses for rental and sale.     You will also be able to download a complete report with the full information about the property you were looking for. This report contains more details about the maximum and minimum pricing for sale and rent.     Something great about it is that it’s possible to find the points of interests nearby such as universities, schools, restaurants, parks, banks and hospitals. The report indicates the methodology used by Urbit Data to get access to all this information.     The already processed information is stored in the blockchain or in the warehouse, depending on if it corresponds to a transaction or is complementary property information. When a client requests a valuation, the application communicates with Urbit Data Service Gateway and serves the appropriate data depending on the location of the property that needs to be valued.  To estimate the value of the property the main source of information is the blockchain and it is classified as follows: -  Witness: Each Witness corresponds to a property located geographically in the same area and shares similar attributes with the property to be valued. These properties provide the base prices used for valuation. These witnesses have a responsibility based on the transactions carried out on them and the time they are available in the market. This is because the less time they are available for sale or rent, the more accurate is the price. -  Additional information: The value of each property depends on multiple things, such as construction details, availability of services in the area, available amenities and any other information that can be quantified and have an impact on the price of it. -  The qualitative information available, like quality of materials or amenities is also important for the valuation of the property and will be taken into account (if applicable).     If you want to get more information about the project, please visit urbitdata.io and download the Technical White Paper. The Urbit Data’s website offers a demonstration video of the beta version.

This idea was born in March 2017; it means that it’s really new. Even so, it has been growing very fast.     Urbit Data is born out of the real estate sector’s need to offer the users the opportunity to make correct decisions when selling, buying, and renting (either for a short or a long period of time) and evaluating a property. The main idea is globalizing and decentralizing transactions through intelligent peer to peer contracts, as well as obtaining real data and real time valuations from any part of the world. Now, let’s talk about the mission and vision in order to get more involved to this revolutionary project.     Urbit Data’s mission is to create transparency and efficiency in the real estate market. As of today, Urbit Data has already a product which offers ad-hoc evaluation of any real estate object in the Spanish market. They developed a powerful data collection engine which gathers information from various publicly available data sources and combines them intelligently in order to be able to calculate the value of any real estate property in Spain.     Urbit Data’s vision is to create an ecosystem which offers and manages all the information to which any person, company or institution needs to have access to (price valuations, interests in selling, buying or renting) and also to link all this information together in order to offer transparent, safe and high quality real estate services with no intermediaries.       Real Estate market needs more transparency therefore Urbit Data works hard to build the biggest online service and real estate management platform in the world. On April 2017 the Urbit Data team starts with an analysis of the market, the structure of all the work team, and with the development of the beta version in Spanish market.     Later, on May 2017 it initiates the definition and starts the operations, smart contracts begin to be created and also start the first definitions of programming and blockchain. At this stage it is also created the definition of strategies and processes.     By November 2017, the team made some programming adjustments and systems improvements. They success in the completion of the firsts tests of beta version and begin with the viability analysis for big data at a global level, structuring phases of the project to go on market through a token system.     In the second trimester of 2018 Urbit Data is going to launch the private pre-sale and the public sale. In the third trimester Urbit Data will be listed in several exchanges and the development of the platform will begin. Finally, in the fourth trimester 2018 will initiate several processes such as the design of the Urbit Data blockchain, the structure of global Big Data, the test with the new platform and the development of reward system.     Regarding the second and third trimester 2019, the goals of Urbit Data are to start commercial planning and expansion, the reward system deployed, starting operations in Moscow and San Francisco and the creation of the Urbit Data Foundation.     This is the way how Urbit Data is projected as one of the most successful platform in the real estate that enables the assessment of real estate, rents, sales, holiday rentals, all using blockchain technology offering transparent and secure transactions.

Urbit Data will offer to its users the possibility of making business in a secure, easier and faster way changing the whole concept of the conventional real estate transactions.     This is how Urbit Data platform will work: In order to purchase or sale, when the user is interested in a property, he/she opens a negotiation channel with the person who made the publication. This channel will transparently offer the Urbit Data Value analysis tools so that both parts can reach a price agreement.     Another benefit about Urbit Data is the application Urbit Data Owner where users can verify the identity of those involved in the transaction, as well as the ownership of the property and its purchase/sale history. The platform can offer advice of business users who can support each of the parts in the decision process and in the legal process of the purchase according to the legislation that applies to the property: this advice will be paid in Urbit Data Coins (URB).     Once the price has been agreed, a double verification process is executed to complete the purchase process by both parties. This process takes place with or without the assistance of the advisor. Urbit Data tools will have documentation of the legal processes of the countries in which it is implemented. The verification process is executed as follows: By accepting the offer, the buyer must send the amount in URB to an Urbit Data escrow service that is in charge of maintaining the funds while the legal operation is being executed. This transaction is written into the blockchain as an operation in process.     Once the amount is verified by the escrow service, the seller of the property is notified that the payment is in the platform and the vendor verifies the payment and initiates the legal process.     Once the legal process is completed, the seller and buyer confirm the transaction and the funds are transferred from the escrow service to the seller.     If the seller or the buyer fails to confirm the operation, a dispute phase begins for the property. This dispute is resolved by users of the Urbit Data Finder network who are in the locality of origin of the dispute and rewarded in URB coins for participating. The dispute system will use a Proof of Stake mechanism where the ""Judges"" will ""pay"" URB coins to resolve a dispute; if the dispute is successfully resolved they will receive their coins plus a reward, therefore, everybody wins!     All transactions, including all disputes, are stored in the blockchain and may be viewed in future consultations of the property. Purchase and sale transactions generate commissions for the use of the escrow and the transaction in URB coins. Selling and purchasing using Urbit Data is to think wisely, it will be a way of avoiding all the paperwork, corrupting, and bad experiences.

Using the Urbit Data Owner platform, users can verify the identity of those involved in the transaction, as well as the ownership of the property and its purchase/sale history.  The platform can offer advice of business users who can support each of the parties in the decision process and in the legal process of the purchase according to the legislation that applies to the property: this advice will be paid in URB coins.

Unfortunately, when it comes to make a choice it is so difficult because of the amount of real estate information shown in many scattered online platforms. This situation generates a lack of agility when inquiries need to offer a global vision, especially at the international level.      The process of buying, selling or renting a property then becomes complicated not only by this reason but by other difficulties such as there are no uniform regulatory requirements, a very low trading frequency due to high transaction costs, unstandardized assets (each object has different characteristics) and excessive bureaucratic processes.      Here is the right moment to open your mind. Forget about what makes you hesitate about transactions in the real estate market and let’s explain how this new project called Urbit Data can help you.      Urbit Data will take out all the stress that buying or selling a property may cause you. This is the way to break the paradigms of the real estate market, because it will change the people concepts about real estates. How does it make it? Accelerating the sharing of data and real estate records worldwide, using the most transparent, robust, secure, economic and scalable technology as blockchain.      The platform will allow you to buy a property in a safer and faster way with blockchain technology. It will disrupt monopolies held by present market leaders. The technology presented in Urbit Data is not intended to replace the current processes of the real estate market. Instead, it aims to complement by making it more effective, accessible and reliable.      The vision of this project is to reduce the existing problems within the conventional real estates. Some of these problems are: the high fees which increase the price of the property; the lack of communication between the real estate agent with the buyer or seller; the lack of information regarding the property; illegal deeds; slowness in the process, fraud, errors in the public record, unknown liens, and forgery among others.      Another disadvantage is that traditional real estate agencies tend to support more the seller than the buyer which represents an inconvenience for potential clients. In Urbit Data it is not necessary taking any sides. In addition, it is also really difficult to buy a property in another country because of the lack of information people need to do it, and the legal area.      In Urbit Data, people will find real estate information that will increase transparency and efficiency greatly in transactions. Some of the improvements that will obtain are: - Registration of real estate documentation in the blockchain. - Improving transparency, speed and security in transactions, making them cheaper and more efficient. - Reducing risk of fraud for investors and users. - Bringing together all real estate services in the same site that allows: The verification of property and improving the accuracy of the data, the reliability of transactions, and the transparency of the market. - Enabling electronic payments using cryptocurrency. - Creating a universal reference system to identify properties using blockchain technology      You will feel free and safe with this project because you will find the complete information of the property you want and make negotiation with just a click.
