Quality of streaming is excellent. But still there is a lot to do to improve and things which are deeply unsatisfying. All women in the mansion seem really to come from the lowest social level. Over tatooed, over-vulgar and all the time dressed (well, partially dressed) like whores, which they resemble in all aspects.

More normally-looking girls and normally dressed girls could add much to the quality of the whole experience.

However unlike so many wannabe projects, Rasputin is an already working project which is seeking to grow even more and it relies on the cash flow of non-crypto people, which in the current market conditions is a good thing.

To answer very quickly: ICO will run for 6 months. Unlike with other ICOs, physical construction will be going on along with ICO, as soon as softcap is met. Rasputin already have a live operation. The token ROC1, can be used to redeem for service worth $120 right now. On the livesite, https://www.rasputinmansion.com/, when purchasing camera access, you'll see ROC1 token as a method of payment. At the conclusion of ICO, every holder of ROC1 will receive a 1:1 air drop of ROC2. Not sure about bounty. Ask admin in one of their channels?  The following is a longer, more wordy explanation I have given before to similar questions:  While the current ICO is going on, ROC1 will still operate as normal, by providing a quarterly dividend and can also be redeemed for camera access on the live site, which worth $120 (otherwise, it's $40 per month, if paid by credit card). The Phase 2 construction will be going on while ICO continues, so by the end of ICO, the new Mansion will be operational. At that time, ROC2 will replace ROC1, to become the token to use to redeem for camera access (and possibly other type of services) that's equivalent to $150. The great news is, at the conclusion of ICO, all ROC1 holders will receive a 1:1 airdrop of ROC2. So no current investor will lose out on anything. What's more, ROC1 token will retain the dividend function indefinitely, covering the revenue from both mansions, and possibly new sites in the future.    Hope the above clarify things for you.

It's a little confusing but I think I can help to explain:  While the current ICO is going on, ROC1 will still operate as normal, by providing a quarterly dividend and can also be redeemed for camera access on the live site, which worth $120 (otherwise, it's $40 per month, if paid by credit card). The Phase 2 construction will be going on while ICO continues, so by the end of ICO, the new Mansion will be operational. At that time, ROC2 will replace ROC1, to become the token to use to redeem for camera access (and possibly other type of services) that's equivalent to $150. The great news is, at the conclusion of ICO, all ROC1 holders will receive a 1:1 airdrop of ROC2. So no current investor will lose out on anything. What's more, ROC1 token will retain the dividend function indefinitely, covering the revenue from both mansions, and possibly new sites in the future.   So as an early investor who currently holds ROC1, at the end of ICO, you'll have two type of tokens (in equal number), with one for receiving dividend, and the other for redeeming services of $150 in value.  Hope that help to clear it up for you! ",False
