About our project  Vreo is developing a unique solution for software developers and brands, which enables the placement of digital billboards (any surface within a game can show banners, posters, videos) within games without interrupting the user experience. Our Plugins thus enable so far untapped potential especially on the PC and console, but also the mobile market. At our marketplace, developers and brands are then matched using programmatic advertising and a parameter based filtering and targeting system. We are working on new ways to finally let gamers participate in the revenue streams as well, as they fuel the whole industry. Last but not least, the current states of both ad measuring and ad payout are slow and inefficient, leading to many problems like ad fraud and financial shortages for developers and advertisers – problems we can now solve with the advent of Blockchain technology.  More basic information regarding Vreo can be found here.   Market overview  The gaming market consists of around 2 billion gamers worldwide that spend over 3 billion hours per week with gaming, which is about double the time spent on watching YouTube videos. The average gamer is between 18 to 49 years old. The gaming industry achieved an annual revenue of around 90 billion dollars in 2016, meaning it has surpassed the film and music industry, while growing by up to double-digit percentages.  In-game advertising is currently used primarily in mobile gaming, where around 100 billion USD were spent in 2016 with the numbers expected to double until 2020. The budget of digital advertising has reached and even surpassed the spending for TV advertising in 2016. Our technology allows us to enable untapped potential by utilizing available, unused space within the software, further increasing the possibilities.   Problems with current Digital / In-game Advertising  Ad fraud is a major problem in the ad serving industry. Up to 12.5 billion USD were lost due to so-called invalid traffic in 2016, with an estimated increase of around 4 billion USD annually, with around 50% of that being attributed to mobile. Ad blockers are also a huge problem for non-embedded ads and account for multi-billion dollar losses each year. Estimates reach numbers as high as 25 billion USD lost per year at 2020, which leads to an intensified search for solutions within the ad industry. A lot of gamers are annoyed with the current state of advertising in games and apps. Most ads are interruptive, often even mandatory to progress within the game, and the user gains no real benefits for being part of the ad chain. Another obstacle for the success of in-game advertising especially on PC and console is the missing possibility of detailed targeting and measuring of in-game ads. It is possible to provide an estimate of players that will probably see the ad before a game is released, but definitive numbers cannot be provided with static in-game advertising, which in turn makes pricing and evaluation of success incredibly difficult.   Our solutions  With the usage of our plugins we provide the opportunity to swap out ads easily and evaluate all interaction of the user with the ad. Our plugins are tethered to the various game engines (an MVP for the Unreal Engine 4 and Unity Engine 3D is available) and thus operate cross-platform, allowing us to open up new markets like PC and console by providing a technology so far missing. For the mobile market, our approach can be used in addition to current advertising formats (as we make use of untapped space) or replace them – it’s the developers choice. An important aspect is currently missing: the participation of those who fuel the whole industry, the gamers themselves. We want to reward the gamers that watch our provided ads with a fraction of the ad income, using self-determined control and digital profiles.  International sales and conversion of all existing currencies is a slow, difficult and expensive process. Blockchain and crypto currencies provide an excellent solution to this, which is of high interest to the tech-affine developers (faster payout, international market and funding opportunities) and advertisers as well (decentralized data storage provides trust and minimizes fraud).  More on our key features and technical solutions can be found in our Whitepaper.   Outlook: software funding  While we focus on our in-game advertising solution at the moment, we know there are more problems in the gaming industry that need to be solved. One of these is games funding, for which we have a solution in mind: Software developers have the opportunity to create a campaign for an ICO on our platform. We will evaluate and filter those campaigns before releasing them to our platform. Developers shall provide an overview of their experience, references and current project they seek funding for as well as their funding goal and form of return value (through in-game currency or revenue shares).   Token  Developers and advertisers need the security to foresee future expenses and income and can therefore not be exposed to the volatility of a token that is traded on secondary markets and potentially does not possess a high liquidity. Therefore, ViewCoin (VIC) will be used as an internal token whose value is pegged to the Euro and other FIAT currencies. VIC cannot be transferred or be exchanged on secondary markets.  MeritCoin (MTC) functions like a voucher, with which utilities to the secondary token are provided. They have a fixed and limited supply. Users of the platform are able to choose between simply converting Euro (or other FIAT) to VIC at a rate of 1 to 0.97 or to make use of the utility tokens as a discount mechanism to eliminate the network fees. A combination of Euro and MTC will allow advertisers and developers to get rid of any deposit or withdrawal fees with what we call Proof-of-Merit. MeritCoins can be seen as a software license that can be used to access a discounted deposit solution along other benefits in the Vreo platform. More information regarding our Token model and economy is provided in the Whitepaper (LINK).   ICO details  The MTC Token Sale will take place in 2 main phases. Vreo will issue in total 700.000.000 MTC Tokens. 450.000.000 MTC Tokens will be issued in the Token Sale (both Pre-Sale and main Token Sale).  Pre-Sale (with a 20% Bonus): End of Q2  Main Sale Start of Q3  As we hold ourselves to the highest legal and compliance standards, we will announce definitive dates once we have received final feedback.  Price per MTC is at $0.05 (equivalent price in Ether will be updated within 24 hours before the Token sale)   Bounty program  You want to contribute? Our bounty program can be found here .

If you are interested in a longer conversation, I'm happy to share more of our views on this topic. For now I will provide a shorter reply:  Last summer, few people in Germany knew about blockchain and crypto currencies. In the last month the public interest has increased, and topics like Bitcoin, blockchain, crypto currencies and ICOs are thematised more and more in the mainstream media, leading to even more exposure. We have seen the formation of many meetups, which have reached triple to quadruple digits of members, leading to conferences about crypto assets and blockchain. Throughout this process, a great community has formed and is evergrowing, which led us to the first announcements of German ICOs. Larger corporations notice ICOs, and especially the technology behind it - blockchain. From a regulatory standpoint, to the best of our knowledge ICOs are seen as both a potential risk and a potential chance, but BaFin has not yet approved or denied a single ICO. Even in the coalition paper of the currently forming government blockchain/crypto is mentioned and a taskforce will start experimenting.",False
