Throughout history, the best motivation has always been money. That is why Paris Climate Agreement commission has revitalized Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs). These are contracts between the government and the owner of a power plant, which provide the owner with constant cash flow for 20 years at a fixed tariff – for 100% of the energy produced. This gives Construction Company unique highyield opportunity to have up to 30% equity-based IRR and low risks of governmental bonds. Using this business model 390 GW were constructed around the world. And they have only one major problem – liquidity.  Solution Our business model is based on the opportunities this market can offer and is split into two parts: SPPs Construction and Energy Marketplace.  The Construction part is very plain. Even though solar is the most accessible and cheapest renewable resource; its minimal reasonable CAPEX is $5 million, which creates barriers to entry for minor investors. We will collect small investments and use them to construct plants for you. Then we will refinance these plants thanks to the difference between the real yield of 30% and the fair capital rate of 10%. After refinancing we will have enough money to build a plant with lager capacity. Doing so constantly, we can exponentially increase our capacity. And this is where the second part of our business model comes into play – the Energy Marketplace.  Marketplace The Energy Marketplace is a space where every SPP owner can put a constructed power plant with constant approved cash flow and issue forward contracts for kWh with a fixed tariff. Hyperion Fund takes a 1% commission of all transactions and reinvests it to construct new plants, which will then also be refinanced. The overall solar market is more than $1 trillion and at least 30% of it needs to be refinanced.  Token Based on this idea we developed a concept of Hyperion Token (HWT), which is tied to overall capacity. At issuance 1 HWT is backed by 1W capacity. As a result of SPPs Construction and Marketplace development in a five-year period our overall capacity may grow up to 5.9GW with 1HWT being backed by up to 38,7W.  At that moment we will start to distribute Hyperion Coins to all our tokenholders. 1 Hyperion Coin is equal to 1 kWh. Token-holders can redeem these Coins to receive energy. If a token holder redeems Hyperion Coins and requests energy that we are unable to deliver, or token holder refused to obtain energy, he or she will receive an assurance payment from the Hyperion Foundation Buyer Assurance Pool for the value of the Hyperion Coins.  We have developed a strong basement on which to build our project: combining advantages of Construction and Marketplace significantly contributes to Hyperion Fund and makes it sustained and fast growing.  Team We have built up a team of world-class professionals who have helped to bring ideas to life: Greg Thain has 20 years of business experience and he is responsible for coordinating investment and working with the banks. Noel Shannon has constructed over 200 MW all around the world and he controls construction part of the project. Igor Akhmerov is responsible for the financial marketplace part. He has constructed more than 500 MW and is a real expert in refinancing Solar plants. Andrey Petrov has is huge business experience and is focused on Government Relations necessary for implementation of our construction projects.   We have spent last year working hard to set up a strong and attractive portfolio. Collecting it we have managed to strike an ideal balance between emerging markets, which provide extremely high returns, and conservative Europe, which provides high and reliable yield.

Without MVP at least project should be related to a company or person that has been working for several years in the same area, not a few months. Glad to know that Hyperion has this kind of people in the team. In addition to that, they have a diversified project portfolio with a significant scale which covers four regions – Europe, Asia, Middle East and Africa. Sounds good.",False
