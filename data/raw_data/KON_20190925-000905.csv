We are on it, with limited funds. As mentioned early on, the timeline shifts according to raised funds (see WP).   As for the coming time: We have aquired customers for paid software development projects. Mostly regular company software. We started it a month ago to earn money, so we can keep going with the platform development. It might not be what we all wanted, but the reality is that we havent raised much money during this crypto-low. the ceo and cto, have invested not only time, but also money. So whatever BS talk there is regarding scam or dead, we wont comment. We also wont delete your comments, simply because you are free to talk your mind.  Btw: We have no comments regarding your trading strategy. Its also not the place here. We have a seperate section in Discord for trading, there you can discuss these matters with other people not part of our team).  Airdrop is distributed as well as the bounty. That part is closed and we wont spend any time further to handle single inquirys.  For the btc bounty we havent found a reliable person to distribute them, since its not relevant for kon token traders, we will wait until we find someone.  Notice that Konios is a real company, which means: We can not reply to your private messages and share individually informations. Even if you have invested, that is not something we are allowed to do. Even worse, it is insider-trading. So please spare us the time with those messages.  If you share what you invested here, that is up to you, but we dont have the time to comment on wether its worth or what you should do or calm down your frustration. That is not why we have this channel. To those who wrote the team is trading: the team tokens are locked for 2 years.  Finally, the recent happenings in the crypto world, especially BSV and nChain: We are leaning towards a switch to them instead of continuing with hyperledger. It has some crucial advantages concerning our platform. Also craig wright made a comment last friday at the summit in london, that pretty much explained Konios and its whitepaper from a year ago. We think that we are on the right track and that the demand is not only here, but will grow with the next wave.  Dont just wait for announcements, DYOR will help to stregthen your knowledge and youll be more sure of your investment by understanding the big picture instead of panic reactions. (This is not a trading or investment advice or in general a call for action, just a general comment on crypto. Dont trade based on our talks, we are simply communicating to share updates. Telegram is our official chat to release first hand information. We may not update other social channels out of capacity reasons).  Thanks for your support. And to the unpatient, thanks for your understanding.""",False

We are on it, with limited funds. As mentioned early on, the timeline shifts according to raised funds (see WP).   As for the coming time: We have aquired customers for paid software development projects. Mostly regular company software. We started it a month ago to earn money, so we can keep going with the platform development. It might not be what we all wanted, but the reality is that we havent raised much money during this crypto-low. the ceo and cto, have invested not only time, but also money. So whatever BS talk there is regarding scam or dead, we wont comment. We also wont delete your comments, simply because you are free to talk your mind.  Btw: We have no comments regarding your trading strategy. Its also not the place here. We have a seperate section in Discord for trading, there you can discuss these matters with other people not part of our team).  Airdrop is distributed as well as the bounty. That part is closed and we wont spend any time further to handle single inquirys.  For the btc bounty we havent found a reliable person to distribute them, since its not relevant for kon token traders, we will wait until we find someone.  Notice that Konios is a real company, which means: We can not reply to your private messages and share individually informations. Even if you have invested, that is not something we are allowed to do. Even worse, it is insider-trading. So please spare us the time with those messages.  If you share what you invested here, that is up to you, but we don't have the time to comment on whether its worth or what you should do or calm down your frustration. That is not why we have this channel. To those who wrote the team is trading: the team tokens are locked for 2 years.  Finally, the recent happenings in the crypto world, especially BSV and nChain: We are leaning towards a switch to them instead of continuing with hyperledger. It has some crucial advantages concerning our platform. Also craig wright made a comment last friday at the summit in london, that pretty much explained Konios and its whitepaper from a year ago. We think that we are on the right track and that the demand is not only here, but will grow with the next wave.  Dont just wait for announcements, DYOR will help to stregthen your knowledge and youll be more sure of your investment by understanding the big picture instead of panic reactions. (This is not a trading or investment advice or in general a call for action, just a general comment on crypto. Dont trade based on our talks, we are simply communicating to share updates. Telegram is our official chat to release first hand information. We may not update other social channels out of capacity reasons).",False

Softcap is reached already. We set it to 100k USD which we collected partially in USD and ETH. Because the ETH price has rapidly lost in value - some think that it isnt reached, but we used the timestamp value of the transaction as well as bank wire statement from the USD investments to calculated the softcap status. But as you can see, some use the current price and question our statement because of that   So, to state it clearly: SOFTCAP REACHED   We have started the application before we thought of an ICO and will continue with it even if we dont raise more than what we already did. Some people dont know that they need this application yet, because they havent gotten to the point of cashing in/out. And when that situation comes, its too late and you already missed it. It feels like the part where Alice from the Movie Resident Evil fights through like a hundred zombies, just to realize that another 1000 lined up in the meantime  Its definetly not a fly by night project - though we stayed some serious nights up to work on it. We spend quite some of our own money and we will be the first to use the platform, since the whole purpose of it, is to solve the problem we already faced.  Just let us know anytime if you have questions, will do our best to get back asap!   With love from Switzerland Your Konios Team",False

This is what I like about a project best that I too am kinda looking to invest in, good communication from the Team. Also, this is actually very good that you will continue with the project regardless of investment outcome, which for me means you have a lot of drive and passion to see this through. Problems that get solved by a solution are big business and because this might start out as a low cap project maybe VERY JUICY for early investors to take note of. I started day trading just this week and I want to try to diversify a portion of my profits into solid new projects and those that don't need humongous amounts of capital right off the bat are the ones that can actually turn out to be real Gems.

(You can read the official article here: https://medium.com/@KoniosOfficial/announcement-new-team-member-7d02749cff6c  Announcement | New Team Member We are excited to announce a new face to the Konios Team.  Emmanuel Chilaka, Germany Position: Konios Africa Ambassador   We met Emmanuel at a pitch in Munich. He was at this Summit to expand his network and to look at new projects. Since we were represented at the pitch in Munich with 6 team members, we had enough time to talk to Emmanuel about the Konios project in more detail. Since we continued to be in contact with Emmanuel after the Summit, we became aware of his commitment and expectations for the Konios project. His suggestions and expertise are in line with our philosophy.  Emmanuel is above all a Crypto and Bitcoin enthusiast. His technical expertise is no coincidence, as confirmed by his bachelorâ€™s degree in mathematics and computer science. With his practical experience of about 7 years, especially in the field of Apple and Microsoft systems, he not only brings theory on board. He currently holds a Masterâ€™s degree in digital currencies.  Emmanuel is going to support the Community Engagement, Manage Facebook, Reddit and Discord. He is also an admin on Telegram. Further he will engage with the community in Africa and will be the point of contact for the Konios Project engagement in Africa.  He is the first of 6 ambassadors for all the continents. So far we donâ€™t know if there are any crypto activities in Antarctica. Should this circumstance change, we will appoint a seventh ambassador.  If you want to know more about Emmanuel, you can find him on these social networks:  Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chilaka-emmanuel-62629bb3/  Twitter: @e_chilaka  Join the Konios Community here:  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3128951 https://twitter.com/KoniosOfficial https://t.me/koniosofficial https://www.facebook.com/konios.social/ https://discordapp.com/invite/HvX5756 https://steemit.com/@konios https://www.reddit.com/user/konios_inc/ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59K4VVzTI86HWMdrXMZj9g https://medium.com/@konios  From Switzerland with Love  Your Konios Team",False

A few things to mention:  - Bitcoin price is fixed at 10k USD/BTC, Ether at 1k USD/ETH (of course only as long as the market price remains below the fix). - Accepted currencies during presale (BTC, ETH, Fiat) - price / token is 50% compared to the public sale - a bonus of 25% is added on top. - First come, first serve. - We contact the presale participants in person since they are getting in and sharing our vision early on.  Since it is a private sale, we reserve the right to refuse as well as set a minimum investment.  Thanks you!   From Switzerland with Love  Your Konios Team",False

For example: a seller offers BTC to change into cash. A buyer accepts the offer for the desired cash amount but is inexperienced and the seller does not yet have a high and already trusted user level on the Konios platform. Therefore the buyer decides to choose a validator nearby to aid with the procedure to go on without a hitch, offering secure and public locations for such face-to-face transactions and in effect solve the fears of both buyer and seller of being mugged.  With the aid of the immutable blockchain, each validator can be identified with absolute certainty by the transacting parties, using the Konios App on their phones, as no one can counterfeit such identities, or act in any malicious manners as these transactions go on. So the validator procedure assures maximum security for the easy access to crypto currencies with cash on the decentralized Konios exchange platform.",False

You are right. The form of the marketplace exists not only on facebook and ebay but since hundreds of years, perhaps in the form of a bazaar, a fruit & vegetable market or a simple garage sale. The Konios Marketplace is a part of Konios Platform. We have a process system we call F2F (Face-2-Face) transactions. This innovation is the core part that allows to exchange crypto and cash assets safely. So with this basic innovation all the transaction or exchanges on the konios platform will be processed, which also includes the Marketplace transactions. That means its not the ""Marketplace"" which is making it different from other Marketplaces, but rather the way we are processing these exchanges and the interaction during these transactions.  Why did we include the marketplace in our platform?  From the first part of our concept you can see that our goal is to help people join the crypto world in a secure and easy way. As you perhaps now, there are a lot of areas in the world different from Switzerland or Sweden regarding their economic development. What is here a common thing, could be a luxury somewhere else. As a second step, we thought that once the people join the community, they should be able to use the crypto currencies, not only to enrich themselves by trading ruthlessly, but actually using them in day to day stuff. We see 2 benefits in the marketplace. First, people actually buy products locally from eachother. Second, people who are selling their stuff on the Konios Marketplace for FIAT Currency, will get in touch with buyers who own crypto currency. That interaction between people of a local community is a strong bond that adds value and trust to the crypto community.  The past 5 days are a good example. Our community grew very fast. The interesting questions and answers are yet to come. But if the people wouldn't have checked out the project or joined our activities, you and I wouldn't be discussing your questions right now. So whatever way your interest is leaning, the important part is - that we are engaging and talking. Its the best way to improve and reach others to get them involved.  You did more than just a quick comment, actually giving your personal time to research our project for yourself and then engaging in a discussion. This is value!  Thanks again for beign a part of our Thread!  Your Konios Team",False

All crypto currencies will be exchangable to cash and vice versa. If a certain country restricts the use of a certain coin then it is possible that this specific coin cant be exchanged. Konios Platform will be adopted depending on the country you are in. But as long as there are no restrictions by law, then there wont be on the platform. In this reply its a given that the coin/token has the minimum standard of security and accessability. Coins or Token by the community classified as shady or damaging to the crypto space, wont be listed at all.  -> Not sure if I answered your question completly, perhaps I didnt understand the first part. If its not fully answered, please follow up and refrase it if possible!  2. What happens with the remaining Token after the ICO? All remaining token will be added to the rewardsystem. Please take a look at our Whitepaper to see what the rewardsystem is for.  Thanks for your engagement!  Your Konios Team",False
