Please explain why are not qualified ... maybe you should spend a little more time seeing each of the team BIO profiles.  I’m going to replay to your opinion point by point.  1)   Again ... Say that you Honestly do not think that market need this service, IT IS NOT ENOUGH ... EXPLAIN WHY NOT We  still think that the platform can give real help to amateur clubs not only for promoting and discovering new talents, but above all to help them get a budget to face the season without any financial problems..  2)  If  you tell that professional scouts can evaluate a player using YOUTUBE videos,  you are speaking without know any kind of  scout’s processes. Of course .. we also think that the scouting of footballers is a serious job, and we never says that the platform aims to replace the scouts. DO YOU KNOW WHYSCOUT? Probably you don’t , IT IS a scouting video platform for professional players used from all important PROFESIONAL CLUBS around  the world and IT IS BASED IN VIDEOS AND STATISTICS. Netscouters  is a platform that evaluates players and generates statistics and contents starting from not just “videos”.  3)  You cannot give a general critique of the project just by seeing the video presentation.. because from what you wrote,  it seem that it is what you did. WE SAID THAT WE CAN REACH UP TO 18% NOT OF THE GLOBAL MARKET BUT ONLY OF THE ITALIAN, ENGLISH AND SPANISH MARKETS THAT ARE MARKETS WHERE WE ALREADY ARE PRESENT. Yes because we are already working on that since 2013.. Our revenue model is not outlandish, it is the result of the study of people who have worked and who continue to work in football field worldwide.

You have described very well the 4 points on which you describe your opinions ... but just say that ""probably it's not a scam but for sure the team is unqualified to work on this type of project., IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME .. Please explain why are not qualified ... maybe you should spend a little more time seeing each of the team BIO profiles.  I’m going to replay to your opinion point by point.  1)   Again ... Say that you Honestly do not think that market need this service, IT IS NOT ENOUGH ... EXPLAIN WHY NOT We  still think that the platform can give real help to amateur clubs not only for promoting and discovering new talents, but above all to help them get a budget to face the season without any financial problems..  2)  If  you tell that professional scouts can evaluate a player using YOUTUBE videos,  you are speaking without know any kind of  scout’s processes. Of course .. we also think that the scouting of footballers is a serious job, and we never says that the platform aims to replace the scouts. DO YOU KNOW WHYSCOUT? Probably you don’t , IT IS a scouting video platform for professional players used from all important PROFESIONAL CLUBS around  the world and IT IS BASED IN VIDEOS AND STATISTICS. Netscouters  is a platform that evaluates players and generates statistics and contents starting from not just “videos”.  3)  You cannot give a general critique of the project just by seeing the video presentation.. because from what you wrote,  it seem that it is what you did. WE SAID THAT WE CAN REACH UP TO 18% NOT OF THE GLOBAL MARKET BUT ONLY OF THE ITALIAN, ENGLISH AND SPANISH MARKETS THAT ARE MARKETS WHERE WE ALREADY ARE PRESENT. Yes because we are already working on that since 2013.. Our revenue model is not outlandish, it is the result of the study of people who have worked and who continue to work in football field worldwide. Amateur club can earn money working in the platform, and if club earn money also Investors will do..  4) Again, definitely you should spend a little more time reading the white paper where you will probably find details that respond to all your criticism. Thank you  and, if you want, I  will be available to clarify more items after  you  read our WP. Kind Regards Damiano Lino CEO NETSCOUTERS INTERNATIONAL [/quote]  Hi Dameano and thanks for answering me back!   sure, it's my opinion and the opinion that many other business insiders could have.  Any insider who knows how business (and your business doesn't make any difference) really works, wouldn't give you a penny. This is the reason why you're working on your project since 2013.  1) ""We still think that the platform can give real help to amateur clubs"", so, if it's true that you have been worked from 2013, you could surely show us some real metrics.  2) ""Netscouters is a platform that evaluates players and generates statistics and contents starting from not just “videos”"". How? Then, please, enlighten us! Wyscout revenues' Y2017 = €10 million (after years since the business has been run). Your ROI (first year - ONLY ITALY) 12.603.168,00. It's a very creative financial planning.  3) ""WE SAID THAT WE CAN REACH UP TO 18% NOT OF THE GLOBAL MARKET BUT ONLY OF THE ITALIAN, ENGLISH AND SPANISH MARKETS THAT ARE MARKETS WHERE WE ALREADY ARE PRESENT."" - How? Please, enlighten us again! If you're already present in these markets. So, please show us your Balance Sheet and P&L. Oh, yes... I see via your social company accounts (Twitter) some pics of you or other team members, I don’t know; with some directors of football. Well, I've a pic with Lionel Messi, so I have what it takes for joining the team! I don't think that some pics are enough in order to be credible for asking and receiving money! In my case, they worked well with my niece who now believes that Messi is one of my best friends.    3.1) ""Our revenue model is not outlandish, it is the result of the study of people who have worked and who continue to work in football field worldwide."" Ok, but I suggest you finding people who know how to work on a revenue model that is something different to do other type of job.  3.2) ""Amateur club can earn money working in the platform, and if club earn money also Investors will do"". yes, solid companies work in that way.  4) “Again, definitely you should spend a little more time reading the white paper where you will probably find details that respond to all your criticism.” - I read your white paper and it's good for the copied/pasted part from other White Papers, absolutely outlandish for the remaining part.  Last, but least, you have suggested to me: ""maybe you should spend a little more time seeing each of the team BIO profiles"". I did it. Well, many of them are the classical ""ICO cards"". Smoke and mirrors, illusion!",False
