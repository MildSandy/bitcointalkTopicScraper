After I register on Metagather.org and claim the free 1000 lended coins for forging (your word for staking), can I receive also more coins if my node is proxy or storage type?  3.

Just a public one and a file which I don't know what do do with. Is it some kind of replacement of private key and if yes, can it be used via other, different wallet software?  4.

Founders listed on MetaHash website are also the founders of MetaHash AG and they used to work with Mr Ganin on various projects in the Swiss banking industry. Mr Ganin has a long experience in banking and truly believes that crypto industry will be powerfully supported by private and institutional investments. Thus he accepted an offer to lead Metahash project in Switzerland and became the local director for Metahash AG, Zug. In the coming weeks, the company will start to grow in staff and representation in Switzerland and will include several reputed local professionals from the crypto industry. Meanwhile, Clos Belmont Finance is a 14 year old multi-family office directed by the same person since 2009. Its main area of activity is external asset management and in this regard, the crypto industry is becoming one of investment focuses for a vast number of clients wishing to diversify their portfolios from pure vanilla banking products or private equity. There is no connection between the ICO of bank4u and Mr Kirill Ganin apart from the fact that he knows the UBO of the bank. He was no way connected to this ICO.

However, we weren‚Äôt able to independently verify these claims, and information on AdSniper is sparse (though this may be due to the fact that the company is Russian and we don‚Äôt have reliable English-based information about the company).

Please tell what you think.  Idea against theft of crypto assets.   Idea abstract example: Smart contract or special wallet with a second signature that can cancel a transaction within a certain period specified by a data-transaction in the network.  Simple example. An exchange creates a wallet where it keeps its assets. It sets 24 hours to cancel any outgoing transaction by an additional password. The second password is stored securely and is not needed until a successful hacker attack happens.  Negative: - you have to wait for 24 hours (or whatever time is specified) - if you lose the second password your assets could be blocked by an attacker, but you keep the password securely stored for emergency and don't have to use it online until it happens  Positive: even if you lose both passwords hacker can't use the funds, it will be a cat and mouse game that will discourage stealing   There can be multiple variations. The same password can make transactions and cancel. MultiPasswords for cancelation are needed. And other. It's cool.  The main disadvantage is that no TX is really committed until X hours passed. For daily traders, this might not be something positive. This mitigates the impact of the hacked exchange risk. The hacking best strategy, in this case, would be to retire small amounts trying to minimize the chance that the exchange realizes it. Other systems use some kind of blacklist to make the hacked assets unusable, but that requires some degree of centralization.",False
