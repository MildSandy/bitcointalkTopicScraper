Everbody knows meanwhile that this was a big scam. There is also already doubt that their CEO even exists. Please check out this. You can also check their facebook for any information about the CEO. You will just find some images of the Indian guys of the team, but no image with this Ian Viner. In my opinion this is a classical Indian scam. If I were you, I would stop wearing their signature immediately. Just read this post in the link from this poor guy. Not more people should lose their hard earned money. Also their tokens are already floating around. They had a mistake in the contract (or they have NO contract) that somehow everybody who invested before Nov. 15 is able to trade the tokens already.  Funny fact: They claimed that they raised $7m in the pre sale, but only about tokens worth 300,000USD are floating around.

Though your criticism is obvious We recently hosted a webinar and i invited you as well, but you did not turned because you are only interested in shouting here, u really don't hold any organic question. How do you look in deepOnion without opening covers and reaching core, anyways i know you aren't interested in this. I have always asked you but you never answered why are you on this thread.  You and your Blocklancer friends have been trying a lot to defame Coinlancer but certainly this wont happen. I presented a proof but you ignored that and same way i really don't find fruitful to answer any of the questions.  To your satisfaction all you want is address, We are not using API system as it is not safe these days. In our token distribution system, The amount paid stays in their own sub wallet until ICO is over. You can try to create 3 to 5 accounts and pay some random amounts and You can come back later and check those addresses where your payments will stay in your own sub wallet. Hope you understand the mechanism now.  Once we complete token distribution on Dec 22. Please ping me back... I will give you audit report ",False

It attracts both full-time and part-time workers, and the beauty is the choice of working hours. You can, for example, work your 9-5, and in the evenings or weekends for a bit of extra income, work a side-gig. The market at this point is worth $3bn USD, showing a huge space to work out of. However, there are a number of faults in the market. Coinlancer hope to overcome some of these issues.  Primarily, freelancing encompasses all trades, and mostly serves within the digital goods and services space. The problem is, there are few platforms where buyers and sellers of freelancing services can come together to prosper. Traditional platforms such as Fiverr and Freelancer charge exorbitant fees for use of the service, often as high as 20%.
