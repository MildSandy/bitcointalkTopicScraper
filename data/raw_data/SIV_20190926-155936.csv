A centralized exchange uses a hot wallet and a cold wallet. The hot wallet keeps only 10% of total funds for trading purposes and moves the other 90% to a cold wallet (air-gap). Hackers target centralized exchanges because of their hot wallets. Bitsive wants to use the zero-day protocol to mitigate the hacks. Users cryptocurrencies are not stored on the exchange, hense we do not have a hot or cold wallet. Unlike a decentralized exchange, the zero-day protocol allows for users to trade multiple times, allows various order types, order management, deposit and withdraw which is all done using a smart contract, time lock algorithm, a contra protocol and a federation server.  The benefits of this project is that you will have a decentralized exchange ( funds not on exchange) and a centralized exchange ( versatile functionality) all in one as a hybrid exchange. Many users have lost funds due to exchange hacks. If we want cryptocurrency adoption to go main stream we need a secure platform that does compromise security for features or features for security.",False

What exchange currently has a hybrid model? What exchange offers decentralization and centralization and a OTC exchange where funds never touch the exchange?  The answer is none. A hybrid is a mixture of two things joining together to be come one. In this case a decentralized exchange and a centralized exchange.,False
