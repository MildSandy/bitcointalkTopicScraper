I decided that instead of just handing over money, I'd make use of my technical knowledge and I purchased quite a bit of equipment to mine with. Not only does that cost money, up front, but it's depreciating every month, and I'm also paying an electricity bill each month in one of the most expensive countries on earth.  Then add in the several hundred hours I've spent, getting/keeping everything running, helping people, tracking down bugs, etc.  I suspect I have much more 'invested' in this than you, and that should tell you something.  Why would I bother if I didn't think it was worth it? I could have chosen any other coin, but there's something different about Avesta.  If, and I repeat 'if', they do manage to do what they say they will try to do then it should be very sucessfull.  I suspect we see things differently not because we have 'invested' different ammounts, but because we went into this with different expectations. I'm not in any hurry to see them dump on an exchange. I'd rather they kept doing what they have been doing, and when the time is right, be it 2018, 2019, or whatever, then they list on an exchange once all the functionality is there.  I'm also ready to lose everything I have put into this, knowing from the start that this was like buying a lottery ticket. There is a really good chance you'll get nothing back from ICO's in general, but if your careful and through a combination of luck and judgement pick the right coin.. it's happy days.

They are building a complete crypto payment solution that is aimed at businesses, thier customers, people that don't have bank accounts, etc. They probably haven't even got to the point of trying to on board anyone yet.

Last year I went through 100's of ICO's assessing them for viability. There were lots of fun and quirky offerings that were trying to launch based on some novel idea like replacing securities exchanges, simplifying supply lines and similar.  They were all well and good, but I was looking for a coin that had the best chance of replacing cash\card payments.  From a technical perspective (asuming everything gets delivered), Avesta should be miles ahead of everything else in this regard.  - Exchange listing by the end of the year. - Debit card by the end of the year. - 10s block time - Extremely low transaction fees - A bunch of other stuff like smart contracts, multi currency walet, invoicing, accounting, etc.  Asuming it all gets delivered (the dev team are doing a cracking job so far!) that's a great combination.  No one knows whats going to happen in the future, based based on what we have seen so far this project looks like a good bet.

All the wallets go back to 0 (edit - untill they resync and the correct balance is shown).  I've also figured out how to get round the rejected blocks  issue. Blocks get rejected because someone else beat you to the punch.  Ignore the below, just add --scan-time 1 to your command line when you launch the miner, it has a similar effect and works better.  Normally the mining servers would notify all connected clients that a block had been found and it would distribute the new target at the same time, but this isn't happening.  The client just mines untill either 30 seconds is up, or it finds a block, whichever comes first.  But... if you restart your miner every 5->10 seconds it'll have far more up to date information and your success rate will go WAY up.  Now I'm doing this 9 out of 10 blocks get submitted ok, before it was 1 in 30.  But here's the problem..... if we all do this will we overload the servers with connection attempts?  Also, you have to balance out the down time of restarting the miner against the time spent mining. It takes about .3 of a second to kill and restart the miner so it's mining again on my system/internet connection. If I restart every second I'll lose aalmost a third of my hash rate.  I've found that somewhere between 5 and 10 seconds is the sweet spot, but your mileage may vary.",False

I mean, how would you feel if you were trying to work on something and someone keeps distracting you with other tasks or questions, yep you'd be like don't talk to me right now I'm trying to concentrate and get things done...  So let's give the entire team a big thanks for working on the Avesta project so hard.  Remember guys, this hasn't been upgraded from beta version yet. Look at the post from January of this year when they launched the mainnet.  https://avesta.io/en/avesta-launch-platform-wallet-and-mining/  It is plain black and white BETA.  So YES there will be bugs.  YES there will be bumps.  If you don't report your bugs, then the developers won't know what's going on from your point of view. If you have never done this before, or did not know about it. You can do a bug report here.  https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/5d50731a5d5b4b13886bb3810a0bc2c1  That link will allow you to report your bugs straight to the team! You will be helping Avesta to grow.  And just like Mark has said above if your wallet ever shows incorrect or 0, it means that the team has been working on the wallet and the back end was updated. (Remember, all the changes being done are for preparation of the Point of Sale and Exchange integrations.) The wallet then has to re-sync to the block-chain just like any other wallet. So give it some time and check back. Your coins are always safe on the chain!  Let's work together and bring Avesta to the moon where it belongs!  Thank you all for your continued support!
