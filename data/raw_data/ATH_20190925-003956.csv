Why you want to popularize AI? Is it worth spending time promoting?  Now, the ability of identifying image  of machine learning is up to 98%. However, in certain fields, it shows little difference from different algorithms. Thus, we believe that application of AI will be the key technology for a company to longly exist.  In the future, it is not algorithm, but data resources, that will be the primary object of competition. We believe that what is more valuable is not the tool itself, but is the business problem in different fields solved with the tool. Thus, companies will transform as data application and customized service oriented in the future.   2. Why do I need to learn to use your system, for I can just find an AI company to resolve my problems?  It may be convenient to hire an AI company to deal with your problem. However, despite aiming at the same issue in one field, each project still differs a lot with other ones, so do the experiences of different clients. In addition, customization still has its limits. For example, no company would answer your phone call and help you in midnight, for that we usually deal with our own business actively. But it is hard to ask for the same attitude from other people.  Moreover, it usually cost a long time for making the company really know where your problem is. Also, you may want to keep the Knowhow secret. We prefer teaching one to use the tool rather than just feeding what he or she wants. Our main goal is to let everyone find and filter the most suitable algorithm eigenvalues for themselves with the platform. If each one can learn or understand the core value of machine learning and try to  use it through our platform, he will at least know such a tool that  can help them solve the problems, even he or she can not collect high quality data in the very beginning. Within this process, we may inspire more people to use this platform and educate the younger generation, making it possible to collect large amount of data resources.",False

Now we combine it with blockchain to create another whole new technology. We have been making effort to popularize high technology, equipping people with the ability of fulfilling creativities, enhancing people's living quality, and boosting the development of global civilization.   Three Core Technologies  Blockchain AIgatha's project computing transform cash flow into data flow, making the information computation open and transparent and assuring the users' security. Miners can operate project computing and maintain ledger at the same time.  Distributed Computing (DistComp@home) With DistComp@Home, AIgatha can integrate miners’ computing power to reduce the time of data analysis.  Artificial Intelligence (iMLOv) iMLOv is AIgatha’s computing system integrating multiple algorithms of popular machine learning and parameter optimization and blockchain to make accurate prediction.   Development Four Phases There are four phases of AIgatha's project implementation, including blockchain, distributed computing platform, artificial intelligence service platform and platform for different developing fields. The model of construction of each phase will be displayed in the following illustrations.  LUCA – Aigatha Blockchain 1.Users can use AIgatha token to purchase the service of distributed computing and big data analysis. 2. Miners will offer their computing power and obtain proof of work to get AIgatha token after finishing their tasks.  Pangu - DistComp@home 1.With simplified API, DistComp@home (DC platform) reduce the cost of developing distributed computing system. 2.integrate miners' computing power, users don’t have to purchase expensive equipment. 3.Share benefits with miners, and boost positive circulation of blockchain ecosystem. 4.Built on blockchian, DistComp@home can solve the problem of electricity waste and create new values.  Iching - Big Data Prediction Platform 1.Users can only focus on data collection and make big data prediction based on important eigenvalues. 2.Developers are welcome to implement their own AI algorithm and sell them to users in need.  Xirang - Multiple Service 1.Everyone can find out solution for each case fast with the implementation of prediction system in different fields. 2.Preserve large amount of data and the credibility of data source with blockchain. 3.Friendly, simple, and graphic user interface. 4.Individuals, small and medium-size labs and corporates will be relieved with our platform.   Rules of Selling Token  The amount of token release is 2,000,000,000 ATH (and it will not be increased). The amount of token release during crowdfunding is 1,000,000,000 ATH.  Presale 1：2018/06/05 - 2018/06/10 Presale 2：2018/06/11 - 2018/06/20 Presale 3：2018/06/21 - 2018/06/30  Publicsale 1：2018/07/01 - 2018/07/15 Publicsale 2 ：2018/07/16 - 2018/07/31   Schedule for ICO  https://aigatha.com/img/time-item1-cont-en.png      Schedule for the technical development  https://aigatha.com/img/time-item2-cont-en.png    Q&A  What are the pain points on market we resolve? First, we use blockchain to do big data analysis in addition to maintaining the ledger. Second, using our user-friendly API (application programming interface), we ultimately simplify distributed computation and efficiently integrate all miners' computing power. Third, we simplify the process of AI application and development. Even being unfamiliar with artificial intelligence theories, anyone knowing how to use Excel or compatible software is able to perform all sorts of AI-based prediction using our system.  Is there any actual application of your products? Our technologies of distributed computation and artificial intelligence have been applied in scientific researches including iSARST, CPSARST, DS-SARST, CPred, CirPred and imSuper, most of which protein structural analysis and prediction systems. We are confident of widely applying our core technologies to blockchain.  What's the difference between AIgatha and other blockchain? Compared to blockchain's traditional function of trade recording, AIgatha is a “project-oriented” blockchain, which combines distributed computation and blockchain based on patented technology, recording the information and computation results of user-submitted projects.  What's AIgatha token for? With AIgatha token, you can carry out your own big data analysis on our distributed computing platform, making prediction in various fields. In the future, you can also purchase prediction services provided by our team, such as the prediction about earthquakes and other disasters, optimized proportion of multiple materials, sports game, cryptocurrency trend and energy saving.

Our primary goal is to establish a simply used AI predicting platform. This platform includes several characteristics: For example, it has simple data form. You can pick out important eigenvalue quickly and select the machine learning algorithm for different problems. We hope even one who doesn’t have background knowledge of AI can get familiar with our platform.  We hope to make everyone realize the significance of each historical data at hand in the big data era through this platform.",False

To our system, blockchain is a medium for storing index value, like a bookmark in a libaray. But the concrete book will be placed in other place (Chronos Fortress). We hope to make the black box in traditional cloud data flow transparent, making each one using the system know the flowing direction of their own data without having problems of confidential security caused by part of the nodes. Moreover, miners can know our arrangement is fair and equal.",False
