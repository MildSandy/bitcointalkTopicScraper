Crowdsourced Electric Vehicle Charging!,"Charg Coin [CHG] Just Listed W/ Fork Delta!!!   SEE THE VIDEO  Charg has one two-fold mission: Improve developing economies while transitioning the world into alternative energies. This is done by offering the most advanced, automatic, and convenient electric vehicle and car charging technology at the lowest possible price. Charg plans to do this by enacting their Two-Pronged Initiative with ChargCoin and WeCharg (more on this topic below). Charg Coin and WeCharg believe everyone should be empowered to make money. Get onboard with CHG and together we can change the world!    The numbers above are projected from linear Plug-in Electric Vehicle (PEV) sales growth over the next eight years, when in actuality, the (PEV) sales growth is projected to be exponential. This means the potential revenue could be way higher but Charg did not feel comfortable projecting this without the professional market data so... from a linear growth model based on EV-Volumes.com sales scorecards, WeCharg and Charg Coin has the potential to generate over 1.1 Trillion (~250B+ to CC/WC with ~850B+ to Station Owners) within the next 8 years. To achieve this Charg is enacting a two-pronged approach (Crypto&Fiat synonymous with CC&WC) and aims to achieve 1.1 Trillion by filling an average 10% of the PEV charging sessions per year at $5 USD average per charging session over the next 8 years. The graph and numbers above are based only on the WC FIAT arm's software licensing potential revenue generation at 20/80 on FIAT transactions (avg 20% of rev generated from stations goes to the company and 80% goes to station owners) and is in no way to be taken as professional investing advice. This is merely a model of what could be if we achieve these goals. By comparison, CHG/Crypto/Charg Coin transactions will be nearly tax-free (<3% Ethereum Network Tax with a plan to migrate for lower transaction fees) and utilized to turn chargers on and off. A percentage of profits from WC/Fiat will be used to buy CHG back from the open market and/or station owners but, in general, the price of CHG will be determined by crypto market value.    The CC/WC electric vehicle charging platform MVP is currently active, open source, and can built or bought by early adopters at www.charg.io. The platform is presently crypto only but, with the launch of WeCharg, it will become fiat for fiat and crypto for crypto with the market connecting the two. This, in essence, is our two-pronged approach. Much like Atari's recent crypto arm, we have realized that the two markets (Crypto and Fiat) don't always play nicely together and, while crypto offers incredible technology and a decentralized nature, a majority (probably 95%+) of our potential early (hardware) adaptors and (EV-Driving) customers are stuck in the FIAT (Govt Currency) market. For the greatest success of all our supporters, we've chosen to capitalize the Fiat Market with WeCharg and incentivize Trads (traditional people) to use Charg Coin (CHG) via buybacks, market growth, and Fiat taxes to inspire people to use CHG/Exchange instead of Fiat. But again... we need those dinosaur Fiat lovers to join us in the digital age. In a disruptive market such as crypto, disruptors (i.e. CC/WC) have the option to destroy an outdated market or bridge the gap into future markets. Those who bridge traditionally have greater success. Charg chooses to usher the old into the new via their two-pronged initiative and invites everyone to join us in revolutionizing the trade of energy.      The above model (dino fiat ) will be active within the next year but, again, our crypto arm (the future of commerce ) and station finding app (networked community ) are active now. Join the community! At this point, the tech is completely capable of controlling EV charging via the smart plug/node and driving app. If trading is more of your thing.... Get out there and trade some CHG!!!!     Thank you for reading. Now enjoy trading, building a station, downloading and/or spreading the word.  Together we can revolutionize the world.
