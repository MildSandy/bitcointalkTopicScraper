TaaS Service was the first-of-its-kind at the time. Together we lived through ups and downs and faced numerous challenges summoned by the bull and bear markets. Obviously, nothing lasts forever, and the time has come to turn the page and evolve.    Together we have come to appreciate that Token-as-a-Service fulfilled its purpose, to the benefit of the highly esteemed Community, and thus it is time to terminate the Service and move over to the development of new products to meet the emerging demands of the ecosystem.      Appreciating the trust of the Users, their rights under the Service agreement, on one hand, and the obligations of the Service, and each individual User within the regulatory field and international anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing agenda, on the other, we are focused on streamlining the Service Termination process as much as we can.    Moving forward, the highly esteemed Community, the Users of Token-as-a-Service must be aware of the following developments prior to the commencement of the Service Termination process at 11 AM UTC May 1, 2019:       1. TaaS User Agreement and Privacy Policy have been updated to correspond with applicable regulations, and provide clarity to the Users regarding their rights and obligations under the Service, including the Service Termination process.       2. Up-to-date TaaS Compliance Policy, as an integral part of the TaaS User Agreement, is available here (accessible upon registration of the website).       3. Authorization Procedure which provides Users with the right to claim the Services and TaaS Assets liquidation proceeds will be open at 11AM UTC on April 16, 2019.  As detailed in the TaaS User Agreement, the Authorization Procedure comprises of User identification and whitelisting an ERC-20 wallet for further distributions from the Service.  Please, read Annex 1 of the Compliance Policy and the Authorization FAQ for more details.  TaaS would also kindly remind the highly-esteemed Community that Token-as-a-Service may not be accessed by citizens and residents of a number of jurisdictions. The up-to-date list of such jurisdictions can be found in Article 1.3 of the TaaS User Agreement and Annex 1 of TaaS Compliance Policy.  If your country of nationality or residence is included in the list,  you are strongly recommended to discontinue ownership of TAAS Tokens, by way not forbidden by applicable laws and regulations.       4. The smart contract will be deployed and will start accepting TAAS Tokens submissions from Authorized Users’ whitelisted addresses at 11AM UTC on May 1, 2019.    After Authorization of a User is complete, in order to claim the allocable distributions such User will need to either:      submit a specific amount of his/her TAAS Tokens to the smart contract address 0xa6b5e8DF6553969dE6006EDB3A87Ff5226f4a115 (please, double check  ), OR      Use the “safety feature” or the smart contract and send zero (0) amount of TAAS Tokens to any ETH address, thus transferring the full balance of TAAS Tokens to the TaaS Smart Contract.     Please, note that within the Authorization procedure a snapshot of the amounts of TAAS Tokens held on the User wallets will be taken. In the event of a substantial increase in the TAAS Tokens amount submitted for distribution compared to the amounts screened under the snapshot, TaaS may request additional information and/or documents to comply with the Compliance Policy (‘Suspended Authorization’).       5. After receiving TAAS Tokens from Authorized Users’ whitelisted addresses, the smart contract will execute distributions, comprising of the results of the final TaaS Quarter (February 1 - April 30, 2019), and the TaaS Assets liquidation proceeds. Please read the Winding-up Procedure FAQ  for further details.       6. TaaS will be issuing regular updates on the Winding-up status.       7. As previously mentioned on numerous occasions, the TaaS WebWallet service and support will be discontinued at 00:00 UTC on January 1, 2020, and the users of the wallet need to withdraw their assets to an eligible ERC-20 storage of their choosing to participate in the distributions, and to avoid unnecessary delays or loss of assets due to the wallet shutdown. Please refer to the Winding-up Procedure FAQ for the list of eligible storages.    Any issues regarding the Authorization procedure should be forwarded to taas@taas.fund.    Please make sure you carefully read and comprehend the following instructions, policies and terms  (accessible after registration/login).before using the Service or claiming any distributions:      TaaS User Agreement;     Privacy Policy;     Compliance Policy;     Authorization FAQ;     Winding-up Procedure FAQ;     Redemption Agreement.",False

So a market-capitalization of the taas token that is lower as Taas investmentfund, as its now, shows the people have low trust to the ability (and willingness?) of the Taas Team to make and payout profits.

As a result of the first year of operations of Token-as-a-Service, the net asset value was increased by over 23 million USD(T) equivalent, and the total capital gains exceeded 32.5 million USD(T) equivalent, bringing an aggregated 780% annual growth rate.  In accordance with the TAAS token model, 50% share of the capital gains equivalent of 16.3 million USD(T) or 2 USD(T) per token was allocated to the token owners and distributed in the form of Ethereum (a total of 30.6 thousand ETH) in August 2017, November 2017, February 2018 and May 2018 respectively; 25% of the gains equivalent to 8.1 million USD(T) were retained in the active portfolio.  During its first year, TaaS effectively utilized a number of active portfolio management tools and strategies, including risk-weighted diversification into strategic asset classes, rebalancing, intra-day trading and taking swing positions at cryptocurrency exchanges. A substantial part of TaaS efforts was focused on deal origination and participation in token sales.  As a part of its day-to-day activities, TaaS developed and utilized its in-house due diligence and deal origination expertise, having screened over a thousand prospective blockchain startups at their early stages, around 140 of which were shortlisted. After comprehensive due diligence on the projects’ financial, technical and legal aspects etc., an aggregate of over 10 million USD(T) equivalent was contributed to 35 selected projects including EOS, Bancor, Vimana, Icon, Singularity.net, SALT, TenX and others.  In order to provide transparency and visibility of its activities, TaaS launched and maintains the in-house technology known as the Cryptographic Audit (CA), a set of monitoring tools accessible by any member of the public who currently owns or is considering the purchase of TAAS tokens: https://taas.fund/audit/.  The CA is fine-tuned to provide its users with up-to-date information on the underlying assets held on crypto wallets and trading accounts on exchanges and platforms, details of the early-stage contributions and other assets with limited liquidity, as well as the list of wallets used by TaaS.  As of April 30th, 2018, the token price equaled an equivalent of 5.5 USD(T)/TAAS, providing approximately 500% ROI to the participants of its token sale held in March-April 2017 (the price of the tokens during the sale ranged from 0.8 to 1.0 USD(T) equivalent per TAAS), and a market capitalization of over 45 million USD(T) equivalent.

Today the profit is 12,566,778$. So if Taas were to distribute today you would get [ (12.566778/2) /8.146 ] = 0.77$  I dont think its likely that pay outs become 0 cause they said ""A minor part of the portfolio was used for lending activities on cryptocurrency exchanges in order to bring in a secure fixed income.""

Iconiq Lab aims to identify the most promising crypto and blockchain projects, and partner with them to accelerate their fundraising event launch. The accelerator meets the high demand for proper due diligence on startups issuing coins or tokens, and provides investors the necessary confidence in the integrity of the projects and their investment value.  Iconiq Lab issues the ICNQ Club membership token, fundraising to launch, optimize and scale the accelerator program. The token works as the instrument used to fund and grow the accelerator for the benefit of its token members. Iconiq Lab has recently closed the presale of its ICNQ token for institutional and private investors. TaaS joins the event with a contribution of 115.48 ETH. The funds raised will be used to finance the first batch of startups for the accelerator program, which has begun on February 18, 2018.  In September, 2017, TaaS and Iconiq Lab signed a strategic partnership to identify promising projects and create the infrastructure to match ICOs and investors. Additionally, the TaaS team took an active role on the advisory board of Iconiq Lab.  Iconiq Lab is the first project TaaS contributed to during the fourth fully-operational quarter. TaaS concluded its third fully-operational quarter on January 31st, 2018 with significant total asset value growth of 364%, to 50.75 million USD(T) equivalent, thus outperforming Bitcoin by 205%. TaaS’ capital gains for the period exceeded 22.2 million USD(T) equivalent, which generated a 293% ROA. For the first and second quarters, these indicators were: 4.6 million USD(T) generating a 61% ROA, and 5.6 million USD(T) generating a 72% ROA.  The TaaS token (TAAS) is currently trading at the price of 6.84 USD(T) per 1 TAAS, resulting in a market capitalization of over 55.7 million USD(T) equivalent. The tokens are listed on the following exchanges: Bancor Protocol, Orderbook, Livecoin, EtherDelta, HitBTC, CoinExchange and Liqui.  https://medium.com/taas/taas-contributes-to-iconiq-lab-b50cf957b840",False

For example, this quarter has been amazing going from 12 mil to 62 mil, in my opinion Taas will set the RF at 30% this quarter which is 18.6 million plus the 25% of profit from the quarter plus 12 million from last Quarter equals around 38-40 mil to start next quarter. If they had a bad quarter next quarter which I doubt but if they did maybe they set the RF at 10% to allow more payout or maybe not. All I am saying is that the fund is setup in a way to allow Taas flexibility which is exactly what token holders should want if you trust Taas and if you bought Taas you essentially have them your money so best to trust them. Of course trust doesn’t replace due diligence before and after investing.  Short answer: yes they do and it’s in White Paper ;-)",False

If the price of TaaS goes up they have no benefit because they aren’t allowed to hold Taas tokens. Take advantage of the market the price will rise to 8-10 before next payout in my opinion if it holds true to pattern.  The latest rough numbers reported on telegram show like a 50 cent plus payout in February but a lot can change by then one way or another.  The last quarterly report had about a million worth of ICO’s still being counted as their initial investment due to them not being “liquid” enough yet.

That value is much worse compared to some other coins in the markets that I'm learning about such as Bitcore. Obviously, this is highly speculative but they're offering a guaranteed weekly return of 3% in the form of an airdrop for the month of November while increasing that return by 1% each month going forward. There are certainly downsides to this approach which we'll see as time goes by but from a purely compounding perspective, it seems like a no-brainer to choose another altcoin such as Bitcore over TaaS. Please note that I'm a newbie trying to build a portfolio of dividend coins similar to my stock portfolio and my only intent is to see whether it makes sense for me to consider TaaS as an option.

If we stay on parity with bitcoin like this and bitcoin price say doubles within one year, TAAS token value will also double as well. Also as TAAS is keeping 25% of the profits to grow the fund and there are a limited amount of tokens, this can become a real goldmine and a hedge against all the pumping and dumping happening in other coins.

Please note that the first 25% you mentioned does not necessarily goes to the RF. At the moment the RF is used for really long term investments (this changed because the team has enough liquid ETH to always be able to payout the profit share).  How the TaaS ICO investment flow works: ICO Investment -> (value removed from NAV) -> ICO Investment becomes liquid -> (value added to NAV). Now it is still the question if that investment was part of the RF or not. If it was, it does not count towards the profit calculation. That way the team doesn't have to worry about investments that take a really long time to mature (investments in the RF do not need to be liquidated or be forced to be liquidated).",False

Most exchanges do not accept deposits from smart contracts and will thus 'lock' your ETH deposit. Don't worry though, your ETH is fine. What you should do to 'unlock' the ETH is to send a little bit of ETH from a non-smart contract address, for example MEW. Liqui will now recognize all the eth waiting in their own smart contract and deposit it to your account. Not sure if this works for other exchanges as well.

But this dividend and ROI is really incredible.  As a private investor it's perfect to be able to invest in a kind of diversified 'bag of cryptos'.

You all need to take into consideration the fact that TaaS began investing in ICOs and trading at what was nearly the cusp of the ICO rush induced crash of Eth and BTC correction. As it stands, they are down quite a bit on their ICO investments. The only thing that could have generated positive returns was if their trading team timed the bubble bursting and shorted ETH, BTC and whatever else alt all the way down. Perhaps Kepler is aiding them in riding these waves?  In any case, I think it's premature to expect any dividends at all for this quarter considering the huge losses across the board. For now, the more important milestone would be establishing the successful functionality of the TaaS smart contract. If there are dividends at all, them being paid out to all token holders is a huge thing. TaaS will be among the very few tokens of the hundreds that have actually delivered on what they promised. They'll have proven the fund is fully functional and payouts are indeed working as intended. I hope investors will understand THAT is the more important thing for now. Expect dividends in later quarters. While we're at it, it'd be financially sound to make dividend payouts annual events. Quarterly payouts stress the team too much and puts additional risk pressure on the TaaS funds and reserves. Coin movements make major moves within the timeframe of many months up to a year. Trying to cut profits from marginal movements within just a few months seems unwise.",False

The fund has a certain baseline. This initial baseline is in fiat (USD) and was calculated at the end at the ICO. If the portfolio would rise above this baseline (in USD), it is already considered profit. So what RAGEmond posted is a little bit confusing since portfolio growth (in USD) in general would put the fund over that baseline.  Yes, trades are considered 'profit', but only if these 'profits' are still above the baseline (if for example the market would drop) at the end of the quarter. Then there is also the reserve fund (ETH) that can be used to pay the profit (our share, manager fee and reinvestment) without the need to liquidate certain trading positions. Making it so that the fund does not necessarily lose (trading positions for example) when paying out the profits.  So in general, the amount of ETH that is paid as profit can fluctuate per quarter depending on the price of ETH, and the value of the fund.  That being said, 50% of these quarterly profits are for the token holders, 25% is for the fund managers, and the other 25% is reinvested in the portfolio and thus basicly rises the baseline for the next quarter. That is how the fund grows over time.",False

The ICO tokens that have been launched, to my knowledge, are massively down post-launch due to the ICO craze dumping every single one, which in turn led to the ETH/BTC crash, which has, on average, halved the value of their holdings I believe. It'd be cool if someone had the time to stick all the data into one report and reveal if TaaS is currently losing or is still in the green. If they're in the red, I see no way they could pay out dividends without further compromising their market position, being forced to liquidate in order to pay the ever-more crazed dividend sharks. The only surefire way they could have profited massively off the crash is if they happened to short the market even anywhere near the peaks. Swing trading the bear market in smaller trades seems overly risky for the kind of money they are trading with. But hey, perhaps this fancy Kepler program has guided them through all this, and they did precisely that?  Personally, I'm fairly worried about the way TaaS has decided to manage the payout intervals. 3 months seems like a rather harsh window to impose on the team to turn a profit. I think the dividend should be annual, so once per year. Too frequent dividend payouts put further stress and risk on the team and potentially harm their performance. Once per year is a nice, round period of time and provides ample opportunities for the team to successfully produce results, not to mention it gives time for the ICO investments to mature. Looking at the numbers on ICOstats.com, there are no ICOs that turned a considerable profit in just a few months, so liquidating them seems counter-productive. On average, the ICOs have taken at LEAST a year and usually 2-3 to mature.  In closing, I fear for the productivity of the TaaS team if they are run under such a tight leash. I will be quite surprised if the first year, much less this first quarter turns a genuine profit. That is, they generate enough income to pay out reasonable dividends WITHOUT compromising their market holdings too much. In my honest opinion, the team should have a good 1 year interval to do their job. Better for their focus and trading integrity. Better for investors' peace of mind. Certainly better for potential profits. All I know is that more than the dividend payouts, I await their progress reports. I am sincerely interested in how they are faring with their strategies and how much Kepler has had an impact on their trading.",False

Token-as-a-Service (TaaS), the tokenized closed-end fund designed to reduce technical barriers and investment risks in blockchain assets has announced a strategic partnership with the Digital Developers Fund (DDF), a fund focused on the high growth of digital assets such as domain names (aka Internet Real Estate).  Established in 2010 as the Domain Developers Fund, DDF currently owns over 1,540 premium domains. Rebranded in 2017 as the Digital Developers Fund, the company is now gearing up to raise $90 million via a token allocation event on July 10th in order to expand its operations and asset acquisitions.  The TaaS — DDF partnership allows for transparency of money flows into blockchain projects. DDF is among the very first funds offering free access to all the relevant information investors should have access to at all times. To provide a transparent mapping of the fund’s investment activity post its token sale, DDF will use TaaS’ proprietary Crypto Audit techn­ology.  Michael Marcovici, Managing Director of DDF said:      “Our mission is to make investing in digital safe, transparent and profitable. We are taking a number of steps to prudently allocate the funds raised in our token sale that starts Monday, June 10th, 2017. TAAS’ Crypto Audit is a key component to give investors transparency and therefore reassurance in our investment strategy.”  Taas’ Crypto Audit is a set of monitoring tools that let any member of the public to easily validate the trading history and portfolio balances. Among the most useful features, the technology includes regular blockchain snapshots, proof of reserves and view-only API keys. The technology has already achieved significant milestones with the adoption of an automated system inclusion of new tokens in the balance and rolling out the total value of the portfolio. TaaS is currently working on enriching the Crypto Audit technology’s functionality to offer the most user-friendly interface.  Ruslan Gavrilyuk, co-founder, and President of TaaS said:      “Due to the exponential growth rate of crypto assets, we understand that there is an urgent need to provide investors with relevant tools to guarantee transparency of funds’ activities. We welcome the initiatives taken by DDF to ensure the highest standards of transparency of their fund’s performance and we are happy those chose TaaS’ Crypto Audit technology as their third-party provider.”  Mr. Gavrilyuk recently joined DDF’s Advisory Board to provide his expertise during DDF’s token allocation.",False

WARNING: This user is a newbie. If you are expecting a message from a more veteran member, then this is an imposter !!! Hey, I am from russian BTT local and I must report about multiaccount cheater detected. This is user ""targetmlrd"". See proof below. His multiaccounts BTT usernames are: DmitryMarkov, MarryBit, VadimWorld92, Altmannn, AndyLowley, JusticeLife, CryptoDoncov, AndrewDuakyn. He greatly deceived you in aeternity's signature part1, blog, russian thread moderation bounty campaigns. In aeternity's russian thread he made fictitious activity to get more stakes, he asking and answering himself to his multiaccounts. For example, especially see page #14 in russian thread https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1791710.260 where you can see all those multi usernames (almost all of them have bancor or sonm avatars/signature now). In aeternity's signature part1 bounty spreadsheet you can see his multiaccounts DmitryMarkov, MarryBit, AndyLowley, JusticeLife In blog bounty he participated as VadimWorld92.  Proof All of those accounts registered on October 2016, I think to participate in Iconomi, vSlice and other bounties. All usernames have the same style of naming. All messages of those acoounts have the same writing style with some same words.

And main proof is to explore payment ETH adresses in public bounty spreadsheets of vSlice, Edgeless, TaaS and other. Everybody can see how tokens migrate from his multiaccount ETH adresses to one address: for example see about vSlice tokens https://etherscan.io/address/0x0f5f6e9f54b43466d7c6ae753abd7b05b3eeb5a4#tokentxns wich transfered from 0x8435328AebfE971df220dACf6F387bAE19b66556   VadimWorld92 0x996Cf37e8fB98999ABFf59A7f116D1e7f2B08847   DmitryMarkov 0x6fb50c245D42147AF9A58BB17C0bAe1DeF9a4Da4   CryptoDoncov 0xbB18910616EcF5D51Cc8303d66E7C7Bf43A617E9   AndyLowley 0x8DcBb728B00c442Dbd6337B2d14730Ba2ad186fD   Altmannn 0xF90C096Bf0Fa1A9eB0008200763d50B5bBC46eFf   MarryBit these addresses are from vSlice bounty spreadsheet and the same in other projects.

Thus, it is safe to say that this small stake will proportionally generate small stakes of the total dividend payout.  If the total dividend distribution for token holders in a given month is 100 ETH, this person would be eligible for 0.00122759 ETH of this amount. This amount of ETH (roughly equivalent to $0.50) is similar to (or lower than) a regular transaction fee in Ethereum.  Is the transaction fee going to be deducted from the dividend payout of each individual (which, in this case, would lead to a 0.00000 ETH dividend payout)?

There are zero capital gains if a position is held. IE if TAAS invested $1mil into BANCOR they would have to sell that position to have liquid gains to pay investors. So it seems what actually is going to happen is that TAAS is going to look at their paper returns from the 3 ICO investments and then pick an arbitrary number to return to TAAS token holders.

In practice, a portfolio reshuffling (not necessary but is an option if some of the positions are really hot and profitable) can happen on the last day of the quarter if needed.

Bittrex is one good option taas list if taas there in bittrex for sure many trader will buy taas because they see potential .  Hey chichidori and HatakeKakashi,  TAAS is a smart contract/profit sharing token and is working on a totally different kind of system than most of the altcoins available in those markets.  While a ""high volume"" exchange is interesting (and something we consider as important); we prefer to implant our Token-as-a-Service in markets where it will properly work with the system in place.  An exchange being listed or not doesn't change how the team handles their investments and do profit. With 25% of the profits being reinvested in the net asset value; the growth of the token will continue. With the limited amount of tokens available; rarity will be a selling feature. You also need to understand that most of the people who bought TaaS are in for the service that it is offering (funds managing) and not for the only growth in price of the token in the market.  This being subject to change in the near future; we are always in constant communication with a lot of exchanges to push the reach of the token even further.  Thanks!  Quote from: kalpit on June 10, 2017, 08:11:24 AM We are waiting for the 2 announcements.  In future, when will the investments in ICO made public? Just after investment? Or when their ICO ends?  Hey kalpit,  We always make our investments public as soon as they are done (executed).  Thank you!

AFAIK it will be distributed in ETH meaning the recent ETH surge that happened since ICO will actually mean the company holdings when converted in ETH is lower since a significant amount raised during original ICO was payed (and is still held) in BTC.  However it does mean the price of the tokens have now a higher floor in $ since market cap of all TaaS tokens should theoretically not be < to Net Asset Value of the fund.

There wasn't the need for me to answer as most of the questions were answered by kind members of the community.  For your question: TAAS is a smart contract/profit sharing token and is working on a totally different kind of system than most of the altcoins available in those markets.  While a ""high volume"" exchange is interesting (and something we consider as important); we prefer to implant our Token-as-a-Service in markets where it will properly work with the system in place (PLNX or BTRX; for example; not being the dearest fans of ""profits sharing"" programs.)  This being subject to change in the near future; we are always in constant communication with a lot of exchanges to push the reach of the token even further.  Liqui.io is indeed a small exchange (compared to BTRX or PLNX), but it is a really good one. While I understand your worry about needing bigger exchanges; TaaS doesn't /need/ that to be able to have an healthy growth. Since 25% of the quarterly profits are reinvested in the NAV of the token; only that (and the reserve funds) are features that will allow the project to be built on solid grounds while the traders of the team make investments.  Also; to be noted: the team was busy in Tel Aviv for a Blockchain Conference and will soon do a statement about the outcome of it.  Hope I answered your question!",False

There is only one way to responsibly invest the money, and that is to get into ICO's that solve real world problems. They will not be doing much else with it because to do otherwise would be to invest in pump and dump schemes (of which there are hundreds here on this board), and potentially lose all their money (and reputations).  I know what the whitepaper said, I wouldn't bother thinking TAAS will somehow magically daytrade profits into existence. What do you think your dividends will be, 1 dollar per token/quarter? Then they'd need to whip up 8 million for you in 3 months, that's a lot of daytrading, and a lot of opportunities to get it wrong. Daytrading is, in general, stupid.  They should (and will, based on what we've seen) invest sizable sums into new projects that solve real world problems because it is a responsible way to drive value for the fund.

They are interested in mid to long term investments, not day trading. Thus they need time to get more investments made that appreciate in value. There are no magical dividends to be calculated, it is all based on math.  2) The only way the Taas Token could be worth 40-50 is if the value of their holdings grew 40-50x from the ICO. Ethereum grew 3-4x, true, and Bitcoin grew, but not 40-50 times its ICO price. If they take the BTC/ETH they received and get involved in projects that increase vastly in price, then you may get some payouts. 3) If the price of the TAAS token grows beyond the value of their holdings, it would be because people think the team can somehow do magic and earn greater rewards in the future (e.g., they demonstrate they are able to be fast enough to get into hard ICO's like BAT, which they failed to get into). 4) If you are truly interested in slowly but surely growing your investments, buy Bitcoin or Ethereum and hold it. As Warren Buffet has said (paraphrasing) ""the stockmarket is a way to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient"".  I would be cautious buying too much TAAS until they actually start buying into projects.  TAAS, if you're reading this, my money is on FCT, MKR, XRP, NVO, and IOTA. Best of luck!",False

The profits that we made so far were only from the natural growth of the funds from the raise in the market value. Also, profits sharing are done at every end of quarters; which gives the team a total of three months before the next sharing to make profits (largely enough time to make a proper return)  About your second question: we do not have a particular interest in ICO's but are always looking at interesting projects where we could contribute. TAAS will participate in anything that the team consider profitable and worth an investment. For day trading; the team is mainly looking to do mid/long term investments at the moment.

Everyone entitled to get a reward got/will get their dues. We are still processing everything and the distribution isn't done.  With the recent events in the Ethereum blockchain making most of our transactions delayed; we totally understand how some people could get impatient about their bounties. Now; that being said; it is a really unfortunate event that we couldn't nor had any possible way to prevent.  The other reason for this could come from the opinion of some people about how our bounties manager (Jamal) has handled the information collecting/distribution. While we can understand the situation; we would also like to restate that he had multiple problems with his internet connection thus delaying the whole process and our attempts of contacting him. We are still waiting for him to open the spreadsheet and hope we can finish the bounty distribution as quickly as possible.  Thank you!  Quote from: Emilianos2k6 on June 03, 2017, 01:24:48 AM Hey guys,  If I buy some TAAS from Liqui.io do I get in for the 50% profit sharing in the future? Or was that a specific ICO smart contract?  Thanks!  Hey Emilianos2k6 ,  Yes! Any person holding the tokens are entitled to get a part of the quarterly profits sharing! The smart contract is embed in the token itself; making anyone holding it a ""shareholder"".  Hope I answered your question!",False

While I understand that we first said ""July"" in our roadmap; a lot of external factors (mostly the waiting of the Grant Thornton audit) added delay to our planning; thus shortening the trading time for the quarter (the fund not being able to be invested during that period.)  To prevent any unfortunate quarter results that could come from this; we decided to move the profits sharing a little further down to road; allowing the traders and the analysts of the team to have ""a full quarter of time"" to properly do their job. We prefer doing this instead of rushing things up; which could (in a lot of situations); end up with unwanted results.  Thank you!",False

According to your provided transaction link i can find a total of 427 transactions and 380+ transaction was made about 8 days ago, that should be the 1st round. The last distribution happened about 8 hours ago,so around 50  transaction has been made today. How did you say that 90% bounty already sent? Do you know there is 800+ participants in the spreadsheet and 380 of them was already paid out in the 1st round. Who recruited you as a community manager?  where is the officials?  Only 427 transaction has been made since 1st round and he assure us that 90% bounty was already sent, someone pls check the link https://etherscan.io/txs?a=0xd775af5ff5b8414f3c00539640f402f242e3e0af&p=1  Don't play game with us,this is blockchain technology,your statement is 100% wrong,you misguided us with fake confirmation. No more words i am going to believe anymore.  EDIT: 376 transaction in 1st round that has been sent 8 days ago Only 51 transaction has been made today that caused a total of 427 transaction for bounty participants. Now tell me how they calculated it as 90% ?",False

They simply don't show up on Etherscan. There has been a really slow processing on the ETH blockchain today; some people think it is because of the enormous amount of transactions generated by the BAT ico who ended up in a matter of minutes; making more than 156,250 ETH to be sent on the memory pool in a short time.  I just talked to Oleksii Matiiasevych (one of the ETH smart contracts developers and TAAS advisors) a second ago about the matter and here is his answer:  ""I just asked Etherscan dev to increase amount of shown pending tx's. If he will agree, they will appear.""  For your concerns about me and my position; I encourage you to contact Dimitri Chupryna; TaaS co-founder, on our official telegram who will confirm you who I am.  Also, I am not playing any game with anyone. I am just here to help as much I can.  Thank you!

Please refer to my last answer; you will find the details concerning the reason why you probably did not receive your reward yet.

I appreciate, but is it possible to shown pending tx's in any block explorer? As you said 700+ transaction is actually in the transfers queue, there is no way to prove that if this is really a truth,unless we find them in the block explorer. Or ask taas dev for providing some screenshot from his side that  will actually show some queue transaction.

All he started to work from 18th of May when i first saw some address in the spreadsheet but stakes reward was still missing in the spreadsheet.He put the reward after collecting addresses, is this really the way that he should work? You know what yahoo would done if he was the manager, yahoo will calculate all the stakes after end of the ico and put the exact bounty number behind every username before start collecting address,from 11 may t 18th may he'll collect addressess and wait for the last day. On final day yahoo could scraped all the  addresses that would take another 24-48 hours and then deliver the worksheet to the owner for making payment.And believe me all distribution maybe done within 21st May. That's how a real dedicated campaign manager should act, as yahoo always earned respect from the community only bcoz of this. All this fucking things happened to taas only because they chose the wrong manager because of less fee.

We are working on contacting him to change the settings. Really sorry about that!)  2. While the bounty pool had a set number for each program; there is a possibility where someone did not actively meet the requirement to get their reward; thus lowering the amount of distribution. This should be resolved and recalculated/spread out.  3. It was decided by the team to send the tokens in form of ""batch"" so that it can be quicker for our bounty hunters to get their dues.  So far, 90% of the bounties were given to the hunters; the last 10% being mined right now and on the way to distribution.

How are you all doing?  My name is Samuel. I would like to take the time to address some of your concerns and; I hope; answer your questions.      Quote from: ludbega on May 30, 2017, 04:06:25 PM Same for me, still waiting the bounties, and not for sell directly. But still have hope, probably not so well placed, but it's ok, i have my time.  But clearly than some news adds will be appreciate.  We understand your concerns about a possible lack of communication within the project.  The team has been really busy with the recent events after closing the ICO (putting in place the the cryptographic audit, dealing with the external factors of the accounting firm, etc...) and the for us; the fastest way to address problems/questions is on Telegram. There wasn't a ""lot of blog posts"" since there wasn't any real need for any. Statements and official announcements are not to be taken lightly; they are only made when there is some important content to lay out to the public.  On another note; we are currently working on a platform that will really help and improve the communication between the team and the community while the project is being put together and advancing. This new platform will have a lot of features; one of them being an artificial intelligence with a learning database to answer our investor's questions, an offline FAQ, and many other things. The cryptographic audit will also provide a lot of information; saving and displaying balances while providing daily snapshots.  Concerning the bounties; we've had a couple problems to fix regarding the distribution. The first batch has been distributed and we are ready to hand the second one; closing the subject afterwards. Jamal (the person in charge of the program), also had some internet issues recently. I agree that it is unfortunate and we are working as fast as possible to give everyone the rewards they are entitled to get.  Our goal is to make a strong, healthy and profitable ecosystem. It does of course take some time; but we are working hard and are thrilled by the upcoming future for the project.",False

They gathered $7,963,119.63 worth of cryptos, and took 30% for themselves from the start. So let'see what they're in possession of.  3,459.59BTC, 43,368.00USD, 45,261.90ETH, 193,562.04USDT - all of these went from just short of $8M in value to $13098989.62. That's $5135869.99 worth of profits for the whole sum, but let's remove the 30% they kept for themselves, we still have $3595108.993 in profit.  They issued a total of 8,146,001 tokens - so that's more than $0.44 in profit PER TOKEN. That's ABSOLUTELY INSANE - considering that $1 got you more than a token that's almost 50% profit before the first divident is due. The divident will be half of it - so $0.22 per token, and $0.11 added value in BTC per token.  And all of this math is considering they NEVER put money into ICO-s or other profitable coins. If they actually started investing and put something into Ripple, PIVX, DGB or some of the other booming coins we'll get even more than that.  The realistic value of this token even now is $3. I moved 27% of my entire portfolio into TaaS, and if I could afford to buy more - I would.",False

The only way you could have ur last chance to get cheap TaaS is to wait for the bounties giveaway ( cause most of the bounties hunter are in for BTC and will sell their TaaS ), but TaaS team will announce some news at the same time, so it's gonna be a trader dream at that moment.",False

I think I can answer your question in a few months or a year when I experienced both products for a while.  ICONOMI is mentioned in the FAQ on TaaS website.  17 - What’s the difference between TaaS and ICONOMI?  ICONOMI is a great project with a wonderful team. As far as we understand, they are building an investment platform and will also have an open fund for anyone to invest in. However, ICONOMI and TaaS are not direct competitors because we offer different products and solutions. 1. TaaS is a closed-end fund, meaning it is open for investments exclusively during the ICO. It cannot accept additional investments after its completion. 2. We offer levels of transparency no other finance blockchain project currently can, thanks to Cryptographic Audit (CA) technology that we built. It is a set of complex tools that monitor trading activity and hash data onto a blockchain for anyone to validate. Our development team is in 5 countries right now, with more than 10 people working on it exclusively. You can read all about it in the white paper at http://taas.fund. 3. We offer a token, TaaS, that shares 50% of TaaS fund profits every quarter, executed and governed by an Ethereum smart contract. No other project is doing this at the moment.  source: https://taas.fund/faq.html#answer17",False

Be fair please in bounty situation! And again we will see a lot of money in one hands. Let me explain the real truth for you and for community. The problem is one! Official ICO project developers always create two separate topics - about project and bounty thread. Russian translator targetmlrd doing his job well. But he is cunning and greedy! He understood: to earn much he does not create separate bounty topic. As a result - hundreds of the same stupid messages like ""when twitter bounty"", ""how to claim"", """"where is my bounty"" and many others. And he answers them many times. Say please, how this helps for the project? Many russians (and not only russians) created a lot of multiaccounts on BTT to earn by signature campaigns. But the problem - they don't know English and forced to write the same messages only in russian topic from each their multiaccounts. Other languages translators are not active in their threads, because it is not actual. Those participants (french, german, chinesse and others) read and write in official English thread! By this reason (russian bounty questions spamming) translator targetmlrd earned bounty about 70 000 $ in Edgeless (2000 posts). He grabbed more: eGAAS, aeternity, TaaS, exscudo and others. And the same situation in Taas now – more 2000 posts in russian thread already. There are twice as many messages as in the official thread! Because almost all messages are about bounty in russian thread. And in all those ICO projects he did not created separate Bounty thread. Guess, why?  And again in TaaS he will receive about 70% of tokens against other 20 translators!?  Main reason of that - stupid rule ""5 stakes per post"". 100 stakes for translating and 5 stakes per 1 any message: but it's only 20 spam messages for a few minutes = 100 stakes. CRAZY! History! During 2016 there was NOT this rule in many ICO projects. This stupid rule was created by ICONOMI only. And all ICOs in 2017 copy and paste it. And as a result Translate/Moderate bounty became ""Bounty only for russian"", i called them so!     To be fair:  1. all developers must pay for moderation separately at first.  2. must be about 0,1 stakes per post and to count only posts made by moderator (if one common bounty pool with translation stakes)  3. necessarily translators must create separate Bounty thread.  4. also must be maximum limit.

I know that 5 millions is a lot, but despited the Iconomi whitepaper that werent that ''awesome'', they raised way more and yet, they achieved their goals.  TaaS founders, and team, have way more to earn by going the way they mentionned, than to go by scamming people.

We're in the explosing crypto world, returns are way higher than in the traditional world.  Last month alone I've made 40% on my PTF (500% annualized). This month I'm on track for 70%. Maybe I did some good choices but I have the feeling that if I had just bought everything and hold the result would be very high as well. People are becoming rich in very short periods of time. This sound scammy in a 7% a year stock market, but not in a young and explosing industry like this one.  For me Bitup is basically a crowdsource loan with high interest rate so that the owners can trade cryptos.  There is no proof it is a ponzi. And yes it is risky to invest in these kind of company that obviously are doing a poor job at bringing confidence to their clients (the fake partnership is just very dumb), and it wwould require more than 35% annually IMO. But don't call it a scam if you don't have a proof.  This guy 'ICO Alert', is just presenting the fact that BitUp is a ponzi as a widely accepted one, this is just dishonnest. I think people taking investment advices from a teenager with 30 ETH-equivalent invested in the crypto world are the real fools here.  And nobody is explaining how a closed end fund with public trading activity can be a ponzi... How does it work technically? Taas guys will make huge profit from their 25% fees on returns, no need to stole money from their customers and ruin their reputaion. The fees are very high, and it is kind of an indication as well. No need to put such a high fee if you're a scammer and just want to run with the money.",False

Well,if you still have questions of that sort within the community , means some of your messages are still unclear to the public. Have read the White Paper and this thread before asking the previous question.The interviews and speeches look more like a general presentation. The Investment Methodology in White Paper runs: Tokens - Markets Volatility - Altcoins Investment - Kepler (somewhere in the future we will see ""a state-of-the-art intelligence system"").  All right, so for now(with Kepler comping soon) we have Altcoins Investment, since tokens and markets volatility aren't some new words to the bitcoin community. So, your company is going to Trade Altcoins, right? Then what is the difference between your company and any other crypto trading company(or solo trader/invester)?    2.If the person answering my questions on FB was you, then you should remember that your ""clear response"" was "" Please formulate the full question and I will pass it to the management"".Still haven't got any respond from the management on FB.

They are adapting to fit within the legal/regulatory environment and to anybody with brains that is a good thing- they are literally trail blazing into uncharted territory and apparently you think it would be better if they aren't able or willing to adapt to problems as they arise. They had a map of where they wanted to go and how to get there from the very beginning, but even though they find there is a boulder blocking the path during their journey you don't think they should update the map or readjust their path to reflect that. Real smart...  Anyways, I'm also investing a bit in TaaS because in addition to understanding the value in being adaptive to a new and changing environment I understand the value in diversification and also that this is not a zero-sum-game and that both projects can succeed (they aren't even that similar, Iconomi is making a DAMP and a few indexes of their own while TaaS is a CEF).",False

It can therefore legitimately claim in the future credit as a pioneer in that service and respective model.  <Investment Methodology>: A main reason why many conservative and veteran traders shy away from the cryptocurrency market is volatility (price fluctuation). TaaS has clearly identified that and proposes a strategy that will mitigate that volatility by reserving 10% to hedge against negative movements. Investments will focus on blockchain game-changers (e.g. Ethereum) and many others to come when considering how young the industry is. Researching the complexities of new ICO’s is something that common investors are not able to do because it requires blockchain expertise which TaaS demonstrates to have.  <Kepler>: In addition to the above, TaaS is further diversifying by building an actual product which the market is in dire need of. If Kepler will be anything close to the Bloomberg terminal, TaaS will be able to offer it for a monthly fee, and guess where 50% of Kepler’s income will go: to you. Half of profits will be distributed to TaaS holders via a smart contract. This further diversifies the group from purely trading and offers a steady income for TaaS token holders.  <TaaS Token>: Reinvesting 25% of monthly profits to the fund means that TaaS tokens will increase in value over time as long as the blockchain industry value grows. If you are convinced that blockchain is the future, you should be convinced that TaaS will be profitable. The only way for TaaS to fail, is if the entire blockchain industry will fail, which we all know will not be the case.  These were just some of my thoughts; I haven’t even mentioned other innovations such as audit transparency for both investors and auditors  @jamalaezaz: I’ve prepared a translation for the bounty campaign in Greek, but unfortunately I’m new to this forum and can’t post images here. Can I send the translated images to you or someone else to post? Is that even possible?  Can’t wait for the ICO!",False

So even if lets say bounties or early investors with massive bonuses dump in theory TaaS will buy back those tokens over time from market increasing rest of it value. While in ICONOMI they require profits + platform + good trading to get money so start of ICONOMI when it pays off is longer and have many variables. Project will deliver more but that cost time and effort new clients ext in general it will take a lot of more time than TaaS. TasS managers can start trading faster.Earned income goes directly to token holders via buybacks. From my perspective Tass require less work to get return for investors. With good trading they will fast pump TaaS if they will be bad at trading all fails. Iconomi even with bad trading can be profitable because it will have those automatic indexes when they not itereferate with trading and platform where others trades.  In summary: ICONOMI: higher quality product but needs more to be polish TaaS: less complex but gives people that what they want DIRECT own stock buybacks  In theory TaaS token should always go up because team will burn tokens from market putting there 25% of income, Past experience from coin like Cinicoin those folks wanted buy 3strong LTC miners and make buyback own stock but failed so not all solution works forever. while ICONOMI price depends on dividends that are vary from market conditions customer base, trading history, crypto bull/bear markets,legal stuff.  Those projects are quite different in build. If you like buybacks TaaS will officially do it ICONOMI today not. I spotted buyback and exchange arbitrage as something different not offered by ICONOMI, while ICONOMI offers share in 6000BTC fund,TaSS offer 75% of investment goes to fund so no number here. ICONOMI will deliver dividends from 2 platforms but need customers, marketing, seciurity while TaaS will mostly trade for profit. Looking at that TaaS should be delivered faster and have less costs but that will be traded for scalability. TaaS once have those fund online will make mostly profit from it, while ICONOMI by expanding user base can rise with rising customer base. ICONOMI have higher rated task to accomplish like 2 years while TaaS can be fast.  It is hard to judge both projects today, in year we will see results in numbers of both I guess. I like self buy backs but cinicoin proved me that it can be overrated. What are risk with TaaS same as everywhere exchange hacks, fail at trading but this is common for ALL such projects.",False

The whitepaper is correct when it states that loads of altcoins are correlated.  However, to put that in other words, many rose during an altcoin bubble, then crashed later.  In the opening post of this thread, the global altcoins index is plotted in a graph which ends around November 1st.  Since now is 3 months later, it should show through at least around the start of February instead.  It looks like the index was dropping after perhaps a bubble peak, so I would want to see what happened to it over subsequent months.  With that said, a second graph in your whitepaper possibly already shows what would have happened: Near the start of November and beyond, the altcoin indices crashed hard.  Since your fund apparently would have had not more than 30% of assets in Bitcoin (probably in completely unleveraged positions), even the gain in the Bitcoin portion meanwhile would probably not have prevented your total fund doing far less well from November onwards than a simple 100% Bitcoin unleveraged HODLer.  Anyway, earlier estimated percentage gains in fiat terms over the 2016-to-now time period aren't automatically particularly impressive to the crypto community.  It isn't hard to make money in a bull market.  Bitcoin itself went from $434 on January 1st 2016 to $1108 now, 255% of its original value, and that is for a mere HODLer with no use of leverage and stop-limit tactics.  Although use of stop limits is better, a simple crude 2.3:1 leverage bitcoin long position would never have been liquidated and could have been turned into 500% or more of its original value meanwhile.  You plan on a ""maximum"" of up to 30% investments in Bitcoin, per the whitepaper, and, again, it is not apparent that you would be using any leverage or stop limits, so someone might be as well or better off just parking their funds in their own Bitcoin wallet.  ...  Besides, if you are going to choose your various altcoins well, I am not seeing clear evidence of it so far.  It  looks like a large portion of your investments will be in presently high marketcap semi-old altcoins like those in the correlation table in your whitepaper (aside from whatever exact coins are the small marketcap group).  I am not convinced that anything much like an altcoin index fund really works well, especially keeping in mind that 2017 is not necessarily going to be a repeat of 2016.  I actually tried nearly the equivalent of an index fund back when I was very new to crypto (by casually investing in and holding a huge multitude of coins), but soon learned better.  Some altcoins do make great gains, but typically the bulk of those gains are early, meaning that buying in months later after the first pumps is usually too late for much further return.  For instance, an early investor in Ethereum or Dash would have made money, but those are probably lousy choices now, in fact with the latter at a bubble peak about to crash back down to a much lower support level, IMO.  Of course, diversification still has value in risk management, e.g. not all one altcoin alone, but pros tend to invest in a very select handful at the right times, not much resembling just an index fund.  Only very few altcoins are really suitable for continuously sustained HODLing, and worthiness is determined not by already-priced-in gains long past but by a far more special characteristic: present undervaluing.  For most other coins, it is particularly key to know when it is pump time and when it is dump time.   We will not be involved in any pump-and-dump schemes.  As a somewhat experienced trader knowing how much of crypto *really* operates, I would be more interested if you were going to do them.  New players who don't think in pump and dump terms often get burnt.  If not explicitly joining big pumping-and-dumping whales, at least much success can depend on riding the waves made by them.  ----------------------------  Incidentally, given thread length and other indicators of community interest (as noticeable if having seen many past Bitcointalk ICOs), your ICO is presently enroute to end with tens to hundreds of Bitcoin, or even less -- not thousands.  Hopefully you are aware of that.  It takes fancier graphics and more to obtain thousands of bitcoin in an ICO.  If your large team is real, the likelihood of being able to pay their salaries for long seems iffy.  ----------------------------  With that said, the whitepaper's description of the Kepler product does sound potentially quite useful, for those who would rather make their own investing decisions but could benefit from new ways to monitor and handle a bunch of altcoins at once.  Although you are probably not going to change plans based on a random poster's comment, if I were you, I would make the ICO about Kepler itself, at least as well.  Specifically, let funds be contributed for Kepler development, and then, in return, investors receive money from future Kepler sales, as well as having a license themselves.  Tying Kepler sales revenue to a coin could be done by making purchases of in other currencies (e.g. dollars) involve the system temporarily converting the funds to the new coin (with a special exception only if negligible exchange liquidity at that moment), then permanently burning 50% of transacted coins.  In the process, the value of the rest of the coins would go up as more Kepler purchases happened.  ICO investors and early buyers would be rewarded.  The preceding is a little bit like how PEPECASH works but for a different product.  If you made an ICO for that, added a bunch of fancy graphics, and had a business plan just requiring under 100 Btc for the first stage of a two-stage ICO (the second stage gaining more funds after public demonstration of a partial alpha version), it could really work.

I too think Taas team should concentrate more funds and time into the development of Kepler as it does have potential to make big gains for the Taas token holders in future.  Although, I feel TaaS can collect more than 100 bitcoin and it would be great if the team can raise around 2 to 4 million dollars worth bitcoin/ether at least!  The team should have thought about this for sure and I am looking to see how Kepler would be developed and marketed and above all, how the crypto community would receive Taas and Kepler.",False

It is difficult to predict at the moment our distribution, but surely we will have to advise market cap of different assets to understand the weight pressure we can put on separate assets.  Marina_T, thank you for the question -- we have been asked this before. No, $10m is not necessarily our target for fundraising. Our target is to offer 101,000,000 TaaS tokens, each valued at $1.  $10m is the cap that supports Global Cryptocurrency Index approach, as described in the white paper. The goal of that Index was to show the overall growth of blockchain markets. The formula behind that calculation was simple; you take 1BTC and spread it across 100 altcoins, or .01 each. The result was the chart shown in the white paper. It is not the investment approach we will be using in the real markets, however it was good enough to show the significant growth of the assets value in 2016.

I will give it one last chance.  1. Why not capping the number of tokens you will issue and let the ICO participants set their initial price? The only asset you should set is the number of tokens (shares). The price of each share is not for you to decide, but for the ICO participants/market.  2. Why not setting a cap for the ICO? You should know how much maximum funds you need and cap it accordingly. I mean a real, realistic cap target and not that 101,000,000 USD.  3. This Cryptographic Audit sounds a lot buzz words and nothing much. Please explain how it is more? --Already agreed that  the view only APIs provide some level of transparency, but I am missing to see the high security standards --Already agreed that ""most of the trading volume is happening on Poloniex and Kraken"". ""no investment fund is using Proof of Reserves tool to validate account balances"" - isn't it a transparency tool, similar to the view only APIs? I still don't see any Cryptographic Audit here..  4. Escrow - can you please answer clearly to that very simple question? Will you have escrow (escrow, as ICO money will held by third-party), if yes who is the escrow team?  What does it mean ""Chief executive team will be holding access to operating funds""? Someone from the company? multisig? how many signatures are needed?",False

Let me know if you have an additional follow-up.  1. Because in the past there have been different price-setting ICO models, and we decided to go with a fixed price due to the nature of our ICO -- and that is a token acts as a Proof-of-Membership in a fund. Due to a profit distribution system we have, it was more natural to go with a very well understood, fixed price. When tokens will be introduced to free trade on the exchanges, price discovery will have to reflect on a Net Asset Value (and that is the value of a single token within an investment structure), and the starting point in itself makes no difference, be it a $1, $5 or $0.0001.  2. Same answer as I have given earlier. 101,000,000 TaaS tokens is the cap we are willing to sell. Winklevoss ETF is raising $100M, so we see the number as adequate given the market.  3. API Keys and Proof of Reserves provide transparency tools, you are right. In fact, all of the tools are designed to provide transparency insight. And that is the point, to make sure that company's use of investor's capital is highly secured.  4. Escrow (or, as I said, ""use of proceeds"") will be governed by HLB International, hlbi.com. Follow the link to find out more about the company.  5. For obvious security reasons, I cannot reveal this information -- but yes, funds are accessible exclusively from the inside of the team.  Quote from: MoveCrypto on February 10, 2017, 02:01:03 PM The view-only API keys sound like they could be a disadvantage.  Then people can learn your trading patterns.

I believe most questions are still unanswered.. (highlighted them for your convenience).  1. Quote In fact, $1 price in the context of itself means absolutely nothing I am not a financial wizard, but it kind of makes me wonder.. How come the price that one pays means nothing?  Why not capping the number of tokens you will issue and let the ICO participants set their initial price? The only asset you should set is the number of tokens (shares). The price of each share is not for you to decide, but for the ICO participants/market. Still waiting for an answer about the second part - ""Why you decided to have a bonus structure based on total amount of funds collected and not based on time?""  I will add a new ICO-related question, hope you don't mind: Why not setting a cap for the ICO? You should know how much maximum funds you need and cap it accordingly. I mean a real, realistic cap target and not that 101,000,000 USD.   2. I am sorry, but all I see is more buzz words - ""The goal of TaaS is to provide maximum transparency for investors to set high security standards for blockchain industry"" The view only APIs provide some level of transparency, but I am missing to see the high security standards.  What is so special about ""Proof of Reserves""? You anyway will need to use Poloniex, Kraken, and maybe another 1-2 major exchanges, like 99% of all traders do. What am I missing here?  Another unanswered question: Proof of reserve - basically you will provide the public address of the crypto asset, so people can view the balance and transactions? Is there more than that in this ""Cryptographic Audit"" feature?  3. Quote Smart contract does not hold any funds -- it only disperses them whenever they are deposited to it. Funds are stored cold-storage. So the smart contract does not interact with the money in any way? If so, who has control over the cold storage?  4. Escrow refers to money held by third-party on behalf of transacting parties. I guess the question is Who will hold (have control, private keys and such) over the funds collected during the ICO?",False

Quote from: Daparski on February 04, 2017, 03:41:03 PM Quote from: TaaS on February 04, 2017, 02:49:45 PM Quote from: Daparski on February 04, 2017, 11:50:48 AM Few questions to TaaS team:  1. ICO structure: -- Why do you set a fixed price to your token at $1? Why not $0.50 or $10? Wouldn't it make more sense to have a fixed number of tokens, and let the ICO participants set the initial price (number of tokens/total funds raised)? -- Why you decided to have a bonus structure based on total amount of funds collected and not based on time? It looks ""pumpy"", like those power hour bonuses. Wouldn't it make more sense to have a weekly based bonus decrease?  2. This Cryptographic Audit sounds a lot buzz words and nothing much. Please explain how it is more based on the following: -Proof of Reserves - everybody is using the same exchanges, nothing ""cryptographic"" here -Auditable Exchange accounts - good idea, how does a view-only API key fits into this bombastic buzz phrase ""Cryptographic Audit""? -Proof of reserve - basically you will provide the public address of the crypto asset, so people can the balance and transactions? Is there more than that in this ""Cryptographic Audit"" feature?   3. If I understood correctly, the smart contract will hold the funds, is that correct? If so, it is a BIG BIG BIG NO GO. We had The DAO fiasco, and smart contract holding and managing funds is still couple of years ahead. If you think you can put all the honey in one pot and be smarter than the entire community - well, good luck. I can't see how investors will keep their funds in a smart contract.  4. Do you have an escrow?  thanks  Thank you for questions, Daparski.  1. There is a misunderstanding that a price of a token is high. In fact, $1 price in the context of itself means absolutely nothing -- the price was chosen arbitrarily so that every investor, no matter how large or small, could participate.  2. Please read white paper for more information to your questions. I will note that Cryptographic Audit is not a technology in itself, but a name for multiple monitoring and auditing techniques that we created and assembled.

We decided to base the bonus structure on the amount of capital raised and not on time, because we are an investment fund and it makes more sense to dilute supply with bonuses based on our operating capital. Bonuses could be based on time but we believe it would be unfair towards investors, however we indeed considered it initially.  You are right, a view-only API key is not the ""high security"" technology -- but we still decided to include it to offer those investors who do not have technical capabilities to validate other tools still have an opportunity to watch our trading activity.  Yes, while most of the trading volume is happening on Poloniex and Kraken -- you are right -- no investment fund is using Proof of Reserves tool to validate account balances. This is the primary difference that separates us from the crowd.  Chief executive team will be holding access to operating funds.

As far as we understand, they are building an investment platform and will also have an open fund for anyone to invest in.  However, ICONOMI and TaaS are not direct competitors because we offer different products and solutions.  1. TaaS is a closed-end fund, meaning it is open for investments exclusively during ICO. It cannot accept additional investments after its completion. 2. We offer levels of transparency no other finance blockchain project currently has -- thanks to Cryptographic Audit (CA) technology that we built. It is a set of complex tools that monitor trading activity, hashes data onto a blockchain for anyone to validate. Our development team is in 5 countries right now, with more than 10 people working on it exclusively. You can read all about it in the white paper at http://taas.fund. 3. We offer a token -- TaaS -- that shares 50% of TaaS fund profits every quarter, executed and governed by an Ethereum smart contract. No other project is doing it at the moment.  We will be happy to clarify other details or answer questions if you have any. We are excited about the project and hope you get the best understanding of its revolutionary potential  ",False

We will give preference to using exchanges that have Proof of Solvency (PoS) implemented; cold storage reserves can be audited, as in Poloniex and Kraken. AUDITABLE EXCHANGE ACCOUNTS. For each account that is going to be used for trading on the exchanges we will create a view-only API key that will allow anyone to verify the balance and trade history of the account. We believe that this does not increase security risk, as it is already known that exchanges are managing large volumes of cryptocurrency and we have an account with every major exchange. TaaS will be hosting an audit page with full list of API keys and aggregate account information, automatically pulled from the exchanges by our service. It looks similar to Tether implementation. PROOF OF RESERVES FOR NON-EXCHANGE ACCOUNTS. For all non-exchange accounts, such as cold storage addresses, that will be used for storage of our funds we will provide a proof of ownership: transaction with special marker in OP_RETURN (or similar feature, depending on a blockchain protocol) will be sent from each account in order to verify that the account in question belongs to TaaS. PROOF OF RESERVES FOR FIAT ACCOUNTS. We will use TLSNotary or similar solution to provide a cryptographic proof of fiat currency reserves in our bank and exchange accounts. In short, this can be achieved by recording SSL signatures of online banking sessions. REGULAR BLOCKCHAIN SNAPSHOTS. To have the proof that nobody mismanaged data between the audits, a special smart contract will be developed to hold the daily snapshots of audit data forever. The contract will be supplied with a convenient contract explorer.   We believe that security measures stated above will provide full transparency of our financials.",False

Here is how Reserve Fund works:  built from the 25% investment profit cannot be less than 10% and greater than 30% of the total portfolio size provides low-risk exposure to fiat-denominated gain of blockchain space  Quote To illustrate the point, assume that TaaS collected 1000 BTC during ICO and constituted a 100 BTC (10%) Reserve Fund. Next, TaaS reported a 100 BTC Quarter-on-Quarter profit. In this scenario, TaaS token owners get to collect 50 BTC, with 25 BTC reinvested back into portfolio as a part of a Reserve Fund, growing RF to 12.5%. Should numbers in this scenario stay the same and the process repeats several times, RF will grow to 30% eventually. On the other hand, if an active trading portfolio balance shrinks, Reserve Fund will cover the loss. It will reestablish a balance as reported during a previous quarter. This technique allows us to mitigate risk, secure payout liquidity and take more aggressive positions simultaneously.  When  RF grows to 30% of TaaS portfolio, that is actually good news for token owners. As maximum cap (30%) is reached, the 25% reinvestment is going to more risky asset allocation, meaning TaaS token owners are exposed to higher-returns assets, and at the end of next quarter will collect presumably higher earnings.",False

ICO structure: -- Why do you set a fixed price to your token at $1? Why not $0.50 or $10? Wouldn't it make more sense to have a fixed number of tokens, and let the ICO participants set the initial price (total funds raised/number of tokens)? -- Why you decided to have a bonus structure based on total amount of funds collected and not based on time? It looks ""pumpy"", like those power hour bonuses. Wouldn't it make more sense to have a weekly based bonus decrease?  2. This Cryptographic Audit sounds a lot buzz words and nothing much. Please explain how it is more based on the following: -Proof of Reserves - everybody is using the same exchanges, nothing ""cryptographic"" here -Auditable Exchange accounts - good idea, how does a view-only API key fits into this bombastic buzz phrase ""Cryptographic Audit""? -Proof of reserve - basically you will provide the public address of the crypto asset, so people can view the balance and transactions? Is there more than that in this ""Cryptographic Audit"" feature?   3. If I understood correctly, the smart contract will hold the funds, is that correct? If so, it is a BIG BIG BIG NO GO. We had The DAO fiasco, and smart contract holding and managing funds is still couple of years ahead. If you think you can put all the honey in one pot and be smarter than the entire community - well, good luck. I can't see how investors will keep their funds in a smart contract.  4.
