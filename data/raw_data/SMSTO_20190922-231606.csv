The amount of SMSTO balance determines Miner’s priority in traffic distribution. This means that Miners with a higher amount of SMSTO will be able to sell more text messages on daily basis and gain higher financial return. Nodes with higher SMSTO balance will also earn higher fee percentage per transaction. This creates significant demand for SMSTO from the side of Miners and Nodes which are actively participating in the system.  On the other hand, there will be a demand for SMSTO from the side of companies which would like to buy delivery of text messages. They need to buy SMSTO in order for their SMS campaign to be executed.  If you put it in perspective, you will see that there is a demand for SMSTO from all members of the system. SMS miners and Nodes will want to accumulate certain amount of SMSTO on their balances in order to retain high priority in the mining process. At the same time, sending entities would also need to buy SMSTO from other members in order to execute SMS campaign. This will inevitably create a natural scarcity of tokens and therefore increasing demand while having limited supply.",False

And you are one of our smaller clients. 2. Our whitepaper has been updated since the last version you are reffering to. In addition a new update coming soon in a few days. 3. Your product from 2016 has no relationship with what you are trying to create now.  If anyone has any questions regarding our project please ask directly and do not refer to people who are bias .

Key difference between our solutions is that we will allow the general public to sell SMS which will have bigger global impact, adaptability of the app and appeal while SMSCHAIN will focus on few token holders.",False

We have made our research about your project before making the post and we expressed our opinion about the advantages which we currently have in comparison to your project. Stating such advantages has nothing to do with badmouthing.  1. You definitely have significant experience on the A2P SMS market. What you don't have experience in is SMS quality testing, which is essential part of any similar project to function. If you do not have proper quality control implemented, you will constantly face issues with fake DLRs and general low quality delivery problems. We have certainly much more experience in the domain of SMS quality testing and this is a simple fact which we have stated. I am sure you will be able to figure this out yourself, however, it will definitely take more time for you since you have to do it from scratch.  2. Unfortunately, we are not monitoring your white paper on daily basis. However, we had a quick look at it now and we still see almost no technical details about how the blockchain part of your system is expected to work. You cannot compare it to our detailed explanation (ref: https://smschain.org/wp_smschain.pdf?v=1.2.6 pages 14-20 ). We dedicate at least 6 full pages of our white paper to blockchain infrastructure details and we do not see anything comparable in yours. This can mean one of 3 things: 1. You are still behind in research when it comes to the blockchain part of the system. 2. You have done the research, however, for some reason you still have not added it to your white paper. 3. There is a detailed description in your white paper, we just can't find it. The only relevant technical information we have found in your white paper was reference to Plasma + IOTA. Hence, we are inclined to believe the 1st case.  3. Our product which is live since 2016 had direct relation to what we are creating. It serves as a prototype of a testing node, which will be an essential part of SMSCHAIN network.  P.S. we haven't promoted our website on any of your channels as yet, is it ok for us to do it as you did it in our thread?  P.P.S ""Key difference between our solutions is that we will allow the general public to sell SMS which will have bigger global impact, adaptability of the app and appeal while SMSCHAIN will focus on few token holders."" - that is not the case. SMSCHAIN will also allow general public to sell SMS and will not focus only on token holders.",False

I would say, there are 2 main differences:  1. Birdchain does not have embedded delivery quality control, at least from what we can see in their white paper. Without Proof-of-delivery the system would not work properly and SMSCHAIN has a lot of experience in this field and has already created tools which enable the system to automatically control the delivery quality, which can be faked otherwise. I am sure that Birdchain will realise this at some point and implement something similar, however, it will take much longer time as they have no experience in this field at all, while we have a working solution which is currently being used by most top SMS aggregators in the world.  2. Birdchain is quite behind in terms of development as well as conceptually. Their white paper hardly describes how the blockchain part of their platform would function, they do not provide any technical details, unlike us. We already made a lot of research and development on this subject and we already know how to implement every aspect of our system.  Overall, Birdchain just came up with the concept, however, did not have enough time to think about the technical side of implementation. In contrast, we already have working prototypes of the product and it has been live since 2016.",False

We would like to kindly remind you that this is an English-speaking branch of the forum.  1. Terms and conditions, as well as regulations vary significantly from country to country and also depend on mobile network operators. In some countries it is allowed to send A2P (Application 2 Person) messages from SIM cards, in others it might not. You have to check the terms and conditions of your mobile network operator in order to determine whether your service provider can block your SIM card or not. Please ensure that you comply with terms and conditions of your mobile network provider.  By the way, SMS aggregators, such as you guys at sms-rassilka.com can also become part of the network and offer your delivery capabilities to all members.  2. Sender ID  3. The speed of delivery will depend on the number of Miners we have in a particular country. The throughput might be relatively low initially and grow gradually as more and more Miners join our network.  4. Yes, the delivery receipts will be supported. But more interestingly, the Proof-of-Delivery is provided with embedded Testing infrastructure, that consists of Testing subsystem which mixes test text messages into live traffic. Such embedded testing process is a way to prove that the miner works well and doesn’t abuse the system by providing fake delivery receipts.",False

Let me illustrate it with a practical example:  You can send 5000 SMS/month from your phone with your current mobile monthly subscription. You normally send only 100 SMS/month and the rest of the messages are unused. With SMSCHAIN app you will be able to sell 4900 of your text messages to companies which need to deliver SMS messages to the subscribers and you allow them to do it from your phone (of course, you will also have full control over the type of messages they send). In such case, you can sell your 4900 SMS at 1 cent each and earn 49$.  If you pay per each SMS message with your provider, it might not work for you of course, unless you sell your SMS at a higher price than you buy it from your provider.",False

For example, you can opt to deliver messages only for Google, Facebook etc, which are transactional (one-time passwords, alerts) and non-marketing in nature. If you would want to deliver marketing messages as well, there will be an option also. However, you will have the full control over the types of messages",False

Besides that, various operators have different criteria when it comes to blocking SIM cards. Most of them look in volumes which are sent from SIM cards on daily basis and block the SIM card if this limit is exceeded. From our experience, it is safe to send a few hundred messages a day without having any issues in most of the countries we know.",False
