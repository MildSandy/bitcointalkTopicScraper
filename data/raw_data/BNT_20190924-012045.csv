Often, the legal teams for an organization advise teams not to make promises about the future price of a token, or try to influence it. So while some might assume that the developers not influencing the price is due to arrogance or a similar unappealing trait, it's often due to a desire to comply with regulation.

Yet, unlike cryptocurrencies‚Äô utility tokens, the value of which is directly linked to the growth or decline in the use of the token, a stablecoin value is pegged to a stable real-world asset, from commodities to currencies. Another significant difference between cryptocurrencies and stable coins is that any stablecoin value has to be backed by assets held in reserve by the stablecoin issuer. This means that stablecoins are centralized by definition, as there has to be a central authority in charge of holding the backing assets, supervising the assets management and providing the documentation for audits."" https://ban.cr/stable  More on why Bancor's Head of Marketing, Anna Stone, is optimistic about using stablecoins to fight poverty: https://ban.cr/stable",False

This is one of my favorite interviews as well, as Galia has a true flair for breaking down concepts in a way that is easy to understand. This Q&A in particular is great:   Quote Can you elaborate on what you mean by ‚Äúthe trust is actually in the trustlessness?‚Äù  Meaning, we trust the system because we‚Äôve programmed it and designed it in a way that means we need not trust every user of the system in order to trust the system. And what does that mean? You don‚Äôt need to know every user of a dollar in order to trust that the dollar will buy a dollar‚Äôs worth of goods at the store, and the same with cryptocurrencies. You‚Äôre not going to know every person that uses BitCoin or Ether or Bancor or any other currency that you‚Äôre using. You can trust the system itself to behave in the way that it‚Äôs claimed to behave.",False
