Dropil has been very transparent with everything they are doing in all the aspects they can be. Surely I hope no here thinks they will get a snapshot of the trading algorithm or anything like that. IF Dropil has a bot they would never disclose the code publicly since their entire company is based off that bot. As with all great projects Dropil had a few hiccups the first week or so after launch, but everything was resolved quickly and smoothly.  If you have trouble contacting support try joining the telegram group and messaging @jmcalpine   @zmatar   @Vanko_McCoin   @PatrickDropil @DropilChris message them by typing those names into the dropil group chat with your message or searching those names in the group(without the @) and you should see the admin symbol next to them click there name and then send message. Dropil has already hit the top 100 on CMC, #87 was as high/low as it went.

After depositing drops the deposit page does not change at all and still asks to deposit more.

That would be acceptable if this was some alpha or beta version test of Dex, but not when you roll it out.  Secondly Arthur still does not let me use its features even though Arthur has been live for some time. It still has that same message telling me that to use it I have to have $50 worth of drops in my wallet or in Dex, which i do.  So at the moment I'm not very happy with the way it is working.

A: No, for any reason, at any time you are in control of your coins and may withdraw them.  Q: Are there benefits if I refer people? A: In short no, during normal operations there is no incentive offered from the company for referrals (There is an exception only during ICO for referrals, and for these there is no hold time, or minimum stipulations - the affiliate will be paid 5%, in drops, of the referrals first deposit).  Q: Are ""Drops"" tokens the only way to use the service, can I send USD, BTC, or other currency instead? A: Yes, Drops are required and the only currency accepted for use of the investment services.  Q: Why is the use of Drop required? A: Reason Drops are required: 1. To control the volume of assets managed by the smart investment algorithms. While the bots are able to make substantial returns on massive volume, there is a point of diminishing returns, and as such there is a hard cap in place to ensure all investors receive optimal portfolio performance. 2. The cap on the overall number of Drops ensures that value of the token also increases, which further benefits our customers, especially those who are long term investors. 3. By managing all in and out funds via Drops, all customers are free to cash out their Drops at partner exchanges into whatever currency suits them best. All transactions taking place in Drops also allows us to protect the anonymity and privacy of our customers.  Q: Do you have any back test data? A: We have back test and live data available.  Q: How long you guys have tested and what is the performance? A: Dex is actually a lot of bots, they all run and are controlled by an overarching strategy. The returns have always been very strong and even more importantly, reliable; depending on logic historically we have seen 2-6% gains per 30-day period. There is approximately a year of testing from our oldest, and still being used, logic.  Q: What crypto coins is the bot buying and trading? A: The coins being traded varies from strategy and market conditions, over 90% of trading is done among the following currencies.  Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Z-Cash, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Neo, and Dash.

Until then, here are some key differences.  We are not a lending service, and have no plan to become one.  In Dex you do NOT benefit, need, or even have the option, to have any down-line accounts, i.e. referrals, affiliates, or any pyramid structure at all.  There is no hold period on your funds at all; you may withdraw them at any time, and incur no fee.  The returns “promised” by many of these other services are too good to be true, we have significant experience with algo-based trading and have yet to see an option that can make the massive returns, to the large user base, scaled to large capital amounts, sustainable over a long period of time, match the profit these companies claim.  We do not grantee any specific numbers, this is after all trading and it cannot be 100% certain ever, however we do have plenty of historical data to estimate with accuracy expected returns and as you will see they are quite reasonable while still being very attractive relative to input required.   An amazing trader will always be able to beat an algorithm trader, and any bot claimed to be better is suspect.  Our product is not for the top 5% of traders, they don’t need it, out product if for the rest of the population, that does not have time, skills, or interest in full time trading but still wants a decent return on their investment.  To be very clear about the affiliate issue, we do offer one ONLY during the ICO period, and it is a simple incentive to spread awareness, when the system is live there is no benefit from having signed others up even during the ICO on your future trading.    Thanks for your interest!",False

Please read below:  In order to offer the highest level of security for the company’s continued legal operation without possible interference due to the uncertain regulatory nature currently surrounding the United States for cryptocurrency, Dropil will operate as an IBC going forward. This changes nothing on the user end of the operations. In order to complete all associated legal filings prior to accepting funds for participation in the ICO we must regrettably push back the start date of the presale to Friday the 26th.
