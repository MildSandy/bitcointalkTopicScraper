With the soft cap of $10 million reached days ago, the total  attracted funds exceeded $10.5 million, the company reports today.  The raised capital means that the project of helping millions of unbanked people around the world get loans and build credit is fully viable, and MicroMoney can now carry out its mission laid out in the whitepaper.   AMM tokens will be traded on a number of high profile exchanges such as HitBTC, Yobit, and others around November 25th or soon after.  The bonuses that were received by some participants will be automatically added to the amount of tokens received through donations and displayed along with the wallet balance, MicroMoney explained.   “This is a huge milestone in expanding our mission of helping the world’s unbanked enter the global financial system,” said MicroMoney’s co-founder Anton Dzyatkovsky. “We are grateful that we were able to get the support that we have now and this is just the beginning. We have a lot of work ahead of us.”  The company reports that 15% of the funding will be spent on further developing the platform and mobile applications and another 15% will be used for legal, operational and marketing framework.  Most of the money, 70%, will be used to help setup funds for payday loans.  Having entered more than six Southeast Asian markets, MicroMoney has developed a unique mobile application that allows to give out loans online by using smartphone data only, without a credit check.  Unbanked people in many countries can now obtain loans to manage their daily problems and build virtual credit history.                                  ",False

Today, MictoMoney extends its token distribution campaign for 7 days, due to popular demand. Now the $AMM token campaign will run until November 25, 2017, so that many more potential contributors who are waiting out the highly volatile market, can join in.  The news comes on the heels of MicroMoney raising its softcap from $1 million to $10 million. MicroMoney reached the new softcap yesterday.  The successful token distribution campaign with a social mission to help financially include the unbanked around the world was launched on October 18 on micromoney.io.  The pre-distribution phase helped gather more than $5 million alone. MicroMoney reports that AMM token campaign for potential investors has been extended from the initial closing date of November 18 due to an anticipated hard fork occurrence that is anticipated around that time. Hardfork is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid (or vice-versa), and as such requires all nodes or users to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software. This may create an extreme volatility in the blockchain market.  The innovative platform for integration of unbanked, MicroMoney has already distributed over 11.5 million tokens to date. It has created strategic alliances with dozens of blockchain market leaders and with companies that are currently going through ICOs. Most importantly, just days ago MicroMoney has announced that it will be listed on such influential exchange platforms as HitBTC, Yobit and Etherdelta.  Headquartered in Singapore, MicroMoney has been operating since 2015. MicroMoney plans to use attracted funds to further develop its business, expand to Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Nigeria and other countries and to add previously unbanked customers to the global economy.  MicroMoney’s mission is to help give over 2 billion of unbanked and underbanked people a chance to become part of the global financial system. The company has developed a unique protocol for that — through a mobile application based on blockchain technologies and neural networks. The application allows clients to get a loan through a smartphone with no collateral or paper-based document requirements and thus start on a credit history. By analyzing data on a client’s smartphone, the system decides whether to approve a loan or not.  Based on on its vast field experience and market research, MicroMoney has worked out business development algorithms in new countries. At the moment, MicroMoney is at the stage of launching several international franchises. Access to the company’s expertise in finance and credit will allow customers to enter emerging markets around the world.  Now, with the campaign extension, potential investors have one more week to join the token distribution campaign and help millions to improve their lives.  About MicroMoney Founded in 2015, MicroMoney International (micromoney.io) is a global fintech company offering financial services for the unbanked in the emerging markets, and access to the unbanked audience for banks, trade, and financial organizations. MicroMoney is a fast-growing company valued at $1.85 million, with over 85 employees in six international locations.  MicroMoney makes lending decisions using a proprietary, A.I. algorithms, machine learning, and Big Data based mobile scoring system. MicroMoney’s lending process doesn’t require any collateral or paper-based documentation. MicroMoney collects customers’ opt-in mobile phone data to establish potential borrowers’ credit score. MicroMoney uses the score to generate credit profiles, stored with MicroMoney Blockchain Credit Bureau, which in turn shares this data with financial institutions worldwide.

The ICO has a cap of $30m and a fixed price of $1 per token. Even with the bonus, assuming the ICO sells on on day 1, this is a maximum of 37.5m tokens for sale in the ICO.  So, where are the other tokens? Unless I missed it, there are 12.9m tokens unaccounted for, possibly more if the ICO goes on longer than 1 day. Was there are a pre-sale? If so, for much much were the tokens sold?",False

What is it about?  -         When two years ago I learned that 2 billion people in the world have no access to banking or basic financial services, I was shocked. They are not included into the global economy; they are deprived of some basic human right. Moreover, this system exists throughout the world and it is very difficult to change anything. It is a catch-22 situation – when a person needs to have a bank account in order to obtain a loan but financial institutions refuse to deal with unbanked people because they consider them too risky. Most unbanked people do not have credit histories and this is the main problem for them to become bank customers. Therefore, my company is here to change that. We provide an alternative solution for people to start building their credit and get loans, based on new technologies.

You got a very important question here. Let me start by saying that MicroMoney is not aiming at becoming a traditional bank. The project has two major focus: 1. Micro-lending for the people on the blockchain using crypto currencies. 2. Building Big Data Bureau for businesses using blockchain technology.   It's operations are completely focusing on using the crypto economy to bring financial services closer to the billions of unbanked and under-banked population worldwide while at the same time build the credit history of those customers to make them to become easily incorporated into the services of the traditional financial institutions, which is today very impossible to most of those target groups.",False

Thank you for having read the white paper. If you can refer back to page 38 I believe your concern was addressed there. In the last paragraph in my response above, I hinted on the fact that the value that the company will create will in turn drive its rise in value. In other words, the higher the demand and use for its products and services the higher the value of the company which will definitely reflect on the value of the token. This is because the token is the only key to access its products and services. You can read an extraction from the white paper below which explains it better...  Quote AMM token Value Proposition  MicroMoney only wants to be partnered with reliable and capable counterparties. Partners must share our values and prove that they are keen to invest their time, effort, and money to develop and expand the MicroMoney platform. As a way of proving their commitment to MicroMoney and its network, partners must be prepared to put their assets into the project in the form of holding in AMM tokens. This secures our operations for the future and it shows that partners are capable and willing to invest the relevant amount of money in order to support the platform.  Purchasing and holding AMM tokens today is a sound and legal notion. After a thorough analysis, our American legal firm, Gagnier Margossian LLP, has provided us with an opinion that the sale of AMM tokens cannot be interpreted as a securities offering by financial regulators in the United States, Singapore, and Canada. This means that AMM tokens, unlike many other tokens available in the crypto economy today, can be legally sold in the United States, one of the largest markets for cryptocurrencies.  Our management team has a development and expansion plan in place that indicates that MicroMoney will be operating in 47 countries within 5 years. By that time, we expect that 75% of our tokens will be held by our various partners. As MicroMoney’s network and operations grows, we will need a greater number of partners to best represent each franchise within those countries. With an increasing number of partners, more tokens will have to be bought from the market. This will ensure that the value of AMM tokens will rise. With the simple example above, we have illustrated that each country will require a significant number of tokens in order for that country’s operations to be well represented.  MicroMoney is operating in three countries today and has already signed agreements to expand to three new countries by the end of 2017 (Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines). With 47 countries left to expand to by 2022, and after having already identified another 50 countries where MicroMoney can expand to in the next 10 years, it is clear to see there will be no shortage of demand for AMM tokens in the market for at least the next decade. People who participate in the initial token distribution will see an incredible rise in value of their tokens as MicroMoney continues its expansion efforts.  The last paragraph says it all. Invest with confidence!",False

According to the United Nations, there are still more than 2 billion of the unbanked in the world and this has brought the topic of financial inclusion to the front burner. These people are excluded from local and global economies as they are still using cash and don't have access to basic financial services. Taking out a loan is a great challenge for them as well unless they have a credit history.  MicroMoney’s mission is to solve this problem. It was established as a microfinance institution and has sharpened the business to become decentralized Open Source Credit & Big Data Bureau on blockchain. Since 2015, Micromoney provides individuals and SMEs with short-term loans as the best solution for their financial needs. MicroMoney uses innovative risk scoring powered by artificial neural network and in the long run aims to help these 2 billion unbanked and underbanked people to build a multi-purpose digital identity, creditworthiness, and financial reputation without borders or intermediaries. In the end, the ultimate goal is to bring these people to the new global decentralized crypto economy.  A project of this nature, that is serving such a huge targeted population will definitely create value and increase in value in the nearest future. A good return on investment for investors is a possibility.",False
