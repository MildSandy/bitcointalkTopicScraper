Along with the expansion of the cryptocurrency market are new threats, including ‘scam’ projects, and more importantly, hacking incidents on cryptocurrency exchanges.  Hacking Hacking erodes confidence and represents the main threat to the value of cryptocurrencies. Efforts to refund investors for damages by some hacked exchanges have been slow, leading to uncertainty about how long repayment processes take. Incodium coin (INCO) was designed to fill this gap.  Incodium’s Solution Incodium provides a rational way for investors to cope with the threat of exchange hacking by providing a ‘smart compensation protection’ service for eligible victims.
