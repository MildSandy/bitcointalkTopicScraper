However there are some questions. Do you already have some certain plan involving healthcare providers who is the owner of EHR now? In the web site you mentioned that for them it is free. According to my 10+ years of experience it is really hard for healthcare provider to change its own internal processes and invest in the interchangeability solutions. This does not make the integration with your system free but brings lots of new effort that healthcare provider usually does not want to take. From your whitepaper it is not 100% clear what is the reason for the blockchain usage and how this technology solves the interoperability problems in eHealth that is a really big problem now?  Answering these question is essential in my opinion as they cover main nowadays problems in the healthcare data integration domain.,True

All updates associated with any individual health record can be curated within individual blocks and published on the Litra blockchain.""  No one will give their ""data"" for free, but when it comes to access other ""data"", and organize plus saving time and money, they will all join in! more important we are starting with the patient, as it is his right to access his EHR anytime anywhere not by requesting 100+ pages by mail!
