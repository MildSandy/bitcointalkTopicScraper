Disruption and greed seem to be the leading motifs. AAA COIN is purposefully designed to be different. Whilst satisfying the human desire for greed, it also serves a purpose of making men better. AAA COIN is a speculative blockchain-based cryptocurrency altcoin with the short-term goal of making men rich and long-term goal of making them better. Making men rich is accomplished through easier than Bitcoin mining and 100% annual interest (~0.3% daily) on existing AAA COIN holdings, effectively doubling your money every year. In addition to the 100% annual interest (~0.3% daily) through Proof of Stake (PoS), the market price increase of the AAA COIN is designed into its creation through limited supply of coins that could be mined through Proof of Work (PoW). Making men better is accomplished through investments of net profits into strategic global initiatives to prevent disease and extend human life. We have created decease-resistant plants and animals already. Why not humans?

My quick thought process here:  For 50 cents FIAT you can buy a AAA coin in the ICO  On the 10th it will be minable, and is a Scrypt ASIC with the stats as listed. Surely on the 10th when it's minable, it will be a lot cheaper to get some hash power and mine many coins than if you had purchased in the ICO? For example, about $5 worth of hash (500MH for 6 hours for example)  is going to net me ~100 coins (at least). So the cost value of the coin is going to be 5 cents FIAT (which is still way above what I'd expect a Scrypt coin to list for on an exchange).  tl;dr - The mining component is going to destroy value of the coins purchased in the ICO unless you basically sell every coin in the ICO.  For my own benefit/knowledge, I'd love to see how you've done the math here with valuations. Perhaps you could graph it out for us?",True
