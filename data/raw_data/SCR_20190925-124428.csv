My allegations make no sense, okay great, where's your rebuttal to the allegations?!?!? Stating you're not connected to my findings without showing a shred evidence is just nonsense.  You stated in telegram, scrinium has absolutely no affiliation with ukit, meanwhile you got a developer linked directly to ukit making code commits to your github repository? Nothing to see here guys, no affiliation, look the other way!  A plethora of domains all registered same day, with verbatim content on each domain at different points in time. There are domains with same content that were published before scrinium website. Oh, and mysteriously, as I blast you guys on telegram these web properties are taken offline with the quickness.... hmm, must be a coincidence, see a pattern yet?  Forbes left scrinium to pursue Octa FX? Hmm, odd don't ya think? Because his position was dissolved with that company in January? Oh btw, go checkout the documents linked to ""Octa FX"" and perhaps you would see same person signing different documents, the handwriting is all the same. How about this, Octa FX is about to have their business license completely dissolved... hmm, sounds legit.  Riddle us this, Forbes creates Scrinium, leaves the project immediately after the ICO to work with Octa FX and now he's working with another ICO called ""World Bit Bank"" where they publish content about Forbes in March of 2018 stating he's the CFO of Octa FX, however, again, his position was dissolved in January of 2018. How is that possible? Oh btw, if forbes is such a wizard with 10 years experience, why would he be reading off of a projector with all this experience under his belt. Must be difficult to remember everything with all that experience. If he was the mastermind behind Scrinium, why would he leave two companies and not come back to scrinium? Makes absolutely no sense from a professional standpoint.  ABT Tech LP is incorporated, what's the business / license number? Link your investors to the registered business so they can all see who the officers of the company are and your filings.",False

We understand you went through a lot of effort in trying to prove that we are unreliable, but unfortunately the issue with that is, it‚Äôs possible to find a lot of misleading information on the internet. Therefore please, allow us to clarify. Our team is not affiliated with any of the sites you mentioned. While one of our developers used to work at uKit, that is all there is to it. Secondly, your claim that our website and some other websites were registered on the 16th of December 2017 is false, as our site was registered at an earlier date. Here we‚Äôd like to point out that our Pre-ICO already started on the 11 of December 2017, and by then our site was already up and running. We experienced a couple of instances where our website was copied. Hence, it is not the first nor the last time something like this might happen, unfortunately.  With respect to Mr. Forbes, he was working with us and is currently working as a CFO at OctaFX, and we as a company shall not address his employment status as he‚Äôs no longer a member of our team. However, please note that all the profiles you shared are fake and you should not rely on sources simply because they mention his name.",False

Here's my findings:  I sent emails days ago to every scrinium email address I could find, added tracking pixels to my emails and not a single email was opened. I mean, who has time to open emails when you just got mega paid with another successful ICO scam. Hell yea boys!  Union Paycoin is another ICO scam that they produced. Thought they were slick with this, purchased a new domain after someone mentioned copy was listed from a different website... aka, their entire network of fraudulent ICOs.  Meta data default sample groups are in russian, looks like while their ""team"" was getting drunk on their twitter pics, someone forgot to remove Moldova location from their meta data, which is kinda odd for a dublin based company.  Tel: 01-661 3788 <‚Äî‚Äî call this number and ask for scrinium  their advisor, simon cocking... he's made one mention of scrinium back in January of 2018. If I could locate this mother fucker, I'd send em ""ico blockchain shill master of the year award"" but this dude is just another shill getting paid in cryptos to write SEO articles for these scam ICOs. If you do some searches, you'll find this guy is connected to a shit ton of ICO's as an advisor, has digital footprints in blackhat SEO forums from way back in the day, dude is making bank as a shill.  Anyways, I beg you to contact simon cocking via twitter, techicoshills website, his personal wordpress site which is garbage as fuck, facebook, myspace, linkedin, reddit, goodluck. However, he does have a dreamweaver award... gotta give this mother fucker props on that.  Update: Simon blocked my broke ass when I inquired about his involvement with a handful of ICO's.  No worries tho, I am working on simon, will be exposing him soon enough.  Another shill master: https://goldvoice.club/@sergeypyshkin/  Scrotums Admin, please riddle us your involvement with uKit, ICO Podium, Union Pay, MBC Coin, bankex, geCryptoXchange, the list goes on and fucking on... we'll all be waiting with a big bag of ""FUCK YOU"" popcorn.  BTW, who-is search these domains if you got time, or just take my word for it... they all connected.  Domain:mbccoin.co <--- they just took this site down SON! https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:fbI7iAbONx8J:https://mbccoin.co/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us Registration Date:2017-12-16  Domain:scrinium.ai Registration Date:2017-12-16  What's funny, is since I just exposed them via telegram, they are rushing to take down all these sites that expose them.  Their team pre-ico: http://www.ico196.com/ico/detail/97/global Their team post-ico: https://github.com/LordotU  What's funny is that they changed their developer info in github after someone mentioned the developer only project he starred was NoCode repo... look it up, funny as fuck.  Sebastian Forbes is a paid actor, he's also shilling some other ICO / Token bullshit right now as well. You can find this shill on youtube, looking highly professional! Anyhoot, I used lexis nexis accurint and there is ZERO record of this shill in their database. Do not ask me how I got access to this platform.  Only reference I could find of Forbes and his so called listed college was in this document. https://us.abrsm.org/fileadmin/user_upload/libretto/libretto0309.pdf  Here's a distant cousin of Forbes located in Nigeria! https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-forbes-ab84b5162/  The final nail in the coffin for Forbes and scrotums....drum roll please.... he was hired by COHEN+CO TALENT AGENTS. Im'a hire him for my next shill.  LinkedIn profiles are all fake as a three dollar bill. If I had more time, I could provide the dates of when these profiles were created, however my adderall is wearing off and I don't feel like it. FYI, LinkedIn loves hiding shit and not allowing pages to be cached because they make a killing off of these fake profiles generating ad impressions for their advertisers.  Anyways, gotta give these guys credit, they have found a way to create legit looking ICO's that makes them a killing. They must get off on this shit because one ICO scam just ain't enough for these mother fuckers. See, these scammers know that everyone just tells their friends that they read the whitepaper and view the linkedin profiles and do their due diligence so their friends think they are crypto overlords. They understand the psychology and mind of the crypto enthusiast, they feed off this shit.  Lastly, ABT Technology Limited, whatever the fuck the company listed in their whitepaper... company been dissolved for like three plus years. If you were to do some modifier searches, you'd find that same company listed in a plethora of other whitepapers.  Hope this helps.  God Bless.",False

As far as I understand you need a lot of money for your platform development. Does it mean that you are going to have big commissions fees?  There are no commissions charged for traders offering investment profiles neither for investors. Because it would make it harder to attract new users. But if you are not charging any fees from users where are you going to get money? Eventually you will run out of money you got during ICO.  Scrinium is getting money from liquidity providers. It's a standard procedure: investors deposit money and this money are divided between different exchanges and each exchange pays fees to the platform. I have never seen this kind of a system before. But sounds like a great idea especially taking into account that all your competitors are charging investors.  How traders are going to get profit?  We'll pay a part of this commission to traders.",False

No, Scrinium will help investors copy trades from traders that make profit. the AI will analyse traders' overall results and will place them in a certain risk-to-profit tier. Investors will be able to simply set their risk-to-profit ratio and subscribe to available traders. Investors cannot lose more than the percentage of risk they are willing to take, i.e. if they set their risk ratio to 30%, they won't lose more than 30%.",False

If you‚Äôre reading this website daily, you‚Äôve probably seen articles like this before. And while we have no doubt you‚Äôre perfectly aware of the technical and groundbreaking features of the blockchain and smart contracts, we‚Äôd like to draw your attention to what exactly Scrinium can do for you. Not to mention how we‚Äôre going to make this happen.  Drawing on over 12 years‚Äô experience in finance, our founders have been putting a lot of thought into copy trading, social trading platform development and all the drawbacks that they bring. Inexperienced investors often find it hard to evaluate traders‚Äô performance, and fail at copy trading just like they fail at ordinary trading.  So after pondering on it for the past several years, we finally came up with the solution: we‚Äôll build an AI system that will help investors manage their assets.
