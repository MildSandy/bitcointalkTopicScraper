Governing law: Canadian Federal Business act  What is Kryptopy? Kryptopy is a blockchain based third generation Social Network providing content sharing tools, trading tools for traders and combines concept of several successful social media with lessons learned from their mistakes and their community feedbacks. An important key factor to its success are the activities of the Kryptopy’s community. This is why we are using a Proof of Intelligence system mixed with a Proof of Stake system to reward every valuable activities on the Kryptopy Network. Those mechanism will allow us trough machine learning to efficiently filter content making sure only relevant content is rewarded while still maintaining the user privacy. The goal of the Network is to bring cryptocurrencies closer to mainstream by building a “Facebook-like” community with unique features not yet offered by other blockchain based networks.  Kryptopy will offer the following:  - Complete privacy on user profiles and their content; - A mean to get quality content and be rewarded for posting such content; - A mean for people to learn about cryptocurrencies via various trading related activities; - A mean for newcomers to reduce the risk of buying tokens and cryptocurrencies by following and copying more experienced people; - An efficient portfolio management dashboard that is sharable and copiable between users if permission is given; - A proof of stake on the KPY token so that users can make more rewards by holding them longer; - An advanced filtering mechanism to avoid Spam and Scams from being rewarded or even displayed to the users; - Social Groups, Investment Groups and Pages to promote the industry; - An ad-free, bot-free (spam bots) environment; - A link to special rewards who are related to Brands, thanks to our special partnership with Leading Locally. - Free usage of the Network for everyone; - Blogs & Industry news; - An upvote mechanism and rooster; - A private chat based on the blockchain; - More than 200 tradable assets and pairs updated in realtime.  The Market At the time of writing this White Paper, the total capitalization of blockchain is 80 billions USD. However only a small portion of the Internet community is knowledgable about it. On a traditional Social Network scale it would be less than 2.5% of its users.  This is leaving a huge gap and misunderstanding about what the blockchain is really about and how it is changing lives everyday.  The 2017 ICO boom, also considered as a bubble by many did not help the reputation of blockchain assets. Most considering this innovative mean of investment as scams based on a lot of them having ran away with the funds or simply became unproductive, not delivering the promises after their ICO was achieved successfully.  However, there are still success stories on the blockchain and Kryptopy wants to be one of them. EOS, steem.it and of course Ethereum just to name a few were very successful ICOs.  Kryptopy can remember the steem.it concept while being totally different and catering to a different group of people and is more to be compared to the Reddit of blockchain.  The concept of Kryptopy is a mix of Facebook and Linkedin together for their popularity and successful user interactions. The concept was based on the following assumptions :  - Social Network users are very worry about their privacy as it is known that on these network it is very hard to ensure it, especially since they sell user data to advertising third parties; - All of them, including those who are actually on the blockchain are plagued with spammers, scammers, fake profiles and fraudsters; - None of those networks contribute to the cryptocurrency industry in a positive way, most are used by scammers which is putting a bad name on all of our industry;  On a blockchain related note, Steem it is the only one offering rewards for content which is voted by its users like Reddit does. One of their main problem is to make sure the right content is rewarded and not useless content so the value of their token “Steem” does not get affected badly. Kryptopy is bringing a solution to this problem with his Proof of Intelligence concept.  Rewards trough Proof of Intelligence The Kryptopy Network is based on a concept we call Proof of Intelligence that will reward people and ultimately make the value of the network and its token growth based on their interactions.  To explain it let’s take a search engine like google and explain how it works (very briefly) for those who don’t know yet.  - Google is ranking websites based on scoring; - It uses an algorithm that includes more than 200 different criteria from simple to complex; - Based on the result it provides a score which will determine where your page is ranked in the results.  The Proof of Intelligence algorithm is similar in the way that it will score content to give the rewards and avoid bad content or spam. It has various criteria, like google, that is not widely known to the public so it cannot be manipulated.  Its scoring results will be stored on the blockchain so it cannot be tempered with.  Depending on the quality score, rewards will be attributed to the user who did post the content no matter if it is someone who initiated a post, replied to one, shared something interesting and so on.  Regarding Bounties  No bounty thread will be made to avoid decreasing the value of KPY. However, we are willing to work with big influencer on the cryptocurrency space. If you are a YouTube's Channel with 5,000+ subscribers, or Twitter audience of 10,000 followers contact us at info@kryptopy.com and lets us hear your ideas of promotion for KPY and your price.

In fact the proof of intelligence mechanism which is a sophisticated artificial intelligence algorithm for scoring the content, will take care of redundancy in the way that if it scores too high as redundant it will get less reward or none at all.

Take per example Facebook user base, what if only 10% of it would bring real value with every post they make ? You can look more at this like a mixed of Facebook & Linkedin, without the spam and ads and with a mainstream portion to attract non cryptocurrency users to the industry with rewards and such. The other portion is the trading / exchange portion where traders can trade and share or not what they did. If they do then they get rewarded for doing so.  So yes both have benefits. But also there is benefits for posting relevant content or replies and making the network more valuable with quality content.",False

You can only give access to portions of your profile and so on. That is how it usually work but a bit less granular.  On the other end, nobody gets access to the posts, trade or content you make unless you decide to do so. Not even the administrator of the system. This bring another question which is how to filter without seeing the posts ? Well we use and will develop more sophisticated machine learning classifiers to do so in a way that we dont have to see the content but only its classification score without the context. That classifier which is not as huge as the user content, will then be stored on the blockchain so it cannot be tempered with. This will reduce the cost of having a fully decentralized content system on the public blockchain and allow filtering to be secure.",False
