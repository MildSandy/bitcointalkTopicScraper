The hard cap of the Government Network Crowdsale is between $ 40 and $ 45 million, depending on which package our contributors choose. I would like to refer you to https://thegovernment.network/token-sale  The funds will be used mainly towards development, operations, and mindshare. We start with hosting the constitutional convention which will determine the structure, framework, and governance of the DAO and nation (this is not done by the organisers, and will be done by representatives elected by the early citizens of the Government Network). After which the development of the DAO will progress in accordance with the constitution. The main features will continue development simultaneously with the convention and DAO development. This includes the integration of existing innovations in GovTech into the Government Network Ecosystem.  The focus is initially around the creation of drivers, concrete applications that have an immediate use case in partnership with the end users or entities with an existing user base, driving transactions and individuals into the ecosystem. As well as the development of a developer toolkit allowing for citizens of the nation to develop their own applications within the framework provided by the Government Network.  Part of development will go to (academic) research, testing the hypothesis on which the Nation will be built, this includes further identifying the market conditions and society specific requirements that need to be considered for mass expansion. Furthermore, a large part of the required research will be directed toward behavioral finance and economics.   On the operation side, a large chunk will go to field testing of the drivers going through the typical phases of discovery – pilot – and implementation. Mindshare will be created through an event series on decentralised governance and the need for competition in the market of governments. With the goal that in this world, your birthplace stops binding your future. Other expenses include attending conferences and membership fees (as required by some of the organisations we will work with).  The soft cap is $ 3 million.  If the Government Network does not reach its hard cap, this will result in a focussed approach directed towards establishing concrete drivers that will later grow into the ecosystem and nation as envisioned.  Examples of drivers are:  -The creation of a framework for an existing and established business network linking African companies to the rest of the world facilitating transactions, cultivating growth, spreading education and cultural inclusion, and pushing a borderless pan-African mindset. The Government Network will provide the framework for the organisation to grow to the next level, integrating it within the larger ecosystem. This is done through the creation of a trusted environment with decentralised identities as the backbone (in this area of the world establishing a trusted counterparty is often the hardest part of the transaction), as well as elaborate escrow and arbitration solutions (lack of banking infrastructure), participation mechanisms, a communication and voicing channel.  The created framework will be available to other organisations and the participants will become part of the larger ecosystem. The different solutions within the framework will be elements returning in the larger ecosystem, with the framework being a specifically designed front-end application.   -The creation of a voting, polling and petitioning application based on decentralised identities for countries, communities, and organisations. The Government Network will collaborate with a number of entities and groups in order to assist them in implementing more transparent and empowering governance systems. Initially the Government Network will push its own expansion through active pursuit of new implementations, bringing the participants into the larger ecosystem facilitating the road to critical mass.  -The creation of decentralised identity solution front-end applications for specific use cases such as sports federations, schools, non-profit organisations, and universities. In a university, this could mean linking the identity to the diploma, modules, and courses the individual has followed or passed, facilitating inter-university communication and potentially proving to be an additional benefit for graduates applying for employment (abroad).  Please let me know if you have any further questions, and forgive us for not always being able to reply immediately.",False

Belize, October 31, 2018, The Government Network is building a borderless Nation powered by Blockchain Technology, operating from a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO). Its purpose is to innovate governance one step at a time through the implementation of applications serving direct market needs as drivers for the ecosystem. The goal is to build a nation, operating on a decentralised governance model, accessible and free for all, that empowers its citizens with abilities to achieve their goals independently through the power of technology.  The framework under which the different branches and procedures of the Government Network will operate will be determined by a Constitutional Convention. Here, an equally represented group of prominent experts, businessmen and humanists will be tasked with rethinking the role of government as we know it. The Constitutional Convention will be organised starting from March 2019.  The Crowdsale aims to secure $ 3 million in funding to be used for the further strengthening of the parallel task groups building the Nation, with a first focus on completing the foundation required to develop the DAO and the initial front-end applications. These applications will function as drivers for the Nation and will be equipped with a user base through partnerships. The applications include a decentralised self-sovereign identity solution, a trusted trade framework, and a basic community engagement platform.  Furthermore, the Government Network will invest in testing the different assumptions on which the Nation will be built, the onboarding of new citizens, and educating the world on our new form of governance absent of national boundaries and free from the traditional centralized national models.  Now raising capital by launching a Crowdsale through its own cryptocurrency called the GOV Token, an ERC 20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain. The Government Network Crowdsale commences on November 1, 10:00 AM GMT and will run for 4 weeks.

According to the global indicator framework developed by the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators, through Goal 16 (“Peace, Justice & Strong Institutions”), we seek to: ""substantially reduce corruption and bribery in all their forms; develop effective, accountable and transparent institutions at all levels; broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance; ensure public access to information and protect fundamental freedoms, in accordance with national legislation and international agreements; promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure equal access to justice for all; significantly reduce all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere; and end abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children.""  According to the Report of the Secretary-General ( The Sustainable Development Goals Report 2018 ), there is promising news on these fronts: ""Freedom-of-information laws and policies have been adopted by 116 countries, with at least 25 countries doing so over the last five years. However, implementation remains a challenge. Since 1998, more than half of countries (116 of 197) have established a national human rights institution that has been peer reviewed for compliance with internationally agreed standards (the Paris Principles). However, only 75 of these countries have institutions that are fully compliant.""  Acknowledging that these are powerful strides in the right direction, we must also recognize that innovation and progress in these efforts are often stymied by insufficient legacy systems, political divisiveness, and the inertia of entrenched special interests. I am fascinated and inspired by bold innovative experiments in developing new forms of governance generated from without existing national boundaries and free from the traditional centralized national models, particularly through the application of new technologies that allow for effective decentralized governance models. The Government Network’s platform promises to be a fascinating laboratory for bold experimentation around these new models on a global level.  by Efriam Wyeth  About Efriam, advisor at the Government Network  Efraim (“Ef”) Wyeth is a community organizer, business developer, startup consultant, and content producer working primarily in New York and in both Northern and Southern California.

Thank you for your interest. Tomorrow we will publish a partnership that will show you a concrete application of the Government Network.  The Government Network is a borderless nation, rethinking the role of governments and providing an alternative government framework, accessible and free for all, empowering the people with the abilities to achieve their goals independently through the power of technology.  This means we will be working on the decentralised version of all functions expected from a functional government, ranging from identity services to the provisioning of free speech and a legal and financial framework.  We look to integrate the latest innovations in the industry and focus on the creation of direct drivers until the Government Network reaches critical mass and becomes fully autonomous. With the citizens establishing its own business in the Nation and guiding further development.  The GOV token swaps with a stablecoin (the NTN token) which can be exchanged with the nation for other cryptocurrencies or used in the nation’s economy over time. Drivers for the swaps to occur are the growth of and transaction volumes in the nation.  The constitution which will govern the DAO and the Government Network will be drafted by a constitutional convention in Q1 and Q2 of 2019.

The Global Africa Business Club (GABC) and the Government Network started the development of a platform which is geared towards facilitating trade and the movement of goods across Africa and the rest of the world. Providing African businesses with an infrastructure which compliments their national legal and financial frameworks which is geared towards Pan-Africa Globalisation.  South-Africa, November 5th 2018, The GABC and the Government Network are working together on the creation of a platform which is aimed to reduce the barriers for African enterprises to trade without borders, cultivating a borderless mindset. The platform will be focussed around the creation of a trusted ecosystem between market actors including corporate and individual identity management solutions, access to financial instruments and transaction management. The partnership is an execution of the vision of the Chairman of the GABC, Washington Kapapiro, who believes that Africa needs to create her own tailor-made solutions if it is to ever realise its potential for economic development.  The platform will be built on a decentralised framework with the individual and enterprise both central in the ecosystem. It will be equipped with the latest technological innovations and transparent by design, in line with the borderless vision on which the Government Network is created, says Jens Lievens, founder of the Government Network. The platform will complement national legal and financial frameworks where they prove to be inadequate to cultivate economic growth, allowing for a faster transitioning towards a borderless Africa, and effectively a more prosperous Africa. It is a step towards individual empowerment, reducing the impact of any businessman’s location or background.  The GABC is a private business network promoting borderless thinking and pan-African globalization. A non-profit development organization founded in 2004, GABC has access to 34 African countries, 50,000 African businesses, and 26 partners’ networks to promote dialogue, debate and influence policy to improve the role of businesses and enterprises operating in Africa and globally.

Its purpose is to innovate governance one step at a time through the implementation of applications serving direct market needs as drivers for the ecosystem. The goal is to build a nation, operating on a decentralised governance model, accessible and free for all, that empowers its citizens with abilities to achieve their goals independently through the power of technology.  The framework under which the different branches and procedures of the Government Network will operate will be determined by a Constitutional Convention. Here, an equally represented group of prominent experts, businessmen and humanists will be tasked with rethinking the role of government as we know it. The Constitutional Convention will be organised starting from March 2019.  The Crowdsale aims to secure $ 3 million in funding to be used for the further strengthening of the parallel task groups building the Nation, with a first focus on completing the foundation required to develop the DAO and the initial front-end applications. These applications will function as drivers for the Nation and will be equipped with a user base through partnerships. The applications include a decentralised self-sovereign identity solution, a trusted trade framework, and a basic community engagement platform. Furthermore, the Government Network will invest in testing the different assumptions on which the Nation will be built, the onboarding of new citizens, and educating the world on our new form of governance absent of national boundaries and free from the traditional centralized national models.  Now raising capital by launching a Crowdsale through the GOV Token, an ERC 20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain.

Through initially focussing on the implementation of applications serving direct market needs, the Government Network will cultivate mindshare and creates the drivers required to support the implementation of its vision of fair, non-exclusive and rational governance for all people, empowering them with the ability to achieve their goals independently.  The platform will consist of a network of incorruptible, interconnected decentralized services, each optimized for their purpose, together greater than the sum of their parts. Transparent by design, the platform will operate as a self-regulating entity, governed through an impartial consensus mechanism and constitution, in jargon referred to as a Distributed Autonomous Organisation or DAO. Practical in approach, The DAO is intended to work in conjunction with society as is for the betterment of individuals, communities, and global governance.  In essence, the Government Network is aspiring to build the foundation and drivers required to realise its vision, creating the framework — the platform, for others to build upon.  Benefits born out of this include:  -Enhancements to free trade. -Providing a voice and recognition to all people. -Creation of a global community under the decentralized control of the citizens themselves. -Reclaiming control over personal information. -Improving voting mechanisms, for governments, communities and enterprises. -A stable, accessible and global currency. -Increased efficiency for transaction and information flows. -Judicial processes that highlight solutions and resolve conflict. -The Government Network — a system of check and balances that will evolve with the practicalities inherent to the process of reaching its vision. In this process, the participation of the citizens stands central.  Mindshare  To realise its vision, the Government Network needs to gain mindshare. While there are various definitions, in this context, mindshare is the collective space in which people willingly participate of their own accord, giving their time, attention, and enthusiasm.   The Government Network will cultivate mindshare by servicing real needs in today’s world in a transparent and open manner. Mindshare brings forth long-term success in the ecosystem and is won by making an individual’s life easier, more fulfilling and free, in the long term.  It is won through open and transparent transactions, decision-making processes, excellence, and responsiveness. No one technology can deliver this, rather it is the marriage of technology with values to create a medium for those values to flourish.  Mindshare will bring the scale to disrupt, improve, and change patterns of commerce and governance. Through enhanced communication and efficiency, market forces will bring forward changes to manufacturing, healthcare, real estate, law, banking, farming, and almost every other industry — examples include:  -Moving from subscription models to micropayments, made possible by new forms of identity management and digital currencies. -Supporting local trade and direct distribution through decentralized approaches, supported escrow services, reducing income inequalities.   This grassroots, bottom-up approach is achieved by adapting to the needs of the people with flexibility through geographic zones and cultural values and a universal message of cooperation enabled through the medium.  Early Participants  Building the network, gaining mindshare into the space, engaging hundreds of millions of participants, is a practical journey of many steps and a long-term plan.  In order to convince, initial contributors providing resources to help build this Network, the organizers are aware for the need to see shorter routes and near-term achievements to bring significant traffic and real-world use cases to the platform. These tangible services deployed in the short term are required to fuel organic development and kick-start the project to its next levels.  We will focus on several verticals which can along with economic drivers, mature into billion dollar industries in their own right within a reasonable time frame. Amongst others, these include:  -Escrow and arbitration services for online commerce providing trust to consumers using decentralized currencies. This branded service will be available to various commerce platforms in the world at large, along with the free or low-cost integration of the software. -Voting services and other governance processes developed for countries, communities, and corporations, bringing a cost-effective alternative to current systems, along with proof of trust, while redefining governance and simultaneously increasing mindshare in the Government Network to further its growth.  Identity Management  Essential to a decentralized approach, within a peer to peer environment, is proof of identity to ensure trust and for building continuum. For any solution to be adopted it must be secure, easy to use, cost-effective and universally accepted. It must support a wide spectrum of usage, ranging between complex business trades, simple social exchange, legal purposes, and for regions and communities lacking consistent infrastructure.  We will be developing and partnering with others to bring forth identity management solutions as the backbone of the platform. Furthermore, value added scenarios can arrive by serving complex corporate trade agreements and legal requirements to help fund the infrastructure.  In Closing  The public-facing aspects of the platform will now be called ‘The Forum’ which is a DAPP accessible by smartphones and browsers, whereby users can access from one place all of the Government Network and third-party services build on the Network.  The Government Network project will span decades, its health includes excelling in aspects that bring benefits to participants and incentivizes its contributors in the relative near term. It encompasses developing and positioning ourselves for widespread adoption of certain verticals, and the governance processes all engineered for victory within the practicalities of market forces.

In the light of these numbers, Cryptocurrency has the occasion to reach significant adaptation by becoming a significant means of exchange in this development. However, the following three strategies need to be present in order to ensure such evolution:  -Ease of use -Presence of an economic driver -Trust between market actors  Ease of use  Notice I have not mentioned security, scalability, speed, or identity. Albeit all important qualities, for the end user, these are transparent, just like you expect a light switch to work when you turn it on. If this is not the case, then it is not a working solution, hence these all fall under ease of use.  The presence of an economic driver  In order to use cryptocurrency as a means of payment, there has to be an economic driver to do so, this driver could be ease of use or monetary. Currently, some cryptocurrencies provide more stable and/or secure alternatives to fiat currency in some regions, examples of this can already be found in Africa. As trust is earned in the consumer and business areas, the adaptation will spread globally.  Trust between market actors  A third crucial element is the ability for market actors to trust one another when transacting, making certain they receive their product or service in a satisfactory condition. Unlike using a credit card, without further safeguards there is no recourse once a cryptocurrency payment is made. This risk factor is often not worth it, particularly if purchasing from an unknown vendor. A solution to this is escrow and arbitration services implemented through smart contracts protecting the consumers and providing them with a way for their funds to be returned if something goes wrong. The Government Network project aspires to overcome these hurdles and develop trust in escrow services, along with arbitration, both for the use of trades on its network and as a service to other platforms.  Once a significant portion of e-commerce starts using cryptocurrency, say .25 to 1%, those who do not comply with all three of the above-mentioned elements will have missed the boat, as building branded trust is just as important as the technical aspects of implementation. At that time this will be a billion dollar and growing industry.  We, at the Government Network have worked out atomic processes to ensure that much of the escrow and arbitration processes can be automated. Simultaneously, we are working on Identity Management as a critical piece of the solution not just for our citizens, but for everyone. This is a key part of the first quality of the triad of adoption: ease of use.  The bottom line is, any new technology to be accepted needs to be easy to use, straight-forward, and trustworthy to the last mile. Notice that the Business-to-Business (B2B) portion of sales is much larger, estimated to be ~6.7 trillion dollars globally in 2020. B2B transactions often require additional safeguards, such as custom smart contracts with stages of fulfillment, multi-signature approvals, KYC and AML requirements, delayed triggers pending a chance for human intervention, penalties and bonuses, and more complex arbitration mechanisms. The Government Network yearns to serve the needs of such trade.  Along with escrow services we plan to develop ‘proof of authenticity’ stamps available to merchants providing further confidence to consumers. This can range from simple authentication of the origin of a product to more complex proofs which include ‘fair-trade’ arrangements, and links to immutable multi-step manufacturing authenticity protecting against counterfeit products.  The Government Network invites you to learn more about these evolutionary advances that we are endeavoring to build in cooperation with the larger community, from vision to practicality with excellence. Together, let's make our world a better place.
