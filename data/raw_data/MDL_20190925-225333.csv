We had a look at Modum, it seems to be a great product dedicated to a vertical market, in this case data integrity for supply chain operations using Smart Contracts. With Modulum we target a horizontal market, meaning we want to provide a platform over product. Modulum is customizable both on the hardware side (i.e. sensors, communication protocols, etc.) and on the software side (i.e. running custom apps).  We are proud to count IBM as an advisor for our project. IBM is a major actor in the blockchain industry, as seen for example with their deep involvement in the blockchain Hyperledger. This knowledge will be of precious help when integrating blockchain technologies in Modulum.  It's true we only recently became active on social medias although the team was already working hard on this project which was kept secret until a month ago or so. As we were already working on our first prototypes, our patent approval process was keeping Modulum under NDA.",False
