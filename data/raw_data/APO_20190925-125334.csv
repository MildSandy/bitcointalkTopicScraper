Apollon Cryptocurrency (APO)’s bold aim is to become a leader in transforming the digital economic ecosystem for global entertainment and leisure businesses. As these fields already move billions in various currencies, and are global in nature, the Apollon Blockchain Project should be an economic boon, by providing an underlying technology infrastructure for a number of commercial applications. Apollon is creating an “APO platform,” a highly compatible and expansive structure that will realize the free flow of value for entertainment and leisure in a digital economic network based on blockchain.  Features of APOLLON — economic ecosystem for global entertainment and leisure businesses Community - a marketplace concept based on a host of diverse pan-entertainment offerings Robust - capable technology deployment in blockchain, side-chain, and blockchain security Secure - strong payment tools and gateways Usability - 2-tier currency structure with LCash tied to the US dollar to alleviate pain points   Core Problems Resolved by APOLLON Free Flow of Value The Apollon Blockchain will develop and support all the related business applications with underlying blockchain infrastructure technology. The APO platform will become one of world's first and most comprehensive multi-chain platforms, re-shaping the eCommerce ecosystem for entertainment and leisure. Their vision is to have a “free flow of value,” enabling users to enjoy the rich benefits of blockchain technology. Cross Chain Interaction APO enables cross-chain interaction technology to allow different blockchains to connect and communicate with each other. A variety of systems can run through and integrate with each other to provide efficient, convenient, secure, and stable data processing. The Apollon Blockchain system enables large numbers of blockchain data to do parallel processing. They are closely watching the IT development of the Pratt & Whitney case of Blockchain deployment which may trigger a change in the future evolution of FinTech deployment. Environmentally Sustainable APO is a much greener cryptocurrency and blockchain solution compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum's PoW consensus mechanism. The DPoS consensus mechanism they’ve adopted does not need to increase power to compete for the right to book, so it wastes less computing power and greatly saves resources.  Core Technologies APOLLON  BFT-DPoS (Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus and Delegated Proof-of-Stake) Apollon uses BFT-DPoS supplemented by blockchain as a consensus mechanism with cutting-edge technologies such as modular smart contracts, zero-knowledge proofs, and state-channel technologies to create high-throughput, high-security, resource-saving technologies with low-cost processing. Longtooth We use Longtooth as it is one of the world most innovated decentralized communication protocols, to provide direct communication services without having to use any central servers. This is a better technology deployment method to prevent or reduce any hacking-risk arising on a single point of failure. TuYYo We use TuYYO as it is one of the world most secure IM tools to provide state-of-the-art point-to-point, public and private (hot and cold) personal keys, Apollon protects any message or document transferring through the platform. NTRUsign signature and the Keccak-512 hash algorithm We use the NTRUsign signature and the Keccak-512 hash algorithm to reduce risk and threats of rapid development of quantum computing and the popularization of quantum computers.
