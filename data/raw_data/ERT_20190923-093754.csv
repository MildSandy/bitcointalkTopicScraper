Thanx for the question. The total number of tokens is strictly limited by the initial issue. Therefore, a deflationary economic model has been created within the framework of the platform. It provides an increase in the value of tokens over time. Estimates and predictions of Eristica are based on Metcalfe’s17 law, which states that: “The utility of the network is proportional to the square of the number of users of this network ≈n2.” 1.2 million users of the platform will add value to Eristica tokens. Moreover, the constant exponential growth already seen plus the pre-installation of the application on new smartphones will certainly contribute to the further growth of the user base and, consequently, the increase in the value of the token.  You may read all that in details in our whitepaper: https://eristica.com/wp/wp_en.pdf",False

It means that there is not much promotion for this project which will not give it much benefit. You have to promote it more and more all over the forum in order to infom more investors. Advertising in the services section is important in the form of BTC signature campaign.  Hi gtglener, I know is quite impossible follow ALL ico, bounty, project, new tokens, asset, market etc... about cryptocurrencies... Even if you live dedicated to this industry, you can't check by yourself ALL of these update.  Check here: https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/ 1369 CryptoCurrencies And a lot of project (big and small) are not listed on CoinMarketCap.  I think Campaign Signature are not the only solution, because some users,unfortunately, are just spammers, or write post of low quality. Probably a simple ""word of mouth"" is also practically for a project like this, and focusing only in a sign. camp. is not enough. However this is the first ICO with really famous people in this field (Larimer for E.G https://steemit.com/@stan): there are also other ""uncommon"" type of propaganda already ongoing",False

Challenges are proved with videos. Viral content with smart contracts which guarantees fair plays and transparency    What we have achieved  ✔ A FunTech video platform for challenges with 1.2+M user base ✔ 2+ years of Growth Hack development ✔ Average time per session of 13 mins ✔ Support from the #1 early-stage investor in the world: SOSV ✔ Support from McKinsey, Winter Capital and a group of private pre-ICO investors ✔ Mentorship from industry superstars ✔ Agreements for monthly pre-installs on smartphones in Asia  What we strive to accomplish  An ecosystem where users challenge each other transparently through smart contracts. Decentralised oracle system where anyone can bet and challenge participants with an aim of winning tokens for every successful prediction. A platform with integrated third party services and products based on the blockchain technology. Online challenges for e-sport competitions for games built on Unity and Unreal Engines with help of the Eristica Game API. User friendly in-app interface for purchase and sale of tokens at current market price without dealing directly with exchanges. New types of challenges: one-vs-many and many-vs-many.   The benefits for contributors  Tokens will be the driving force in the ecosystem’s digital economy. Users will need tokens to create challenges, bets, prize funds and in-app purchases. Eristica will have integrated an in-app interface for the purchase of ERT tokens from the exchanges for its current price. Users will be able to pay from an attached credit/debit card, local payment or cryptocurrency. This will create an increasing demand and solid liquidity for ERT tokens among Eristica’s community. Platform expansion through the integration of products and services from third party developers. Creation of additional services for users and use of tokens as a single form of payment both within the ecosystem and on partner sites. This will drive additional value for ERT tokens. Part of commission fee will be distributed to the Challenge Fund, that will fund promotional activities, as well as integration with third-party services. Expansion of the user base through the platform’s expansion to the regions of Southeast Asia, India, Europe and North America. Starting from 2018, local smartphone producers will pre-install the Eristica app on new smartphones. Potential growth from the cooperation targets around 500,000 new users in the first quarter of 2018. Growing user base will create new demand for ERT tokens.  The benefits for users  Never before has the Bets and Challenges industry had such freedom as it has now in the times when blockchain technology is so popular. Users will thus get the freedom to monetize their talents, skills and abilities by winning in challenges. They will do so by participating in challenges with individuals, major brands and celebrities or making predictions on the winners of ongoing events. Moreover, Eristica will set a commision fee at 3% for all type of events. That will create a global minimum for Bets and Challenge industry.  The benefits for crypto community  Integration of the wallet in the accounts of more than 1,200,000 users of Eristica is expected to make it one of the mass mobile cryptocurrency wallets in the world. Cryptocurrency has been known to be quite complex and only popular among tech enthusiasts but future developments of cryptocurrency are aimed at simplification targeted at many users. The Eristica project considers the promotion of the crypto-economy among young people to be one of its main goals. The project is thus looking to bring in millions of young users to the cryptoworld. The first tokens in this platform will be a new starting point for the future generation of crypto-enthusiasts.   Eristica network token(ERT)  The Eristica Token (ticker: ERT) is a vital part of the Eristica network. The ERT will enable users to participate in bets even with celebrities, get rewards for winning challenges, make money off successful predictions and buy access to platform’s services. The ERT also operates in decentralized governance which makes it possible for users to have an influence on solving disputable situations when voting for winners in a challenge.

I'm Nikita, founder of Eristica - P2P challenge platform. First off I'd like to thank bitbollo for starting our thread – he's amazing!  We started up this platform a little more than two years ago and it has exploded to over 1.2M users. The idea is simple: get crazy people to pull off insane stunts and record themselves on video which other people will dare them to do. So if you are bored watching TV every night after work you could: sign up, post a request for someone to eat a bowl of mold and maggots on video (sorry, that was just a recent one Cheesy), sit back and enjoy seeing people submit their crazy videos.  There are four founders in our team – you can see them on the video above. These are the people who stood at the very beginning, they are my family, it isn't a joke. At the beginning of our work we were together and together came to a significant event – the ICO.  Eristica will start the ICO very soon – 7 Dec 2017. It is very thrilling to all of us. Hard work, brainstorms, ups and downs, all this we had to go through. And… Believe me, it was worth it. The main point on the way to success is to believe in your product and go to the end. We do. We're 100% sure that Eristica will be accepted by the audience, as I see it right now. When users submit thousands of new challenges to the platform I feel proud of our product, our team and our work.  There are a lot of milestones yet to be achieved though. The next step is launching smart contract based challenges with token economy. This will allow performers to earn cryptocurrency by pulling off even crazier stunts and videos, as it will make the whole process transparent, seamless and legal. Just imagine it. Funny means money!  On 7th of December we will need your support. I believe that you are on the same page with us. Let's change the FunTech market to the better together! Me and my team members will be joining this topic to cover all your questions and suggestions. Please feel free to ask straight away.  For promising partnerships and investment opportunities feel free to contact me in mp. Thank you!",False

This is Nikita from Eristica. Hope y'all doing great! Just wanted to share some awesome news with you guys:  1. Stan Larimer - The Godfather of BitShares - has joined our team at Eristica as an advisor. He has never been an advisor to any other ICO before. And we are the lucky ones! Together with Stan, Michael Taggert has also joined – he's a marketing guru and the co-founder of Cryptonomex. Can't even tell you how excited we are! 2. Due to those news, we obviously would have to fix the first post in the thread a little bit. 3. We're on media!
