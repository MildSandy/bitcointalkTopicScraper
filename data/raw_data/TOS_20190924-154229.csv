For developing countries, where the requirement of Trade finance is highest, a financier from the Developed country will not have the history of the trader and there is a lack of trust between the two parties.

A major reason for this lack of availability of funds is the lack of access to trustworthy information regarding customers (both individual as well as corporates) for the lending institutes namely the local banks.  We all know that credit history plays an important part in one’s ability to access financing from any lending source. This lack of information leads to improper understanding of the risks that are associated with repayments.  Many multi-laterals like Asian Development Bank, International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation etc have rolled out numerous programs and schemes over the years like Credit Guarantees, Risk Participation, Risk Distribution, Supply Chain Finance Program etc to help the growth of lending to SMEs but these actions have shown limited improvement in the overall scenario. In fact, from 2015 to 2017, the total trade finance funding gap globally increased from USD1.5T to USD 1.7T.  Limited credit information with respect to business payments can sometimes be offset through use of historical data of payments for other goods and services like payment of rentals, taxes, phone bills, school fees etc. But access to such data is also either not available or difficult to integrate because of lack of investments in updated processes, infrastructure, technologies etc.  Looking at the above developments and their limited effect, maybe it’s time to use a different approach. We should attack the root cause and not just the tip of the problem. And the core reason here is credit history which can be attributed to lack of digitization amongst the lending institutes in these geographies.  The proposal is for multilaterals to work with central banks and other regulators in various countries in a systematic way and get them to digitize the banks and other segments like tax calculation and collection. High upfront cost of implementation of banking solutions can be mitigated by the economics of scale, standardization and if required, by credit guarantees from the multilaterals. Furthermore, there is a going realization from banking software product companies too on the affordability of the various costs attributed with the implementation of digital solutions and they are working (some have already developed) pay per use or per transaction payment models and proposals. This along with standardization and economies of scale would further reduce the costs and risks for implementation, servicing and upgrading, thus allowing for a faster implementation, proper maintenance and reaching the goal of providing ways to capture credit and thus, start to create lending history for banks to make better lending decisions, with better understanding of risk and at much lower costs.  We should not forget that increased transparency in a country’s banking system helps to better manage the fiscal and monetary policy which in turn helps to improve the credit rating and lowers borrowing costs for central banks. This systematic approach where we are fixing the core problem would go a long way into providing finance to those who require it, at the right cost thus leading to both micro (more job creation) and macro (better access to global trading partners and integration with global trade) benefits.",False

Details are below:  TCR or Token Curated Registry is a process that produces a list which havetted throughthrough a network of participants. In the KRATOS platform, participants in the TCR process must be token holders. If token holders stake their tokens, they have the right to curate a list of submitted trades into a list of high-quality trades. The token curated registry system vets or filters trade finance applications submitted on the platform.  Token holders are incentivized to ensure that the resulting list or token curated registries are of the highest quality for both the common interest as well as well as for their own self-interest. First, by maintaining a registry of the highest standards, token holders who submitted trade finance applications are rewarded by gaining access to another vehicle for trade finance which was previously inaccessible. Second, token holders who curated trade finance applications are rewarded if they make sound economic decisions and they are punished if they make bad economic decisions while producing the token curated registry.  Once transactions between participants are consummated and made eligible via the TCR process for trade finance, the list will be shared with a network of financiers. This network includes, but is not limited to, individuals, family offices, funds and banks. Token holders can also choose to participate in the financing of a curated trade. This system thus democratizes the entire financing process, gives financiers a high-quality list of eligible deals, and offers financing opportunities previously unavailable to them. This system also allows additional players (individuals, funds, family offices) access to high-quality trade finance deals as an asset class.  As KRATOS platform user base increases, more tokens will be required for TCR process. To make KRATOS token available for users we have already started listing process with different exchanges to list KRATOS Token for secondary trading.",False

Due to their nature, commodities of the same type and grade generally do not differ much between producers. Thus they are interchangeable and are priced similarly, if not equally.  Some examples of widely traded commodities are gold, silver, crude oil, natural gas, livestock, coffee, wheat and corn.  Commodities are crucial to our everyday lives, which could explain why investors see the value in trading them.  Commodities come in two main types:  Soft commodities, which are typically agricultural products or livestock (like rice or sugar) Hard commodities, which are typically natural resources that are mined or extracted (like silver or gas)  The supply and demand levels of a particular commodity are dependent on a wide variety of different factors, like economic and political events, or the weather. They are also hugely influenced by the price of the dollar, because almost all commodity trading is priced in US currency. And all of this means that commodity prices can fluctuate significantly.",False

According to The Asian Development Bank study, published in 2017 – ‘The gap in global trade finance requirements amounted to USD 1.5 Trillion and SMEs bore the brunt of rejections with about 75% of their request rejected.’  Currently, SME’s must almost exclusively go through banks to raise trade finance. This is a long and cumbersome process, often delaying the trade lifecycle and significantly reducing trade profits.  At times, certain trade finance deals are not financed due to manpower issues and system inefficiencies among banks.  With TCR, trades submitted on the platform for trade finance will be curated by token holders based on individual trade risk rather than company trade risk. The output of this curation process will be a list of high-quality trades, which will represent a subset of trades that may not otherwise receive financing. Other institutional finance players can offer to finance these trades on KRATOS. Other challenges like insufficient trust among stakeholders, the involvement of innumerable middlemen, manual paper documentation process and high overhead costs will be solved using Decentralised Blockchain and Smart contracts.  USP of KRATOS   Whitelisting of quality trades through Token Curated Registry Sourcing of Trade Finance and other trade partners by creating an Ecosystem Efficiency in trade and reducing in overhead costs using Smart contracts Transparency in trade through Blockchain[/size]    KRATOS Platform Token  The KRATOS platform token (symbol: TOS) is: A utility token Built on Ethereum ERC-20 To be used for Token Curation Registry (TCR) process  KRATOS Platform Technical Overview  The KRATOS platform model of core data and trust is developed on the public Ethereum Blockchain and uses Solidity as the main programming language for smart contracts. This gives ARKRATOS the ability to build direct, immutable, and tamper- proof records between the ecosystem players on the KRATOS platform. This results in a truly trusted environment which, before blockchain technology, was not possible to achieve with centralised systems. The KRATOS platform's blockchain enabler interface reduces complexity of the workflows from the different transactions and smart contract logic. This enabler can be agnostic to the underlying blockchain protocol making it future proof and also potentially interoperable with other ecosystem consortia. The development also becomes less complex as it abstracts the overlying use case to the underlying protocol of the smart contract or transaction interface. Database and Storage Systems are managed in a way that have an off-chain element. The current blockchain protocols have limitations in their architecture, which do not make them a good solution for storing data. We in fact don’t believe that these protocols should be used as such. We are using the blockchain protocols only for the transaction data of the KRATOS platform and ecosystem calls. All other data is managed securely and off-chain. This also allows us to manage the transaction speeds of the database calls we make.
