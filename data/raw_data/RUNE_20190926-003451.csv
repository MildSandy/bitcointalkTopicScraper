""  If you are enthusiast about cryptocurrencies and if you love fantasy worlds, the Cryptodruid is definitely the right thing for you.  This project can be summarized in a fictional, unique, and extremely funny world that has been created by mixing together blockchains' elements with some of the most famous fantasy universes.  The platform's leading hero is Ronan, a trading champion and a spiritual guide of a far cosmos called Blocklands. He approached our world to protect the crypto investors from trading losses, by mean of his ERC-20 talismans of wealth: the smart runes.  These collectible tokens have a fixed, limited supply, and together with their derivative trinkets, the Artifacts, they can be considered the best way to support the project itself and the only one for actively joining it.  Of course, if the initiative encounters a proper success, substantial improvements will come, following mostly the users' preferences and feedbacks. The possibilities under consideration are a videogame, a card game, and a marketplace - but the options are infinite.  For now, you can regard it it is an amusing product you can freely consume by reading, either support with a small to minuscule investment, in the perspective of future further developments which will be soon announced.  >>> https://cryptodruid.com/ <<<    Additional Info  Youtube Trailer：https://youtu.be/3PhVOrx6HjA  GitHub：https://github.com/Cryptodruid  ICO start time：2017-12-08 00:00:00 UTC  ICO end time：2018-02-01 00:00:00 UTC  ICO bonus：50% discount  Tokens' delivery time： Immediate through smart contract  Tokens' platform：Ethereum (ETH)  Main Token name：Lesser Rune (RUNE)  Main Token page：https://cryptodruid.com/artifacts/lesser-rune/  Main Token available supply：100.000 (fixed)  Main Token regular / ICO price：0.01 Ethereum (ETH) / 0.005 Ethereum (ETH)",False

The project will develop according to the feedbaks it receives - and yours warms me . I think that a game will fit perfectly into the world of the Cryptodruid, and I am already working on that. A natural alternative will be to create an internal marketplace, since the Artifacts (the collectibles on sale during the ICO) have a limited, fixed supply. However, for now, there is no ""need"" to acquire tokens in order to enjoy the project for what it is: a fantasy environment full of funny things about crypto. If you like fantasy worlds AND you are a crypto enthusiast, the Cryptodruid has many, many things to give you even for free - just take your time to read them. However, if you truly want to become part of his world, you should consider participating in the ICO, since at least the base tokens are quite cheap - 0.005 ETH per unit until February 1st, 2018. The worst thing that could happen will be to lose your investment, but this is not just about the Cryptodruid, instead of the whole Initial Coin Offerings scene, and there are many projects out there that offer you just promises and zero enjoyment, moreover through the distribution of much more expensive tokens.",False
