For example, if we were to release just the Point of sale software, would have different requirements. Thus, within a month or two of completion, we would be able to integrate payment for both fiat and crypto, via third party. Our liquidity pool etc, would not be applicable at this time. At this time, we might offer an option of Bitcoin convert to Eur (only these currencies) to your bank account, however, if this were to be implemented, transactions would be not instantaneously. You would need to wait for full confirmations. (this function would be apart of our full platform).  For the devices, although they may have the capability of receiving and transmitting payment (which you will be able to see in the demo), however, without proper certifications and meeting standard requirements, we will not be able to obtain payment licensing. (North American has stricter standards than other countries)  This why we have stated in our road map, that device integration will be released in Q3.  More specifically we expect it to be 5-6 months, as payment processor / Acquirer would than need to verify the certifications and standards of the devices and receiving/transmitting capabilities.  As for our full complete platform payment gateway, again, will need to proper certifications and meet standard requirements to obtain any type of payment license. Thus, as stated before, payment licensing will be required as correlated to what is being released.  ",False

However, we are explaining the difference between the two projects.    We cannot locate their Whitepaper since the link is not active, however, we will make references to prior articles,    from https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/pundi-x/  The company wants to make it easier for brick-and-mortar businesses to accept digital currencies in-store, Our aim is to serve both online and offline retailers, not just brick and mortar.    The system involves the following core features:   The Pundi X Pass, which lets you store cryptocurrency securely, buy and sell digital tokens with a single swipe, and spend it over a card at Pundi X POS terminals At the moment, we will not offer a ""BaapPay"" card to purchase items, on our platform you need to use our wallet/accounts  Mobile payment integration, with digital wallets that you can use to buy, sell, and accept cryptocurrency (Pundi X plans to integrate itself with existing digital wallet solutions) We will not integrate with digital wallets at this time. However, since our POS software is almost ready to be released, will integrate our POS with existing payment gateways, . However, that is not in our road map because it is not our final product. We plan to be our own payment gateway solution.(depending on the region, we might partner up with another gatway solution in conjunctions with ours.)     Top-up using fiat currencies or a bank card at any Pundi X location; or, top up your balance over your mobile wallet We will not have this function, as our system is not based on a card. Balances, crypto and fiat, will available on our payment gateway accounts. These account will be connect to your bank account and wallet.  Use cryptocurrency to pay utility bills As of this moment, we do not have the option because we do not offer a card that can be funded,  Use cryptocurrency to buy and sell goods this is basic of all payments  WHAT THEY HAVE THAT WE DO NOT  establish credit history and reduce financial risk- We do not offer this function  intelligence clearing system to increase the value of the store properties We do not have this function, however, if I understand correctly, it can be comparable to our liquidity pool. Yet, our liquidity pool is not based upon prior sales and history which is incorporated into a intelligence system. Our liquidity pool is based upon available funds, regardless past history  Recently, they have added the options of  3rd party Payment gateway integration, Again, We will integrate with third parties . However, that is not in our road map because it is not our final product. We plan to process the payment ourselves with our gateway.  support alipay, e2pay, go-pay etc We are not sure how they are going to do this, however, in our system, this payment would not go directly to the account holder account. It would be processed as a debit payment and processed through the payment gateway.  WHAT WE OFFER THEY DO NOT HAVE (from our understanding)  Our Own App store (dev can hold account within our payment gateway for payment) Our own Fiat & cryptocurrency payment gateway Fiat-crypto conversion with your own account fait-fait conversion with your own account third party POS integration Liquidity pool   Ecom Fiat & cryptocurrency payment gateway Resolution center Connect bank account to BaapPay account  SIMILARITIES  POS system Devices, Selling and buying crypto, ( however, ours will be done within our payment gateway)  Since it is a payment system, there will also be other similarities.  NOTE  It would be impossible for us to copy their idea, considering the fact that we are in the process of releasing our POS software. Also, a platform of this magnitude cannot be reseached or developed with a couple of months. The research has been in place for over a 1 year.    YOUR OTHER QUESTON  As for SDK, why would that be regulated? If you are referring to integration of fiat and crypto,we are in a different situations. Yes, there are strict regulations, however, if followed properly, with proper connections, it can be done. Also, we are located in Canada and pundix is located in Indonesia. Please refer to the below  https://hacked.com/ico-analysis-pundi-x/  Jurisdiction risks. Will this device be legally allowed in retail stores? Pundi responds to this question, “The Indonesian authority has stated that cryptocurrency can be bought and sold as virtual goods. However, it is not allowed to be treated as currency. We will abide by this rule. We are in the final phrase of agreement to use an e-money license with a partnering company. According to Indonesian law, an e-money license is one of the essential licenses in the Fintech business in Indonesia, it allows the user to deposit, pay, withdraw and transfer money online. We are also actively seeking counsel from Indonesia’s Central Bank (BI) and Financial Service Authority (OJK). -1?   As stated many times before, we are not here to contemplate the better project of the two. It is great to see a project that is actually launching their product into the market. This is only beneficial for  pundix, however, us and the rest of the crypto community.  The greater crypto adoption amongst the public, the greater business opportunities we all receive.",False

If I may suggest, you need to have an access where real-time interaction with your community is possible, e.g. telegram. In reference to several telegram channel that I followed, some are from big and successful projects, they have a strong team that's consisted of people from different countries. The aim is to make sure that despite the time zone differences, there still one or two representative that will attend to customer's concern. IMO, although this may seems costly, it is still essential to show that your team is more than ready to address your community concern.  On the opposite, several communities that I also followed, that took around 12 hours for replies due to they need to wait for the dev team to be online, coincidentally or not, was... well, I don't think you've even hear their name stands out from the pool of ICO projects.",False

Yes, there are similarities with different projects, however, they do not offer all the functionalities into one project.  One project may offer a liquidity pool, however, they might not offer fiat merchant services. Another project may offer a Appstore,  however, will use a third party to process their payments, and etc.  Our platform combines many aspects; Payment gateway, POS, and app store and even a cryptocurrency exchange.  Also, will do not want to be dependent upon third party services, ie, processing payments under a third visa/mastercard account, as they may deny your service at any time, if some sort of issues were to arise.  Pundix looks like a really great project, however, I think you are comparing two different projects. Unlike Pundix, on our platform, our merchants do not have to use our POS system. A third party company can develop and deploy their own POS app on our system.  In this situation, merchants would just use our payment gateway, devices, app store.  Example.  company X is a well know POS software company, they can develop and deploy their app onto our platform. Company X would not be limited to only our platform. As they may have another payment processor for their android/ ios platform.  Company X now offers their customers different options and are not restricted to one payment processor. In addition, developers may port apps from android or develop specialty apps for our devices and integrate them into any POS app.  We also offer a economical device, “MPOS” which can turn your desktop, mobile or tablet into a payment terminal.  Another feature is the liquidity pool, giving merchants the option to convert crypto in fiat and guaranteeing the transaction in seconds.  As for product deployment, we are not that far behind Pundi X(in terms of deploying the same type service), as our POS should be ready for public beta testing within the next couple of weeks and a full release soon after. Within 3-5 months we shall have completed the deployment architecture integration of both devices, meaning that we can plug in any payment gateway, be it ours or a third party. ( which is what i think they are deploying now). Therefore, even though we will started 4 months after them, if were were deploying the same services,(we still have the payment gateways and app store to develop) we would only be 3-5 months behind.  Also, we are not sure if they are offering PCI certified devices, however, in most first world countries, ie North America, Many European countries etc. only PCI certified devices are allowed to be integrate and transmit payments. However, with that said, it still looks like a great project.  As for regulations, it is dependant upon each region and country. Each will have their own rules and regulations that must be complied with. Thus, our system will have limitations and will be developed to each region’s regulations which would be relayed according to the users IP.",False

It became a nuance and a risk for merchants because they had to wait a long time before the transaction was fully confirmed. If they didn't wait for full confirmations, they ran the risk of double dipping, thus, would be defrauded by the customer. However, in our platform, our liquidity pool would solve that dilemma. Instead of waiting for each transaction to be confirmed by the blockchain, our state channels allow the customer transactions to be funded through a liquidity pool. This removes the need for each payment to be individually written to the blockchain, and makes point of sale purchases instant.  The security is that all transactions will happen within the exchanges wallet. Therefore, a transaction will only be processed if the user has the cleared funds available. ",False

VISION  https://i.imgur.com/cXsF1cd.jpg    BaapPay is a multi-layered platform which features a payment gateway, point of sale system and software, and our very own BaapWorld app store which we will elaborate on later in this document. We believe that as cryptocurrency adoption further penetrates businesses and the lives of consumers, there will be a point where; buying, selling, and trading cryptocurrency will be a part of everyday living. The payment platform is built to work with existing credit card infrastructure; including credit/debit cards and will employ payment processing protocols and flows for cryptocurrency similar to traditional electronic payment systems. This approach should enable easier and faster adoption of cryptocurrency as a mainstream payment platform, which in turn gives the merchants a higher level of convenience to accept any method of payment that is presented to them by the customer.

In retailer/commercial, sellers need access to their money instantly, therefore, funds need to be transfer instanously.
