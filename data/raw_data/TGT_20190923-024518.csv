A few updates:  1. The fund has started operating yesterday. 2. Because of health issues and personal problems I have resigned from Target Coin and will not be holding any TGTCoins. 3. I have transferred my stake back to the company.  4. Handling all operations to the amazing Target Coin team, who will be taking care of all operations. Akshath, Shaun , Rohit , Prakhar and others.  5. As of yesterday, the fund was up 4% in trading.  6. Listing will happen soon and buy orders will be created on etherdelta from 15th to create enough liquidity and allowing bounty token holders to exit and others to buy more. You can add a custom token and trade it right now.  7. If fate allows me to get better soon, I shall start a closed-end Singapore based registered fund management company  (RFMC) in future. Details of which shall be shared in my personal group here - https://t.me/joinchat/AFFozAr2N_iZkIprJvCcXA   8.

My issues here are:  1)   Lack of communication from the team following the close of the ICO. I appreciate that the trading platforms need to be set up and beginning to trade will take a lot of effort, however the team has been near silent on this since the ICO closed. I have emailed the team and not had a response on this. 2)   Unsold coins not being burned. This is very risky and as has been stated, seems a bit fishy. From my non-technical background, one possible explanation could be that these are being held for future ICOs? My understanding is that for individuals to buy into the fund in the future there will be other coin offerings? These may be therefore being held as a form of off market shares, that will be used for this purpose (companies on the FTSE are able to hold repurchased or issued shares for example) which would not impact the MCAP of the coin. 3)   Again back to the lack of communication. From what I previously read, details of the progress of the trading team needs to be communicated. This is a fast moving and volatile market, and informing investors every quarter (when the bonus is paid) is way too slow. To generate interest in the project, which would then help reflect value in the coin, there needs to be good PR about the healthy returns the team are generating. Again this needs to be on a regular basis and not just quarterly.  At this point it would be nice to have some official comms on the above issues, as well as an update on the website to confirm they have started trading.  From a scam point of view, if its true that the 400m included in the ICO total is from the 400m sold before the ICO, then there is surely more money to be made from running this as a business as stated. The additional investment from public investors is not significant in the grand scheme of things. 15% returns for the business could easily dwarf simple fraud if they run it well.  Still holding out hope that this is the real deal and not a scam. I don’t see anything Ive read so far to confirm for me one way or another.",False

That is different than initially stated. Also, to lock in profits coin holders need to actively sell off Targetcoin in the market now. Since Targetcoin is paying dividends (right?) it will not be easy to find exchanges coin holders deem user friendly (personally I hate liqui and hitbtc for example, but for everyone this is different).  So again, dev, could you please explain, what happened to the plan of the whitepaper with dividends? Has it changed to buybacks, if so, why? Personally I am disappointed since I was hoping to hold on to this for a long time and still get return in dividends.",False

Or was this already in the Whitepaper (which would mean I missed it)? Wouldn't it be more dependant on increasing or diminishing returns of scalability to issue more tokens? As at a certain level of capital diminishing returns might be the case for example as a consequence of lack of liquidity in these immature markets? Making such a decision based on investor interest would only be a big mistake in my opinion.  Besides this, what will the price of these tokens based on? As current investors might see this as a potential cap on token value. I already invested and might be interested to invest more, but this is something targetcoin needs to be very clear about in advance.  It sounds very vague, surprising and strange to me (to say that additional investor interest, which currently seems to be lacking, can be a reason to issue additional coins) anyway as the current ICO (leaving the pre ico out of consideration) looks not really succesful in raising funds as the ICO raised really little compared to most other projects.",False

If the fund losse money is the 10% still paid out (10% is very much on the high side compared to approx 2 in normal hedgefund in my opinion)  2. After each quarter the max intrinsic value of the fund is the starting value because of fee and dividends?  3. More in delth info about track record, trading history would be appreciated.  4.

Just wanted to go through some numbers.  Example 1: the fund makes no money but just plays even. Fund intrinsic value = 80 million for 100% of the coins. Team gets 8 million (10%). This seems so weird to me. Does the fund have to make up the fee before dividends are started?  Example 2: the fund loses 40 million, fund intrinsic value = 40 million for 100% of the coins. Team gets 4 million? This seems very wrong for me. I see no mention of a high water mark. Why are you guys not working with a high water mark if you are so confident you will make money? I am sure this would ease the minds of potential investors.  Target Coin team is taking 13 % of the coins (80 * 0.13) 10.4 million worth of coins. Besides dividend on these coins 15% of total profit. With all this in mind I think 10% standard fee + no high water mark (investopedia is your friend if you dont know what this means) sends a wrong signal, conflicting with the confidence that the white paper sends.  With a normal, customary 1.5-2% fee and a high water mark this would be a no brainer for me as I believe the project has so much potential (although it would be nice to see some track record).  In the linked interview this comes along:  Does the team have a history of trading other assets?  The team as well as me have over 18 years of experience in trading and investing in equities, foreign exchange as well commodity markets. Our primary focus has been the concentrated equities portfolio which as we speak is up over 90% in the past 3 years.(i.e a CAGR of over 28% YoY)  90% over the past 3 years is not normal. Not a single hedgefund in the world makes 28% per year consistently.I am not saying scam at all! I actually believe Crypto gives a lot of opportunity for long/short funds, but I would like to see what the 70-200% RISK ADJUSTED return is based on/how it is calculated.  Finally, if 85% of profit is paid to token holders, and 15% is charged as a performance fee. You start with 80 mln, aim to be 500 mln in 2019, where does the other 420 mln come from? All the profits after 10% fee go to the team and the token holders. Perhaps I am missing something really simple, so please enlighten me :-)  Don't get me wrong, I am very disturbed by the ridiculous 10% fee and the lack of high water mark, but good traders in immature volatile markets have so much potential, I could still put my money in this ICO!",False

The dividend is based on net profit. If the fund loses money, guaranteed bonus is paid out while the profits will be paid out in the next quarter. If the fund makes a net annual loss, we will not charge the entire 10% fee.  The 10% fees are higher for the first year because of the initial development, maintenance and research costs, which we shall revise after the first year.  2. Yes.

We have been trading in the traditional financial markets since years and have been fund managers previously managing a $25mn hedge fund - Alexandrite Capital.  Will share a snap of our crypto fund here in a separate post soon.  4. Risk adjusted return means minimising your downside in any trade. i.e Your average risk to reward ratio for each trade is 1:2 That means that for every dollar you risk, you make sure that you make at least $2. In that case, even if the fund manager is right for just 50% of the times, the fund will make (0.5*2 - 0.5*1)*100 = 50% returns.  At Target Coin we plan to maintain a minimum risk to reward ratio of 2.5 for each trade, making the downside minimum for each investors.",False
