They made a big mistake working for Orderbook. Anyway, this is how I think it works: you sent your ETH from MEW to the ETH receiving address inside of Orderbook.  In time, these funds will be transferred into PRO tokens automatically (which makes me wonder about the funds one might have already had inside this terrible wallet).  Anyway, in time this transfer will occur and the PRO tokens will sit into this orderbook account.  Only after the ICO is complete will they be released so that you can transfer them to your MEW.  So, I think you are fine.  This is what I think will happen, but again, who knows?  What a nightmare.  How difficult is it to write instructions to an ICO and get someone off the street to read them, use them and see if they are sufficiently explanatory?  Good god. I moved onto Salt instead.

Propy team plans to have agreements with multiple Land Registries/Recording offices to use blockchain hashes for each ongoing transaction. The Propy's smart contracts developed are compatible with US legislation, while our DApp is to enable buyers from China, Canada, the Middle East, Latin America and more to legally validate real estate transactions. Propy is currently working with lobbyists in California and Vermont to accelerate the acceptance of Propy Registry as a legally valid source of trust in the US. Additionally, Propy is working with governments of several emerging countries (Middle East, Central America, and Eastern Europe), where the transition to new systems is more straightforward due to the lack of regulatory complexity. Also, we are continuously negotiating with international governments to achieve our long-term objectives of establishing a fully decentralized P2P platform on the Propy Registry. We are currently discussing agreements with Dubai, as part of the common mission to bring city properties into the Blockchain for more efficient transactions. By 2020 Dubai is planning to bring the entire city’s business activities on the Blockchain. In addition, we are almost ready to announce some other updates on the subject of other agreements and we'll make it soon, so please stay tuned!   Also answering your other question regarding team itself - Propy as a project is located in US, California. The team is international, it comprises specialists from different countries.

Additionally, Propy is working with governments of several emerging countries (Middle East, Central America, and Eastern Europe), where the transition to new systems is more straightforward due to the lack of regulatory complexity.

We are currently discussing agreements with Dubai, as part of the common mission to bring city properties into the Blockchain for more efficient transactions. By 2020 Dubai is planning to bring the entire city’s business activities on the Blockchain.

We want to thank everyone for the support, involvement and creative initiatives.    Crowdsale Structure  Please note that the Pre-sale phase will be closing soon. We remind you that the minimum amount to participate in the pre-sale is $50,000 in ETH and the bonus is 10%. Our Crowdsale Structure is as follows: - Total PRO tokens supply - 100,000,000 - Price per token - $1.00 - First 24 hours of the crowdsale 10% bonus - Funding cap: 35M - Cryptocurrencies accepted: ETH & BTC; For any other cryptocurrencies, the real-time coin conversion widget will be available **Please note that only amounts less than 2.2 BTC can be converted with ShapeShift** - There is no minimum for crowdsale participation, the maximum is $500k    Subscribe to our newsletter and follow our official channels for all new updates!    Thanks for the update, and this is very interesting how many tokens left after the pre-sale. if I remember correctly it was $10 mln max cap available and and 35 mln cap on ICO includes this $10 mln or it is inside this $35 mln, in case on pre-sale max cap was reached, only $25 mln will be available  during ICO or it will be additional $35 mln? Who knows?      Let me clarify this to you: total PRO tokens supply is 100,000,000. According to our official announcements, for pre-sale we reserve 10m tokens + 1m bonus tokens, and 35m tokens for the crowdsale including its 10% bonus of tokens available at the first 24 hours.     Quote from: jacaf01 on August 05, 2017, 05:28:20 AM 10 days to ICO date, I won't participate in pre-sale but I still think the first day bonus is fair too, because we all both get 10% bonus for the  pre-sale and first day investors    You are welcome to choose the best alternative for you! We are equally happy to the participants at pre-sale and crowdsale. Stay tuned with Propy!    ",False

I saw a lot of failed ICO's last month. They either ran away with funds, give zero value tokens or no tokens at all. I'd like to learn about your instance on this.    I understand your point. And we need to take into account SEC's recent decision made in relations of all digital assets, mainly DAO tokens. Propy token is not securities and we'll be successful to prove that, we have such abilities. We are sure of our product and project. Answering directly your question regarding escrow - yes, there is an escrow for our token sale, and if we do not meet our minimum raise of $500,000, all token purchases will be refunded.

Dear Propy Supporters,     Our team is happy to announce that the pre-sale has begun and it is going with great success as expected!     We would like to inform you that we decided to move the token sale to early-mid August because our engineering team is applying additional security measures. It is an important action to take considering recent hacker attacks on Parity multisig wallets and Coindash.     The great news is that after the upgrade, Bitcoin will be added as a form of payment for the crowdsale.     This decision was made in full compliance with our community interest, with the objective to enhance your overall experience during the crowdsale. Your support is greatly appreciated.     Given the estimates from our engineering team and considering the upcoming fork in the Bitcoin network, the actual crowdsale date will be announced on August 2nd or 3rd and it's planned to be launched ~10th-15th of August.       Ambisafe as Token Sale Partner     As some of you already know, Ambisafe is taking care of securing to the highest standard the entire technical token sale process.     We would also like to applaud Ambisafe’s team member Oleksii Matiiasevych, who acted bravely as white hat in rescuing additional accounts during this week’s attack. Read more about it here: https://www.ethnews.com/meet-the-unknown-maverick-white-hat-who-rescued-accounts-missed-by-the-whg-during-this-weeks-attack      We are committed to offer you the best experience at Propy and we truly believe that the real value of our tokens lies within the community, and the technology the developers are creating.

Only negative feedback is present despite multiple successful and well functioning projects 2. His post history is pure trolling and a couple of dumb questions like “how to launch a wallet” 3.

Additionally, to provide our customers with the best possible experience we are entering into a partnership with Civic.      Civic is a successful identity protection and management startup using blockchain technology. In conjunction with its recent token sale, Civic set aside 33% of the 1 billion tokens it created to distribute among partners with Propy being one of them.  Vinny Lingham, a co-founder and CEO of Civic, says, ""Encouraging wide distribution is something that we have really focused on because we are trying to build a network effect and now we will continue to forge more partnerships to strengthen this network and give Civic users more opportunities to leverage this technology.""  Besides his executive talent, Vinny Lingham is a real asset to Propy as he is one of our advisors.

Then we decided to take this picture to immortalize the time we were on this catamaran enjoying the sun while discussing how every industry is being disrupted by Blockchain technologies.

It will allow real estate assets to become liquid while providing users with greater control and protection of their property rights to those provided by the government in whose jurisdiction the real estate asset is located. Thus Propy is building a new ecosystem of token holders, brokers, governments and end users incentivized to support the transition to a seamless, secure and globally recognized P2P transaction ecosystem.

Quote from: wankle on June 29, 2017, 01:55:34 AM The team and advisors look fantastic! Bessemer?? Theyre a huge global venture capital firm. I cannot wait for this ICO and see what this company can do. To all the naysayers, this is an investment you hold onto long term.  If they incentivize local real estate peeps, they will do most of the legwork to build the inventory and sales for this program.  As previous people on this thread have stated ""what about the local governments"". Youre talking global and most (not all) city and local govts' will be receptive to this. Granted, some will accept this faster than others. Do you know how much foreign investments can boost the local economies? IMO- If you looking to get rich fast, this isnt for you. This is longterm and Im excited to see how it progresses Many thanks for your positive feedback.  Quote from: UrsaMajorisBeta on June 29, 2017, 02:10:22 AM Spanish translation reserved Thanks.

Says you completed a transaction prototype & marketplace, is that available or is that the propy app? Any github links?  The Propy app has no reviews for any versions, is it new? Does it have any user base?  Seems there are a few articles out like hufpo for this and more for propy app but hard to tell if that's just paid since there's not much of a community. Is there a market strategy or someone in charge of marketing?  Not criticizing, I'm interested in the project but seems quite early for an ICO if the above isn't really addressed.  The links to github and whitepaper are being released next week.

This pool of PRO aims for incentivizing engagement with the platform. Propy users receive PRO rewards for undertaking certain actions on the platform. For example, when a broker, home buyer, or home seller joins the platform, they receive a reward for doing so in PRO. Other 15% of the total supply of PRO is to provide support to blockchain’s widespread integration. Propy’s success is tied to the success of blockchain technology, that's why it's important to support it and to donate to its further development. So, this is about Propy's donations. Finally, 15% of the total token supply is reserved for the Propy team. This is meant to provide a source of long term liquidity for support and expansion of the team. As Propy’s platform grows in users and transaction volume, Propy will need to increasingly support, grow, and educate its team. I tried to clarify you how Propy distributes its tokens. In this case it's not possible to say that the majority of tokens is the hands of devs.",False

Having lived overseas for a large portion of my life, this solves some real world problems when it comes to buying international real estate.  I love the concept.  What I don't like is that you are linking your token sale to fiat, ie $1 USD = 1 token.  Please consider linking it to crypto instead.  I think you will find more support in the community this way.  Also, you're timeline needs some work.  Investors need to see more details in regards to what is happening between Dec. 15 (transacting tool in production) and July 2020 (P2P transactions).  Ideally you would bring on additional staff with some of the ICO money and try and speed that timeline up.

Once companies that require access to the government registries realize that they have faster and more convenient solution (Ethereum blockchain) they'll start using it as a primary source of data. 3. Once government's realize that most of the consumers of the database already using blockchain and it works, they should be comfortable declaring it as a primary one.
