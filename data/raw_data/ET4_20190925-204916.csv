Eticket4 is a secondary market ticketing platform developed by Israeli enterpreneurs, it is operating since 2016 and registered in BVI. Eticket4 has been selling tickets for major events in Russia and recently started to sell tickets for Katy Perry's concert in Singapore (check it out). Advisory board consists of people related to Huawei, e-shelter, Canonical (Ubuntu) (follow this link to read more about the magnifiscent Eticket4 team members). Please check the token sale website: http://et4.io and the platform itself: https://eticket4.com.  The Eticket4 platform seeks to expand functionality, incentivise customers and introduce a decentralized approach to ticketing. ET4 tokens are generated by the smart contract during Token Generation Event (TGE). The maximum number of tokens is 30 million.  Eticket4 ticketing platform exists and its functionality is already available to ticket brokers and ticket buyers. With the introduction of the blockchain-based functionality all token holders will contribute their efforts to its further development and receive new possibilities that would likely extend their knowledge of ticketing market and help them to take extra advantage of it. Effectively, the success and further development of the ET4 platform to a wide extent depends on the event organisers, ticket brokers and ticket buyers and the ways they prefer to use it.   TOKEN HOLDER'S ROLES  Take advantage of all the platform’s features: the token holder acts a platform participant, e.g. the event organizer, the ticket broker or the ticket buyer.
