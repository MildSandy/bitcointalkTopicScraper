At the end of the day, one of the most important goals for any of these projects is developer adoption and ease of implementation... which are the keys to long term success. I can't speak other projects, but Tierion seems to have kept this in focus with the Chainpoint Logic App, developed in conjunction with Microsoft, nearing launch any day now (https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/shared_chainpointnode/chainpoint/).  Tierion also scales extremely well, which is necessary for most practical business applications of connecting data to public blockchains. Each node is capable of over 50M proofs per day on relatively cheap hardware (https://medium.com/tierion/chainpoint-2018-review-78c0581df4ec)  I have my concerns with the tokenomics behind TNT which is likely the chief reason for its low market cap. It is an issue that hopefully will be cleared up in the near future, as a roadmap is scheduled for release in Q1 2019. However, I suspect since Tierion operates more like a traditional company, they are waiting for further regulatory guidance before they lay their hand on the table... which is understandable, even though the eagerness is killing me inside.  Having said all that, do I think Chainlink is worth over 30x TNT at $190M vs $6M? Or Aeternity over 15x at $90M vs $6M? TNT seems like a pretty solid value in comparison considering their business partnerships.  Here's a pretty good review to check: https://www.coinbureau.com/review/tierion-tnt/",False

It also allows new users a chance to register nodes outside of the people who previously registered nodes in the short/competitive registration windows. At this point, it is too early to judge whether open registration has a positive or negative effect on price. Long term, (in theory) it should aid in price appreciation as a larger share of circulating TNT is held in nodes; but this would require a much larger share percentage than current levels. (Currently: ~8075 nodes x 5000 TNT = 40.375M TNT / 428.481M circulating TNT = 9.42% TNT in nodes)  As far as hash data, there is a service discovery mechanism that identifies the most reliable nodes and sends data to them.

The current time to a reward is 8256 nodes / 48 rewards/day = ~172 days (5.7 months)  With a reward size of 1500 TNT, the current 8256 nodes, and a minimum balance of 5000 TNT, the yearly ROI (in TNT) is ~63.7 %.  The dollar amount ROI is a little more tricky and dynamic to calculate as it is a function of the number of nodes on the network, future reward amount / reward frequency, and VPS hosting costs.   On the short term, I think it is easiest to look at it as a 30% ROI in TNT in ~6 months for $30 in hosting costs ($5 x 6 months). Basically if you are a long term holder and believe in the project and higher future token prices, its not a bad idea to run some nodes. If you are looking for a month to month stream of income, at this point the risk would outweigh the benefits with such a long time to reward and price volitility over that time period.... but this mentality applies across the board for crypto mining in general. Historically there have only been a few 3-6 month windows where mining is extremely profitable; in between booms, you're lucky if you can break even.",False

When you hold 5000 TNT to operate a node, you don't lose your principal balance... it is just held there while operating the node. Node profitability is a factor of many things, including the price of TNT, the number of nodes on the network (dictating win probability), and the size of the reward. Assuming the price doesn't change, at $0.22 you are making (on average) that ~$92 a month with your only overhead being the $5-10 / month hosting cost.   You are basically doubling your investment in one year... not finally turning a profit. Your main liability is the price of TNT while you hold to operate a node over the long term, but the current effective yearly interest rate (paid in TNT) buffers these fluctuations (currently ~87% (@ 4k nodes and 1000 TNT reward / 30 min, same for 5k nodes and 1250 TNT reward / 30 min)). At those returns, if the TNT price gets cut in half over the next year, you will break even. If it stays the same, you will double up. If it increases 10 fold, you will be up 20x.  That being said, the team has stated they are planning to open up registration completely in the future and eventually deliver more consistent rewards (moving away from lotto style). No date on these modifications, so we can only go on the node statistics currently available.  IMO though, node operation is a long term game which requires patience. If you're the type of person that is constantly hawking prices and swing trading around, I would't recommend operating a node... but history in crypto has shown the most profitable investment method is to literally do nothing for longer than anyone else.

After all, if there's no trading or perceived value, the ship goes down.  Regarding utility, I have to laugh at some of the pointless tokens launching over the last few weeks. One of the most egregious ones I saw recently had a roadmap that goes a little something like this...Generate basic ECR20 token > build amateurish website > conduct airdrop > conduct token sale > list on Etherdelta > bounty program > 2nd airdop > get listed on other exchanges. Sad thing is, that quite a lot of people seem to be falling for it. Complete money grab, with no raison d'etre, that anyone with the slightest skills could throw together in a day or two.  Tierion has real utility, but needs adoption - or at least more publicity around their wins, especially with competitors like Protex jumping into the same space.

There was a ""lottery"" reward system, of 6537 TNT attributed to one random node every 30 minutes. With a low number of nodes, this was very appealing, having more nodes increases winning stats.  That meant for long term investors, that they could leverage their investment - if you invested 50k$ in tierion, you could spawn 200 nodes, with a VPS at 5$ per month, cost of leveraging investment was only 1%... so why not.  Add to this that it is easy to write a script for the automation of nodes (I shared one at https://github.com/jupiter126/updatetierionnodes) - and have been reported it was used to spawn at least 500 nodes...  Hence many people started spawing many nodes, the count reaching over 10000 in 2 weeks of mainnet launch.  Now the thing is that tierion did not expect such a rise in the number of nodes.  On the one hand, the internal infrastructure of tierion was not ready to handle this kind of volume, while on the other hand so many people competing for rewards and testing the software uncovered a few bugs.  With those bugs being exploited in the wild, many node operators complained - hence tierion asked node operators to temporarily downsize their network to one node, and disabled the rewards for the time being.  My bet is that once Tierion has addressed those infrastructure issues and critical bugs, the network will return to ""normal operations"", reenabling rewards and telling nodeoperators to run as many nodes as they want. __________________ Edit: The attack described in a post above goes as following: chainpoint-cli can be used on any computer chainpoint-node is the node  To run the node, you some TNT, AND some credits, each time one chainpoint-cli sends a hash requests to a node, the node submits it to core and spends one credit. With the IP's of nodes available through the API, it was very easy for anybody to write a script, sending hash requests to a node, to deplete it from its credits. Right now, credits are free, and Tierion tops up all nodes every 24 hours, so this attack became pointless.  This is a temporary situation though, as credits sales to node operators seems to be Tierion's main revenue source.  This attack would allow to spend a competitors money in the worst case, and in the best case disrupt his node by getting his TNT balance lower than the requirement limit.  So yes the attack is DDOSING the network is done at node operators cost, not the attacker.",False

Tierion is backed by legitimate, real life use cases . Examples with big names, like Microsoft,  who is collaborating on a Tierion based service to generate, moderate and validate attestations, which is useful among review enthusiasts and people searching through resumes for a potential new job candidate.  Also on the list of names is mega brand, Philips using Tierion for upcoming IoT Data Proofs to collect info from MRI machines making easy to follow historically acccurate audit trails. Verifai is another one (my favorite use case) in cahoots with Tierion on a mission to even the playing field between artificial intelligence and humans. Humans are constantly subject to annnoying captchas to prove we are human.   Tierion and Verafai collaborated on the first service to make the ROBOTS do some work to validate the artificially rendered behaviors.  - Machine Learning Auditability is AWESOME.  Also it is worth mentioning the use case example of keeping the data from clinical trials totally untainted and with that more worthy of our trust as consumers.   I absolutely love the project ( hence the enthusiastic endorsement) and anyone who has not yet had a chance to review the whitepaper, here is a link to it: https://tokensale.tierion.com/TierionTokenSaleWhitePaper.pdf  I highly reccommend a read through, and NOW is the time the ICO wont last for long and it is going to meet its goal, anyone can see that.
