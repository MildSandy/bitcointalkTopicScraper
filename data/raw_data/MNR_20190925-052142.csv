This is the internal currency of the social network. Each MON token is worth the equivalent of 5 U.S. cents. Tokens are used to give likes to posts and reward users that post quality content to the network. In using tokens to give these likes, users that give them are also pushed up in the newsfeed alongside the accounts that are earning the likes.  Likes aren’t restricted to single tokens. If a user really likes a particular post, he will be able to hand over more tokens along with his like. It’s kind of a way to say thank you for something that is reinforcing the reason why people want to use social networks and showing appreciation for quality content. Transactions with MON tokens will all be made using special wallets that are tied to personal user accounts. Conversion of MON tokens to major cryptocurrencies and vice versa will all be possible in this wallet.  MON tokens are a great investment tool. Users are able to use them to support and promote projects and companies that they feel a connection with. Investing in companies will no longer require lengthy bureaucracy. Instead, investment can be made as easy as liking a project. Over time, a percentage of the earnings of new content creators will go back to the investors. The incentives for investment are great.  Monoreto will also feature online quizzes for its users. Winners will be awarded MON token prizes. These tokens can then be put to use as the user sees fit.  MON tokens can also be donated to charitable causes. Again, making a donation is as simple as liking a post. What’s more, the simplicity and transparency of this operation are a lot less off-putting than having to make a bank transfer.  https://www.facebook.com/monoreto/photos/a.571323913237768.1073741828.569153790121447/583749701995189/?type=3&theater",False

Thanks for your question! It is quite difficult to answer it in several words, we devoted the whole Whitepaper to it:)  However, we consider the two main issues as our biggest advantages. They are as follows: the motivation to put likes and the user cases of the platform.  If we want such a social network to work, we should create mechanisms that will make liking (and giving a small amount of money - 5 cents) profitable and useful for both sides. Other projects often lack such mechanisms.  So, why would you like someone's photos and videos, spend tokens in Monoreto?  - when you put likes, you also promote your own account in the newsfeed (along with accounts, that receive many likes) - if you put many likes, you can get a part of Monoreto's weekly profit (do not confuse it with making profit by just holding tokens, they are NOT securities) - by liking photos, you participate in forecast competitions. Like photos with a certain hashtag or from a certain category, and if they get the majority of votes (likes) you win and get prizes - we are creating such a platform that will also allow to hold online quizzes just like in HQ Trivia (that will surely be flooded by ads soon). The main distinction - in Monoreto we almost don't need ads to do something. People can earn directly by posting good content. So, a winner's pot in our online quizzes can be made from users' contributions (1-5 cents) - if you can transfer tokens with a ""like"" it is much easier to raise funds for businesses. Imagine Kickstarter with almost zero transaction costs. You see a great project - tap like button - you've just helped this project and can get some benefits from it (i.e. being among the first who get the product, visiting this project events as VIP or whatever else) - same goes with charity. People do want to help each other. But if it is not too much time-consuming and difficult. In Monoreto - one like can save a life - stars and celebrities will receive millions of likes because people love them. Also, imagine if the world-famous sportsman will be able to publish a post and include in the description that the top 3 active donators on the post will get the opportunity to meet him (for dinner, at a training club, etc...
