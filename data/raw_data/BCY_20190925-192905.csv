This is what I did: - Bought Bitcrystals - Bought (many) cards - Bought gems with google play - installed Casa tookan  Anything else I can do?  This is my wishlist: - Second different game where I can use SoG cards, unfortunately Age of Rust seems to go more the enjin way. Age of Rust is a dead birth for me! Why not creating your own ""Multiverse""? - Difficult second level in SoG for the advanced players - DEX for getting bitcrystals / counterparty - More cards (please the old design!!! The old design is much better than the new gold design!) Would buy all cards offered for a reasonable price!!! Why don't you use this business model, selling more cards? - Confirmation in Book of Orbs / Casa tookan should be faster, why waiting 6 confirmations??? 1 or 2 should be enough  - Why not integrate some new SoG-Enjin cards into the Game to have a mixture out of counterparty and enjin? You simply read both blockchains (i.e. Counterparty AND ENJ1155) It can coexist!! So make 50 new enjin-based-SoG-cards and sell them on enjin. Why must a game be placed only on one platform/blockchain? In casa tookan you bring the Ether(enjin) world and the counterparty world together. The right idea at the right time! This cross-mix would be very interesting!!! Technically it would be not too difficult to bring these 2 worlds together!  - Would like to play Moonga, but it was not on my android! Is it only iPhone? - Would like to help you developing, if interested: pm me",False

Could play it a long time without getting bored. The monthly campaigns are interesting. The card pictures are very artistic, like them too.  And the concept of game blockchainization has a bright future. Everything is fine.  There is just one little thing, that is buggy. The Book of Orbs has a problem with buying/selling. Does not work 95% of the time (api error). If it had worked, I would have bought many cards to get a better progress in the game.  But unfortunately it is for me not possible to buy cards at the moment. I tried several Platforms: Book of Orbs Web App, several Android versions... it does not work...

Volume is just not big enough. And more exchanges coin has, harder it is to maintain high volume on all exchanges. If you want to help then trade this coin. According to current situation: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcrystals/#markets and if there is no fake volume it is better that it gets delisted from Polo instead of Bittrex or Zaif. I think one good exchange is good enough for coin like BCY.  Quote from: JungleOnion on July 27, 2018, 02:46:38 AM I wonder if i buy BCY and hold, when the price corrects will the price for the blockchain cards decrease in terms of BCY? For example I need now with current prices more BCY to buy a card, but if price corrects will I need less BCY to buy cards? It is same rule for cards as for any other crypto currency -  supply and demand. What exactly do you mean by ""price corrects""? If you think of price decrease then it would be more logical that one card cost more BCY, since you pay less $ for same amount of BCY.",False

It is made for this and it works well. I guess you can also use IndieSquare wallet but it may be hard to operate with cards.  Quote Someone sent me some maps, but how do I get them out? You think cards? I don't have experience using IndieSquare wallet with SoG. But if you will use Book Of Orbs I promise you that you will be able to send them (cards) easily.  Quote Play once, saw that the cards are traded in tokens on the Bitrex exchange. Really? I know Bitcrystals are traded there, but cards? Again, if you will use Book Of Orbs things will be easier, you can send/receive/trade cards there. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=inc.indiesquare.orbbook&hl=en",False

And I found this website after 1 min of search: https://bitcrystals.com/documentation/ it is full of useful info so I suggest you check it out too.  If you want to send a card, you just click on card and press send. You type in number of cards you want to send (same kind of cards), scan QR code or type in address you want cards send to and send it. You have to have few satoshis in your wallet because the fees are paid in BTC. If I am not mistaken this also applies to creating market offer. - Instructions with pictures: https://bitcrystals.com/documentation/send-an-asset-on-book-of-orbs-web-app/  When you want to create market offer you click on card, press market. Place custom order. Type in number of cards you want to buy/sell (availability means how many cards are there in existence, not how many you have http://prntscr.com/k71487). Then type the price in BCY for your buy/sell offer. Place your order and then confirm it. Then your order is placed. Someone has to accept your order to get trade done. So make sure you put realistic prices. - Instructions with pictures: https://bitcrystals.com/documentation/sell-an-asset-on-book-of-orbs-web-app/  Just saw new logo for BCY while checking BoO. It is definitely better then previous one but I think this one could also be improved or maybe I just need to get used to it. Did anyone already requested for logo change on CMC? https://coinmarketcap.com/request/ I can do it if someone send me .png logo link. Also website is looking very nice, I like the fact that you are connecting with other games and making things like crystalcraft. Well done and I am looking forward to see what you are preparing for us in the future!",False

Just think about it; there is a reason that less and less cards are being sold.  And the less cards sold leads to less BCY burned, which in turn creates a vicious circle: less cards sold ---> less BCY burned ---> decline in BCY price ---> less demand for cards as less players interested to get card rewards due to declining price --->less BCY burned . ---> etc  A good game economy is Age of Rust.  Check how they are handling their assets and coins.  Not to mention that the rewards for solving puzzles includes bitcoins.  The higher the bitcoin price (which is more likely than this to happen to a shitcoin), the higher the reward, the higher the number of players, the higher the price for their ingame assets and coins.  To make my point about how bad the BCY burn trend is, lets compare the last few months with previous years: Sept-Oct 2015: 523,000 BCY burned Oct 2016: 72,000 BCY burned October 2017: 18,000 BCY burned  Nov 2015: 711,000 burned Nov 2016: 252,000 burned Nov 2017: only 33,000 burned  The more cards EDS is holding (mega whale), the less valuable those cards will be, and the less BCY will be burned.  Burn EDS unsold cards, then you will see a higher burn rate, and higher card prices along with higher BCY price.  BCY could finally be able to keep up with Bitcoins.",False

I told you several times that i dont understand why you bother with a game you dislike. You dislike it for like a year and all that anyone did was bad on your opinion. Are there no other games or projects you could monitor and more enjoy in them?  I really have no ideas who did this to you to show so much hate. You should get help and they will find reasons.  I just hope you live in country where medical help is free.  Just take time and read your post here and all previous here and on SoG forum and you will realize what I am talking about.",False

You don't like this game, you said this 3 times already on this this thread, so just stop playing and following this project instead creating FUD about whole project. I am following this project from the release of the game for andriod. I'm not saying they are perfect. Game really can become boring after a while. But still this is game which is still developing and far from completely done yet. Maybe one day number of players will increase significantly. And cards will become more valuable then they are now. But you won't be part of it, because you didn't believe in game now, when times are bad. (similar to supporters of cryptos who had to wait till 2017 and now time ''invested'' in it is paid off).

I believe SOG should significantly reduce the total number of cards (via a swap of some sort) and link ALL the new cards to new crypto projects as has often been done in the past.  - Almost no-one is keeping track of all 140 cards and they are not gaining collectability or value as result? - SOG would be far more relevant and correctly leveraging it's blockchain based USP if each card was linked to a specific crypto project.    2. Whatever price EDS sells the cards for, use 1/3 the proceeds to buy the underlying token the card represents.  (At any time a card owner can burn/destroy their card via EDS and receive the same amount of tokens that were purchased by EDS when the card was originally sold.)    Eg. Imagine if the Sir Ether Card was sold for $60 in July 2015 but $20 of that was used to back each one with say 10 ETH per card.   Sir Ether would have a burn & therefore base value of over $3000 today.  Using this strategy SOG would be distinctly differentiated from any other collectible card game & over time the growing crypto market would feed the value of SOG cards and so too their collectability and liquidity.    (Edit: In fact a lot of new promising crypto projects may give EDS some of the tokens which will be used to back the card for free/discount because of the marketing/publicity value a SOG card has & that it markets their new project to the SOG user base.)",False

Ethereum is not scalable, had a network failure, and is going down the drain.  Any token or game asset on a bitcoin blockchain is the most secure.  No need to create a shitcoin on top of a scamcoin.  Also providing a quote from Cloverme at Rustbits (spacepirate) explaining why Ethereum sucks:  ""There's a couple of reason for sticking with counterparty, the first is that working with Solidity (the language for Ethereum contracts) to manage tokens is still very, very rough, and very difficult to work with programmaticly. It's almost 100 lines of complex code to issue a token in Solidity/Eth whereas in Counterparty, it's about 6 lines of code. In fact, on the Ethereum page itself, it says ""The token contract is quite complex"".  I can appreciate that, Vitalik is a very smart guy, but it's not path I can really take at this point with the game development.  There are also some known issues with using Eth tokens that came to light with the Golem project that allows tokens to be transferred with a modified private key.""",False

The organizer, Swiss game studio EverdreamSoft (EDS), is the creator of Spells of Genesis (SOG). SoG is a mobile game combining principles of classical trading card games, such as strategy and deck collection, with some arcade aspects. What differentiates Spells of Genesis from other games available on the market is its linking to the blockchain technology.  From “True Ownership” to “Digital Craftsmanship”  Spells of Genesis allows players to have true ownership of their digital assets through the bitcoin blockchain. SoG places some cards on the blockchain and thus gives them some properties of physical items. Like physical cards, blockchain cards in Spells of Genesis can be used in the game, but also given, exchanged or traded outside of it, on the blockchain. However, true ownership of digital assets is just the beginning of EDS’s vision. EverdreamSoft wishes to go far beyond easing exchanges between peers.  In his speech, Shaban Shaame, CEO and founder of EverdreamSoft, introduced the concept of the “digital craftsmanship”.  Digital Craftsmanship  Shaame’s  idea of digital craftsmanship is based on three pillars: Crafting - Sharing - Uniting.  Crafting  Thanks to a new platform code-named “Nova”, anyone will be able to express their talents and benefit from the expertise of others. For example, a piece of music, a code or any other item can be placed on the blockchain, which will guarantee its scarcity and authenticity. We call those items “digital crafts”. In Spells of Genesis, players will be able to create their own game levels or characters and share them with others.   Sharing  These digital crafts can be given, exchanged, or sold. They can be used as rewards, and implemented for example in a loyalty system.  Uniting  Digital crafts can also be combined and used to build new crafts. Shaban illustrated his idea with the example of a chocolate bar: you need cocoa, milk and sugar to make one. In the digital sphere you’ll also be able to combine several “ingredients” to craft a new item.  In Spells of Genesis, you will be able to use a drawing of dragon with a level background created by your fellow players and unite them to craft an original game level.   Implementation  We’re currently gathering feedbacks and polishing the “Nova” model.  While still refining our business model, we’re going to implement a prototype into Spells of Genesis by the end of 2017. Then, in 2018, EDS will start building a multi-chain platform, integrating at least Bitcoin blockchain and Ethereum in the beginning.  Moreover, BitCrystals holders will benefit from the platform and its implementation. BitCrystals will be directly or indirectly integrated in the “Nova” platform. We will publish further details about the business model and BitCrystals implementation in due time.  Building a Fairer Economy  “The power of the crowd is much bigger than the power of one game studio.” said Shaban Shaame. At EDS, we believe that digital co-creation will help to build a fairer economy where everyone will be able to enhance their expertise and be fairly rewarded for sharing their crafts with others.",False

Actually you can play the game without the existence of BCY.  You can even acquire all the game assets without BCY as you can buy them with Bitcoin or XCP.  In other words, BCY is presently quite useless as it does not provide anything more than what Bitcoin can provide.  The only use for BCY was the ICO, but it should have been burned 100% after redemption of bonus.  Also BCY is not a representation of the game's popularity as it is not an equity either.  On the other hand, XCP is not a shitcoin because XCP is needed to make Counterparty work.  XCP is also not a scamcoin as the issuance for every XCP was done through the burning of Bitcoin (unlike Omni which is a scamcoin)",False

And until it is released there is nothing to see, so I wouldn't say team was sleeping. (I may be wrong, If you have more details about their inactivity you have different opinion)  Quote from: bitabit on June 22, 2017, 12:04:15 AM Quote from: Geenstijl on June 21, 2017, 12:41:53 PM I can not understand how people can call this a shitcoin. It actually delivers a very addictive and professional looking game....  The coin does not deliver a game.  Actually you can play the game without the existence of BCY.  You can even acquire all the game assets without BCY as you can buy them with Bitcoin or XCP.  In other words, BCY is presently quite useless as it does not provide anything more than what Bitcoin can provide.  The only use for BCY was the ICO, but it should have been burned 100% after redemption of bonus.  Also BCY is not a representation of the game's popularity as it is not an equity either.  On the other hand, XCP is not a shitcoin because XCP is needed to make Counterparty work.  XCP is also not a scamcoin as the issuance for every XCP was done through the burning of Bitcoin (unlike Omni which is a scamcoin) You are right, you can play SoG without BCY, but you can't say they are useless and completely unrelated. 1. If the game works well there will be more interest in SoG cards. 2. If there is more interest in buying SoG cards there is interest for BCY. 3. You can't buy SoG cards with any other cryptocurrency except BCY, so we could say Bitcoin is useless (of course not) 4. I'm still new in world of cryptocurrencies, but as I see the things for now there are plenty of coins which truly are useless (only for trading), in BCY's case I think there is very good base for real need of the coin. 5. They are working with other games so you can use same card from Book of orbs in other games, which is very good for advertisment too.

If the game works well there will be more interest in SoG cards."" Agree that a percentage of players will be interested in the cards.  I would guess that it would be aournd 10% of active players assuming they learned about the game outside of the crypto community.  ""2. If there is more interest in buying SoG cards there is interest for BCY."" How so?  Are BCYs collectibles?  I would argue on the contrary, that SoG cards will take interest away from holding BCYs.  The sole purpose of holding BCY is to buy SOG cards, and only SOG cards at present.  ""3. You can't buy SoG cards with any other cryptocurrency except BCY, so we could say Bitcoin is useless (of course not)"" Go to http://tokenrank.tokenly.com/ and input any coin on the top right side and you will see all the SoG cards that can be sold for let say bitcoins.  For a seller it makes so much more sense to require Bitcoins rather than BCY as he doesn't need to go through the exchange to get Bitcoins.  Unless of course he wants to keep BCY for future purchases of SOG cards.  ""4. I'm still new in world of cryptocurrencies, but as I see the things for now there are plenty of coins which truly are useless (only for trading), in BCY's case I think there is very good base for real need of the coin."" Unfortunately, the present ""need"" of BCY is based on human made barriers such as creating an app that dictates to users what coins to use for what cards to buy.  However, in the case of swapbot, it is a real free market and you will notice that peer to peer independent traders prefer bitcoins to BCY or even XCP.  EDS needs to come up with a genius idea to make BCY truly valuable regardless of market speculation.  If BCY was integrated within the game, which App stores wouldn't allow, then BCY would be truly valuable.  ""5. They are working with other games so you can use same card from Book of orbs in other games, which is very good for advertisment too."" Agree, and this is why i'd rather collect cards than hold BCY.",False

Yesterdays presentation again proved that.

I once read that most of the money games like this earns comes from ''whales'' (players which spends a lot). Example: Let's say we have a group of 100 people, 95 people won't spend nothing, 4 will spend 10 BCY and that one ''whale'' will spend 1000 BCY. So total 1040 BCY and a big majority comes from one player. More players there are, bigger the chance of ''whale''.  2. We are still with that ''whale''. He downloads the game, find games interesting and want to buy cards. If he isn't really interested in cryptocurrenicies he will take the shortest and easiest way to get to cards: buy BTC, buy BCY with BTC and he will be ready to buy any card in Book of orbs. So he wanted cards in the first place, but he needed BCY to get them, so there is interest for BCY.  3. OK, you can buy with other currenices. I haven't seen this site you posted till today. But still if player of SoG isn't very interested in all this stuff he will just want to buy cards in BoO with minimum work.   4. I imagine things like this: There is a shop (BoO) which has only one currency as a payment method (BCY). They are selling products (cards) which you can use for having fun (SoG + some other games). This I think it is a good base for currency and there is some actual need for it. Although you are ''limited'' with what shop offer (is this what you thought?) it is still good thing in my opinion. You can buy same products on street or elsewhere (http://tokenrank.tokenly.com/ and swapbot(?) and others) for other currencies. But still many people will prefer to go to official shop.  So are the APP stores the only reason why there are two seperated apps (BoO and SoG)? I thought it made it easier to integrate cards for other games if there is a different app for cards and games. (a person may want to buy only card for some other game then SoG).  5. Nothing to ask/add.  I may be missing some crucial information which would make my statements stupid, so please correct me.",False

Tokens are too easy to create and the payoff so big, why would anyone build a game using someone else's token as in-game currency? It just makes no sense. In-game assets are a different beast, it would be great if their was a universal asset protocol, and I think there will be, however, in-game currency will never  consolidate to one token.

Our publisher thinks there is quite a big chance to be featured on the Appstore with our next game update, so we decided to postpone its release a bit to hit the right time slot and increase the possibility of being featured.  The next game update will be released on June 21st.  Multiplayer Mode   “Raid” is the name for the new multiplayer mode. Raid is an asynchronous Player vs. Player (PvP) mode. You won’t play against another player in real time but you’ll choose your opponent among other players from the same PvP rank and the cards from their Team will represent your enemies.   If you win, you will gain some gold, points for Raid-rank and even more. In the highest ranks, you can win Epic and even Legendary cards!  If you lose, you will lose some points, but not gold.  There are currently 14 Raid ranks and the gold reward increases with each rank, as well as your element based bonuses and enemy boosts.  Five New Campaigns  We also have great news for those who’ve completed all the current campaigns and who have reached the Sia level. In the new build, you’ll discover 5 brand new campaigns, and others are planned for the next game update.  Tutorial  The tutorial has been completely revamped. All core features, such as crystallizing, leveling up and fusing, are now explained. This will help new players see and understand the deep underlying gameplay elements.     If you don’t want to follow the tutorial you can quit it by opening the menu in the top-right corner and then pressing the button “Exit Tutorial”.  Game Experience Improvement  new Raid and Challenge button directly on map better font in battle better background in gold reward better placement of value in card upgrade better sizing of text field for different languages better placement of campaign icon on map settings button now available on every screen (suggested by community) boost value displayed in challenge mode advance view in team page always by default quest and achievement progression value display corrected better collision with arena side in battle possibility to go to connexion screen from settings menu loads of bugs all around  Wicked Werewolf Planning  We still have plenty of work to do and it is difficult to decide which features to bring first, because we’re excited about all of them as you certainly are!  For the next sprint, the “Wicked Werewolf”, first we need to evaluate the time necessary to implement different features. Then we’ll decide which ones will be included in the next update.  For sure, we’re going to define the rules of in-game cards blockchainization.  Blockchainization Specification  Blockchainization of in-game cards is a big feature. Before implementing it in the game, we need to define precisely which cards, and in which conditions, can be tokenized, and also to review each step of the planned blockchainization procedure. Once we’ve decided the last details, we will schedule its implementation.   We’ll keep you updated with next planned features announcement. Please stay tuned!",False

In addition, those fused in game cards will eventually become blockchainzed anyway.  I believe that the main difference between buying cards with BCY and earning cards by playing the game or buying with crystals is that the Ingame cards including the fused cards are not locked.  In other words, buying through BCY gives you better resale value.  Also, I am not sure if EDS is planing to allow blockchain cards to be fused in the future.  If they do that would be awesome because fusing cards of limited quantity would make them even rarer since they get burned through the process.  The cards you end up after fusing will be very unique, but I guess they would have to own a balance of those cards.",False

Now I got an idea to circumvent the appstore rule.  How about creating an in-game non-blockchan token and distribute according to player's ownership of bitcrystals. The player already provides a link to view his blockchain cards.  Just extend this to acknowledge the bitcrystals owned and have it represented by lets say non-blockchain ""crystals"".

I guess to spend 80 gold would have to be done through BCY on Book of Orbs or any other exchange.   Not sure if the app store allows game apps to be linked with other apps, but they do allow apps to be linked to web browsers as is the case with Spells of Genesis app.  I wonder if the current project ""Nova Crystalis"" is dealing with this shortcoming.  Also I understand that by quad fusing a non-blockchain card and leveling up to the maximum,  it would allow you to receive a blockchainized card.

We’ve been listening to the community requests and, after having considered all the advantages and risks of such an operation, we decided to give Partner and Premium rank members a possibility of transferring their membership, including Partner or Premium Merchant store access, under certain conditions.  The cards are not a part of this deal. The initial owner can sell their cards separately, or make an arrangement with the buyer to include them in this deal. EverdreamSoft doesn’t handle this part of the deal.   We appreciate the involvement and commitment of our early supporters. We think that those who followed the project since its beginning and who took a risk while backing Spells of Genesis back in 2015 have a good insight into the project. While acting as resellers, they help us promoting Spells of Genesis and spreading the concept of the true ownership of digital game assets.   We value our Partners and Premium members and we consider them as important actors in the BitCrystals ecosystem. Nevertheless, if a Partner or Premium rank member can’t, or doesn’t want to be a part of it anymore, we assume that passing their status over to a new member will be more beneficial for the whole economy.   Therefore we decided to set following rules for any future Partner or Premium status transfer:  A membership can only be transferred once in a calendar year A certain amount of BitCrystals (see the chart below) is burnt as transfer fee The BCY to be burnt are sent from the current Partner or Premium rank member’s address The transfer fee in BCY needs to be sent directly to the BitCrystals burn address: 1BURNSogXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXW3ny2Y The buyer has to be a registered SoG user The seller will provide us with the buyer’s username and XCP address, together with the burn tx If any of the above conditions is not fulfilled, the transfer can’t be carried out or may be considered as invalid. One week is needed to operate the transfer The below pricing is valid for 2017. New yearly pricing for the following year will be announced by EverdreamSoft on December 24 at the latest.",False

That is $150,000. Minus Apple fees of $30,000. That leaves $120k, EDS probably removes overhead like taxes. So I am speculating 50k or 161,000 BCY to be burned. Plus the 15k from earlier in the month, that is 176k bcy.  I suppose they can burn their owned BCY. Buying $60k on polo would push the price up 25%.

By purchasing BitCrystals, the initial backers of the BitCrystals Token Sale will contribute to the development of the game. Upon its launch, players will, in turn, give back to the backers (BitCrystals owners), fuelling what we believe will be the first on-chain economy game ever made.  When purchasing game items such as card packs in Spells of Genesis, players will have the option to use their local currency on the Google Play/AppStore or BitCrystals in the secondary market. Hereï¿½s how it works:  A - When a player purchases a card pack via Google Play/AppStore Each time a player purchases a card pack via Google Play/AppStore using their local currency, EverdreamSoft will buy back 50% of its value in BitCrystals from backers (anyone who owns BitCrystals) and burn them in order to issue a new card pack.  B - When a player purchases a card pack using BitCrystals If a player uses BitCrystals to purchase new cards and game items from the secondary market, EverdreamSoft keeps 50% of the BitCrystals and sends the other 50% to Gutenberg (Gutenberg is our project codename for the platform which burns BitCrystals).

The reason why is done monthly is because there are a number of cards sold each week on different swapbots, as you can see from the reports they are set monthly, having someone checking all sales on a daily basis will require one person dedicated to that job + now the game has launched there will be in-app purchases to count towards burning. As far as I know that is handled by All 4 Games (they are the publisher) so they will have to wait for the end of the month to see sale results for a specific month. Again I'm guessing here, I doubt they check sales on a daily basis or they run daily sales reports. I'm not an expert and I don't have apps on Google and Apple stores so not sure if there are daily reports. Also got to consider chargebacks in that case too.  In conclusion I think monthly, as it's been so far, gives the team enough time to check sales and make sure the numbers are right. Daily seems overkill IMO.

A comment on slack cannot be considered a company statement, and the contract was clear. They breached their contractual obligations and undeniably committed fraud.  A public announcement or notice along with the release would have made it okay. The lack of one means fraud. Period.  Also note that issuing tokens to those who ""bought them legitimately"" is NOT the same as ""all gems purchased or earned in game""... So if they do the former they are still committing fraud by violating their contractual obligations.  If anyone wants to bet on if SoG gets removed from the playstore if they don't issue owed gems in the next 48hours, I will bet BTC on it.

Gems are not tokens like BCY. However the team mentioned they'd like to honour people who purchased gems during the soft launch, which applies to only Canada and Switzerland. Which part of that you don't understand? And they have reassured everyone that Gems will be refilled so long as they were purchased for real via the app store, so your threat of 48 hours otherwise...    And BTW everyone else already got credited their 25 Gems that were given during testing seasons so they have already covered that.  The team is one of the most transparent you see in the space, everyone in the community can vouch for them.  By claiming fraud you are only digging a big hole for yourself. You could have come here and ask nicely like every normal person would do, instead you start with attacking the team... Dude chill!  If you are gagging to get your Gems back it only means one thing, you want to play the game as they give you more stamina, that's what they do, you can't sell them or exchange or send them to someone else.

The game will be available worldwide, on AppStore and Google Play in nine different languages: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Turkish and Arabic.  The global launch will be preceded by a one-day game downtime, due to the servers maintenance and preparation. All your in-game achievements will be reset, but unused Gems you’ve purchased previously will be then credited back to your account.    Special Blockchain Card for Everyone  All the players, ancient or new ones, who’ll download and play the new official version from AppStore or Google Play, and who’ll have linked their game account to their wallet by the end of April, will get a special blockchain card, available only on this occasion!  The cards will be distributed in the beginning of May.   New Adventure  The global release is not the end, but a great start of a new and even bigger adventure!  Our developers will keep working to add new exciting features, such as the multiplayer mode, or in-game cards tokenization. And much more…   On June 29, we’re going to release a new game expansion. After Askian and its inhabitants, you’re going to discover a brand new region - “Marva Magica”. But don’t worry, you won’t be alone in this unknown country. “The Twelve” will accompany you throughout the whole SoG adventure. And you’re going to meet them very soon…   Don’t forget to follow us on Twitter to keep yourself updated!",False

Also dont forget Beyond The Void collected 500k BCY. And anyone could in past month slowly collect coins at 0.0001. Price was bottoming many times.  There is also lots of pumping going on on Poloniex. So they buy and push price up and sell. On general price dont change much but volume is big. But that is only good.  Noone have infinity amount of coins. So cant dump them. EDS have lots coins, but so far did manage them carefully. I think also other resources. If not and would just throw euros on best game developers we would have game here long time ago.  They are also smart enough to know that if they sell BCY now they might need to buy them back latter.   Overall nothing changed. all is same as was 2 years ago. If game will be successful BCY will flourish.   Last year and a half we had almost same number of players/speculators selling cards among each other.  impossible to have any real progress in price of BCY. All increase was just a speculation. Now we will hopefully get new players and new demand. Basically BCY might become 3rd coin with substantial real use after Bitcoin and Monero.

But take into account that the speculation side of BCY has already the release baked into the price.  The only thing that could push it higher is fomo when the time comes.  Higher price doesn't mean higher value.  Value only changes based on the utility of the coin, and that utility is being an optional ""middleman"" between worthy assets.  Once cards stops being issued, that value will decrease.  Ironically some people who want BCY price to increase lament about the constant card release believing that this hinders a higher BCY price.  But it is true that when the game become playable and popular among a wider crowd, the trade of cards on Book of Orbs will increase which will increase the value of BCY.  I believe that this is why Book of Orbs was created as original Counterparty wallets only use XCP as the currency to buy and sell other counterparty based coins or assets.  Book of Orbs will be the main reason why game coins such as BCY, Nexium, Pepe, Willcoins etc have some value though minimal.  Personally I think that this goes against the users as it is easier to use one or two coins rather than thousands.  Imagine when we get thousands of games on book of orbs and whatever trade you want to make you need to exchange coins first; what a pain.  it is like the EU going back to national currencies and whenever you travel you need to buy their own currencies.  This is backwards (although I admit that the EMU is so messed up that national currencies are better in this every case)",False

They are not just simply an abstract asset. If they were then your view of speculation and demand for BCY would be accurate. Tokens and coins when tied to a business model like EDS are also integrated into the organizations economy and operating model. At least that is the design. EDS must buy them according to their announcement, and they must accept them for payment for cards. yes you can facilitate this by having one card that rules them all, but that is a technical point that will hopefully still require you to exchange for BCY to make your purchase. This is important because EDS revenue streams are tied to the exchange and purchase of BCY. A good coin will always have a tight correlation between the revenue streams of the organization that created the coin, in this case i feel BCY does. So now you have a float, a certain amount of coins that must float in the economy to make the economy work. Compounded by BCY burning, you should see constant price increases if the game is successful.  What i don't like is cards being priced in BCY, the cards should be priced in dollars with BCY as the currency of exchange for whatever the exchange rate is at the time you buy a card. This would allow for better adoption.",False

I can only point to 2 possible sources of these price suppression.  1. SOG team themselves. WHY? They don't have a locked Bitcrystals fund. Which they should have, if they really want to play fair to their supporters. To remove this highly questionable source of Bitcrystals that are time and time again ""dumped"" into the open market, the SOG team should announce their BCY balance and be open on how those coins are being used or sold. Without that, they can always choose to dump any number of coins into the market. They held an ICO and therefore they should not be SELLING from their balance whenever they want without the knowledge of their ICO investors. This kind of activity is not healthy, they should cease and desist in doing it.  2. The newest ""investor"" Blockchain Invest DAC, buying 500,000 BCY at 100,000 US Dollars. Of which the why, how, when and where of this deal are not declared by SOG team. No one is even sure that it even happened. So what is wrong with having a ""new investor""? Guys, think about this. Are anyone of you be able to buy 500,000 BCY from the open market at 20,000 Satoshis each and NOT DRIVE the price up from 20K Satoshis? Of course not. NO ONE among us can. So why can SOG suddenly sell all of those COINS at once at a FLAT RATE? Is the ICO still OPEN? Are everyone treated fairly? Was everyone given the chance to buy as much as they want on a flat rate of 20K Satoshis? Is anybody's Dollar worth more than anybody else? So why did SOG give under the table priority when someone/some group offered them money? What is stopping them in doing this again??  At 40K satoshis, guess how much of that 500,000 BCY will be dropped into the open market, CAN ANY ONE say? In short, making these kind of deals is a transgression on the trust given to the SOG team by their ICO and original supporters! Bitcrystals are available on the open market. If anyone really believes the project, they should now get their Bitcrystals from the OPEN MARKET and not from the under the table deals. They have to play fair so that they can succeed.  These two possible sources of dumpage on the open market should be eliminated so that SOG team can regain the trust of their investors. They should LOCK their own BCY balance and always be open on how they are using them. NO MORE surprise ""new investors"". Or dumping on the open market whenever they want or need.  Do the SOG team wants more money? Of course, who does not? Then, they should DELIVER the game immediately. It has been almost 2 years since they start developing. Why is it that until now, pages of pages of bugs are still not addressed? That launch and the game's success should be their means of getting more money! They should do those things right.  If the team can honestly show that they will resolve the above issues and finally deliver on their promises this coming April, then there is hope. If not. I think we should all look elsewhere to find a real Blockchain based development, game or otherwise and forget this one.",False

EDS wouldn't dump so many coins in the last 7 days as it undermines their own project. Investors aren't buying 500k in bcy just to then keep the price from rising by dumping.  I don't care if they sell bcy off market for the very reasons you describe, eds would destroy the market if it dumped so many coins just to raise funds. it is a legitmate way to raise cash.  The only thing that is bizarre to me is how the price is relatively unchanged after so much bcy changed hands. There aren't that many bcy out there, I think 10% of all bcy changed hands in the last week. Maybe just a coordinated thrashing of the market to accumulate coins for a coming mega pump,",False

When playing in a casino, you might wonder why you need to exchange your dollars into tokens to play, collect tokens if you are lucky, go back to the casino bank and exchange them back into dollars or whatever national currency.  In theory, the tokens are worthless and you could just as well hand out dollar bills on the table and bet on it.  The token's value are only based on the fact that you can redeem them back into your national currency.  It is an IOU, just as National currencies are IOUs.  IOUs on top of IOUs on top of other IOUs and so on.  In other words those are all a pile of shit on top of other pile of shits and so on.  What makes the final and initial pile of shit more worthy than the middles pile of shits is that they are generally accepted by the public to redeem them for real assets (non-IOU assets).  In other words, the reason why people want shitty currencies is because they can get something they need or want, such as a house or a car and so on.  People don't want currencies per se, but they want it because they know what they could get for it in the future.  This is of course assuming that whoever controls the pile of shit (currency) doesn't screw them over which is the case 100% of the time.  Now going back to BCY, NXC, Databits and 99% of all the altcoins, those are all the middle pile of shits I was mentioning earlier that are totally useless and can be substituted for real assets such as bitcoin or something useful in a game such as a Satoshicard.  It certainly adds some value if an app such as Book of Orbs was to choose every game's indigenous coin for trading purpose, but it is inconvenient for the users and it is absurd.  It would be much more convenient to buy Force of Will assets, Bitgirls, rare Pepe, Diecast or Spells of Genesis with Bitcoin or with XCP for Counterparty assets.  But no, we get a fragmented economy only because of what ends up to be the control of money.  Everyone wants to control the money supply of their own assets just as Nations want to control the money supply of their own economy.  What does the users get our of it? Nothing.  This is just another form of intended or unintended scam that everyone falls into.  Conclusion: SOG assets are priced in fiat (fiat being the unit of account), traded on a Bitcoin platform through the means of XCP “sidechain” allowing true ownership.  Fiat+BTC+XCP=value.  The rest is just air.  BCY's use is 99% for speculation purpose only.  Use BCY to buy SOG assets or for speculation.  BCY price goes down ==> buy more of them or buy assets.  BCY price goes up ==> sell at a profit and don't buy assets. Either way you win.  People who get pissed at BCY's price falling are those who don't care about the game or the game assets.  All they care is that they get a profit out of speculation either in BTC term or in Fiat term.",False

Trading cards for other cards is much needed. It can be done using counterparty wallet and IndieSquare. It's probably on the roadmap for Book of Orbs. But it never hurts to have more, and possibly better, options.  While you are at it, why not build a totally new game into the wallet that uses SoG cards? There can be an infinite number of games that use BCY and/or SoG cards. Build enough games and one of them is bound to be a candy crush killer. Cards can have stats that are completely unique from the original. You don't need to be EDS to profit by using their tokens in game play.

Our third sprint has ended, and a new release is now available on our website. We spend a good part of this sprint setting up a localization system, but also worked on new features such as moving blocks and infinite infinity.  Download Links  Web: https://spellsofgenesis.com/play  Android (apk): https://spellsofgenesis.com/play/last.php  iOS (Test flight): players already on Test flight have received an update. Please contact us at info@everdreamsoft.com if you wish to be added.  Play Store (Canada and Switzerland): (waiting for publisher)  App Store (Canada and Switzerland): (waiting for apple review)  Release Notes  Features:  Localization system Moving objects Infinite infinity  Improvements:  Tutorial improvements New team speed penalty mechanic Android: back button to quit app   Bugfixes & Corrections:  Lair achievement appearing Stamina bar refresh Speed malus icon (removed placeholder boot icon) iOS: in game ads cannot be closed Change ""Play"" to ""Win"" in daily element affinity quests  We also improved the way we test server code before deploying to production. The aim is to reduce downtime and bugs related to development features for the end users.  Both localisation and moving object are features that aren't shown in the app yet and will appear at launch.  Localization system  Localization was a big part of this sprint. We now have a system up and running, ready to translate all the text of the game. You shouldn't notice any difference, but every single piece of text in the game is now assigned to a key and fetched from a database.  Channel 4 is in the process of translating all this text for the world wide release.   Moving objects  We added the ability for blocks to move along a path specified by the game designer.  This feature alone opens up a huge possibility space for level design. For example blocks that pushes ennemies in spikes if you manage to push them in at the right places, triangles moving that you have to hit at the right time to kill the enemies... Jasper is working on the new campaigns that will include moving objects.   click video to watch  Infinite infinity  Challenge mode (previously ""infinity"") is now truely infinite. Past wave 20, the difficulty will gradually increase. Let's see how far you get! In order to keep the current leaderboard season fair, we decided to leave this feature disabled until the season finishes. We will activate it a few days after that.  Team speed  New team speed penalty mechanic: when a card dies, the team speed will now decrease by the speed of this card.  We're excited to see the game approaching release, and hope you'll have fun with this release!

Thanks to SwissGames, three members of the EDS team - Shaban, Nicolas and Markéta - were part of it!   SoG as a “Gaming on the Blockchain” Leader We were presenting Spells of Genesis and Project ORB, and both aroused very strong interest among our interlocutors, as well as among the visitors of the show. Spells of Genesis is clearly perceived as a pioneer and a leader in the field of game blockchainization and was featured in a blockchain themed conference talk, as well as by Blockchain Gaming Meetup speakers. We also attended SF Bitcoin Meetup where we met one of SoG fans and supporters!    Meeting Asian Publishers China is the largest games market in the world and Japan seems to be the one who decides the trends for other countries in the Asian and Pacific regions, therefore reaching to those markets is important for the global success of the game.  Nevertheless, these markets being very competitive and having their specificities, we need a strong and experienced partner to be able to address local players.  During our time in San Francisco, we met several potential publishing partners, acting on Japanese, Chinese, Korean or Taiwanese markets. They all were impressed by what we’ve achieved so far and the game mechanics were warmly appreciated by our spokespeople. Several publishers showed their interest in working with us to help SoG to expand to Asia.  Shortly we will start discussing the terms of a possible collaboration and further details.  New Games to Onboard Project ORB After SoG, Force of Will, Beyond the Void or Augmentors, several other games seem to be enchanted by the concept of the true ownership of digital assets. We met various game developers who were amazed by the idea and willing to further discuss the possibilities of blockchain integration in their games.  It has been a very busy, but also very promising week. We see a lot of opportunities for the future of blockchain game assets and we believe that the synergies issued from those encounters will be beneficial for SoG, but also for the whole blockchain ecosystem.

During this sprint, our developers have been working mainly on the following topics:  Infinite Infinity A new version of Infinity level is ready to be played! Now it really is infinite and it becomes progressively harder. Nevertheless, as we have a rewards season on, we are not going to implement this feature in this build, but we’ll wait for the next one.  Localization In order to prepare the game for its global launch, the application needs to be adapted and translated into several languages. Working on the app localization was a big chunk of work during this sprint.  Tutorial Improvements Some minor tutorial improvements and modifications have been done.  Bug Fixing Several bugs, such as stamina refresh issue, have been fixed.  Card Balance Changes Based on player feedback, and research to other similar games on the market, we have decided to increase the strength of epic and legendary in-game and blockchain cards. These changes are further explained here.  Version 1.0.6. A new game build will be released by the beginning of the next week, stay tuned!

The build resulting from it will bring you several great features!  Multiplayer Mode You’ll be able to start a multiplayer match by clicking on this button. Each player will be matched with a deck of another player of the same multiplayer rank. A separate multiplayer ranking system will be set, we’ll explain you more about it the next time. Once the match is done, a random level will be generated and the waves will be filled with cards from your opponent’s deck.  New Levels Several new levels will be added, some of them using our new feature - moving objects. The infinite Infinity will also be included in the “Sacred Owl” 1.0.7 build.

Thanks for all of your feedback. Based on the players feedback and research to other games, we have come up with a plan to increase the power of epic and legendary cards (both in-game and blockchain).  Currently, the real power of epic and legendary cards will only come to surface once you quad-fuse them. We are currently planning to rebalance these cards so that they will be stronger in general, even in their un-fused state. In order to keep the blockchain cards competitive, we’ll also make them stronger, so the balance between in-game and blockchain cards will be maintained.  We hope this enhancement will increase the excitement of summoning an epic/legendary card!  Thanks, SoG’s team",False

BitBay would be a perfect marketplace for you guys to sell these cards.  They have a working decentralized smart client where each party uses deposits to guarantee the the other does not take advantage.  For example, if you are selling a $20 card, each person might put up a $30 deposit until the transaction is done, then they get the $30 deposit back afterwards.  In other words, it makes more logical and financial sense to complete a contract than to not.  This also means there is no middleman or arbitrator, so no fees involved in the transaction.  You could even create an entire private market just for SOG card selling and invite the community.

We listen to your feedback and try to address concerns in the best way possible, to make everyone happy and for your continued support.  We have had several collaborations with different projects from both blockchain and gaming spaces. One of the collaborations was with Force of Will (FoW), the well known trading card game that followed the SoG  model by releasing blockchain assets on our Project ORB platform.  To support and encourage their efforts we promised you some of the FoW cards will be playable in SOG. Our initial idea was to use the original FoW illustrations, linked to specific FoW game assets, to be enabled in SoG. However we were unable to use their original artwork for obvious reasons.  So we decided to use existing SoG illustrations. We then heard your feedback on the illustrations: they didn’t reach the usual SoG quality standard and that you would have preferred something more similar to the original FoW artwork. In order to resolve this in the best way possible we’re going to mandate our illustrators to produce new designs, in line with the SoG visual style, inspired by the FoW characters.   We thank you for your being so passionate about our products!",False

We have not been spending much time on updates, neither released them regularly, updates are great for you, for us and for the game itself. To reassure you, we were not trying to hide anything from the community. Being the small team we are, means a lot of work and responsibilities as well as a lot to undertake for each team member. Because of this, sometimes it is not easy to handle priorities, and so, somehow, we neglected this part.  Being our partners and supporters, you have the right to see what’s happening behind the scenes, to know if things are progressing as expected or if we’re struggling with an issue. Going forward, our communications will be more open, regular with a focus on progress updates.  Starting from this week, our developers will be working in 2-3 weeks cycles called “sprints”. They define the tasks priority for each period while evaluating the achievement of set goals. At the end of each sprint, or at the beginning of a new one, we will publish a progress report to inform you about what we were working on during the sprint, if tasks were completed or not, and which tasks we are going to focus on next. Sprint 1, week 1  This week, we are working on the following tasks:  In-game tutorial  Sebastien has almost finished the first part of the in-game tutorial. The first chapters of the tutorial will be included in the next build issued at the end of this sprint. He is explaining more about it in this video. ( http://spellsofgenesis.tumblr.com/post/156123188065/progress-on-the-tutorial )  New Community Forum  Up to now, SoG has been sharing the Moonga forum and wasn’t very active. While evaluating our current communication channels we decided to reorganize them. One of the main changes is that we want to move most of the interaction between community and us, as well as between community members to the forum. To be able to do so, we need to reorganize it and and improve it. There is substantial amount of work around this and it should take us a few more days to complete. We started this week and will try to re-open the new forum as soon as feasibly possible. In the meantime, the old forum may be inaccessible or may not function properly. We are aware of these issues and ask you to bear with us for the inconvenience. API Tester Once Thierry has finished the API Tester development, it will be a very helpful debugging resource to our developers when making major changes to the game. Thanks to this new tool, we’ll be able to make simulations of each change and test game/server connections before deploying them. Minor debugging  Fixing minor game bugs  Sprint 1, week 2 - what are we planning to do  Next week, several team members will be travelling to represent the company and present its current projects in differents parts of the world. Satoshi Roundtable  Shaban is going to Central America to attend the prestigious Satoshi Roundtable. Satoshi Roundtable is a strictly private, invitation-only event, hosting up to 100 of the leading personalities, CEOs, developers, thinkers and investors in the blockchain space. Game Connection, GDC America, Ludicious Game Festival  Nicolas will spent two days in Zurich, Switzerland. The 1st day, he’ll be attending a preparatory event for Game Connection and GDC America, in presence of Jason Della Rocca, who’ll be coaching the studios. Next Friday, the 3rd edition of Ludicious Game Festival will be held there. TechnoArk Conference  Also next Friday, Markéta is going to present the gaming case study at the TechnoArk blockchain technology conference, held in Sierre, Switzerland. Development  Our developers will keep working on the tasks they’ve been assigned for this sprint, in order to be able to deliver a new build at the end of it.  Our next progress report will be released at the end of this month, we want to thank you all for the continuous support and the feedback provided so far, keep it coming!

It shows you get this owning your gaming assets paradigm, it will change gaming forever.  I will make a few qualifying statements though where my views differ somewhat from yours:  1. This is a small team on a small budget. Most of what you are talking about is out of their reach. That said, there are things they should do differently. 2. Your point on blockchainification of your card assets is the home run insight that you have. I completely agree, another way to describe this is a instant trading feature with the first version of the game. Show off your cards, and trade. This game becomes instantly relevant with that single feature. 3. Owning assets is the most important part of this game, not the game play or anything else. The graphics have to be killer, and you must be able to trade or otherwise exchange your cards with others. Worry about the game play later because gameplay is hard to get right and will evolve 100 times before it is perfect.  EDS has limited resources. Focus on asset ownership. Make it work in a relevant way in the game and with friends. Make those assets easily usable by any technology. Go around and preach to everyone about asset ownership and create an economy around SOG card ownership. What can I do if I own a specific card or set of cards that have nothing to do with the game itself? Start creating card-ownership incentives now outside of the game. There is zero reason that card assets have to hang on the success or failure of SOG.",False

Add a blockchain wallet (in this case bitcoin/counterparty wallet) to the game is dangerous because there is the possibility that sometimes google or apple could ban SoG from the store. Anyway as you point out the SoG team is not so big so they have to prioritize were to code, the ability to play (a lot) SoG  (or buy some gems for fiat money)and have as a reward some blockchain asset is a super strong incentive.   I strongly disagree that owning asset is the most important part of the game, the beauty of the game itself and the game mechanic is the rock solid base to build a trading-card game economy. SoG have to be played and have to be fun without any blockchian card at the start to attract more and more user, the ability to gain something that have a real value and that can be traded is its Turbo.

Preface    I played a lot with the SoG Official Swiss Android Version 1.0.1 , and the unofficial (not in Google Play) new 1.0.3 version. Actually I'm doing a complete re-test from scratch.   State of the Art  From ver. 1.0.1 to 1.0.3 there were some good improvements, better graphics, better sounds and some bugfix. So the EDS team is working fine to release a commercial high quality game.   Actually we are in soft launch, so the players achievements are to be reset before the real world wide launch. It mean that SoG is in an advanced beta testing stage, and it is necessary to test the iteraction between the fiat money store and the first real blockchain oriented game in the world.     What are the main area for develop the game (in my player opinion):   1- more levels, actually we have 14 levels with several waves each about 10-30 hours of gaming depending the power of your deck. It too less for a worldwide official launch (and of course more quests, daily quests, achievements)  2- a more interesting challenge mode actually the ""challenge mode"" is quite boring, with a not so powerful deck is very easy to complete.  There is a lot of room here to add more waves (what about an infinite mode?) and mix different waves from regular levels. Also is possible to create more than one challenge/infinite campaign. There are some example around mobile game (Hill Climb 2 it have this pattern)  3- Multiplayer SoG is designed for mutiplayer challenges, at least the Player Versus Player mode have to be implemented soon. This is one of the two killer feature of the game.  4- Card Blockchainizzation This is the second killer feature, the most important. The ability to maxed out a card just playing the game (so watching ads and buying gems for fiat or blockchain card for bcy) and then get rewarded with a True Blockchain Ownership of a card. It is simply revolutionary.  5- A more rational card deck manager the actual deck manager work quite fine with few cards in the deck (blockchain and non blockchain) when a player do have a lot of same tipe cards the actual deck is a little bit messy to manage.  6- A card exchange for non blockchaind cards actually only blockchain cards are tradable with Book of Orb or other counterparty wallet/software it would be nice if players could trade non blockchain card for gold, crystals, gems (or for nothing, that could mean fiat money over the counter).  Those are the main area in my opinion , Time will tell what will be the SoG direction, but I'm sure what is the bitcrystal direction. The moon.",False

This is one of the two killer feature of the game. Multiplayer will be available in asynchronous mode, meaning you will be able to challenge other players deck but without them to be connected.

Actually it won't be possible with the current model for several reasons. 1. Giving ability to trade cards will bring fake account creation. People will grind early reward to get cards on an account and centralise the card to another big account and mass blockchainize cards. Also for the free to play balance we are going to give a small amount of good cards once the player progress. With the ability to trade people will take advantage of it to move to their master account. 2. Card have a real value specially when they are blockchainized if the trade exist and is centralized we will be held custodian of people belonging and an exploit to the database will be damaging. 3. Ingame cards are subject to fake purchase and chargebacks. Meaning someone will purchase a lot of cards and move them around then ask for a chargeback.

You see from previous picture that last one  was on 5th January.   How many expecting to get burned in 2017  is really hard to speculate, it all depends of how successful game will be. And also when will be finished and started mass played. Definitely burning less then in 2016 would be quite a despoilment.

The ARPU (Average Revenue per active User) is calculated : total revenue on a period divided by the number of active users. Of course it's an average meaning some people during the period did nothing and some other are highly addicted. The average is important because when you do some customer acquisition (advertising) there will be always people who who leaves after 10 minutes and some people who will stay for months. When the acquisition cost is lower than the average revenue then the product does positive performance and more can be invested in acquiring users.  Another important metric is LTV (life time value) total expense of a user during his lifetime with the product.,False

The preface of this post is that Spell of Genesis (SoG from now) is one in the very restricted number of projects that actually are doing real revenues in the crypto-economy. The  game-linked true-ownership blockchained card idea is disruptive for the game industry, and SoG have the right positioning to take full advantage of this new sector. For this reason  right now there are all the ingredients to see bitcrystals in the top ten crypto for market cap very soon.   So why bitcrystals is so weak comparing to so much vaporware token and cryptocurrencies?   Bitcrystals is not a new token, it have more then 18 month, and the project under bitcrystals is well developed and it recently reached the maturiry for a soft launch in the Google and Apple stores in two country (Canada and Switzerland)   In my opinion it is time to do some fact checking on the reasons why we are in this weird and frustrating situation analyzing every aspect of the project. So this is my personal contribute to the discussion:   Game and ecosystem, coding, development, bug fixing[   This is the strongest area of the project, SoG is good and addictive game and the Sog Team (the Team from now) are doing an excellent job balancing spells, game mechanic, graphic, sound effects (i like to play SoG with headphones). The bug fixing and player feedback process is not perfect and have to be refined, probably slack is not the best software to address this issue but it can be used. The team is actualy build some procedures to correctly report bugs and feature request on slack. Also the team do provide to users some documents that are in their internal bug fixing procedures:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m0NmAnBl8KpFOUWseIPyZ4kg0dSFaH6veyrZwYXfuUY/edit#gid=979109819    As for ecosystem we actually have, Sogasset, Book of Orbs (BoO from now) Bitcrystalbox, and normal counterparty tools. BoO in particular is a very wise and effective Idea, as for SoG, BoO have to be strongly developed in particular allowing cross game-currencies secondary market trades but right now is a very powerful tool to improve the True Ownership card game experience.   The game is not finished for a real launch, the most important things to be done are:  1) There are few levels, quests and achievements  2) There isn't any kind of mulyplayer mode right now (it is only mentioned in an achievement)  3) And most important for the bitcrystals token ecosystem, there isn't the card blockchainzation system for non-blockchained maxed out cards.   The point 3 in my opinion is by far the most urgent and disruptive. The ability to obtain a valuable and tradable true ownership asset through the game is the real ""new thing in town"" in the game industry. The real main driver of the game.   Doing a real launch without this feature is a suicide. Because this single feature worth the effort to download the game, try it and be addicted. And also, the blockchainizzation feature is a powerfull marketing weapon.   Marketing, communication and Social Influence   And here is the real problem.    To my external eyes the Team have not a real internal marketing professional, so they hire Vambex Group and All4games to do this job, let's have a look.   Vanbex group  ( http://www.vanbex.com/ ) the face and the nicknames of Vanbex here is Coin@Coin (bitcointalk) or @nic (slack) , this professional is doing what it is called community management. Informing on new cards, web articles (sometimes provided bu the Vanbex team)  and doing some kind of moderation and community help. I have nothing to say about the two first jobs, is fine , but he is total disaster as moderator, you can see it observing how many users (mee too) are personally pissed about is bad attitude with forumers. Bitcointalk is almost a dead channel now (what a big mistake, bitcointalk is the first informative channel were a crypto investor look at) and the general Slack section is not doing well. I think he is in charge for this situation.   All4games ( http://www.all4games.co.uk/ ) my question is : what are they doing? I suppose they are doing translations, quality control, and that they are preparing a big style launch on the mobile market. The problem is : WE DO NOT HAVE ANY VISIBILITY on what is the All4game work. And that's unfair because investors did agree to have a cut for the all4game work. So probably some feedback is needed. I'm not asking for industrial secrets but it would be nice if someone from the all4games team do explain to the comunity some ldetails about the state of art of their work right now.   Now let's talk about official communication.   Actually Sog directly or not directly (Vanbex) do regular statements on  1-new cards  2-burning report  And recently:  3-game devs report http://www.moonga.com/board2/index.php/topic/15582-week-1-objectives-summary/   Some pr material is sporadically done by Yodark itself ( video and roadmaps)  like this, the last Yodark video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMseE14Evbo&feature=youtu.be  They use: 1- Twitter https://twitter.com/SpellsofGenesis 2- facebook https://www.facebook.com/spellsofgenesis/?fref=ts 3- Slack https://spellsofgenesis.slack.com 4- Tumblr http://spellsofgenesis.tumblr.com/ 5- bitcointalk https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=957797.0 5- Moonga forum http://www.moonga.com/board2/ 6- Official website : https://spellsofgenesis.com/    I want to start with Moonga Forum, I perfectly understand that this communication channel is in the Team comfort zone but really, except a very small community no one know about it, the moonga forum at my non-moonga-player eyes is invisible. It haven't any network effect and... come on is called ""moonga"" not ""spells of genesis"". So please I beg you to stop using it as a comunication channel. Investors have NOT to do a treasure hunt to find news. And we are talking about important news like the last objective summary.   Now Tumblr: the question is, Is SoG Tumblr an official blog? Because I do not see any link from the official website https://spellsofgenesis.com/ to http://spellsofgenesis.tumblr.com/. Anyway let's suppose it is (what a mess), the official blog IS the center of investor and communiuty official communication. So all the interesting news have to be posted there.  Not only new cards or the burning report.  I didn't see the last Yodark video on Tumblr and actually that video have less than 150 views, that's a Joke and Yodrak simply waste his time doing it, 150 is less than the Slack community so no one see it except us.  I didn't see any official communication about the fundamental objective summary, that I hope will be a timely regular public relation edition (let's say bi-montly?)  I didn't see anything official about the release of the new game versione 1.0.3 on Tumblr and bitcointalk. And that is very serius mistake. New game version IS the ""news"" any new release is the most important news for investors. Because it certificate the company hard work.  But again no one know outside slack. To me it sound crazy.    Then facebook facebook is a powerful marketing channel for cryptocurrencies and games, bitcoin and other crypto are a strong topic on facebook now, so i didn't understand why facebook is not used like twitter is.

I understand that most people here ""hate"" facebook (me too), but fb IT work for games, and recently it works for crypto (the facebook decred case)  For Slack and Bitcointalk I have already said. The Vanbex moderator is the main problem, ha have not the skills to engage forumers. Probably some devs post  on bitcointalk is needed. Actually bitcointalk remain the first place were crypto investor look at for every project. Slack is a more restricted area.  Twitter is the only media that in my opinion is properly used.  My final impression is: a real good project (one of the best in the crypto sector) that lack of proper communication.  That's all, hope it help.  Paolo Rebuffo (funnyking)",False

You really love the project and you want it to be successful. But you are worried on some point that you think is important are not taken care enough. 1. Game wise it's about card blockchainization and some more content. 2. Communication wise social media and communication channels are not used enough. 3. The moderation is not good because it's pissing of users.  Do I understand right ?  Before of I have on my side personal request to the community. To everyone here team and community.  Please don't do personal and public attacks on people and on the individuals of SOG team their partners or other members. It's nothing wrong pointing out weaknesses or doing recommendation. Public personal attack first hurt people and is counterproductive. It's the same thing in a company if the boss or anyone make big loud reprimands on an individual the person will not perform better. We are talking about individuals that are fully engaged and working hard to make innovative things, since blockchain is startup environment people have to du much more than working in a big company doing only one single task. I can guaranty that the pressure on my team shoulder is high, working on things that are un marked path coming with a lot of obstacles in an unstable blockchain environment. Breaking new boundaries every day. Trust me its a hard path. My role is to keep them motivated. Seeing them rewarded with the sadness of being hurt when opening communication channel makes my work lot harder.  My ideal vision of true ownership and shared ownership of SOG is we are all in the same team. We are here to help and to grow together and not attack each other. I want a community where everyone brings his stone to the monument we are building together. There are a lot of people contributing and I love that it make me feel we are on the right direction. But when the word are targeted toward my team or community it make me feel hurt. Also it's not productive and doens't help SOG.  So for everyone when you post messages and discuss please think are you trying to build grow, or destroy are you hurting anyone ?. If you are in the destroying mood please come back and think how you can help.  If you feel hurt because you feel someone is attacking you then please don't escalate don't insult or judge. Report misbehaviours. That's my first moderation rule. Starting from now we are going to be more strict. Any insult or attack on an individual will be sanctioned.  So let's address point 3 about moderation.   Gameplay wise Blockchainization is an important topic if we implement it right now it might create an imbalance since the game will be reset after the soft people who didn't maxed out the card might be an issue. Specially if he invested money the upgrade the cards. But open to discussion that brings me to the forum. We are working on reorganising the forum, we heard the comments and we are working on it we are moving to forum.everdreamsoft.com it's not imediate because there are work on moving the forum. Devs are working on bugs and lot of stuff so please allow a week and a half to be deployed.   Social media Thank you for listing it up. As you know EDS is a small team and each social media is time consuming. We decided to focus on twitter because it has shown to be very effective better performing than facebook. With limited resources we try to focus the time on the things that brings the most results (even with big teams its the same).     You may have noticed that the news feed from the website is coming from Tumblr. Does it worth to bounce back people to Tumblr from the website if the news are the same ? Debatable but it's a possibility.  Okay to summaries all we are working on news and community followups we heard the concern about community and communication. We are working on it. We are reviewing and reorganizing the communication channel. When the forum is right we will discuss and poll about the communication channels and see where it's more interesting to invest time.  And if someone think he can help, we will be more than happy to discuss",False

Not in huge quantities, but in all shapes. People many times ask why so little quantity. like 2000 cards is max. Because there will be so many cards. If you would have only 20 cards then ofcourse some would need to be issued in supply of 100000, but with lots cards, supply are smaller.  this give bigger variety in game, but also makes development experience, since 1000 new cards needs to be drawn and strength calculated.   Price of freshly issued card offered first to Partner merchant is always same in $. No matter what is current price  of BTC or BCY. I think cheapest cards that come in 2000 supply cost $5 those medium strength $15-20. Depending how much BCY cost is then determinate their price in BCY.   This is only way to prevent cards would become to expensive for players to afford, or to cheap that game could not run anymore.   Price of BCY change a lot since is leveraged with BTC.

We are hard at work together with our producer, All 4 Games, to a launch for both iOS and Android on Tuesday, December the 13th.  We have had to implement some additional technical requirements to the latest version of SoG approved by the producer. These were minor changes nevertheless necessary to be able to publish the game on the app stores.  We like to add “tentative” to the date because you never know... it will be in the hands of Apple and Google to make it go live. From submission to approval it usually takes a week, however sometimes it does take longer, based on the number of apps they need to approve and if they find issues with our app.  We also had to revisit the number of countries where we will be initially soft launching. Following guidance from All 4 Games, we can confirm they will be Canada and Switzerland. Worry not, we will also release a version for Android and WebGL which will be exactly the same as the one on the app stores but without the in-app purchases screen. So everyone should be able to enjoy the latest game-play.  What’s new?  The Soft Launch release will feature In-App Purchases (IAP) with a dedicated screen which replaces the current “summon” section, a new, colorful and improved map, as well as a more polished UI. Most of the changes we have had to implement are to do with the back-end, analytics, and app stores integration.  We are very excited and look forward to the Soft Launch as much as all of our fans, if not more! We have done our best to produce a solid release in the hope the community will continue to offer their support beyond this hugely important milestone for us, all the way to the eventual full launch.    We are thrilled to have you with us,    The EverdreamSoft Team",False

That make cards 4 times more expensive.  Also first cards was put on sale wrong way. This was changed about 10 months ago, with partner, premium and public merchant.  Right now was issued new card. in 1200 lot so is in range of second most cheap ones and for Partners is 40 BCY or right now $6.4.  When it will hit public merchant will be 20% more.  This is price at which EDS issue 1200 lot cards. In one month when these cards will hit public merchant BTC can double its price. That will double its price, since EDS made a commitment that will never offer cards cheaper as is for the first time ( so now to partner merchant). Price of HUNTERCARD will be 48 BCY on public merchant even if that will be $50 at that time.  But new card in this range they will issue again at $6 of BCY.  That means that rare will buy this expensive HUNTERCARD. Those that need it for game for sure not. Only collectors will.  Some cards that are in same range as this 48 BCY card was sold at 1000 BCY a year and more ago. You cant expect those that paid 1000 BCY for them will now resell it at 50 BCY.  Yes they will have troubles to get for them as much as paid, but they will for sure nto have competition by unsold EDS cards, since EDS made commitment to not sell cheaper.  Those unsold EDS cards, will most likely stay unsold forever and only like 100 cards will be in circulation what will not onyl make them expensive but also rare.",False

Full launch will be sometime after that but there is no specified date for it yet. It will be decided between EDS and All4Games (the producer) when they believe the game is ready and player engagement is at the right level.  I think there will be more reset/s as specified on the opening screen when you launch the game. Once that screen disappears we should be good to go with no more resets, I guess the last one will coincide with the full launch but unsure if there are more before then.  About blockchainization, it is on the roadmap but the team should confirm that, I guess before the full launch.",False

Most of the cards have gone up in price since their release, however you have to consider several factors when you buy cards: The price fluctuation of BitCrystals from when you bought the card (in BCY) and the time you are going to sell it. Cards that are rare usually go up in value more. Some cards are better for playing the game then others and are also more sought after by players.  So with that in mind you can make your own judgement. Also consider that you can get free cards in game, they are not as rare as blockchain cards but if you just want to play the game then you don't have to spend money.",False

There are a couple more big releases before then. I believe as time goes by the game will be fine tuned especially for newbies that mainly use ingame cards. The achievements are also work in progress, they were first released for the latest Rewards Season a few weeks back.  I use mostly blockchain cards so I can get to finish the game no problem. However there are some free cards you get in game that are as powerful as the blockchain ones. It's mainly a question to be lucky and summon them.  The timer/stamina is pretty standard for games like SoG and other games also use it. There's been discussion about this on Slack and the team has taken notice. I don't think the timer will disappear but it will be tuned. The reason for the timer is that if you could play forever without limit you will get bored of the game pretty quickly. This way you can spend some time playing the game then do something else and get back when the stamina is loaded up. I personally don't have a problem with the stamina.  For the earth card ""daily quest"" you need to finish one game in one of the 5 levels on the map or finish the whole infinity mode (35 levels). Each level you complete should count as one and of course make sure you have a earth card in your deck.  I'm looking forward to the mobile soft launch to check out what new features and improvements will be added. ",False

The team at EDS have created a compelling card battler mechanic that I’m looking forward to seeing released.”  The U.K. company will provide extensive expertise and guidance to improve various aspects of the game including graphics, animations, menus and other important aspects that ensure we are meeting the high standards they seek in all of their titles. In addition, the partnership will help in translations, important for the many markets EDS intends to release SoG in. All 4 Games will also provide industry leading analytics tools and technical services which will help improve SoG and make it fit for a mainstream audience. They will also be in charge of the product’s quality testing and publication of the game on various platforms.   Spells of Genesis has made significant progress since its successful crowdfunding campaign in September 2015, releasing progressively improved iterations — termed Seasons — of the blockchain-based mobile trading card game. “Since the beginning, Spells of Genesis has been surrounded and heavily supported by a very engaged community, whose help and commitment are highly valued by the team, ” said Markéta Korteova, marketing and communications manager at EDS. Markéta further stated, “Without the community’s close cooperation we wouldn’t have been able to achieve what we did.”  After the web soft launch as previously announced, EDS is going to soft launch the mobile version of the game.  The company has decided together with All 4 Games to soft launch in the following countries: Canada, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. The mobile soft launch date is tentatively slated for next month (November) with further announcements in relation to this to be made in the coming weeks.  “A massive thank you goes to each one of you who have been supporting us and shared some of the most important Spells of Genesis milestones,” said Shaame, who added, “We still have a lot to do and improve and are working hard for the game to evolve further. We are thrilled to have you with us, and happy that now the SoG team is even bigger and stronger. This is a great time for Spells of Genesis and its future and we hope you will all cherish this moment with us.”  About All 4 Games All 4 Games is Channel 4’s Glasgow-based games publishing arm, formed in September 2015 to provide premium support to talented indie developers within the mobile games sector.

On the other hand if someone registers someone else's public address first the original owner will receive any points or benefits they gain by playing with that address and also the real owner can always move their cards to a different address.

They do answer on SoG slack in Sog-beta-testing chanel. You need to understand that SoG is not about shiling. they have product and spend time to develop it, not to monitor 100 communication channels and answer questions.  User Hnin here is Marketa who manages marketing. so if you have suggestions you should contact her. But as i said slack is most perfect communication channel for SoG.  About Poloniex I cant give you any answer. There BCY are freely offered to sell and buy. If game will be successful price of BCY will raise if not price of BCY will go down.

The forum is a Moonga forum which has been used so far for some minor partner and premium member discussion. A new forum dedicated to SoG should be good, however having more than one forum? Not sure if that would create more confusion than anything else.  You got some valid points there but I think the strategy and the tools should come from the team. It's wonderful to see so much passion, don't get me wrong, however I personally wouldn't want to put pressure on the team with these things at this stage. I rather them concentrating on the game delivery first.   Community members, players and supporters are free to promote the game as they please of course.

What about enhancing the ways you can display and show off your card collection digitally instead?  Perhaps displayed as a hierarchy of rarity and once you have that card in your collection it lights up.

Every card sold makes the current BCY held more valuable.  Calculating the deflation to see how beneficiary this may be to the price going forward from launch has got me all excited! And from quickly looking at the numbers only about 1/3 of all BCY are currently in float to be traded.   Last month over 17k USD in card sales sent to the burn address but what does this really mean?  That means that people purchased 34k worth of bitcoin (@$600 USD each) putting 56.67 bitcoin buy pressure on the BCY crystals while only returning half of that to the market to be reabsorbed. That's right. Last month about 28 bitcoins or roughly a bitcoin a day was burned through the sale of card assets. No other coin I know of offers a burn that makes more sense to the investors and company itself.   I can only see card value / demand increasing once the game is live and people are using them to play in a multitude of games using the assets they bought through a secure digital wallet. Love how they drive daily engagement in SoG game launch with leader boards, daily quests, pvp, ect ect!!!  Every day a card is sold and BCY crystals burn increasing the value of the rest of the BCY in circulation.   Thoughts?",False

Let's use a recent day Sept 5. 14 bitcoin traded hands. 1 BTC of that was bought and burned on that day according to the August burn report average. That is 7.14% of all the bought coins on that day being burned. This is a huge number. I imagine as we gain awareness this number will become increasingly smaller.

As a early investor in SOG I'll explain you why some older cards seem to have a high price.  For example if you buy today one card with 2000 BCY would you like to sell it after a few months with 1000 BCY because BCY is increasing in price? I think as a investor in SOG is normal to make all the calculation in BCY.  If we are talking about legendary cards, SATOSHICARD and GENESISCARD were offered only to early investors. Most of other legendary cards were sold in Partner or Premium swapbot with 1500-2000BCY. SHAPESHIFTCD was sold only on shapeshift.io at 0.3 BTC - about 2500BCY that time. FDCARD only in folding coin project etc. So don't think that early investor are very greedy and the prices are too high. Please check the initial offer in BCY for every old card and you'll see that you can still find cards on the market at the same price or some time even lower than initial. Even in sogbazar I found one card cheaper than 6 months ago when I bought it official....  P.S. Do you have any idea how official swapbots were working one year ago?

If they intend to sell more cards after the game is launched is their decision and they can do it at the price they want. At the end of the day this is a game and EDS is a for profit company not an Open Source project so they are supposed to make money.  Also by having extra stock they could even sell card packs to people interested to get their collection kickstarted quickly, this is me speculating. Cards can be used for promotions, giveaways, bounties, etc as it happened in the past.  This is the second trading card game for EverdreamSoft so they must know a thing or two on how to sell cards and how many to sell and when to maximise adoption and profits.  Also you can get free cards just by playing the game so no one is forced to buy cards if they don't want to. However I'm a collector and I like to buy them.  As others mentioned here cards are sold on EDS own Merchants (Swapbots), there are 3 of them:  Partner Merchant (for partners who participated in the token sale) Premium Merchant (for players who participated in the token sale) Public Merchant (for everyone else)  The above are the official places to buy cards right now from EDS.  Anywhere else, including swapbots, DEX, and other online stores are part of the secondary market.  Transactions going from the issuer address may go to EDS swapbot addresses and/or Partners and Premium Members' addresses who purchase them from EDS' swapbots. Also EDS has been doing many collaborations with different projects and companies and in some cases some cards are allocated to these third parties.  You can't just come here after hundreds of people have been playing the game and purchasing cards for over a year and throw accusations left and right like you did.  Before you can even speak you need to do your own research, learn about how things work, then make your own judgement. Or at least ask nicely: hey why is this happening? Why is it done this way?  Everyone can follow the blockchain, and thanks for that because that's the whole purpose of making blockchain-based game assets, as well as owners of these assets can do as they please with them.  If you are really interested to learn more and follow SoG closely I recommend you join the community Slack: https://spellsofgenesis.signup.team/.  There are a lot of resources to get you started too:  http://bitcrystals.com (BitCrystals Website with a list of all cards) http://spellsofgenesis.com (Official Website - new updated version is in the works, looks great!) http://spellsofgenesis.tumblr.com (Blog with the whole history of the game, cards, news, updates, and merchant rules) https://twitter.com/spellsofgenesis (For news and updates)  Also https://sogassets.com is a great third-party resource for card stats of all kinds and their availability on the DEX and Swapbots.  The team can also expand on this further, I'm only sharing my opinion and what I know seen I have been following the project since its inception and love it.  Hope this answers your question.",False

You must understand how counterparty works to get the cards. Anyone can make a asset. It's who and what the asset is tied to that makes it valuable. You can go buy many assets on counterparty not all of which are SoG cards. The SoG cards are made in connection with the developers of the game and sometimes with partner companies. That's what gives them value. They can hold a premine of whatever token they want. To make a token you go and pay a fee on the counterparty exchange. Anyone can do it. BCY uses XCP.

I mentioned to look at the blog earlier and there is a post that describes how it all works with percentages.  http://spellsofgenesis.tumblr.com/post/141656034650/spells-of-genesis-stores-become-merchants  Read it up it should clear a few things up. No team member holds any percentage of cards unless they buy it like everyone else, stock that is saved for future sales is entirely held by EverdreamSoft.  Before you keep going on making assumptions you have to understand that the game has not launched yet, and EDS is doing what every other company would do: hold on to cards to be sold after the game launch and thereafter. There is no premine, new cards are issued once a week right now and the way distribution works has been more or less the same since the token sale when Partners and Premium members joined the scene. Everyone involved since a while knows exactly how it works and by the way sales are going people seems to be happy. If and when there is a need to make a change EDS writes up an update or a survey and asks the community and partners before implementing it as it has happened in the past.  When you say private addresses (and I explained you this before) it means EDS is selling cards to Partners, Premium members and the Public. Some Partners buy up to 50 cards at the time or more and guess what? These are all private addresses On the other end EDS may have some internal addresses to allow various team members to operate the different swapbots but that shouldn't be any of yours or anyone elses business. They should be able to use and distribute cards as best as they can to streamline operations and maximize profits.  Also don't forget that stock will be needed once the game launches because at that point, if all goes well, there will be thousands of new players onboard and some of these will want to collect all the cards too. So in my opinion EDS is operating in the best way possible to cater for the influx of new users in the future. Most cards are issued in numbers between 800 and 1200, now imagine if there are 10,000 players just after launch, will there be demand for old cards? What if there are 50,000 or more? Shouldn't EDS have some reserve stock for that in your opinion?  Cards are only the beginning of what you can buy with BCY, there will be other game assets available, merchandise, they will be used to reward people for tournaments and gosh knows what else... You can even rent shared office space at EDS' headquarters in Geneva right now with BCY. So saying that they all go into cards is wrong. EDS has always been clear that they would allow any other game producer who wants to to use their system, including token, cards, etc... They are even building a platform together with IndieSquare to make it a breeze for anyone interested to spin up game assets using Counterparty. Force of Will is scheduled to be the first physical trading card game to start using the platform to digitize assets for their new App.  You need to be patient and give time to time you can't have all your answers right now as the game is still in development. I understand you came late to the party as many others who only start following projects when the coin increases in price and there is a bit of buzz. If that is the case well... Sorry to hear but that is your problem don't make it everyone elses.  Once again, read up the blogpost above and the rest which contains everything you need to know about SoG, cards, etc and it's publicly available.",False

Don't want to bother you all with trade talk but looking at everything going on its getting exciting. Watching the order book shrink every day and the support is building up. I been aware of this coin since 8k satoshi but just bought in for an investment recently in the 50k range.

Surrounded and supported by a strong and very committed community, whose help with the development is highly valued by the team, the game is currently in closed beta.   SOG APPROACHING SOFT-LAUNCH  Recently the game benefited from a revamped card design and user interface. The implementation of several new features is now being finished and will be deeply tested afterwards. After a period of intensified internal testing, aiming to discover and to immediately fix all possible bugs and exploits, Spells of Genesis will be soft launched in mid September!   The game will be endowed with multiple new, highly expected features. Every day, players will be challenged by a daily quest and their progress will be monitored by in-game achievements. The possibility of creating and joining guilds will also be added, and players will discover several additional campaigns. We are also working on state-of-the-art sound and visual effects.  SoG will first be soft-launched in its web version, but it will be shortly followed by its mobile version, which you may expect before the end of September. The mobile release will be enriched by in-app purchases, so players will be able to buy offchain cards in-game, with a certainty of getting rare, or even better card.   FULL GAME RELEASE  After the game soft-launch, we will meticulously monitor and measure multiple factors and achievements of the objectives we’ve set up previously. If the results match our goals, we will work hard on making the full game release possible about a month later.  Nevertheless, it won’t finish there! We already planned other great features to be added to make your game experience even better.  Stay tuned for news and announcements to follow.   The EverdreamSoft Team",False

I had an interesting proposal that I'd love to flesh more out in terms of thought and possibilities. I am one of the team members from the Jewels project. It is our goal at the start of next year to start developing our own illustrious MMORPG which is the purpose of the Jewels crowdfund, however we have immediate use cases in our existing games - Apex Conquer (see Jewels thread).  I've had some time today to fully look over this project and it's progress and over all I quite like what I see. What is most alluring to me about this project is its beautiful art work that shows a lot of time and effort goes into crafting each card. Minor suggestion and off topic but I would love to see a lore wiki put together for Spells of Genesis if there isn't... but I digress. My idea is simple - I think it would be very cool to integrate some of the outfits from some of the characters of SoG into our upcoming game as well as our existing game. In our existing game (Apex) there are already cosmetics for customization that are fantasy oriented after all the majority of the game is fantasy oriented. There's actually already existing garments that resemble some cards such as the dark robe seen here albeit it is a bit generic .  The way I see it working is as follows - In our new Jewels web wallet we are working on developing we will offer a store for specialized cosmetics that are modeled after cards seen in the Spells of Genesis game. These cosmetics modeled after SoG cards will only be obtained by depositing the same blockchain asset associated with the card and then the player will be able to corresponding item on our game while logged in. I believe this is a positive use case for SoG cards and mutually promotes both our franchises. Here you can see some examples of cosmetics that already exist in Apex. Additionally, scrolling through our facebook you can see a few garments which are not shown in the previous link here.  Anyways, Just and idea at the moment but I would love to hear the SoG's team members as well as community's thoughts on this!  Edit: In case the BitCrystals team themselves reads this and is interested in further discussing this idea, please shoot me a PM or an email at jewels@apexconquer.com",False

It's similar to what has already been implemented in the mobile game Sarutobi where you can use several of the SoG cards to give special power ups to your character in the Sarutobi game. It would increase the usefulness of SoG cards even further, expanding the game ecosystem into new realms and getting players more excited about holding  these valuable assets in their possession, knowing they will be able to reuse them in several games or even sell them to the players of the other game that are seeking to have these special cosmetics. Cross game synergy is the trend of the future. I for one am all for having more games use SoG assets!  ",False

I'm not 100% sure about this because details are scarce for the moment but if FoW is using the same platform which SoG uses for their assets it makes sense to have some cross game assets too.  Also consider FoW is well known and has over 100K users from what I read, so in my opinion this is not merely FoW joining Counterparty, but them using specific tools to manage their game assets which are going to be digital for the first time. It is currently a physical TGC game with no game app, and they will be releasing an app in September.  FoW is a different project, and have their own players but if they decided to use tools built by a ""competitor"" to go digital I think it is a good sign. If any of these players look up EverdreamSoft or IndieSquare they'll definitely come across SoG. Not saying all of them will want to get into SoG but maybe a few will. They are different games with different ways to play.  Will another popular game join the bandwagon after this collaboration proves successful? I really hope so. Will it attract more people to SoG? I think so. Will it bring the BCY price up? It did already, I can imagine when this goes out in the wild.",False

For me, I feel like we are way early in this platform. Short term, the price may drop. Long term speaking, I can see many more games from EDS that will use BCY as their in game currency. They already have a track record with Moonga. It's not their first rodeo. Moreover, I like the fact that they take their time to make the game right and not just release it without making sure the product is at its highest quality.

Crypto is what it is today without a single mainstream success story..... not even one single mainstream business runs on crytpo.....  One company will change everything, it will happen. Yes, I want it to be EDS and BCY that makes that change and breaks open the flood gates... but I think an opportunity like this may be lost on management... Do they realize how big this can be?

Using this platform, game developers and companies can easily and securely build blockchain games similar to SoG on the Bitcoin blockchain through the Counterparty protocol. The platform release is scheduled for September 2016.          Furthermore, Force of Will (FoW), a popular Japanese trading card game, is set to take advantage of the blockchain game platform built by IndieSquare and EverdreamSoft. The game sells cards in more than 30 countries ranking 4th in sales volume in the North American hobby channel collectible game category. The FoW’s upcoming online simulator, “Force of Will Battle Simulator” is scheduled to be released this coming September and will have their game items tokenized on the blockchain, just like SoG. Thanks to this, FoW’s passionate players (that amount to more than 100,000) will be able to trade their game items securely on the blockchain.   In addition to secure game items trading on the blockchain, the new joint venture between IndieSquare and EverdreamSoft will allow interoperability of game items between different games. Utilizing IndieSquare’s API services the popular bitcoin game SaruTobi has already enabled Spells of Genesis cards to be used as in-game playable items. The crypto geocaching application Takara now allows the geocaching of Spells of Genesis cards and other Counterparty assets. These are also made possible by IndieSquare’s api service.  By combining IndieSquare’s Counterparty API services with EverdreamSoft’s easy to use dashboard for game management and asset registration, we hope this collaboration will enable a new wave of developers to utilize blockchain game items, planting the seed for a generation of games and applications with interoperable assets.  For Shaban Shaame, the EverdreamSoft's CEO, this collaboration is the beginning of a new era: ""Blockchain-based games and asset “true ownership” redefine the basis of the game economy. Last few years we saw an important shift to free to play model. Right now we are heading to a new change towards blockchain-based models. Decentralization of ownership is the next huge step forward, heading to a more collaborative creation process where users and developers are working hand in hand.""  Further details about the project will be announced later this month, the platform includes a game optimized mobile collection app as well as a game developer interface for token management.",False

Some of them are a little cheesy with the descriptions.  The quality art needs some quality writing for the lore of Askian.  * Also we need a card for Factom (possible librarian style card..keeper of records of Askian), Monero (an elusive bandit that handles secret dealings within Askian), STEEM (a town crier or Spreader of news), Counterparty (and group of masked men that hold court in handling the money of Askian without corruption.

SOG cards are public domain, they are owned by you and in the blockchain and part of the CounterParty protocol. Is there anything that prevents another company from building a game or app that allows you to play or otherwise use your digital SOG card?  Bottom line is I think there is nothing that prevents you from building something on top of these assets. For example, I can use physical Magic cards in my own game of my own making if I so choose to do so. If any of you would like to discuss this idea further, send me a private message.

You are probably already familiar with that project. I quote from their website:  ""A new technology called the Blockchain is an invention which will cause a revolution (REVUNKOLUTION) in digital ownership. The blockchain was invented and first implemented as part of Bitcoin, the first independent global currency. It enables digital tokens to exist independent of any centralized 3rd party or mediator. These digital tokens can represent anything: a bitcoin, a car, a legal contract, or a virtual object. By assigning the characteristics of a virtual object to a blockchain based token, you make that object independent of its virtual environment. It can now move freely from one owner to the next seamlessly and without needing permission of the entity that created it. The token can never be copied or counterfeited, and if the creators desire it they can fix the total number of tokens that will ever be issued for a particular object so it now becomes scarce. Once an asset is assigned a token, the blockchain does the rest of the work. Owners of the token hold it in a digital wallet and every time they enter the game it scans their digital wallet to see what tokens they have and assigns them the proper virtual items. However, the wallet and the token exist independent and outside the game itself, so the game has no power to restrict what they do with their tokens.""  Freemyvunk appears to be mostly concentrating on ethereum-based assets, but are open to other protocols such as counterparty, too. Spells of Genesis is also already supporting the concept of Freemyvunk (Free your digital assets from being limited to only being used in a specific game). To try and build some momentum from the gaming community, the creators of Freemyvunk have issued their own reward token called VNK on ethereum, which you can earn by tweeting about Freemyvunk. You can find more details on their website.  On the other hand, Sarutobi already has taken the first step to implementing this concept by making several of the SoG cards playable in the Sarutobi game, to give power-boosts to their monkey character in the game. I am sure people can think of other interesting uses and new games that could also make use of the SoG cards and bitcrystals in new ways, and I for one as a SoG partner would welcome such iniciatives from the community members as they certainly would add value to our investment in the existing SoG game ecosystem.",False

If you had been around as long as me maybe you would support the project as much as I do.  Hope we get on a Chinese exchange so you can relax about it. When you say ""I invested"" you make it sound like you are a stock broker... You bought some coins to speculate on them, that's not investing, buying shares of a company that's investing. Hope you make some money though, as that is every speculator's aim, and there's nothing wrong with that. Just don't pretend that what you suggest should be done because you bought some coins.  There is much more to SoG than the value of BCY, it is a game first and foremost and its success is based on many other factors not the value of BCY. There are many players on here and on Slack that actually play the game, buy cards and come up with suggestions to improve gameplay and other things that surround the SoG ecosystem. I think that is the right attitude.  In my opinion even without a Chinese exchange once the game launches, hopefully with enough players onboard, BCY value will go up. It is deflationary at the end of the day so the more BCY are spent, the more EDS earns, the less BCY will be in circulation.  There's been more volume lately on Polo, that is great to see. If that keeps going it'll be easier for other exchanges to want to support BCY. But first and foremost they need to support Counterparty which on its own is improving by the day.",False

The other chinese options are:   Btc38  Yunbi  In those cases, probably EDS have to invest some money to ask those exchanges to support the Counterparty Protocol  There is another option: Open Ledger (Bitshares) Trough an Open.Asset backed by Bitcrystalls trought a Gateway (blocktrades.us)  Bitshares is running on a wallet that is a DEX (Decentralaized Exchange) quite  popular in China because of a big community and a service called Transwiser.

I would wait for SoG to announce the release when is ready. Yes there is a roadmap and it stated in August there should be a soft launch. But I would rather make sure it is announced with more certainty by the team first. Why adding unnecessary pressure?  On the other end there have been articles coming out regularly about SoG not only that specific one on TheMerkle, I try and keep track of them and post them here if and when I see them. And we are talking about dozens of articles since the project was formed, not 1 or two. So I think they are doing well on that front.  I believe once there is a download available on the Apple and Google stores things will pick up as well as more articles and news. Nobody (gaming blogs, etc) really wants to publish about a game that is in beta with no way of easily downloading to a smartphone, of course unless you are EA Games. Hence why I think Bitcoin media is the best option right now and where you are more likely to see articles about SoG coming out.  Looking forward to the next releases whenever they are, the team has added some great features lately like the level maker which I find quite entertaining. So I try to stay positive and support SoG while I wait for the launch as anyone else without being too inquisitive or critical. I believe the team has got things in hands.  ",False

One of the boring thing about SoG assets management is Swapbots, I do think that a subscription card could be appreciate from customers because who own it, receive cards directly from EDS.

There have been over 60 blockchain-based cards so far but at any one time you can only get one.  However, partners and premium members who have a lifetime subscription to SoG card releases (one at the time as well) will make a considerable amount of noise if any new party would be allowed to purchase cards before them. Unfortunately! I suggest you mention this on Slack Viva, and see how people takes it. This is not about being able to purchase cards earlier but to have more card choices for newbies.  I think eventually some more third party stores will come out and they will offer previous releases so new users are able to buy older cards if they wanted to.

First of all, we want to thank everyone who gave us a few minutes of their time and replied to our survey. We are now able to share with you a brief summary of the outcomes and address some of your comments.  SUMMARY There were over 50 survey submissions, ⅓ of which from the USA. Most respondents have been following the project since the Token Sale, or even longer, and almost all own some BitCrystals, even though only 65% have purchased them. Half respondents took part in the BitCrystals Token Sale, while the other half didn’t. About 60% of all those who replied are absolutely or rather satisfied with project progress and for 65% it has lived up to their expectations. We are very pleased to hear this.  Ongoing improvements and new features, external communication & PR and customer service & internal communication are the aspects perceived as the most important for both the success of the project and from the respondents’ points of view. Nevertheless, on a scale from 1 (very unsatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied) the notes given the most often are 3 (not satisfied, nor unsatisfied) or 4 (rather satisfied). This indicates to us that we still have something to improve on these important aspects.  COMMENTS  GAME DEVELOPMENT Our current focus is mainly on the game development itself, to deliver all the features we have promised: We have just released the alpha version of the custom level editor, so you can create and play your own levels! The web version of guilds and an updated team page (new design, faster workflow, possibility of sorting out your cards) will be released shortly. Lesson taken from our previous, often hasty releases: we are going to run a pre-launch closed testing periods for all important releases from now on, to identify the major bugs before an update release. Some of you asked for daily or weekly based leaderboard, in order to make the game more challenging. In July, we’re going to add daily quests, achievements and experience points gathered while accomplishing different quests. In August, we’re planning to release the game soft launch, while releasing a new version, enriched with in-app purchases and a tutorial. Finally, the complete version of the game is scheduled for September, with a full version of the guilds system, blockchainization of the highest off-chain cards evolution, in-game news and XCP address verification. The last point will address the security concerns, raised by some respondents.  PUBLIC RELATIONS Given our detailed roadmap and the constant progress, we are also going to put more efforts in the PR domain. We are constantly in contact with blockchain media and trying to raise awareness of the project.  CARD SYSTEM Some concerns about the complexity and difficulty of the card system have been raised. A brief summary for those who wish to learn more or would like a refresh:  Currently we have off-chain cards which can be obtained in-game by summoning gold; and blockchain-based cards, which can be purchased from one of our “Merchants” (swapbots selling blockchain assets) for BitCrystals. The off-chain cards can be leveled-up and fused. In the final game release, the highest evolution of a card can be “blockchainized.” For the moment, we will keep releasing one new card per week in the current supply, varying between 600 and 2000 units for most of them. After the game release, the cards will be released in seasons, as the standard for physical card games. After the end of each season, which will run roughly for half a year approximately, there will be a new lot to take their place. The cards that won’t be “printed” anymore will gain value for collectors and players, and the older editions or collections, will thus also increase in value given the heightened rarity of the items.  The page www.bitcrystals.com/store offers an overview of all blockchain cards released so far and provide links to the three “Merchants,” the only official SoG card marketplaces. While visiting each Merchant, one has a quick view to which cards are currently available. A possibility of sorting cards out according to their type (public, premium, special)  will be added shortly.  SOG AS A PEDAGOGIC TOOL Last but not least, someone mentioned that the game could be used to teach people about blockchain technology. Already the fact that blockchain technology is used as a backbone of a game economy is a revolutionary step, which in turn we hope it will introduce the concept to a more mainstream public. Our aim is also to develop tools that will make using blockchain very easy and user-friendly, so easy that anyone can use them without even knowing they’re on blockchain.  THANK YOU A huge thanks goes to all of you for being with us, helping make our common dreams come true.",False

Like in Magic the Gathering. Right now the game needs to have a certain amount of cards to complete Milestone #4 (about 150).  And this latest update has added quite a few to reach that stage. If there's a new card a week going forward there will only be 52 new cards a year.  http://bravenewcoin.com/news/spells-of-genesis-additions-arriving-soon/  Also got to consider newcomers, when the game launches there will most likely be an influx of new users some will want to collect historic cards, some may not give a sausage they will want to play. Free cards are there, like in any other game, because there must be something given for free (I mean by playing the game) because not everyone can afford or wants to spend money to play a game.  However the early adopters will have some of the rarest cards ever released and if the collectors market gets a lot of traction we should see some interesting trades too.  About estimating the future value of current cards: the value will be what one is willing to pay for them. In the past a Moonga card was sold for over $1000. If demand is high for a card and offer is low plus there are not many, that is a perfect combination for crazy deals.

With the Bitcoin rise and alts in question BCY would probably also be hurt in trading.  We are feeling some effects but not as bad as the top 5 on Polo right now.  Just be patient and I'm sure the game will come out at the perfect time where the Bitcoin rise will have settled.

So you are right, we get it, EDS missed, the price is suffering and there is nothing you can do about it.

Now transaction are very slow and expensive and the things are getting worse.   For the future we all do expect LN, Segwit, and a block size increase but I do not think that any of these technologies will be ready for September/October wen SoG will be launched.    Unlukcly some Blockstream/Core dev do think that counterparty transactions are spam , so I do not think we got much support for op_return tx in the futures (in the past they reduced op-return size for a while) , for example we don't know if it will be possible to make Op-Return TX in the LN.

All blockchain cards (which are assets in counterparty)  can be tradeable.  This will be the first time in gaming history that people own cards that is almost impossible to duplicate.  For instance I have a Satoshi card and only 200 were sold.  The rarity of these cards have gone up an insane value from the presale.  I think they're worth close to 4 btc now each.  The other cool aspect is that other games are using some of the cards as special powerups.

I remember they announcing that on Twitter.  So far there are lots blockchain cards and and could be only bought. And this also gives them high value. Many cards was bought by speculators and soem cards will never be on sale for regular players, but for partners and premium members only.  But there will be also some cards that you will collect and upgrade in game and i guess after maximizing it it will become blockchain card and you will be able to trade it same way as bought cards.

Why? Because it is on the cusp of testing a legitimate crypto use case in the in-game economy of Spells Of Genesis.  Some other crypto uses cases that are out there are: cloud storage (Sia, Storj), cloud data verification (FCT), cloud apps (ETH)  But it is surprising that in-game economy hasn't really had a true mainstream effort yet. some coins have tried in-game economies but the games are not mainstream mass-market games.  So now we are on the cusp of releasing a potentially very popular game whose entire economy is built around crypto.  These two paragraphs in the OP are most interesting to me:    I presume EDS will buy BCY on the markets... What will happen to BCY when thousands of dollars in BCY are being purchased every day... you have an instant market maker in the company itself. You cannot mine these coins so the in-game economy will drive the price higher every single day.  Coupled with gaming assets that are owned by the user and are infinitely usable in any future game that wants to use those assets in some way....  The big BCY bump will happen when the game hits the market and EDS starts buying coins. The second huge bump will happen when SOG assets are used in a second game.....

DigiByte nobody uses it anyway. SoG is a Trading Card game can't compare with the above.  GameCredits has one game out: TurboCharged, I played it and it's fun. They also have a few other bits they are working on, but again other public. I am personally excited by more game studios building crypto related games, at the end of the day is all good for the ecosystem.  The main problem you'll find is that the mainstream gaming community is mostly unaware of what's coming in this space or just ignore it because they don't know how to use bitcoin or cryptocurrency. The more games there are promoting blockchain and cryptocurrencies the better IMO, and the more successful they are even better for all other gaming projects.  But hey you are either a shill for someone who asked you to post negative stuff here, or got issues of your own. Someone like you would never delete a wallet even if there was 1 penny in it so you either still own BCY or as I said you are doing this for a reason.

The milestone was quite ambitious, we had to comply to our commitments such as: 100+ levels, 150 cards, guild creation and level editor.  We made important changes to the backend as well as the game architecture, specifically the way we store blockchain and off-chain cards. We also developed tools to allow the game to balance and analyze cards. We promised a release on the 6th of June and we did deliver the same day, however not without some significant glitches. The update was intended to be huge but in the end there were too many new features in our new technical architecture that were not tested enough.   What we did wrong  I take responsibility for this “half baked” launch, we tried to build too many things at once. Learning from this experience we are now working on test procedures to be carefully followed before each beta release going forward. Of course, that is common sense you might say… Thus in our case, because of the speed of releases and updates, we need to create shorter review cycles. Going forward we will not change  architecture and implement big changes at the same time. We will make sure to thoroughly test each release before going live for as long as it takes to find all major bugs. Seen that we are still in beta minor bugs will still be the norm and our team will be there fixing them as they come.   Overall progress  I’m very satisfied with the game progress so far. We now have everything we need to make SoG a big hit: Several blockchain analytics methods Hybrid off-chain and on-chain digital assets management system Strong tools to create new cards that will make card expansions and levels a breeze  At EverdreamSoft we have previous experience with several product launches. This is the first time where we do a continuous integration by developing the game while the community is testing it. It’s exciting because we get a lot of feedback and we see how people are playing from the very beginning. It does really feel like a product made by the community! We also feel the pressure since we are not quietly developing off the radar, people have expectations from us even though we are still in the production phase.  Nevertheless this has been a very good lesson not only for us but for anyone working on blockchain-based and community-driven games in the future. We are moving to an ecosystem where the crowd is part of every step of the process.   A big thank you goes to everyone who is following us in this adventure for making us all more efficient, effective and stronger by the day.",False

The value of this for SoG is promotion in another country. The tokens have no resell value hence why there is no point to convert them to BCY and burn half of that.  However what this can do is promote SoG further in Japan which in turn attracts more attention to the game. Don't forget that the biggest market for Moonga was Japan so I guess the team should do even more of these partnerships. The cards that were sold for third party tokens are unlocked cards so their value is not the same as a rare card. And I think what was sold for BCY got burned as it was supposed to.

I also own BCY and most cards, and I fucken love this project!    How did I find out they are partnerships? By reading the announcements on this thread or on the SoG blog. Each card is announced in both places including who they are done in collaboration with and how they will be sold. One example, the Sarutobi card: http://spellsofgenesis.tumblr.com/post/140625317755/sarutobi-get-your-flying-monkey (there's all you need to know that I know, right there). Also the team is quite active on Slack and if and when there is a change they ask people for feedback first.  As in the example above it was known when announced that:  ""You can get your flying monkey for 60 BCY, or 15 SaruTobi, starting from Tuesday, March 8th, 3pm CET.""  When you do a partnership with another game if the other publisher says: we'll promote your game and you promote ours but we want the card to be given to our fans for Sarutobi tokens what's the big deal? I'm not sure how you get Sarutobi tokens, maybe by playing the game? Who cares? So long as it creates buzz within the two communities I am happy with it. There have been several articles when Sarutobi became available on Android and in each one of them there was a mention of SoG. (big applause to the team!) People have also bought the Sarutobi card for BCY and those BCY have been counted as revenue from sales, half of which have been burned. I see nothing wrong.  As others have said: chill Sherlock.   It's ok to provide feedback but try do it with respect towards the project and other fans.",False

Monday 6/6, the date is probably marked in your agenda and you are awaiting the next season with impatience. It is time to tell you more about it. Ready?   The next testing season is coming together with a new game release, which will offer you over 300 cards! Therefore we found natural to base the 6th season on cards.  As you know, the cards can be leveled-up and, once they reached their highest level, fused to get a higher evolution. To level-up your cards, you need to pay some elemental crystals. The points you’ll be gathering in the season 6 will depend on the elemental crystals spent for leveling-up your cards. Just as a small reminder, the cost, in elemental crystals, of leveling-up your cards is as follows:    HOW WILL YOU COLLECT POINTS?  The number of points you’ll receive will depend first of all on the cost of the level-up. Then the card evolution and its type (common, rare, epic, legendary) will count too.  EVOLUTION If you have the I. evolution of a card, the number of points you’ll get will be equal to the amount of elemental crystals spent to level-up the card. For the II. evolution of the card, the number of your points will be multiplied by two, and for the III. evolution, multiplied by three.  CARD TYPE This basic formula will apply for common cards. For rare cards, the number of points will be multiplied by 1.5, for epic by 2 and, finally, for legendary ones the coefficient will be 2.5. See the details in the chart below.   SEASON 6 POINTS OVERVIEW   The 6th testing season is starting on Monday, we will announce you the exact time tomorrow. Stay tuned and get ready for the new game release!",False

As i understand those collected coins should be somehow sold and with half of it bought BitCrystals to be burned.  unless, public merchant last month hav no other income then selling Sarutobi, CNPCOIN and SHUMAI and all together those collected coins were worth 80,592.00  so with adding them as to be burned, mean they were sold/took out of the system.

If you keep talking about this you are not going to change their mind. What you are doing is pissing people of. So give it a break for fcuck sake!  OpenLedger is paying a PR company for their articles they are not coming out just because they are brilliant, because they are not! These PR companies cost money, about 12K a month. And the results are pretty mediocre. A waste of money in my opinion for what you get. I've seen very few articles about OpenLedger to be honest, I saw way more articles about SoG than that! I rather SoG spends their money in development and I'm sure they have had someone helping them out on the marketing/PR side.  The other thing you should know is that when a blog writes about a project they are not going to write about them the next week. Most of the bitcoin blogs have covered SoG several times, I'm sure when something newsworthy comes out they'll cover them again.  Nobody is forcing you guys to be around and not sure how u suddenly turn so avid on the BCY front. Can't believe you guys don't realize what's going on with alts right now, since the beginning of the year actually... This is all going to stop soon enough and all alts will go back to where they were previously: nowhere. Only the few that have an use, a valuable product may grab some speculative attention.  Do you seriously think that EDS's future is based on the 25 million BCY they hold? Are you aware that they had a game release previous to SoG and they raised VC funds in the past, I do believe they have investors outside the crypto space interested too. The only ones that are worried are the few of you that keep mentioning BCY are important.  Don't get me wrong they are important but there are other ways that a project can support itself.  The originality of SoG together with the roadmap, the community support, the possibility of working with All4Games are all things that will make a difference when the time comes.",False

Maybe they are not spending 12K a month I can only guess. However 12K a month is what some PR firms charge for their services.  As an example look at this PR (press release, not article) that came up about OpenLedger: https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/initial-coin-offering-openledger-icoo-extends-support-future-icos-order-empower-community/ Media Contact: Ronnie But who's at the bottom of the article? Bitcoin PRBuzz: A marketing and PR firm: http://bitcoinprbuzz.com/  Here's another one: http://www.coinspeaker.com/2016/05/25/initial-coin-offering-openledger-icoo-extends-support-future-icos-order-empower-community/  So OpenLedger is using one of those firms to market their token sale or ICOO as they call it. Or do they own Bitcoin PR Buzz? I don't know. Where am I lying? You guys are getting people to write Press Releases, paid articles, etc, or at least to distribute them and to create buzz around them. Done a little more research and found what they charge too, from $800 to $1000 per press release, they also do monthly or yearly plans. I can show you their .pdf I found if you don't believe me but I rather not because it's not fair to them.  Their services include spreading PR's and articles all over social media and various channels, how many of these you guys get done a month? How far I was from 12K a month? Maybe half of that? My point is OpenLedger doesn't do their marketing all on their own, the price I stated originally may be different.  For what I can see the ICOO started on May 20th and they only raised about 34K USD: http://icoo.io/. Is the marketing effort working? Not really. How much did SoG raise on the first day only? About 240 BTC, and managed to get what they needed and a bit more to get the project going by the end of the sale. What does that mean? That SoG knows when it is time to push for marketing, who to choose to do their marketing and when to spend the money for marketing.  Nobody is blaming you for that don't get me wrong, you guys are doing a token sale that's when you want marketing to be at its high to pitch it for potential contributors. Yes when a PR comes out (if newsworthy) some of the other media picks it up. This is how the PR world works and this is what is it used for: to create buzz about an upcoming event or to get people to know of a project/product, like TheDao token sale, the OpenLedger token sale, and (at the time) even the SoG token sale. They certainly have had a PR firm working for them. Everyone does this not only in the crypto space, it happens for every single product you know of, even the ones on supermarket shelves.  However, there is a time for spending money in marketing and PR and there is a time to do some work, development, and that is what SoG is doing right now. Of course it doesn't mean to have to stop all marketing efforts it means that those efforts may slow down while the projects build what they are supposed to build and get it ready for launch.  I'm confident that marketing is still ongoing with SoG is just that there are not big news coming out right now, give it some time and there will be. Can you imagine when users are going to be able to build their own levels in SoG? Don't you see yourself playing with that? Or guilds to play in groups of players?  An article a week or even more often will happen organically if the product is worth talking about. Having a few articles saying there is a launch coming in September ain't going to do much for BCY price IMO. Viva, you have been around for a long while and contributed to this project, I loved your google sheet with all the stats you provided and hope you'll keep doing that. You seem to care about SoG and hope you still do, I'm not here to compare your other projects to SoG so long as you don't do it as well, otherwise I will tell you my opinion and you got to accept that. I may be wrong on some things, I don't read people's minds, and I'm not perfect either. I do get frustrated when I see people repeating themselves over and over about the same arguments which are not doing anything towards supporting a project for the best.

If you're working with a company like Channel 4......I'm pretty fucking certain that they wanna make sure the product is all hashed out for a proper release.  Not some bullcrap release with only bitcoin community advertising.  The bitcoin community itself is not even worth throwin bones at these days because they're too involved with block size civil war to even pay attention to actual products being developed to grow the space.  If we're talking Channel 4, we're talking about professionalism and PROPER deployment of said game.  Would you guys rather have a game that is ""kinda"" finished with maybe a couple bitcoin write ups..........or actually a proper release with a proper salvo of advertising drops and more effective visibility.  You make your choice but from what I'm seeing, I'm just seeing a bunch of 2014 era, no patience, get rich quickers trying to pump the price to make a profit.

Bitcrystals price matter, is a vital part for the whole project.   About 25.000.000 bcy ar in the EdS portfolios and those token are sounds money to pay development, new features, contract, hardware.

As many other blockchain projects there isn't any ready product here, but I can assure you that SoG is one of the most concrete project ready to do real business in a matter of months (not year).

Currently i'm working with Ronny Boesing on a Open Ledger project, Ronny is not an engenieer, he is a marketing guy, and so i KNOW that marketing in the crypto ecosystem works and is quite cheap. It work because now we are in the middle of the blockchain bubble so, Hype, PR, bitcointalk campaigns, are worth the effort.  So please, price matter.

Bitcoin blockchain is slow, but this isn't the main issue. The main issue are the fees.    Currently Core Devs are doing their best to realize a specific vision :    1) small blocksize 2) very high onchain fee 3) a lot of offchain transaction throgh the Lightin Network protocols and sidechains ( Blockstream products)  In this vision, the counterparty protocol is not suitable for cards. Some cards have an high value but the most of the cards worth a very little amount of bitcoins. In the future, the near future, fees will be more than the value of those cards.  Right now is not cleare if and WHEN counterparty protocol could eventualy use offchain transactions.  So my proposal is this: change blockchain with a controlled process  The two most interesting blockchains for SOG are:  1) Ethereum blockchain, powerful but still diffcult to handle 2) Bitshares blockchain, less powerful but very easy to manage   I don't think that is so difficult to add a system that control more than a blockchain in SOG, that's a trivial function, so some cards for same time could exist in the bitcoin blockchain and other card in eth or bts blockchain.  The problem is the switch for the old cards and eventualy bitcrystals. This topic have to handled whit special care.  I know that this new topic add other stress to the sog team, but I realy thing that in a very near time, bitcoin blockchain will be a problem not an opportunity.  Thanks in Advance Viva!  p.s I know more the bitshares blockchian because currently i'm working with the open ledger team, but i do think that also the eth blockchain fit perfectly with Sog . https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1479359.40 my name is Paolo Rebuffo      ",False

A new day a new suggestion, what will you guys suggest tomorrow? LOL  Don't worry noone is going to raise fees that much in the near term, and from what you say fees are going to cost as much as a card... not this year, not next IMO. For one Bitcoin is the most secure and popular blockchain. Ethereum is still in its infancy compared to the well tested Bitcoin and they may hit issues of their own in terms of scalability soon enough.  They are working on Casper and I wish them good luck with that, but until it is proven effective I have my reservations on Ethereum's scalability and speed.  BitShares... No one is using it or they have little traction. However they have very low transaction fees and they were thinking of having 0 fees implemented... But network effect and user adoption with them is 0 at the moment. I was following them when they did their massive token sales and attempted a DAO, it was so complicated, there was confusing information all over BitsharesTalk that a newbie could only get lost to find anything useful easily. So glad I didn't waste my money on it.  Open Ledger is trying hard to get people on it (I know Ronny, met him in London last year), but I don't know many people who are actually using it. I do like what they are trying, but it will be a while before it takes off if ever, with all the competition and wish you guys all the best.  Not sure if you have seen Yodark's last message, it explains pretty well what the team is concentrating on and I think unless it is a major issue in the near term (which I doubt) they better stick to making the game as awesome as possible. Nice of you thinking ahead though.  If and when there will be an issue with BTC I'm sure the team will keep an eye on alternatives however I personally don't believe it is something to worry about right now. Having a mix of blockchains can be really confusing for new users, have you thought about that, user experience? Especially new non-crypto users that know nothing about crypto tokens?  If push comes to shove it will be trivial to create tokens on Ethereum or another blockchain for BCY and cards, may cost a bit in Tx fees for users and SoG but things can be swapped one by one. Current users are well used to Counterparty, there are swapbots that allow many in the community to participate in the economy and sell cards... It's not a small change you are proposing. Some may not even want to go through all this and could cause people to loose interest in the game altogether.  And the way I see blockchain integration in SoG is merely to show your cards in your account as it is now. Blockchain-based cards can be exchanged outside the game.",False

Once they come up with something useful I may consider it. There are a lot of disillusioned people in this space.

If I understand well the concern raised by some of you are the following:  - 1. BitCrystals price is having a downtrend and you feel the EDS team doesn't care about it and doesn't put the effort to change it. - 2. Some people are unhappy with our Marketing strategy thinking we are wasting resources. - 3. Some people think the solution for a sustainable growth of the project awareness and boost is to be listed on Chinese exchange and for some reason we are not going for it. - 4. Some people are unhappy with the launch delay.  This is how I oversee the Spells of Genesis project. In my opinion, compared to lots of other projects we are focusing mainly on delivering value and not much on delivering hype cycles. EDS is not a company that was built over a coin or an asset. We have experience raising funds and delivering value to the end user. I believe a sustainable success comes from a successful way to deliver value to the end user, a user that will actually pay for the benefit. There is time to raise funds, create hype on a promise, and there is a time to build a sustainable product.  My prediction is we are heading sooner or later to a “Token Sale Hangover”. There is a lot of hype over altcoins and a lot of speculation. Right now altcoins have market caps that don't reflect their actual value. No project springs to mind where a company or a end user (outside the crypto space) are willing to pay for. When this hangover will take place there will be a severe correction among altcoins valuation. At EDS we need to make sure we have a solid product and customers who are willing to pay for when the bubble bursts.  This is the very reason the main indicator for us is not the BCY price but SoG’s user engagement, user retention, feedback, etc. Failing to do good with this numbers will sooner or later bring us to the wall whatever value BCY has today. This is why I'm focusing our communication resources toward card sales and mostly analytics, because at the end of the day that is the product’s value. I measure the success on the number of people who are purchasing cards because they enjoy playing with them. I am personally astonished by those numbers, they are incredible. The engagement and the expense per user is way higher than industry standards. I'm also aware that those numbers are very promising even though they only address a hardcore fanbase. The game is tailored to people who have extensive knowledge of it. This is the reason I decided to take more time to work on features for newcomers to make sure they also will be hooked to SoG.  We could have rushed to launch early but I think it is for the project’s own good to be polished. Going earlier might create hype for a short time frame but overall it would be a lost opportunity. Might have appealed to 25% of the hardcore users but not to the other 75%.  So I’m pretty certain that our strategy is healthy and solid. I also don’t like seeing BCY going down, however resources are scarce so should I put more effort on the coin marketing and less in understanding the product data and optimise it? I feel this may not be a good idea, and could jeopardise the final product.  Nobody is perfect but we try our best, our marketing could be focused on every single aspect of SoG and other stuff could be improved as well. I believe in the power of many. I believe if together we are putting our energy to fill the gaps that will make us stronger. I understand people getting nervous because they feel the project is not progressing quickly enough. Wouldn’t be better putting energy from frustration and complaints into positive actions? For example thanks a lot to GroundBEEFtaxi who posts regularly on Reddit about SoG, this kind of actions will definitely help.  So I encourage you to push us in the right direction, as you already do. We are constantly polishing the product and the strategy to have the best possible outcome. I exhort people to make suggestions, but even more to act in a positive way, as the majority of the community already does. It will help to push the project to the Moon.",False

If the game is successful once it hist the apple and Google stores I do not believe however that most gamers will be into BitCrystals and will mainly use in-app purchases as not that many people are willing or want to know about BitCrystals and/or Bitcoin (they will need both).  So in my opinion you guys have taken the right approach by concentrating on the game and try to make it fun and worthwhile.  I also do agree that people should be more positive rather than complain.  Someone made the GEMZ example, they haven't released an update in ages, people are using Telegram instead, the project is not being very proactive. Instead SoG is around, it's delivering new updates every month and the team is actively working on the project.  I have no doubt SoG is going to be here to stay as well as on Poloniex. ",False

The game is over, gamers are over for a simple reason: no one will invest here. And, curiosly, these project live on because of money flow. Not because of ideas, sensations, dreams and so on.  They have to learn from the crypto you mentioned: their collegueas are now swimming in the money, they can pay for better developers, for better marketing and so on.  Am I crazy or is it so difficult to understand that if the world (let say a few ""big hands"" in financial sector) looks at Bitcrystals, everything would bè better and EASIER for all of EDS?  I'm here and I will be here for all 2016 I think, I don't invest for day trading, but I have to say that the management is not what they look to me some months ago.  I did a mistake, probably, I know and I personally don't suggest any more to any of my friends to puttana money in a thing that is manager like this, without any direction.  Oh, there is the game... it's right. One day it will be released and people will go crazy for it all around the world, because it will appear everybody in everybody's dreaming. People will run on app stores to get it, paying every amount of money! Yes yes for sere this will be our future!!!  Or not?",False

Thanks for your ideas, they are very good. Let me reply to them:  1. In early stages of game design we had a version with your orbs on the battlefield and tested internally as we also thought it would add more variety, strategy and would be perfect for multiplayer. The big downside and the reason we didn't implement it was that the controls just were too hard and it was harder to get into the ""flow"". The reason for these two issues is as follows: - In the current gameplay all your characters are always at the bottom of the screen, meaning that in order to aim precisely you only need your finger/thumb to be a little bit above that. In this way you can easily play the game with just one hand. - But the biggest issue is that it is a lot harder to aim when you can hit in 360 degrees instead of just around 90. It became so annoying that we decided not to do this. - Also because you have to adjust way more to the new situation, shootposition, and strategic possibilities each turn, it's harder to get into the flow(especially when you play the game casually).  - Lastly we chose for Asynchronous multiplayer because it is a lot safer. Both players don't have to be online at the same time, meaning we can match player a lot better to their ranks without the need of millions of users and huge servers. Also you don't have to wait for each other and we eliminate the risk of someone having to stop the game because he leaves public transport or for some other reason. Be aware though that the multiplayer now is just a random level with the cards of other players. The goal is to have players really design their own levels and in this way make it way more personal between the two players.  Synchronous multiplayer in the way you suggest it, or in another way has not been removed from our dreams. But due to the risks and negative test-responses we've decided to postpone it. Perhaps in the future and if SOG is very succesful(what we're going for of course) we'll give it a try again.  2. Crystallizing multiple cards and reducing load times for this is quite high on our priority list! We'll promise that this will go way more smooth.  3. Good idea, but due to a lot of things to do that are more urgent we'll postpone it first.  4.

In general I think that supply unlimited blockchained cards is an huge error, and maybe it will be better to set up  an upper  limit (10.000 cards? 50.000 cards?) as a general rule. One solution could be on introducing a sort of ""edition"" for cards sold out but still necessary for the game play.  This concept should be used for cheap common cards and ultra rare cards.  For example, FDCARD is sold out, what about of a second edition for FDCARD? FDCARD2 Same power, different color.  There is also a second issue we can observe whit Premium Merchant, some cards are simply too costly camparing to their rarity/power. This issue is strictly related on bitcrystals price volatility.  In this case I suggest a massive burn so these old overpriced cards will be attractive again at their original price tag. (example BEARWHALECD, 1200bcy each, too much for a 3000 issued not so powerful card, currently EDS owns 2830 cards, probably 2500 to be burned to make those cards attractive again)  Just some proposal.",False

Don't ask from me how that script will be made but if I have understand right it will be possible with smart contracts calculate how many cards and burn others. First developers make example 50000 card and send it for smart contract swap bot what will burn before selling start example 40000 cards or even 49000 card  If blockchain choose that will be something what never have seen before and it will make similiar but new kind of random element for game what you have when you go buy un opened packet of cards from shop and hope to get one rarely card.  This will make also comments ""devs"" only collect money with cards wrong because they can't control it.  What you think about idea?   Edit. When I think the idea why even doing like this. Why not do real packets. Where blockchain have choose card amount/rarely and where you can buy packets example 1000 BCY 5 cards or 2000 BCY 11 cards and there behind smart contracts are all cards and you will get randomly 5 card. If you have good luck you receive some really rarely card   Then deck building will be more difficult and resellers have still markets in their swapbots. Early adopters also get better position with their first decks what have buy already before released this kind of system.",False

Battle royale peer to peer instead of playing other people's decks.   Instead of playing their decks maybe in the future you can actually fight the person in game where your cards on the battlefield attack where they land.   It probably would be easier if the battlefield had a little more room.  However I can give you an example.  Instead of my team firing from the ""dugout"" section they actually fire from the location on the board.  So technically your cards could possibly land(get hit or bounced) into a position close to your opponent's attack lines.  Here's the cool part though, if it was peer to peer both teams would be on the battlefield and cards would be getting bounced around which would possibly add a new variable to strategy and shooting technique.  I was thinking about this when I was playing other people's randomized decks.  I think it would be pretty fun and crazy to see half my cards in enemy territory because I was ""bounced over"" from their attacks............kind of behind enemy lines.  Also visually it would be awesome just seeing both decks in the mix and clashing with each other.  Maybe also you can have cards that are ""friendly fire"" so when you shoot and hit your own cards you won't be damaged.  I guess this idea came from a slight frustration in feeling it wasn't ""truly"" multiplayer............like feeling a disconnect by not actually playing the player themeselves.  This could also add to specialized ""multiplayer"" cards that can only be used in multiplayer mode because of the abilities they have(IE +3 friendly fire......).  I know this is a pipe dream, BUT if Everdreamsoft considers this idea for a later update............I can guarantee this added feature's addictiveness will make people go crazy.     2.  A ""Batch crystallize feature.""  This could address the time consuming transaction after transaction lag time the players experience.  Maybe a feature on the team section where you press and hold a card which then allows you to pick as many as you'd like and then press crystallize.  I've noticed you can't batch crystallize all of the rare cards which takes up alot of gaming experience time.    3.  Coindaddy plugin to view your counterparty wallet within the game(this is a farrrrr reaching dream).  To have a coindaddy plugin of some sort so you can view your assets within the game would get players used to knowing how counterparty works and how much assets they have(and how much BTC they own).  4.  Still not sure if people would even like this BUT.............I've noticed a very smart thing Bitcoin billionaire did.  They allowed people to the option to view ads in order to make/or keep their fictional bitcoins they earned by watching ads.  Maybe if there was an option for people to watch ads in return to slowly accrue rubys to buy new packs that could help with Everdreamsoft's revenue stream.    I HATE ADS.............but..........if I watched enough to get some guaranteed rare cards.........then it totally wouldn't annoy me.  NOTE:  If you haven't seen how Bitcoin billioinaire implements the adds in their game it's actually pretty genius.  They way they did it was so non intrusive and optional I actually didn't mind it and actually appreciated it.   All of these ideas came out of constantly playing this game and seeing the possibilities of jetting it up beyond the atmosphere.  I hope the Everdreamsoft guys see this and relate it if they like it.  ",False

It would be required even anything special, for example it would take a written newsletter on a regular basis (monthly? weekly fortnightly??) in which every head of the development team tell what he did during the reference period and in which the project head (Yodark) update the roadmap .  Yodark had begun well by doing a couple of videos in the first two months, then nothing on a regular basis but the usual and proper ""Burning Report.""  There Exists ""best practicies"" that have developed in recent years within the cryptocurrencies ecosystem:  1) open sessions of AMA (Ask Me Anything) made on quarterly basis 2) regular newsletter (at least monthly) 3) web based Roadmaps (there are lots of scheduling webtool)  continually updated  Query the community of some sporadic management choice is absolutely not enough. Even worse is to start making communication and then stop (The first Yodark Video).  I must also insist that despite having been repeatedly pointed out in this thread, today Bitcrystals are not listed on a Chinese Market, and IMHO this is one of the big market related issue where EDS have to work.  Do not get me wrong, these are not sterile criticism, I have made the ICO and over time I increased my position on Bitcrystals.

It seems a lot of peoples concern re: PR, updates etc are being skipped over and ignored.  I am holding a modest amount of BCY and this is the first time I have started to lose faith in my investment.  I'm not fussed about delays, bugs etc but I would prefer to know what is going on regards development rather than look at new/old cards up for sale.  FWIW I think the game is a lot of fun. I am not a gamer but I do enjoy playing this when I have a few spare moments.  However,  Could someone please address the concerns of this community?",False

Thanks for the feedback. I completely understand we should have better communicated the status. Actually we get a bit overwhelmed with the success of the closed beta. The engagement : numbers of game played and involvement really high over our expectations and it keeps us very busy on the slack to address all the concerns feedbacks etc. I lost a bit track of making wide PR.  Today I'm having a call with the publisher to review the roadmap. I'll make a video update by the end of the week !,False

Maybe you have missed it above, there are news of a partnership with All4Games part of the UK's Channel4 group. From what Yodark mentioned on Slack they are reviewing the contract so that should bring a bit of fun to the party, once it all comes together.  Game development is progressing, have you played it yet? Getting more fun to play at each Testing Season, we are at #5, and you get a little reward for it out of the 20K BCY pot. Of course there are bugs but within each testing season they get all straightened out, the game works, you get your cards in the game, you get even free cards by playing, you can fuse them, level them up... More and more assets are being added to the gameplay and IMO from when it all started, last year, SoG is so much better off than many other projects. You also have added strategy to consider when playing the game with all the different cards, and powers, spells, etc and the many levels. And this is just before it even hits the Apple and Play stores. Hope they are not too far away from that, so looking forward to it.    Quote from: Rumhurius on May 07, 2016, 02:11:43 PM i know its a beta.  But upgrading Cards = better stats. seems pretty basic stuff to me.  Some of the Card Upgrades are  simply broken af atm. Seems like the Level of professionalism went down overall lately.  Why ?  See above + The team is as professional as ever, they are busy and work office hours, I can't see where the lack of professionalism is. Game is progressing at a good pace, a bug here and there but they get fixed swiftly. They are in the midst of hitting the final milestone #4 I believe. The team can digress on that further.    Quote from: bugsywugsy on May 07, 2016, 08:13:58 PM There will always be bugs in new projects that are still in beta. But it would be really great if the team could get someone with experience, say, someone who has worked at Wizards.  I think the team appreciates the suggestion, however they have developers and designers onboard and are doing a great job IMO. But if you come across someone of ""that caliber"" feel free to tell em all about SoG and put them on the right track.",False

Let us know if that's the case (and if you feel let down) - Some cards combo let you win endlessly, so we decided to cap the number of waves to 25 (that's retroactive) - A bug which happens infrequently generates a level without enemies, thus letting you win without fighting. I've modified the leaderboard to detect that problem and remove points earned that way. As a consequence (cap 25 + bug detect) the leaderboard have changed a bit...

Yodark has mentioned this before. The other good thing about SoG cards is that they don't get damaged with use like MTG physical cards so you don't have to worry about treating them well, keep them in plastic wrappers, etc. Even if Counterparty disappears there is still a record in Bitcoin's op_return about your cards so they will always be there. And the way Counterparty works once you set a number of units for a certain asset that can't be modified so you are guaranteed by math if a card is rare it'll always be and cannot be counterfeit.  As players of SoG keep growing there will be more demand for cards and there are loads of collectors out there who are into trading cards so over time the value of some cards should increase. Surely EDS expects to have a good number of players once the game launches and thereafter, imagine 100,000 players (which is not such a big number for games) that want a card that has only 1000 units, or 700, or 300, or 200. What will happen with demand then? Do you think some people would want to get a full deck? How much will they be willing to pay for a Satoshi card?  The easiness on which you can trade SoG cards is also much better than physical cards, I see that as another advantage together with proving their authenticity.",False

The scenario you are suggesting is the following if I'm understanding correctly we give the BitCrystals to the publisher they do their job and they might profit for the increase of value. It's a good idea in essence and I'm sure it will work that way in several years. But in 2016 it's too early, no multimillion dollar company in the game or show-business industry with well established process will accept to be paid in a blockchain asset. Look how hard is the Bitcoin acceptation so talking about BitCrystals build on top of Bitcoin... They neither have the knowledge or the tools to integrate that in their process. It's also not very wise because a publisher might want to selloff a big bag of BitCrystals right away and have a negative effect to us and BCY holders. When Spells of Genesis is going to be a planetary hit people in the whole industry might understand that owning digital assets (decentralised trustless, transparent) is worthier than on the good old system (Centralised, Trusted and opaque) people will cry for them.  Also we are very lucky here. They accept to publish Spells of Genesis as it use to blockchain and an open exchange economy. A lot of publisher I talked to liked the game but they said they don't understand the bockchain and the managers will never accept to publish something they don't fully embrace even though it's a great project/idea    It adds to my confusion, that I have no ideas for what will/was this 15 millions BitCrystals used. If they will be efficiently used for Awareness & Promotion, then All4Games will not really need to do much but just take part of revenue.  The BitCrystals for community are used  for events. Such as the running season 4. Those BCY create a very good traction to keep people playing finding bug and improving the system. As the game release those BCY will be very helpful to keep the game popular and will be a serious advantage over all other games since playing is rewarding.",False

The game hasn't even launched yet, those BCY could be used in many different ways to setup prizes for tournaments, give rewards to users that test SoG (that is already happening), bounties, etc... There is still a long way to go for the game to improve and be complete and after that plenty of uses for these BCY. Having that reserve is necessary, as well as all4games getting their cut of revenue. As Yodark mentioned if it doesn't work, after a year things can go either way. I have confidence the team is doing the right thing with this proposal and BCY. And the fact they ask the community before they take a decision as big as this it is a +1000 for me.",False

We previously mentioned we are in discussion with All4Games, they are a new videogame branch from the television broadcast company Channel 4, one of the biggest TV network in the UK. It’s a half private and half public British firm. They reached out to us to endorse the role of publisher for Spells of Genesis.  Publishers in the gaming industry are responsible for product development and marketing, including market research and all aspects of advertising. They usually have more money and more reach than developers. They usually have big marketing budgets and/or a broad network to push the product. In our case All4Games are not committing to invest money directly in customer acquisition but will be offering their communications channels which have a lot of reach, especially to the “non-bitcoin”, mainstream gaming community. All4Games is pretty new to the game publishing business but they succeeded to have one of their games, Super Arc Lite, featured by Apple which is the holy grail of visibility.  Publishers usually play a big role in the revenue making of a game.  The terms of their participation are on a revenue share model and details are as follows for the game income and the deriving product income:  15% on net revenues from £0 - £100,000 (incl) 20% on net revenues from £100,000 - £200,000 (incl) 25% on net revenues from £200,000 and above  Taking the above in consideration, EDS (us) will have to share up to 25% of the revenue. Seen that we burn 50% of the BCY income, once we join this new deal, we will have 12.5% less burn.  We want to ask you the following question:  “Should we accept the deal and collaborate with All4Games, who will become our publisher?”  Our take on this  We recommend to vote yes for the following reasons:  Their revenue share is very reasonable, publishers usually take 30 to 50% They commit to translate the game in several languages, this will give the game a broader reach The fact that a public television network publishes a blockchain-based game will give unbelievably good press to Spells of Genesis and blockchain projects as a whole.  We have been amazed and pleased at the same time by the support received by the community and the many testers that are currently helping us out. However, for SoG to be successful we cannot rely on bitcoiners and cryptocurrency enthusiasts alone, this opportunity will allow us to grow our user base by making Spells of Genesis known to a much wider audience. We believe this will be of great benefit to us as well as our Token Sale supporters and partners.   How to vote  Your Token Sale BCY address has received an asset called “SOGVOTEPUB”. This asset will serve as a ballot paper. We have created two addresses where you can send this asset:  If you want to reply “YES” to the question stated above, please send your SOGVOTEPUB to: 1LC1q733F2NadKq2gHicLd9KNz9vtuENSj If your reply to the question above is “NO”, please send your SOGVOTEPUB to: 18X1A4pri4sRmXPJubUmeS9SWM85ivT2oM  Voting starts at 6pm on Tuesday, April 19th (CEST) and will end 48 hours later at 6pm on Thursday, April 21st (CEST).

You're right, we're a bit late on the original plan, it's because we prefer the quality, to the quick launch. So we prefer to work on the game and improve it a bit longer, but then release something we, and of course you all, will be satisfied with.  Quote That said, what about some partnership? Have you got any update or news? Are you talking about any concrete partnership?  Quote Moreover, what about some social marketing? Don't you believe it's time to push your product around?  I think it's time to male this game known, so that more and more people will wait for the final release...

The hard work of our developers during these last weeks bears its fruit! The new gameplay release is here! What's new?  NEW SERVER The major news brought by this build is our new server! Maybe you are not as excited about it as we are, but, trust me, you should Our new server is more robust and will serve us a lot in the future. We've transferred several game fonctionalities from the application to the server side. This means that all the so far known cheats, as for example playing simultaneously on several devices, are no more possible! NEW SPELLS SYSTEM Another big change, and this time you'll notice it very quickly, is a new spells system. Each character having a spell will release it at their first turn. The spell will stay on the playground, until you'll decide to trigger it by shooting it. Adding another player-depending factor means more strategy decisions during each turn. And now enemies can trigger spells too! NEW LEVELS AND MORE You will discover the animations have changed, some obstacles are more complicated and there are two new levels too!  The testing Season 4 will start later this week. We want to be sure that the server transfer does not generate any major issues, in order to avoid making any big changes during the season. We will bring you more news shortly.  Please, note that all your achievements (except your blockchain based cards, of course) will be reset again before the new season starts. Also, the leaderboard will be updated only with the beginning of the testing season.  The Android users can download the new version here, the iOS users will receive an automated notification shortly.  WARM UP TO BE READY FOR THE SEASON 4!",False

Find here the latest monthly BCY Burn Report! We will proceed to the burn and the discounts refund within a few days.   BETA TESTING SEASON 4  The next testing season - with new rewards - will come the next week! We'll bring you an updated SoG gameplay version too. Also, we want to remind you that we are awaiting the arrival of Merchants, who will replace the current card stores system (for more information see the original announcement). In order to prepare this improvement smoothly, some of the bots are being switched off. The cards remained on stock may be offered by one of the Merchants in the future. Take a chance now and get the cards which are missing in your collection!   CREDITED BITCRYSTALS DISTRIBUTION - LAST CHANCE!  A long time before even the first version of SoG has been released, we had been rewarding those who already supported us by crediting a certain amount of BCY on their SoG account. We have already distributed those credited BCY in three waves, yet some of you are still claiming their BitCrystals. We remind you that to ""withdraw"" your credited BitCrystals, you have to link your SoG account to your digital wallet! The missing XCP address is probably the reason why you still haven't get your reward.  If you were eligible to get some BitCrystals for early registration, yet you still haven't received it, verify that you have filled a valid XCP address. Please, do so before April 30th 2016, the last distribution wave will take place in the beginning of May.  Please note that any credited and not ""withdrawed"" BitCrystals can't be claimed after April 30th 2016.    Do you want to receive regular updates in your mailbox?

And BearWhale card is a perfect sample of it. As i remember BearWhale card come to swapbots right at time when crowdsale ended and everyone was full of BitCrystals. And price raised sky high by numbers of cards sold. So many including me bought few of them at expensive price. Later that was changed. I guess i can call buing few of those as a bad investment. BearWhale  emission should be reduced to 1200 cards as the others are. Other problem of cards i see, that strength of card is not perfectly correlated with its rareness and price. Lets take a look at Aji-Jaspaar , there are 1000 cards, stats are not that bad 18\3\3  price is already at 1000 Bitcrsytals ($70), but card is only a common one.

And someone looking from the outside will most likely associate this with a scam when the average price for 1Card is $130 USD based on the prices mentioned earlier.  So a deck of 4 avg. priced cards would set you back a mere $500.  I am a huge gammer and stream on twitch daily.  I don't know anyone who pays $500 for in game items or let alone for the entire game.  If the price of the ""unique"" cards were cheaper then it would be much more inviting to join.  Ok so as I was typing this message I had an idea which may or may not work.   If the unique cards could be ""split"" meaning the owner of a card would get 2 and could sell 1 based on the number of active players in the game or something like that.  This would allow early adopters to sell cards for a small profit and grow the ecosystem.  This way a ""unique"" card could cost say $5 but the ""uniqueness"" will be determined by the number of active users or something of the sort.  Obviously this need more thought but I think lower priced cards while remaining some sense or uniqueness or rarity would allow the game and ecosystem to grow beyond the crypto community.",False

Every Spells of Genesis (SoG) backer and current asset holder has helped shape the new “true ownership economy”. The results are stunning! SoG assets transactions add up to over 80% of all Counterparty transactions and some of our cards are the most valuable assets on the platform. We have sold almost 9,000 cards for a total of over 3,600,000 BitCrystals (BCY). Together we became a trendsetter for the future of digital game economies.  The exchange of Blockchain-based assets is still in its infancy and there is a lot to be explored and learned. Since the very beginning, we believed in a world where the game studio and the community are co-owning and co-building their projects. This is our vision, we are striving to turn it into reality.  The community is bringing even more value to the game with examples like sogassets.com, an unofficial but invaluable source of information for trading cards, and sogparty.com, a Counterparty wallet dedicated to SoG assets. Third-party projects are flourishing even though we are still in the game production phase.  Together we are setting the trends and we want to go even further in our exploration. Seen that a big part of the fun in a trading card game is the secondary market, we want to empower it by encouraging user-to-user exchanges and third-party digital retailers. Our second objective is to bring blockchain-based assets and transactions to mainstream users, the non-bitcoiners out there. To reach these two targets we are going to change the timing of public offers. Not having 100% of the inventory available at any one time will create more excitement during sales, while favoring a secondary market growth.  We are also creating some free assets, playable without having to pay for them. These freebies will allow people without Bitcoin or any other digital currency to get familiar with swapbots and the Decentralized Exchange (DEX). They will be rewarded with freebies allowing them to enter the blockchain ecosystem smoothly.  Furthermore we are changing the name of our stores to merchants, so the Partner Store will now be Partner Merchant, the Premium Store will be Premium Merchant, and the Public Store will be Public Merchant.  Card Types There are two types of cards in SoG: off-chain cards are those you get by summoning Gold in-game and blockchain cards are the ones offered by Merchants (former Stores). There are 4 types of blockchain cards available from different Merchants and are described below.  Public Cards Those offered first by the Partner Merchant and then, a month later, by the Public Merchant.  Premium Cards Those offered first by the Partner Merchant and then, a month later, by the Premium Merchant.  Special Cards Those offered directly by the Public Merchant without passing by the Partner Merchant first. An example of a special card is XAJIBOSS, a card released for a special occasion, available for sale only during a very limited period and offered directly to the public. To keep the special cards really exceptional, we’ve set a cap of maximum 1 special card release every 10 Public or Premium cards. We did offer special cards before but it should be considered a new type of blockchain card we offer from now on.  Free Cards Those offered directly by the Public Merchant, they won’t be sold for BitCrystals, but only for “Free Assets”, more about that in the Free Assets System section below. This is a new type of blockchain card we’re going to introduce in order make it easier for new players to enter the blockchain ecosystem. This will give them a feel of game assets ownership as well as experience in acquiring cards for free.  Merchants The Merchants are expected to arrive in Askian in the first week of April.  Partner Merchant  The Partner Merchant will keep offering Public and Premium cards for BitCrystals. As always, all the Public and Premium cards will be first available at the Partner Merchant. One month later they will then be offered by the Premium Merchant or by the Public Merchant. 80% of the total supply of each Public card and 40% of the total supply of each Premium card will be available at the Partner Merchant. Each card will be available for a week if we keep the current release rhythm, or until the next card release, or until the end of the allocated stock (if this occurs first).  Premium Merchant  The Premium Merchant will offer 40% of the total supply of the Premium cards. Those will be available one month after the card release on the Partner Merchant. Each card will be on sale for a week, then it will be replaced by another offer. If there is any stock left, it may reappear later. Some Free Assets may appear on the Premium Merchant too.  EverdreamSoft (EDS) will keep 20% of the total supply of each card. For the cards produced in partnership with another project, EDS reserves the right to allocate a reasonable amount of the card supply (out of the 20% kept by EDS) to the partner project.  Public Merchant  The Public Merchant will sell Public blockchain cards for BitCrystals and distribute Free Assets, including free cards, for other Free Assets. The Public cards will be available a month after their release on the Partner Merchant, but the exact date of availability won’t be guaranteed - it may occur at any moment starting from one month after the card release. The number of cards available for sale will be limited for each sale. All items will be sold using flash sales, lasting a few hours or days. This should also make sales more exciting.  Free Assets System The purpose of a Free Asset is to be exchanged for another Free Asset, or for a free blockchain card. Free Assets and free blockchain cards won’t be sold or bought with BCY or any other cryptocurrency. Free Assets will be represented by different minerals such as coal, tin, copper or iron and each asset will have three stages (e.g. iron1, iron2, iron3). You will be able to exchange with the Merchant a set amount of iron1 for iron2, iron2 for iron3, and finally a certain amount of iron3 for a free blockchain card.  There are several ways to get a Free Asset. The different minerals can be acquired as rewards while playing, for a specific achievement and/or the leaderboard rank. You can also get them because you own another blockchain asset in your wallet. In this case, your mineral asset will be “generated” by the other asset in your wallet which may be a free asset, or any other blockchain asset (e.g. you could get one copper1 for each SARUTOBICARD, or for each coal1 you have).   Future This new model is an experiment we want to try out but it may be changed in the future depending on community feedback. Thanks to your support and enthusiasm we are constantly improving the distribution model. Together, we are creating the most entertaining use of the blockchain that will inspire game creators for the next decade.",False

So the player buys $10 worth of a card pack, of which $3 go to Apple (or Google Playstore presumably) and the other $7 go to EDS. EDS in turn uses half of that, $3.50, to buy BITCRYSTALS from the open market which they then send to be burned in exchange for the card pack they then send to the player. So open market would imply, they go to an exchange or shapeshift and post a buy order for Bitcrystals presumably after having turned the cash into bitcoin first on some bitcoin exchange or by using a service like glidera, or they offer $3.50 worth of BTC or other counterparty tokens like XCP for sale on a swapbot in exchange for Bitcrystals. Swapbots have the advantage of being able to peg the price you offer to a fixed USD value. Anyone who has Bitcrystals they want to sell can do so using the aforementioned EDS swapbot. I think the latter is more likely to be implemented in the end but someone like @hnin would be better able to answer that question. I assume EDS would continually run such a swapbot with an attractive exchange rate to always have enough Bitcrystals on hand in order to be able to dispense the card packs quickly without delay.",False

Just to complete: every month we burn BitCrystals worth of 50% of our revenue (no matter which currency we recieved, the amount to be burnt is then calculated in BCY, according to the rate at the moment of the burn). As the cards are sold for BitCrystals, we receive back, by small amounts, those sold during the Token Sale (or later, via our swapbot). As long as we keep generate the most of our incomes in BCY, we will have enough of them to burn. If the most of it comes from the purchases via stores (therefore in USD or other fiat currency), we will need to buy BitCrystals to burn them. In the two cases, the total supply of BCY will keep decreasing.  Market: yes, there's a BitCrystals market, they can be both sold or bought for example on DEX or Poloniex, or bought from our BitCrystals swapbot (where we re-sale the other 50% of our monthly incomes, which represent our actual revenue).

A lot of activity in the game these days! We are happy to see such a great number of motivated and devoted players! Thanks to the time you are spending on testing the latest SoG version, you've discovered and reported us lots of bugs and flaws. This is essential for the future development of the game and it helps us enormously!  Nevertheless, since some players keep exploiting these flaws, while others don't, we are constrained to slightly modify the rules for the Season 3. More in details, we have calculated and fixed a maximum number of waves cleared, reachable all along the duration of this season. The maximum amount of waves we'll count for points is 7 000 waves cleared, between March 1st and March 24th. For all those having reached more than 7 000 waves, only 7 000 will be taken into account. For the same reason, we have to cancel the top 10 bonus reward too. At the end of the Season 3, a common pot of BitCrystals worth of 1 500 USD will be distributed, accordingly to the number of waves cleared.  Yet we are working on a more robust and secure backend to be able to identify the cheaters, who'll be removed from the ranking the next testing season.

Slack is not a chat integrated into the game, therefore you don't access it with your SoG username, just put in your e-mail and click on ""get my invite"".  Since we decided to give rewards for reporting new bugs, starting the next season, we'll use a forum, dedicated to this.

We'll publish an information about how to access this forum in due time.  Regarding the number of waves: the waves cleared in the ""hidden"" level ""Fight against the masters"" were reset, since the level was not supposed to appear (it was created in a test mode and appeared only because of a Unity bug, which has now been fixed).

Ofcourse more exchanges is better, but things are not taht bad if you are being traded on D exchange!  That's not true, language is a big barrier. Hundreds of Millions of Chinese People do not use poloniex because of language and alphabet.  It's not that easy to get on a Chinese exchange IMHO, also the exchange needs to support Counterparty assets and I don't think there is any at the moment, correct me if I'm wrong. So the potential exchange will have to integrate Counterparty first, then maybe BCY... A bit of work before we even start. Best way to help would be if anyone knows a Chinese exchange that already supports XCP assets then, as a community, we can submit requests to support BCY. I'm well up for it!  The other thing is the game needs to be promoted in China with articles about it, also it will have to be translated to Chinese to make it easy for users to actually play it. So ""Marketing"" in China is only part of the problem, the cost of doing that when the game has not even been officially released, needs to be evaluated by the team.  I'm sure the team has thought about which are the best markets to support initially with the available financial resources they have. I'm aware they are well known in the Japanese market since Moonga and it continues to be popular with many articles about SoG on Crypto Currency Magazine together with card partnerships.  The Chinese, again in my opinion, look into projects carefully and before they actually buy certain coins they need to see value. As a game there is plenty of value in SoG with its original use of blockchain tech, but will that be sufficient to attract Chinese speculators or game fans? And how many of these Chinese cryptocurrency speculators are actually gamers? Market research is a must here.  EDS is already doing a great marketing job in current markets, I have seen dozens of articles about SoG since I started following the project back in early 2015. I have no complaints about marketing and personally I believe the team should concentrate on making the game fun to play and incentivize new users (non-bitcoiners) to give it a go. With a larger user base there will be more BCY trading/speculation, doesn't matter where the users are.  China could help but I don't think it's fundamental to the success of the game, nor increased usage of BCY. Poloniex is the best exchange out there with top volumes for many coins. Would be nice to hear what the team thoughts are on getting in the Chinese market, I've seen this being asked several times on this thread. Maybe they are working on this already?",False

The total amount of BCY found in this report is higher than it was for the previous month, which is a bit unexpected, because we released one card less this month. People have noticed that the reports from the end of 2015 were showing  significantly more BitCrystals to be burnt. Some of you were watching it with a raising anxiety. Personally, I’m far from being concerned about this issue. BitCrystals we receive are, of course, our main source of revenue so our goal is to maximise it to sustain the game operations. But in the beginning of this year we released less cards than during the fall  2015 and we also did less flash sales and special offers. The reason for all that is we are putting more energy in two, at this moment more important things:  - The gameplay itself (the product) - The asset platform  The gameplay  The Sells of Genesis project has two main pillars: the development and the marketing/sales forces. The role of our developers is to implement game features and to ensure the release of the final product, while the role of the marketing and sales forces is to gain the project more visibility, to manage the community and to drive sales. Q4 2015 the SoG Beta didn’t exist yet, so our developers were busy building it, while our marketing team was working on creating hype and selling cards. In the beginning of this year, I’ve decided to allocate more of our marketing resources on the community management side. Since the first version of the Beta has been released, we are heavily testing the game and organizing contests to reward players. Right now, nothing to generate revenue is implemented in the game. There’s no way to purchase cards in app or to monetise by advertisement. The main reason for this is we are not pushing hard to make money out of the game immediately. Rather than this, we are focusing on making it great, keeping people involved and, most importantly, on setting up the basis of a system allowing mainstream users to manage a Bitcoin wallet in a very simple way.  The asset platform  At the moment, EverdreamSoft is putting a considerable amount of effort in creating the asset platform. Our goal is to provide mainstream users with a tool to purchase and trade cards. We aim to give them possibility of using a digital wallet, which would be tolerant to password and data loss, while still giving them the full ownership of their private keys. Once we have the perfect wallet solution, i.e. simple to use, secure and flexible, we are going to implement it directly in Spells of Genesis and moreover, to open this solution to third parties games or products. And to focus our efforts more on content sales.",False

I know in old version i knew how to do it. Now i am not sire. During battle when is turn for this card we click on it and then only press OK?  So once we click on it, we cant change our mind and not trigger spell?  Or, ....?",False

Right now, Health & Attack alternatively increase when leveling up. But it'll probably change a bit.  2. There are different type of Spells. Some are permanent, and others are triggered when it's the character's turn to shoot. In any case they are not triggered by the player any longer, we found that it was not fitting well in the game.",False

I'm also waiting for mine and will wait patiently, not the team's fault.  However hnin has already answered the question here:  Quote from: hnin on March 04, 2016, 03:37:24 PM Quote from: jeffanthony on March 04, 2016, 02:52:40 PM No word on why Everdreamsoft still hasn't sent Bitcrystals for phase 2 testing? The announcement stating it ""was sent"" was 3 days ago. How do you define ""sent?"" If you don't attach enough Bitcoin transaction fees they are in no sense of the word ""sent."" The rewards were sent, together with the required BTC fee, to an automated distributor address, which should dispatch the right amount to each address. The BCY are no longer in our hands, therefore we can't do anything (e.g. re-sent or anything else). Blockchain transactions encountered several issues these days, and it is the reason why the reception is delayed. There's no other solution than patience.",False

ARE YOU READY?  As announced, with the end of February, the Beta Testing Season 2 is over, too. During these 10 days, over 73 000 waves have been cleared and more than 430 cards evolved until the quad fused stage!  All players whose accounts were created before February 24th, and who have entered their XCP address, were eligible to get rewards during the last season. They received points according to their quad fused cards and then those points were converted in BitCrystals, using the coefficient 10. Those have just been sent.  WHEN ONE THING ENDS, ANOTHER ONE BEGINS! HERE'S THE SEASON 3!  All the non-blockchain cards, as well as the in-game currencies are being reset and an UPDATED BETA VERSION is being released! What's new? Lot of items from your ""wish list"" we have received through the feedback form or the slack channel, are there: We have the first version of a multiplayer! When choosing this option, you'll play against a random player's deck, completed with some other random cards. Supplementary confirmation when crystallizing your cards has been added. From now on, you have the possibility of crystallizing several cards at once. By clicking on the ""crystallize"" button, situated on the Team screen, all your level-one unfused common cards will be crystallized. Two brand new levels have been added. The network usage has dramatically decreased, you can leave a level whenever you want (""exit"" button), or you can switch the music off. You can access the leaderboard directly from the main game screen (the map of Askian), as well as the beta-testing slack channel (by clicking on the ""feedback"" button), where you can meet our dev team.  SEASON 3 RULES The Beta Testing Season 3 will start at the moment when all your offchain cards and in-game currencies are reset. This will happen during this Thursday. We are waiting for the iOS version approval and will reset it once everyone, no matter on which platform, can access the new version. The Season 3 will last until March 24th. During this season, you have to clear as many waves as you can (as for the first season), and there'll be a special bonus for those who end up in the top ten at end the end of the season.  IMPORTANT: Please, remember that you have to fill in your Counterparty address! Otherwise you can't receive your reward. If you haven't linked your SOG account to your Counterparty address before the end of the season, you can't claim your reward later.

It might take a little while before you have them though.  5, 9, 7 & 10) Yep, that's in the pipe too!  We already have the UI design for that. It will be much more streamlined.  6) Sounds is kind of a let down at the moment, we'll put more effort on it later on as we already have so much to do that we feel is more urgent.  7) Good idea!

First of all, a huge thank you for your time spent on testing the Beta! It helps us enormously to discover all the bugs and to progress towards the final release!  For any ""technical"" terms used here, there's our brand new SoG Gameplay and Cards Guide. Please, read it first, before asking any questions.  SEASON 2 REWARDS - RULES  For each ""quad fused"" card (see our guide for ""quad fused"" explanation), no matter at which level, you will receive a certain number of points (see the list below). These points will then be converted into BitCrystals. Each of the cards listed below counts only once (i.e. even though you have 6x Devastating Minotaur, it will count only once. Keep one Devastating Minotaur, crystallize the others and try to have for example a Royal Deer instead). We were forced to introduce this constraint due to the bug allowing multiple card fusions. You will only have points for the cards being in your account at the end of the Season 2 (If you had a Devastating Minotaur at a certain moment this week, but you've crystallized it later, before the end of this season, you won't get any points for it). Only accounts created before today, i.e. Wednesday, February 24th are eligible to get points for the Season 2. The accounts created later will be eligible for the next season rewards.  QUAD FUSED CARDS&POINTS Devastating Minotaur: 1 point Royal Deer: 1 point Weanara Assassin: 1 points Viscula Mantis: 1 point Centaur Archer: 3 points Feodora, Princess of Spring: 3 points Ice Unicorn: 3 points Warrior Luminatis: 10 points Warrior Obscuras: 10 points Slashing Crirawin: 20 points",False

On the web version allow people to mouse hover over the orb/enemy to view how many hit points it takes to kill them and how much health they have. On the mobile version allow us to view stats by pressing and holding on an orb/enemy to view the stats.  New barrier idea. There are currently barriers that you can bounce off as well as break.

I don't want to post them publicly yet, but so far the people at Spells of Genesis have not told me where to report bugs. Any help would be great. I have found 4 so far, and two of them can be pretty big.  I also have a list of suggestions.  Suggestions:  1. There needs to be some type of leader board. Maybe most wins in a region, or most gold collected. I noticed when you defeat the enemy faster you can get extra/more crystals. Maybe have a leader board for the most crystals collected per node/city/location. This will get people coming back to try and beat other people’s scores. Maybe at the end of the week, month or other time period, whoever has the highest score gets a free rare, epic or legendary card, or more coins/crystals/gems.  2. Shouldn’t be able to play bonus round more than a couple times, this might just be open for better.  3. I was playing ""Let There Be Lite"" and at the end of the match it is kind of boring just waiting for all the 69 coins to be collected. Maybe give the option to tap the screen and have them all collect automatically or collect faster.  4. Perhaps have a way for people to earn more hearts, or a way to shorten the timer on hearts. Maybe by a potion purchase or by beating certain levels.  5. Options to arrange and sort cards, alphabetically, by power, by level, by element, etc.  6. Turn sound on and off  7. Make a confirm on Crystallization. I accidentally crystallized an awesome card. I sure many other people will, to in the future.  8. Daily rewards for playing everyday. ie, 5 coins the first day, 10 the next, by the 10th day some crystals, maybe a card thrown in every so often.  9. Suggested by l8nit3 ""I would love an option for multiple selection of common cards for crystalization (or possibly an alert that asks if you want to crystalize 'all of this type')""  10. Suggested by l8nit3 ""Also, not a big thing, but I think it would be useful to have page numbers on the team page, easier to go back to the same spot when leveling up""",False

I think that is not possible to implement marketing action without a marketing strategy, a strategy that has to exist just today: if you act like you are saying, you'll find at the day of launch with a good (I hope) game and you will be literally still for several days. The game is here!!! But there will be no listening, few of us apart. I mean, if you want to open a shop, you will work to be perfect for the day you'll open, but in the meantime you'll tell you're opening, you'll try in every way to get people informed of your first day. Otherwise, you will open the shop and you'll be alone with your girlfriend, your parents and you best friend. And in the best case you will have days to wait for customers to come: days in which you will pay monthly rent, utility bills, and so on. Not a good strategy at all, for my opinion.  For the second matter (only two exchange), as we are today a newcomer who wants to buy Bitcrystals has to face: 1) limited access to the criptocoin, just because he will have only two potential exchange 2) a book empty, without liquidity, because nobody is here  Sorry my dear, I hope the best for the game, for devs and for my Bitcrystals too, and this is the reason I think that we have to work strongly on a good exposure today.

Discussions on the future tech road map, ethereum, dapps, how is a card owned today going to be an eternal asset to the EDS gaming ecosystem, regardless of game popularity coming and going, would be nice to hear about how a card will survive decades with its value.  The bottom line is that you would update a wiki type page on business plan and product development ever few weeks, addressing these types of issues, that would be very helpful.",False

Also you may be interested in the following article:  http://counterparty.io/news/counterparty-recreates-ethereums-smart-contract-platform-on-bitcoin/  In the article we find this paragraph: ""With Counterparty Contracts, users may write Turing Complete smart contracts into the Bitcoin blockchain and execute their code on all Counterparty nodes. We’ve ported Ethereum’s language and virtual machine over to the Counterparty platform, using the pyethereum codebase. The result is hosted on GitHub and open for public testing. Today, you can take Turing Complete Ethereum code, or write your own, and run it on Bitcoin with Counterparty. Anything that one could ever do with Ethereum, one can now do with Bitcoin and Counterparty...""  So as you can see, the groundwork has already been laid for cross-pollination between the two platforms.  On the other hand, I disagree with your statement about counterparty not having a lot of momentum. Granted, there is a lot of hype around the ethereum platform (though it is not even really finished or proven to be secure yet) while counterparty tends to work quietly in the background, didn´t do a multi-million dollar crowdsale or concentrate much on PR. However, besides SoG, I´d like to mention the following highly promissing counterparty projects:  1) Storj decentralized client-side encrypted cloud storage network  http://storj.io/ and http://driveshare.org/dataserv.html - already in its second round of beta testing with around 1000 farmers contributing 3 Pb of storage, and about to start the third round of testing shortly.  2) http://getgems.org/ encrypted messaging app that rewards its users for using the app with GEMZ token airdrops which in turn can be used to purchase gift cards from Starbucks, iTunes, Amazon and others or be traded on altcoin exchanges like poloniex.com.  3) http://foldingcoin.net/ FoldingCoin is a registered non-for-profit that that distributes tokens called FLDC to reward participants of the global Folding@home network (a Stanford University project) which lets people contribute their unused CPU and GPU power to help find cures to diseases like Alzheimer, Parkinson etc.  4) http://scotcoin.org/ The Scotcoin Project was created with the intent to serve as the Scottish citizens´ money supply to be the first official decentralized currency of a country. Scotcoin has recently been in the news for being accepted to buy beer in a Glasgow pub, and is actively traded on the Bittrex altcoin exchange.  Counterparty is currently running its DEVPARTY contest to attract new applications, where 15 innovative projects are competing to win 9500 XCP in prizes.",False

Actual card selling (without official game e no marketing activities)  is going down nearly to zero revenue month by month.  That's the elephant in the room.  And in my opinion the main problem is that right now we do not have a marketing strategy and frankly I don't see any direction on the cards issued.  Is there any story here?

I mean: is it possible to make it possible to trade Bitcrystal on a Chinese exchange? It would be FONDAMENTAL, in my humble opinion...

I am not concerned about where we are now because the game isn't selling yet. Also, the CEO has delivered a successful card game already, so ostensibly he is then creating card game 2.0 with features and game play he knows will excite his user base.... I hope.  I do agree that it would be great to hear more about the game marketing prep for launch. Why is this game going to be a great follow up to the previous card game. More info on how it will drive the eco system of bcy and cards purchases.  I also think that with BCY integrated there are endless opportunities.

Who buys coins, players or people that think the game is going to take off or both? Actually When the game will take off owning coin and asset is a way to pre purchase in app purchases as a discounted price  Quote 2. How is counterparty involved if at all? I don't know if you know how counterparty works but basically it's a way of storing digital assets (like games cards, levels or BCY...) on the bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty offers a good set of tools that are not available on Ethereum yet such as decentralised exachange and SPV wallet allowing mobile light wallet, a must for any newcomer.  Quote 3. If the games that integrate BCY become very popular, then will the coin because of how it works with the game become more valuable? BCY is deflationary each time someone purchase for example a card on SOG half of it is burned. Also cards have a limited supply meaning they will get more valuable if the demand for them are increasing by newcomers who want them.   Quote 4. Is this games usage tied to txns of BCY? In other words, can you track usage of  Spells of Genesis in an accurate way that is validated by the coin's blockchain? Yes Every blockchain card can be audited on the blockchain, insuance, transactions etc.  Note ""the coin's blockchain"" is the bitcoin blockchain it works like colored coin if you are familiar with it. Meaning a Bitcrystals tixid or a card tixid is a bitcoin blockchain transaction tix https://counterpartychain.io/transaction/433b88b3721295af0e31e76f3b2e4ac38f5b41bfea5b35a413455b19eb30d9e6 and if you look at the same tix on blockchain.info https://blockchain.info/tx/433b88b3721295af0e31e76f3b2e4ac38f5b41bfea5b35a413455b19eb30d9e6 https://counterpartychain.io/  Quote 5. How can anyone tell how many updates this coin gets to its software compared to other coins? Even counterparty might evolve and since it's based on bitcoin every change on CP and BTC is affecting BitCrystals as well, but basically right now we have everything we need being able to issue new card on the blockchain and allowing people to freely trade. Thing that need improvement are the tools automated selling bots, wallets UIX (user experience) etc. Quote 6. Are all cards, just digital cards, no physical cards? Right now they are only digital Quote 7. Your digital card is in essence ownership of a coin in another chain, whose ownership is secured by your BCY digital asset? or something like that?

I think it will be both a revenue stream, will help immensely with communication and interest level, and could be an additional collectors item as well. My suggestion is that the card have a printable square for QR code that has proof of ownership.  I spent a lot of time on the poloniex chat room trying my best to answer lots of basic questions about BCY, SOG, and EDS  Not sure if you work for EDS but here are some of the common themes and not so common ideas:  1. The counterparty, bcy bitcoin, blockchain, relationship is confusing to me and most people. I seem to get most of it now, but this was a barrier to entry for me and others. I think SOG will do well to provide services that completely hide the crypto complexity. I see a new wallet came out specifically for SOG, which is awesome the team is already on this. 2. 3. A common response is ""so there is no physical card???"", see my comment above. While not necessary, a physical card that has my QR code on it would be cool. I am curious, it seems there is a permanent colored coin marker for each coin somewhere in counterparty techno universe, so regardless of how many time a coin is sold, there is always the same color coin QR code marker? If so my physical card could be forever linked to the digital asset???, which would be way cool and would likely increase immensely the value of my card I own. Of course I would want to own the physical card AND the digital one. 4. There is an idea on the chat room that the game that is coming out has to be successful for BCY and cards to have value. While this intuitively makes sense, it is probably not exactly correct. Especially, if you can tie the coin to a physical card, because then it builds on its secondary value which is a collectible. 5. Also, the cards are inputs to game play, whether it is your current mobile game or an actual card game, there could be many games that are built on top of the card attributes. Are there any such plans for additional games built on top of the card attributes? 6. It seems the EDS revenue model is to make money in the appstore or android store. For in game purchases EDS is buying 50% back of BCY at market prices? Is there a bot on Poloniex testing this right now. I see odd behavior on Poloniex that could be a test of this buyback feature. 7. Rather than burn them, I think you should do a quarterly dividend and disperse them to addresses with x amount of BCY. Maybe this could be a long-term strategy, I think eventually burning them creates too much deflation, too few coins. 8. If SOG has millions of players isn't the satoshi card going to be too rare with only 1000.... Maybe this is how other card games work. 9. Someone asked if they can play the game and earn bitcoin... that would be a cool marketing feature if you could use shapeshift or something and convert in game credits to bitcoin. People want bitcoin not just bcy",False

Also, the cards are inputs to game play, whether it is your current mobile game or an actual card game, there could be many games that are built on top of the card attributes. Are there any such plans for additional games built on top of the card attributes?  Some of the SoG cards are already playable in EverdreamSoft´s previous trading cards game, Moonga. More cards are being integrated as time goes on. This is a way to explore how blockchain based game assets can be used on multiple game platforms and also get the previous user base of Moonga players involved in using blockchain based digital assets and to hopefully onboard some of them to Spells of Genesis. Find out more about Moonga at http://www.moonga.com/ All the SoG blockchain based digital game assets can be freely traded outside the game and also, other game devs can choose to integrate these into their own games if they want. The www.FreeMyVunk.com movement is promoting this concept of digital game asset sharing between different games. I think SoG is also part of this reVUNKolution in a way even though their game assets are issued on Counterparty and not the Ethereum platform used by FreeMyVunk.   6. It seems the EDS revenue model is to make money in the appstore or android store. For in game purchases EDS is buying 50% back of BCY at market prices? Is there a bot on Poloniex testing this right now. I see odd behavior on Poloniex that could be a test of this buyback feature.  Currently, SoG runs a Bitcrystals swapbot where they put some of the BCY earned from cardsales back up for sale to the public.  https://swapbot.tokenly.com/bot/spellsofgenesis/bitcrystals#choose  I think the buyback feature you are referring to will be implemented later on in the final release, right now players can not yet purchase blockchain based cards from inside the beta version of SoG. Buying cards for fiat is not yet implemented in the game. So I doubt that EDS would have any reason at this point to be buying BCY on Poloniex. But I guess SoG staff could better answer this question.   8. If SOG has millions of players isn't the satoshi card going to be too rare with only 1000.... Maybe this is how other card games work.  There are actually only less than 200 SATOSHICARDs in existence   Originally, 1000 were issued but of those, EDS burned 800 leaving only 200 in circulation, but then one SATOSHICARD holder decided to send a small fraction of one card to the burn address, so they made that card which is missing a piece unplayable in the game.   So yes, SATOSHICARD will be a very rare game asset indeed!    9. Someone asked if they can play the game and earn bitcoin... that would be a cool marketing feature if you could use shapeshift or something and convert in game credits to bitcoin. People want bitcoin not just bcy  BCY is already listed on shapeshift so you can turn them back into bitcoins if you want. Also the shapeshift feature already integrated into Bitcrystals Box Chrome extension allows people to shift BCY to BTC and back (as well as turn other altcoins into BCY)",False

We have a great news for all our supporters: the SoG Beta has just been released! You can test a web version or a mobile app for android and iOS. The web version and android app are available from your profile on our website. The access to the iOS version will be given automatically to all the Token Sale backers and upon request for the others.    WHAT'S NEW?  The latest release brings you several new features: Mobile app, new User Interface (just a foretaste for the moment, it will be more polished and developed in the final release), cards leveling up and fusing system, off-chain and blockchain cards and several in-game currencies you are rewarded with.  If you still have any difficulties or doubts regarding how to create a digital wallet or how to bind it to your game account, check our Step by Step Tutorial.   GAMEPLAY   Levels are placed at the map of Askian to show you your progress in the game. On the top you can see the amount of different in-game currencies you own: ""Gold"", ""Elemental Crystals"" and ""Gems"" and the level of your Stamina just below. The menu is placed on the bottom: ""Play"" to access the game directly, ""Team"" to view, fuse and level up your cards or recompose your deck adn ""Summon"" to obtain new cards.   CARDS   Your deck may contain different types of cards, with different strength level, depending on their rarity: ""Common"" (wood), ""Rare"" (stone), ""Epic"" (marble) or ""Legendary"" (gold).     When you complete a level, you earn ""Gold"" which you can use to buy, ""summon"", a new random card. In the final version, you'll be able to purchase ""Gems"" through your app store and then use them to buy a random rare, epic or legendary card.  EVOLUTION   You can sell, ""crystallize"", your spare cards to receive ""Elemental Crystals"". Those are obtained when destroying an enemy too. By spending ""Elemental Crystals"" you can upgrade your cards to make them stronger. When a card reaches its maximum level, you can fuse it with an exact copy of that card, and then upgrade the new card again. The final evolution of a card can be blockchainized and then traded outside the game, on the blockchain.

But I'm sorry to say that EDS currently is not doing any valuable marketing job- Twitter followers are nearly stable, likes on the 2 FB pages (english and Japan) are ridiculous, the slack channel is nearly death.  In this situation (no game, no marketing) is perfectly normal that cards do not sell quite well.  Marketing is equally important than the product, I think the SoG need Hype now.

I have a very important topic I want to discuss with you  We've been approached by Channel 4, a very well known TV channel in UK. They liked spells of Genesis and they might open the discussion for a publishing deal. Just to make it clear - they liked the game itself and they are probably unaware of the whole blockchain thing. It's just a beginning of discussion with them.  The role of a publisher is to provide marketing and visibility for the game studio. Making a great game is one thing, having people downloading it even if it’s a great game, it’s another challenge. Usually the game studio provides the creative input and the publisher makes sure the game is sustainable and makes money. A game can also be self-published but in that case the game studio requires solid marketing people, people who are emotionally not involved in the creative process but are on hard numbers. A good balance of both is required to have a great success. Having a publisher implies a cost in the revenue share, but it’s worthy if the publisher invests in customer acquisition (marketing) and is able to make his job and drive revenues. Choosing the good publisher is critical, because he needs to be able to drive downloads to justify his cut. Big publishers usually are masters as analysing how much cost to acquire a new customer and how much revenue to expect from it.  So Channel 4 is a big name in UK, but a small publisher. Their cut is also very reasonable (confidential for the moment)  Basically their offer is to promote Spells of Genesis trough their community platform, which has a good amount of users. It could definitely give a boost to the game, but since it’s mostly UK based, does it justify to give a cut to the worldwide sales ? They say they have good relation with Apple and Google UK (note all publishers say that) and that way the game could be pushed on the front door of the stores giving a lot of visibility and downloads. According to them, having a good visibility in UK store usually might lead to acquire a good visibility in other European countries and US too.  Advantages of working with channel 4:  - Small cut on the revenue, comparing to other publishers - Reach towards their content channels with several millions users - They are looking for new content, so it might be relatively easy to talk with them  Disadvantages:  - New to the games field, their ability to successfully promote the product still has to be proven - Reach limited mostly to UK (could snowball but still to be proven)  Since Spells of Genesis is also YOUR game, I’m asking you for your feedback before we go any deeper in the discussion. Remember this is only the beginning of our discussion, no deal will be signed before discussing further all the implications of such a deal. My question here is more this: Should we start discussing with them, knowing the fact it’s an investment in time? I’m listening to your thought.  You can find more information about all4games on their website  http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/channel-4-to-launch-new-all-4-games-publishing-arm-in-scotland  http://www.all4games.co.uk/",False

You will get some good push on their channels and SoG really needs users outside of the Bitcoin space. Also they may need to understand Bitcoin, BCY and what the cards mean for players. They could pitch it as a very innovative take on gaming. However they may also get scared of it, so good to get to talk about it early and get feedback from them.  Mainstream exposure could do well for SoG. In my humble opinion.",False

Though they are new to publishing, they are a global, recognized entity with likely some very good contacts. If you're saying the cut is small then I say it's justified.

Even though the next milestone is scheduled for February 2016, we're constantly working on the game play and we keep adding new features to improve your game experience. The latest game play update brings you several changes.   The bonus system turns into the spells system!  In order to have more variety among cards, and more strategic options for the player, we introduced the spells system. Instead of leaving a bonus at the end of the shot, each card now has a spell it can cast once per match. The spells vary a lot. A spell is activated by tapping on the character's portrait at the bottom of the screen. A spell can, for example, destroy the nearest enemy, or heal oneself and allies.  Map of Askian replaces the chapter system   Instead of being organized into chapters, the levels are now located on the map of Askian. Levels are being unlocked one by one, as you progress through Askian.  You are rewarded with in-game currencies  Every time you destroy an enemy, you can get a certain amount of Elemental Crystals, one of the newly introduced in-game currencies. The total amount of Elemental Crystals for each level is defined in advance. When you win a level, you will be rewarded in Gold, which is another in-game currency.  Please note that the current system is just a foretaste, since the in-game currencies system will evolve a lot in the future, as well as the other game components.  Three-stages animation  Instead of reloading the three level stages every time, your characters will now hover over to the next stage, which is placed over the previous one.  Shaban and Olivier will explain and show you more!    PLAY NOW  AND HAVE FUN!",False

I'm sorry you feel this way. We are trying to improve the game constantly and our latest update contains not only a map, but much more. We have introduced the new ""spell system"", which brings more strategy and diversity into the game play. Each card has a different spell, so combining them allows to to get another deck every time you play. And this is still just a foretaste of new updates we'll bring you soon. To know more about what we're preparing in the future, you can watch Shaban's video HERE.",False

While one part of pour team is working on the game development, another one is producing and offering you new cards. The difference is just that one activity is more visible than the other one. We've just updated the Early Beta and, personally, I think that the new spell system is a great news! We are working on the mobile app (hopefully available very soon) and the next Milestone is approaching too. We hope to show you that we are constantly working on the game play, while communicating you every update or change we made. Nevertheless, develop a fully featured game takes some time and while waiting for it, we're bringing you new cards. As you can see, every game update offers more and more possibilities of how to exploit the full potential of these cards.  To know more about what we're planning to bring you in the future, you can listen to Shaban's speech HERE.",False

It's true the cards actually don't disclose exactly their effect. But you can by the way look at https://sogassets.com/ you have the exact power the cards actually have in SOG. If we don't disclose the capacity in the announcement it's for 2 reasons  1. The cards are or will be playable in two different game (SOG and Moonga) and even more in the future. We will open the ability for people to use the assets and the image in their own game. Having that in mind the true value of card is the sum of their use the different games. So in the annoucement should we show Moonga ability of SOG ?  In that case it's really their scarcity that define their value. A card that exist in 200 pieces is more rare by essence and more powerful than a card distributed in 20'000 pieces.  example of a card announcement and in Moonga     2. We define capacity and value for SOG. But the game is still in progress and we might change and wipe all capacity as we progress and balance the game. So we don't want to market a card as extremely powerful and have it buffed later on.  Overall what I find very interesting personally with those is comparing to other digital game is the asset is not about it's single use in only one game. Since it's blockchain the asset can be used for anything it's value comes from its essence as well the image and what it represents. The will be alive as long as bitcoin blockchain is alive. I hope in 100 years SOG will not be used anymore of course but the blockchain cards will be still there and representing a part of the genesis of technology. Those cards like satoshi, doge, battle for blocksize... will still be there as a witness of the incredible journey blockchain was going trough at the very beginning and even being used in future games or products.",False

Case in point, the last card that came out is being sold on the open market at less than 500 BCY which is less than 12 USD at current exchange rates. This is not the only card that has been sold at this price. Apparently there are plenty of other gamers happy to buy their blockchain-based cards for the upcoming Spells of Genesis game, knowing that there is complete certainty that EverdreamSoft will never be able to issue more than the initial limited number of cards, so with time their value will certainly appreciate and cards can freely be resold to other gamers in case someone decides they don´t want a specific card anymore. The more expensive cards are the ones that are the most scarce, and the ones that have the most powers in the game. Market demand and supply determine the price people are willing to pay for these cards. I am sure mainstream gamers will soon discover the advantages of this novel approach where you can be the true owner of your game items and have complete control of them without any interference from anyone.  Also I find it unrealistic to demand that the developers should already have an android version available, when the intial tokensale was just a few months ago. I myself find the pace of development is meeting expectations and right on schedule as promised in the terms of the tokensale.",False

People are already using them in moonga tourneys. So not entirely useless as you claim, as all you would have to do is link your counterwallet address to moonga/SoG and install moonga on your phone or enter the SoG beta on your browser. As I said previously, if you don´t want a card anymore, you can always sell it to another person. Can you legally do that with other mobile games? BTW you did complain that the android game is not yet available: ""Game still in beta, no android version""",False

From the BCY we receive we burn half and the other half is our operational revenue. Of course we need revenue to operate the game (otherwise we don't have any incentive to operate the game bring people in, retain them and sell content) With a healthy game economy more and more BCY will be burned so the more BCY we sell more burn occur and the more scarce and valuable are the BitCrystals",False

Customizing personal card decks can be done in a nearly unlimited amount of ways, allowing players to mix and match very powerful and potent combinations.  So in April 2016, we will have 150 blocksize card. Let's do an hypothesis:  1) The mean free issuance will be 600pcs for every card (accounting card already sold)   600x150 : 90.000 cards Now the total supply of BCY is about 43.500.000 that is a maximum spending power of 87.000.000bcy (because the half of the revenue stream will be burned)  So the maximum median price for every card till April 2016 is: 87.000.000 / 90.000 =  966bcy  That's the theory.

SOG STORES There are three types of Stores, all of them are now swapbot-based. Partner Store Premium Store Public Store  PARTNER STORE Access to the Partner Store is guaranteed for Token Sale contributors having reached the Partner rank. They have the lifetime membership. In the future, it will be possible to reach the Partner rank temporary, the conditions will be set up and announced in time. During a transition period, while implementing the Partner Store on swapbot, until the second week of December, we will be releasing one card a week for Partners only. Afterwards, there’ll be two cards a week and all new cards will systematically be released at the Partner Store first. The cards offered at the Partner Store are available during a month. After this period, cards from the Partner Store may go to the Premium Store, or to the Public one.  PREMIUM STORE The Premium Store is accessible to the Token Sale contributors, from the Player Silver rank higher. As for the Partner Store, it will be possible to get the access temporarily. Some cards will go from the Partner Store to the Premium Store and they’ll never hit the Public Store. Premium Store hold specific cards that large public cannot access. You can identify the Premium Store easily thanks to this icon, placed on the top of the swapbot. New cards will come to the Premium Store one month after their release at the Partner Store. The first cards we will offer you at the Premium Store will be the RIPPLECARD and the BLOCKSIZECD, on Tuesday, November 17th. The time and all details will follow.    PUBLIC STORE One card a week will be released at the Public Store. Until the beginning of December, these will be new cards, after the end of the transition period, those will be cards issued previously at the Partner Store. You can identify the cards going from Partner Store to the Public Store thanks to the icon below.     DISCOUNTS As promised, several discounts will be applied to your purchases, according to your Partner/Player rank.  Discounts applied at the Partner and the Premium Store are Partner Gold: 5% off Partner Platinum: 10% off Partner Black: 15% As for today, we don't have the discount program implemented yet. At the end of each month, we will summarize your purchases, calculate your discount and refund you the difference between the price you paid and you were supposed to pay, regarding your rank’s discount. The discounts program for the Premium Store will start in December 2015.  Discounts applied at the Public Store will be Player Gold: 5% off Player Platinum and higher: 10%   IMPORTANT:When purchasing a card from a shop with a restricted access (Partner or Premium), or if you are eligible for any type of discount, please, use always the same Counterparty address you used during the Token Sale.

I tried to click on a picture while playing the game to see the card stats and it fired a shot instead. Maybe put the cards below the playing field, or move the playing field up a bit, or let players know the playing field is being covered up for your cards.  Also, I put in the wrong Counter Party address and now I can't change it. So that sucks.",False

Ranging from 8k sats to 10k sats puts this on par.  The only major difference is the price swing with BTC which makes the fiat price higher.  If there were to be a significant increase like 5x or 10x current prices, say each BCY went to $0.10 or more, due to increase in BTC vs. fiat, then the prices should be adjusted.  Right now it should be left alone.  After all it will be up to whatever the market is willing to pay.  You talk about Ripple.  Less than 5 days ago it was going for less than half what it is now, and I see you are trying to capitalize on the market increase by selling it for 0.5 BTC, yet at the same time you believe new cards should be ""less"" costly.  Can't have your cake and eat it too.  Regardless, the market will take cards to where it believes they should be.  BCY team should actually keep increasing prices for all cards as they have been doing.  Once the game gets more popular, all the cards that are out right now will be high demand since they are limited and by increasing the prices small steps at a time will ensure the market keeps the limited card prices high.  I'm on par for keeping new card prices ""as is"" unless there is a drastic increase in BTC prices or if BCY were to rise drastically vs BTC.  Lowering them will only feed the ""card shark"" pockets down the road as the cards increase based on where the market believes the prices should be.",False

Naturally we can expect a general upward price trend for BCY considering that half of the BCY collected by EverdreamSoft in new card sales will be burned. I would expect inicial sale prices for new cards to be continually adjusted in view of the market dynamics of BCY price.  On the other hand, I suppose you are not aware of the fact that the partner store is now open and partners did in fact buy limited edition RIPPLECARD and BLOCKSIZECD today and will be able to continue doing so for another month, before sales of these cards will be opened to players with access to the premium store. So it is not accurate to state that almost no cards were sold in the past 72 hours. There were also additional cards resold on the Counterparty DEX. I know cause I made a purchase there myself recently, and the TX information is freely available for anyone to check on blockscan.com.  Edit: BCY price went down significantly late monday night after someone dumped a large amount on poloniex so I suppose too high of a price for BCY will not be a concern for the time being",False

Let's say about 30%-40% less in bcy terms, to give a chance to buy one to not so wealthy people and most important to new adopters, those that did not do the crowdsale. My take is: You really have to take in account bcy and bitcoin volatility by designing the new cards price curve on some fiat money alghoritm.

When it will come to large public purchase AppStore, a lead could be to allow people to store their purchase off-chain only.

I understand UFCKid your frustration by the delay. Ahmed is right it's a trading card game, we are producing cards that are limited in number and auditable in the blockchain. For our milestone in April 2016 we need to have 150 cards. So you can expect more of those. Selling a lot of game card is of course our objective, it is beneficial for us but also for all BitCrystals holders because ultimately it gives more value to the BitCrystals. Selling cards is healthy for our company and our company doing healthy sales benefit players AND BitCrystals owners.  Since we are doing pretty well in the sale the BCY value is increasing and more BCY are burned.  We implemented an edit button in the spells of genesis website to allow to insert the wallet address. But we received some mass registration from people who try game the system. Unfortunately sorting this out takes us some unproductive time. People trying to manipulate free BitCrystals distribution intention is probably not to to get game assets to play or share with friends, but make short term profit on dumping them on an exchange, and that benefit no one except himself.  Someone suggested to make an SMS validation and I think it's a good idea we are going to explore that.  Again sorry for the delay but I believe taking time to sort this out is ultimately benefiting everyone and we will take the time it requires to have a fair distribution.",False

Thanks Viva for your updated numbers It's quite helpful for us as well  just precision the SJCX GEMZ and SWARM that are in the wallet most of them were received before the Token Sale and won't result from a Burn. Everything received after the sale distribution will result to a burn.  The SHUMAI and CNP are blog coin. Coin follower of their respective blog receive. The coin received this way are fully burned and not resold by us. It's freebies for the blog active community in counterpart of some coverage.  Shapeshiftcd belongs to Shapeshift 800 cards where given to them in counterpart of dev support they provided. They sell the card for the price they decide. So there is no BCY burn on those cards. But we still have 200 cards that are not on sale. If we sell them at some point it will result with a BCY burn. The first price was not .3 it was .1 I think,False

If players want to buy these cards, they have to use Shapeshift.io's exchange interface called Skeleton on the Spells of Genesis website.  This way EverdreamSoft would never have to hold coins or do the exchanging.  Players purchase these cards like the ""Shibe Doge"" USING Dogecoin through this API and it actually goes and buys BitCrystal off the market by selling the Dogecoin first, converting to BTC, then buying BCY.    There, now you can make cards for every coin on the market and help the purchase value of BCY.

If you pay special attention to the charts describing how players can buy packs of trading cards using their own country´s fiat currency from the Apple Appstore or Google Playstore, you can see the following statement:  ""You can purchase game items through Google Play/AppStore using your own country's currency. When a player buys a card pack in the AppStore or on Google Play, we buy back 50% of the price in BitCrystals from our backers.""  So this implies that EverdreamSoft will be buying back BCY from exchanges like Poloniex where backers have offered their tokens for sale, in order to acquire BCY they need to send to the Gutenberg Platform to be burned so that a new card pack will be issued and then sent to the person that originally send their cash to the Appstore or Google Playstore to buy the cards.  The fact that BCY will be burned every time a new card pack is issued by Gutenberg also ensures that the token will retain or increase its value in the long run. So there is really no need for EverdreamSoft to put up buy walls on the exchanges to show their confidence in the BCY token. We are still in early alpha stages right now. As development of the game platform progresses, the in-game token´s true value will become more apparent to traders as well as players.",False

Now we have:  1) People who received bcy in the crowdsale 2) very few people (proxy to zero, i think) that actualy buy bcy on Poloniex for cards 3) Developers that sold cards, and that need fiat money (or bitcoin) to pay opereational costs.  So 1) the half of the revenue in BCY burned now have zero effect on the bcy price ( or near zero ) 2) the other half are sold for bitcoin on the market by the developers  In other word... selling pressure.  But this situation is temporary, if the game SOG will gain popularity new customers (people that do not partecipate to the crowdsale) will have to buy BCY on the exchanges.",False

Well actually cards can be also used in other game Monga this Company also runs, but lets forget that right now. 14M Bitcrystals bought in crowd sale were bought by speculators and players that knew when game will start and dont plan to sell them on Poloniex before it does.  Half Bitcrystals that company collect for sold cards is also dont that much. We will see exactly how much when first batch will get burned.  What i see problem are 30M Bitcrystals that are reserved for Development and Marketing (15M each). That is 68% of all Bitcrstals. I am sure Company will not try to spend much if any at all before game actually start.

Many of us know, how the SoG team pushed thru months before the token sale and worked for this, even before the availability of the funding. Now that the funding is available, we can therefore look forward to faster and better developments as promised by Shaban Shaame himself.  What are the great features of this card game?  For me these are the following:  1. Technology (being blockchain based trading card game) 2. Cards security (cannot be forged/faked) 3. Increasing token value (Bitcrystals BCY being slowly burned as the game development and adoption progresses) 4. Cards/Token reusability (Being Counterparty tokens other developers can make token based games and adopt these existing tokens as in-game items.) 5. Crypto developers cooperation like XCP, GEMZ, RIPPLE, ETHEREUM, SWARM, SHAPESHIFT.IO, FOLDINGCOIN, CLEF (having many developers involved in making this game succeed also helps in propagating the blockchain technology to younger generations of crypto users)  Many more...  Therefore there are many reasons for us to be hopeful that this game do indeed gain traction. More power to you guys. Keep reaching that dream.

I don't dislike the current SoG cards. But then that's me.  However if the frame to the illustrations could be made look better, is always welcome.

Because owning the game currency is owning the game assets. Let's take an extreme example. Let's say Bruce manage to purchase 100% of the BitCrystals then he will be able to to get all game asset we produce. Bruce will be able to influence the game since BitCrystals will be enabled to vote some decisions. Since he holds all the premium currency, if someone wants to get a premium asset he will need to get them from him.   Answer this question. What benefit is there in buying into the token sale? Won't I be able to buy fake game money after the game launches for the same price?  First of all like any crowdfunding buying early give the opportunity to make the project happen. It's also an ability to get the premium currency at a discounted price. Also there are a lot of advantages purchasing during the sale. There are rewards like very limited cards. The genesis card or the satoshi card for example. The card that we distributed at limited supply like the FDCARD already have a lot of value. We saw an ask price of 110 XCP on counterparty decentralised exchange. Most interesting purchasing BitCrystals during the sale open the door to premium and partner store. Those store are limited to people who reach certain ranks. This give the ability for people to be resellers. They might have access to cards that we are not selling anywhere else. This way they can open their own shops. There are more info about the rewards here http://www.bitcrystals.com   If I can't buy tokens for the same price won't new players hate the game because the most power players are only the most powerful because they're rich and they got in at the top of the pyramid?  The art of a good game design is to give unlimited fun for people who don't purchase and incentive and advantages to people who pay. So our job is to find the right balance in order to keep free players and to maximise revenue from paying players.   It seems to me like the devs want to get paid to build a game that they will own 100% of. How will the devs make money once the game is complete? There will need to be servers/fees that cost money to maintain the game if it ever gets popular. Why can't game profits be shared with token sale participants?  Getting paid to build something or baking a project is the base of crowdfunding. Like there are millions on Kickstarter. The main difference between Kickstarter and this project is the fact people are buying part of the game economy. The blockchain nature of Bitcrystals means when you purchase something in the game it retains it's value just like physical objects. You have full ownerhsip of it. If you want to trade it, share it or whatever it's up to you. You can even build other games or products that are using those assets. There is a win-win situation because if the game gets popular the demand for the game asset will be important so people in the community are empowered to promote the game.   There will need to be servers/fees that cost money to maintain the game if it ever gets popular. Yes exactly. This is why we continuously produce new content and we sell them for BitCrystals. For each 2 BitCrystal we receive we burn 1. The 1 BitrCystal left will be sold (or held) back to pay our running costs.    I wish you people luck and hope this brings in new users for BTC.

There is a limited supply of BitCrystals (BCY), available only during a defined period - during the Token Sale right now. The price of BitCrystals increases every five days (the current rate is available till Friday, August 14th, 3pm Swiss Time).  This is for the price.  Regarding the amount of BCY which will be burned: this will depend on the game items which will be purchased. After the Token Sale, the game items (mainly the cards), will be available only for BCY. Every time a player purchase a card, we will receive a certain amount of BCY (the price of the card). From the total amount  received from the player, we will keep 50% and send 50% to Gutenberg, which will burn them and send us the card that we will then send to the player (e.g. you want a card which costs 100 000 BCY, you purchase it and we'll recieve 100 000 BCY. We keep 50 000 and send 50 000 to Gutenberg. Gutenberg will burn the total amount of these 50 000 BCY and will issue the card, send us the card and we'll send it to you.)

There are two reasons -some BitCrystals were sold to early investors before the Token Sale start (This possibility is mentioned in the BCY distribution window on the sale page...) and, secondly, since we are launching several promotions, allowing people to get more BCY than they actually pay, we need to keep some  BCY for this.",False

My guess is some investor, owner, developer or interested party wanted their cut so they made up a decision out of thin air to reallocate 10 million bitcrystals.  If this is the case then it's a little shady because the sale already started and then they rewrote the rules.  This means anyone who bought when it was 70 million could have their bitcrystals diluted.  Why?  Because any bitcrystal not sold was supposed to be burned.  It's about a 10% dilution.

I trust the team they will deliver, they have an alpha of the game which is available to test online. I've been following the project for a long time. So I know quite a bit about it.  I never heard of 80% scam, it's either a scam or not. This is not an open source project, it's a company raising funds to develop a new game, they have already a game out since 2009 available for iOS and Android. BitCrystals will be used to purchase cards, card packs and in-game items, they are the fuel of the game. And when they are used they get burned. What does that mean? That BitCrystals will decrease in number over time, the more they are used, hence the potential for return is pretty solid in my opinion.  You are making assumptions in your comments, which is fair, everyone is free to think whatever they want. It's a free world. The team has been clear on how they will use the coins (out of the 100 million that will ever exist), it's all in the OP, on the sale site and on the Spells of Genesis site.  Do have a read through, I did, and have no worries about the team being honest and working hard to deliver. There are also milestones to be completed before they get any money from the sale. An extra guarantee for contributors. If they don't deliver they ain't getting anything.  I wish they'd get a million, they have proven themselves before with their previous game Moonga.

You sound pretty sour, have to say...    What you just said applies to any altcoin, and even Bitcoin itself. Something is valuable because people who use it considers it of value. Stones once were used as money, something that it's hard to consider money nowadays, yet they were being used as a mean of exchange centuries ago.  To be noted that Moonga, EverdreamSoft first game, with over 250,000 downloads to date doesn't feature any ads. So I'm not sure where do you get the impression there will be ads in Spells of Genesis.  Furthermore, all the fake money that people uses in those other games you mention, it's really fake because they don't own it, it can only be used and traded within those games. They are closed economies.  BitCrystals are a mean for users to actually be part of the game economy, they can first be used to buy assets, cards, etc but they can also be freely traded outside of the game, peer to peer or on exchanges. This is also true for the blockchain-based trading cards, everyone can exchange them between each other, online, and even be sold at will anywhere in the world.  If by any chance BitCrystals go up in value because they become rarer the more they are used by players, who do you think is going to benefit? If in the future 10 BitCrystals buy you 30 cards instead of 10 or simply they are worth more, the players and the community are going to benefit, the people who actually own them.",False

Because we are preselling ingame currency and you think games are not serious enough to spend anything in ?  I know there is a lot of spam in that space. But being qualified like that makes me sad because we worked more that 8 months to set up a standard of emerging fairness game economy. I tried very hard work to set up the whole thing, for the first time in game industry, to align the developper/publisher to the community interest. So people might like it join the idea or not. But qualify this as a scam is saddens me for all the effort that as been put by the passionate team.  My opinion is the most popular app genre is game and the most grossing, just looking at the app store and playstore top grossing app it's all about premium currency purchase. As a company our goal is to be sustainable at least and being a super hit at best. Puzzle&Dragon a Japanese game for example is a mix of casual and arcade game. It generates 4.5 mio USD per day of sales. Thats what we are heading for. We have now 5 years experience in doing games and I'm pretty confident we have the ability to push this to an great success, one of the reason is the fact blockchain technology opens up possibility for people to become digital asset game resellers and ability to expand the game. I beleive this model is the future of the game economy, where the product is produced by the market for the market.     This is a good sign, if the game is average and it just has been funded and not yet developed we have room of improvement to make it a big hit.

EverdreamSoft is now launching another from its series of limited editions of blockchain-based cards: SWARMCD.   SWARMCD has been created exclusively for Swarm and can be purchased with XCP tokens, Swarm or BTC. SWARMCD is playable as “Ayana, the Swarmborn” in EverdreamSoft’s Moonga and Spells of Genesis games, or tradable freely outside these games, on the blockchain. ATTENTION: THE EVERDREAMSOFT’S ASSET MADE FOR SWARM IS CALLED SWARMCD, NOT SWARMCARD! The 1st card of the serie will be sold for 1 XCP (or its equivalent in BTC or SWARM) and the price will gradually increase with the number of cards being purchased (for more details see the SWARMCD distribution chart below). This means that the sooner you purchase your SWARMCD, the less you’ll pay. In the future we expect the cards to acquire more value as they are collector items. The first 19 cards are available on DEX starting now, then the sale will be moved on Tokenly.  SWARMCD DISTRIBUTION CHART   All EverdreamSoft’s special blockchain-based cards are playable in Moonga and SoG, as well as freely tradable outside the games. When you purchase one of our blockchain-based cards, you will own your game asset not only within the game, but also on the blockchain. So far we have created special blockchain-based trading cards for FoldingCoin, Storj, GetGemz and Counterparty XCP - FDCARD, SJCXCARD, GEMZCARD and XCPCARD - and we have lot of other projects onboard. EverdreamSoft is a swiss based company specialized in the field of mobile games development. With Moonga, our main trading card game, we were among the first to have a free-to-play game on the AppStore in 2009. Since then, the genre has evolved in unexpected ways. Spells of Genesis is our upcoming mobile game, which will integrate bitcoin and blockchain technology in its game economy as well as in its storyline. It’s targeted for release later this year.

Another rare card is the SATOSHICARD of which, according to the Swapbot it is sold by, there are only 200 of them. They are doing flash sales for it, one at the time.

This means that the sooner you purchase your XCPCARD, the less you’ll pay. In the future we expect the cards to acquire more value as they are collector items. The first 19 cards are available on DEX starting now, then the sale will be moved on Tokenly. Right now we are getting 5 XCPCARDS as rewards in XCP skype contest!

To earn BITCRYSTALS and the FDCARD card in addition to FLDC please make your donor name style:   username_ALL_CounterwalletAddress   Starting March 13th until May 31st, calculations for the Merged Folding _ALL_ command will allow you to earn BITCRYSTALS in addition to the exclusive FDCARD card for SoG that can only be obtained via the folding method.  For those of you not familiar with FoldingCoin please read up on our bitcointalk or visit our website FoldingCoin.net. You may also contact me directly with questions at rross@foldingcoin.net but for a quick start to earning BITCRYSTALS and FDCARD please follow these two steps: Step 1. Get a Counterwallet (if you already have one skip this step) Step 2. Setup your FAH client  Spells of Genesis (SoG) is an upcoming trading card/arcade game, from Swiss-based company EverdreamSoft, which will integrate bitcoin and blockchain technology in its game economy as well as its storyline. It is targeted for release in late 2015 for iOS and Android devices. The development of the game will be funded by a token sale which will start in June on Koinify.  BitCrystals are the game fuel and premium currency of SoG. As Counterparty assets, they are tradable and can be used to create card packs and acquire new items in the game. Read more about BitCrystals and our in-game economy HERE.  In addition to BitCrystals, there will be distributed 300 unique trading cards among the folders also as a counterparty asset named “FDCARD”. These cards will be playable in the game and will be freely tradable (also in bits). The card is specifically designed for FoldingCoin and will not be distributed in any other way.  Distributions will occur monthly for BITCRYSTALS and the FDCARD. BITCRYSTALS are divisible tokens and like stated before are game fuel for SoG, so having fractions of a whole token can be used for various things such as buying packs of cards. The cards on SoG are normally non divisible tokens as they represent individual cards. However, in order to distribute FDCARDs among Folders this particular card needs to be divisible. So as long as you have 1 whole FDCARD in your wallet you will have the card, anything less will not be eligible to use the card in the game.  Also in order to not have this card centralized to the top Folders on Merged Folding, you will be maxed out at 0.5 FDCARD per monthly distribution. This will then allow for more fractions of FDCARD to be distributed among the lower Folders so some of the lower Folders will receive a higher fraction of FDCARD rather than just satoshis worth (satoshis worth would make it extremely hard to earn a whole card during the promotion). BITCRYSTALS will still be distributed evenly in the same manner that the rest of the tokens on Merged Folding are.  The daily distribution amount for BITCRYSTALS will be 100,000 tokens over 80 days from 3/13/15 - 5/31/15 at 1,250 BITCRYSTALS per day: April 1st: 23,750 BITCRYSTALS Distributed May 1st: 37,500 BITCRYSTALS Distributed June 1st: 38,750 BITCRYSTALS Distributed  The daily distribution amount for FDCARD will be 300 tokens over 75 days from 3/13/15 - 5/26/15 at 4 FDCARDs per day: April 1st: 76 FDCARD Distributed May 1st: 120 FDCARD Distributed May 27th: 104 FDCARD Distributed  For more information you can visit the following links:  SpellsofGenesis.com Merged Folding Page  I will be following this forum now consistently if anyone has any questions.

BitCrystals can be traded on the blockchain or used to purchase blockchain-based cards, playable within Spells of Genesis.  Our Vision  We believe players should have full ownership of their game items. Once you acquire a game asset, you should be free to own and transfer it. Unlike in other games, you should be able to keep your assets outside the game database and be completely independent of it. Once you own a game item, you can play it in Spells of Genesis, trade it on the blockchain or even find alternative uses for it in other games.  Our goal is to build an innovative in-game economy while developing the whole game and background story, cryptocurrency will be used as an in-game means of exchange. Counterparty tokens will be assigned to cards in SoG which means you can trade cards freely within and outside the game app.  Players will own their game items and cards not only in the game world but also on the blockchain. Other functions on Counterparty such as the lock feature will also give players the possibility to lock a specific amount of rare cards in a public and transparent manner.    New Way of Crowdfunding  BitCrystals were first put on sale in summer 2015 during our BitCrystals Token Sale. By purchasing BCY, people became backers of the SoG project. This means they got rewarded with the game’s premium currency while funding its development. The value of BitCrystals is linked to SoG’s popularity.   Since the BitCrystals supply is limited, the game assets that one BCY will unlock will vary according to the demand of the game asset.  For example, let’s say we create a special card called the Black Dragon which will be sold for BitCrystals. We’re going to sell part of our BitCrystals reserve for players who want to acquire it. Since we only hold 15’000’000 BitCrystals – if there are only 15 players who play the game, we will probably sell the Black Dragon for 1’000’000 BitCrystals per piece. However, if there are 15’000’000 million players who want 1 dragon, then to cover the demand we will sell the dragon for 1 BitCrystals. This way the player who purchased BitCrystals during the token sale will be able to get many more Black Dragon cards according to the number of BitCrystals he holds.  BitCrystals Supply And Distribution    BitCrystals were issued in a limited supply of 100 000 000 units.  30% of the initial supply were kept by EverdreamSoft for marketing and development purposes, 70% of the total supply was offered for sale during the BitCrystals Token Sale. The BitCrystals Token Sale started on August 4th, it ended on September 3rd, 2015.  After the end of the BitCrystals Token Sale, all the unsold BCY were burnt. Some BitCrystals were sold to early investors prior to the Token Sale. The proceeds from the BitCrystals Token Sale were used to fund the development of the game.  At the end of each month, 50% of the cards sale income in BCY are burnt and EverdreamSoft publishes a detailed report indicating their BCY incomes as well as the amount to burn. The amount of BCY is then sent at this burn address: 1BURNSogXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXW3ny2Y.  The total supply of BCY is constantly decreasing thus its value keeps increasing.    Token Sale Report     Get BitCrystals  BUY BITCRYSTALS USING THE OFFICIAL BITCRYSTALS SWAPBOT     Buy BitCrystals for BTC from the EverdreamSoft’s official swapbot (automated vending machine). Download Book of Orbs, a Counterparty compatible mobile wallet to access easily the secondary market to get BitCrystals or trade your blockchain cards.   BUY BITCRYSTALS ON THE COUNTERPARTY DEX      Trade XCP, BTC, or any other asset for BitCrystals on the Counterparty DEX.   Token System  Both BitCrystals and Spells of Genesis blockchain cards are digital assets based on Counterparty. Counterparty is a platform which allows the creation of custom tokens, which act as their own cryptocurrency, while still running on the blockchain. Game assets in SoG are assigned a unique Counterparty token. This allows them to be used and traded freely outside the game.  The use of Counterparty's functions such as the lock feature opens up the possibility for players to lock a certain amount of rare cards in a public and transparent manner   Spells of Genesis  Spells of Genesis (SoG) is a mobile game that is a mix of a trading card game (TCG), bringing in deck collection and strategy, along with arcade-style gaming aspects. Spells of Genesis is developed by a Swiss-based company EverdreamSoft.       A Game For The Community  Our motivation in developing SoG stems from our desire to create a game in strong cooperation with the community. With Moonga, our main  trading card game, we were among the first to have a free-to-play game on the AppStore in 2009. Since then, the genre has evolved in unexpected ways.  We saw some of our players trading rare cards for more than 1000 USD, even if it was not allowed by the terms of service. A whole economy emerged in the game. This inspired us to conceptualise how we could go beyond that and leverage digital goods ownership.   Blockchain Cards     Discover all the SoG blockchain cards!
