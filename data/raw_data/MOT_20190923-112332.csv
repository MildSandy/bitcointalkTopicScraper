Providing an important asset in an investor’s portfolio  Cryptocurrency investors will be able to purchase digital gold straight from the Olympus app by buying DGX tokens, therefore being able to hold an asset-backed token using the Ethereum Blockchain.  DGX will be included in Olympus’ Index offering, allowing investors to purchase DGX as part of a larger portfolio with a single tap. The portfolio will include DGX, MOT, KNC, and a growing list of other tokens, thereby giving investors the ability to easily acquire a diversified portfolio. DGX serves as a relatively uncorrelated asset, counterbalancing the other tokens in the portfolio, reducing overall portfolio volatility to protect portfolio values during crypto sell-offs.  With DGX integrated into the Olympus Protocol, DGX tokens can now be included in any custom indexes and financial products, whether made by the Olympus team or third-party developers using the Olympus protocol. In upcoming releases, Olympus can also provide digital gold futures, lending backed by digital gold, decentralized applications based on digital gold through this partnership with DGX.  “We are very excited to partner with Digix, the first crowdsale on Ethereum, and the creators of DigixDAO, to push the boundaries of blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency revolution. We are honored to be working with such an amazing and forward-thinking team, and we can’t wait to see what amazing financial products and applications will come from our partnership!” said Kai Chen, CEO of Olympus Labs.  DGX is a real-world asset-backed stablecoin, rather than a fiat-backed one, ensuring stability not only during cryptocurrency market turmoil, but also during ‘traditional’ economic slowdowns. Having a non-fiat backed stablecoin being accessible to Olympus clients and developers would assist in hedging risks and provide the cryptocurrency trading market with a powerful alternative to traditional fiat pairs.  “We stick to our ethos in creating a gold backed ERC20 token, namely DGX, as the de-facto stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain ecosystem. With it being accessible through new dApps such as Olympus Labs, encourages adoption and awareness of its stablecoin properties.” KC Chng, CEO, DigixGlobal  About Olympus Labs  Olympus Labs is a protocol for the decentralized creation of cryptocurrency financial products with a one-stop-shop mobile application that offers investors the financial products built using the Olympus Protocol.  The Olympus Ecosystem integrates financial product creators, third-party applications, exchanges, and price oracles, and we encourage third-party developers to build their own financial products and D-apps using Olympus Protocol.  About Digix  Digix is an asset tokenization platform on Ethereum, with physical gold on the Ethereum blockchain being its first use case.  Digix created the Proof of Provenance Protocol (PoP) to track physical assets on blockchain and the DGX token on a fully allocated basis, on which 1 token represents 1 gram of gold bullion from LBMA-approved refiners stored in the vaults in Singapore. The entire asset explorer of gold bullion is publicly accessible by anyone via the Digix Marketplace.  Digix and Olympus Labs believe that such a partnership is timely in propagating a safe haven asset into the financial ecosystem, allowing all financial products to benefit from the properties of a safe haven asset.

As part of this partnership, all 26 BB investable indices will be available through a gradual rollout schedule within the Olympus app, to be constructed and tracked through Olympus’ mobile app with just one tap of a button. Due to its core protocol, the Olympus core smart contract allows for efficient and timely replication of these indices for investors to track and purchase.  “Investments in the cryptocurrency market is still at an embryonic stage. If economic and finance history have taught us anything, it is that passive funds contribute to rapid and sustainable growth of investments. Olympus presents a great technology to foster growth in both passive and active funds. Launching the BB indices using the efficacy and precision of Olympus platform will contribute to the growth of this market,” stated Dr. Redouane Elkamhi, co-founder and developer of BB Index.  A landmark achievement for blockchain and asset management  This partnership will track some of the important developments of more “traditional” financial market indices over the years. Given that transparent and investable cryptocurrency indices are rare in the market these days, this partnership will put time and cost savings into the hands of potential and current cryptocurrency investors.  “We believe in the great value that this integration between BB Index and Olympus will bring to the general and seasoned cryptocurrency investor alike,” said Kai Chen, CEO of Olympus Labs, echoing the positive sentiments of Dr. Elkhami, “With the ease and simplicity of our mobile app, we will enable them to invest in timely and well-managed indices with little hassle.”  By launching this index partnership, both parties have created a crucial tool for producing the huge range of investment products that investors desire today.  “The blockchain community and investors will benefit tremendously from these transparent, well defined and independent constructed indices, presented in the most accessible way,” added Dr. Elkamhi.

As such, Olympus will leverage Lakhani’s 10+ years of financial experience in prestigious firms such as Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, MSCI, and the CME group to gain institutional recognition. She will bring her expertise to set templates for financial products that are suited for the cryptocurrency market, and meet industry best practices for product creation, such as industry best practices for index construction in the new product release.  “I am excited to work with Olympus Labs to further professionalize the cryptocurrency asset class, especially as more investors start setting up cryptocurrency portfolios,” said Lakhani, adding, “Olympus is a fantastic team driving the development of a rich cryptocurrency financial ecosystem, and I am proud to support what will be an important step in the development of future financial asset classes and products.”  As the Director of Index Development at the CME, Payal was heavily involved in constructing the methodology of the Bitcoin Reference Rate (BRR) and Bitcoin Real-Time Index (BRTI) that the CME currently uses for their Bitcoin Futures (BTC).

Your ANN doesn't even have any comment. You should consider whether your market position is accurate. It is recommended that you first succeed in the Chinese market and then promote it to the world. A Chinese project, even many Chinese do not know MOT, do you not think this is a failure? Didn't you have any bounty campaign? If not, the BTT signature bounty may be able to help your token. It is more effective than airdrop. As long as you are willing to go to the Chinese section, I believe there is no shortage of participants. ONION just ended and there are many people out there doing nothing.   You can learn about the semux mode and the semux signature campaign form a strong community! Of course ONION mode is also very good, but MOT may not be suitable for that mode.

This meetup focused on scalability issues regarding the Ethereum network as well as projects making an impact in the ethereum ecosystem. It was a enriching session where core researchers and developers of the Ethereum network gathered to discuss the feasibility and merits of potential solutions such as Plasma and Sharding as well as the overview of Casper Testnet. Speakers included researchers from OmiseGo, MakerDAO, Alpha Protocol, and even the founder of Ethereum Vitalik Buterin. Olympus Labs is honoured to be invited to share the Olympus vision of financial empowerment through a well developed blockchain financial ecosystem.   Kai explained that “the blockchain fintech ecosystem needs to build out its financial infrastructure in order to realize the full potential of financial empowerment.” Kai highlighted three areas of financial empowerment enabled by blockchain technology and tokenomics. Olympus Labs aims to become the Alipay of the cryptocurrency market, a payment portal that serves as the gateway to a wealth of wealth management products for investors.  Democratized wealth creation and distribution  Throughout history, capital has been concentrated in hands of the wealthy elite. As capital is a key ingredient in the creation and thus distribution of wealth, capital has steadily become more concentrated and inequality has widened. The problem we face in the traditional fundraising model is that barriers to entry is very high and usually requires a huge capital outlay. With blockchain and cryptocurrency, anyone can invest in the projects they believe in from the initiation of the project, putting the power of a VC into the hands of any individual.  Banking the Unbanked & serving the disenfranchised  Current flaws in the financial ecosystem still exclude the two billion people who do not have bank accounts from having access to proper banking services. Clearly, the unbanked and underbanked together constitute a large market that is not well served by existing institutions. We believe that blockchain and cryptocurrency provides a secure and convenient way to serve the needs of these individuals.  New form of human organization  Most importantly, the blockchain revolution enables the ultimate form of financial empowerment, human freedom. Blockchain projects bring together people from all backgrounds throughout the world, forming global communities to solve global issues. Likewise, talented individuals have the freedom to choose the projects that want to work on and can champion multiple causes at the same time instead of sitting in an office reporting to a boss. The geographical and employment freedom, as well as the ability to pursue one’s passions, is a fundamental milestone in human development.  Moreover, tokenomics is redefining the traditional corporate structure. In a traditional company, the major stakeholders include employees, shareholders, and customers, each with their own interests. Tokenomics allows the incentives of all stakeholders to become aligned in pursuit of a common goal, blurring the lines between the stakeholders. Someone who believes in an idea participates in a token sale, and thus becomes an owner. He/she is likely to be the project’s most avid supporters, becoming the project’s first customers. The open nature of blockchain projects also means that these same supporters are likely to contribute code or help to spread word of the project, thus taking on the role of an employee. Any individual in the community can take on all of the major roles of the project; this is a revolution in human organization.   And it’s a wrap! We are really happy to have made new friends within the Thailand community and we are in love with the enthusiasm of the people here! Southeast Asia is definitely a market that the team is not going to miss out on, catch us in SIngapore in a couple of weeks as we recap our major milestones and vision for the upcoming year.

Like EIPs for Ethereum, OIPs stands for Olympus Labs Improvement Proposals. It is a continuously updated document about the project which includes core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards. Community (especially developers) are welcomed to comment and suggest feedback to our current proposal. Anyone can submit an OIP on our Github and our tech team will actively review them and update the status of the OIP which will be available publicly.  Olympus Improvement Plan #1: Index Architecture Design  In our very first OIP, we will highlight the high level design describing the general ideas of the components of the first financial product on the platform; indexes.  Then we will go into details for each of the described components, including their roles, responsibilities, and the interactions between the components. Finally, we list the possible usages of the MOT token on the platform and its advantages and disadvantages.  What is an index?  An index is an indicator or measure of something, and in finance, it typically refers to a statistical measure of change in a securities market. In the case of financial markets, stock and bond market indices consist of a hypothetical portfolio of securities representing a particular market or a segment of it. For instance, the S&P 500 is an example of an index, which consists of a portfolio of stocks based on the market capitalizations of 500 large companies listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ.  What purpose does an index serve for an investor? Traditionally, fund managers can create Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) based on indexes such as S&P 500. For instance, we have index ETFs in the market which tracks a benchmark index like the S&P 500 closely. Index funds provide investors a simple way to own a portfolio of well diversified stocks, as the performance of the funds tend to follow the performance of the underlying index closely.  Creating a cryptocurrency portfolio based on an underlying index  In the traditional market, indexes have served to measure the performance of its underlying stocks and bonds. However, there is a lack of choices for cryptocurrencies to track the performance of a certain basket of cryptocurrencies. For the American stock market, we have the S&P 500 to track the performance of a basket of 500 US companies listed on NYSE or NASDAQ. What if we were able to create an index to track the performance of the Top 10 privacy related tokens (we would probably construct a portfolio consisting of Monero, Zcash, Dash and so on).  Therefore, as part of our first OIP, we would like to create an index on the Olympus Platform which allows a combination of different tokens with weights assigned to them to simplify the process of constructing a portfolio of cryptocurrencies for investors.  We have the following foals for the system architecture  1. Scalable 2. Extensible 3. Developer friendly 4. Decentralized 5. Facilitated by Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO)  Key components in the index architecture and their relationships  In order to achieve the goals listed above, we need to design the system in a flexible and extensible way for agents to interact with one another. The key components/agents in our index architecture design are:  1. Exchange provider and its adapters 2. Strategy provider and its clients 3. Price provider and its oracles 4. Core smart contract  Their relationships are shown in the diagram below:    Firstly, for an index to work, we require a continuous feed of live prices aggregated from a database. As one of our aim is to build a decentralised index, we will need to aggregate live prices from price providers and interact with their databases through their oracles. Next, we would require strategy providers to design indexes and decide on which tokens to be included inside the portfolio and assign weights to the respective tokens. Next, in order to facilitate simple buying and selling of the portfolio of cryptocurrencies designed by strategy providers, we will need exchange providers, like Kyber Network and Binance.  To integrate into the Olympus platform, all service providers will have to interact with the Olympus Core Smart contract to perform their respective functions listed above. Similarly, all 3rd party applications and 3rd-party clients can only use the above services by submitting requests to the core smart contract. By ensuring that there is one single point of entry, it makes the architecture of the index product clean, extensible, and easy to integrate.  Core smart contract  The core smart contract acts as a single point of contact for end-users (i.e. people who want to invest in a certain index) to submit requests. After the smart contract accepts the request from the end-user, it will then calculate requests, split them, and distribute to different agents.  For the index product, the main features should include:  1. Retrieving available indexes and their properties. 2. Retrieving token prices. 3. Buying tokens included in an Index from exchanges. 4. Cancel the order if it takes too long or the price becomes inappropriate. 5. Get notified when the order status is changed.  When an end-user submits a request to buy an index product, the core smart contract will hold the responsibility to retrieve information on available listed indexes on the Olympus platform created by strategy providers, retrieve token prices from price providers and their oracles, and buy tokens included in the portfolio from exchange providers. If the order cannot be fulfilled (due to lack of liquidity or changes in prices), the core smart contract will then cancel the order. When an order is fulfilled, it will also notify the end-user of the change in order status.  Although it may sound complicated, the end-user need not know what is happening on the backend when an order is being submitted because the smart contract will take care of all the processes. The user is only required to submit the order to the smart contract and it is designed to be straightforward.  Price Smart Contract and oracles  The price smart contract plays the role of providing prices for tokens to the user as references when buying indexes, it can be extended to also provide instant value of Indexes in the future.  It should interact with 2 parts, providing data to the core smart contract and retrieving data feed from its oracles. To the core smart contract, it provide information such as price data, which tokens are supported and frequency of price update. Oracles, on the other hand, should enable the Olympus core smart contract to retrieve data feed from the price provider’s database.  Strategy Smart Contract and clients  The strategy smart contract holds all the strategies provided by different organizations or individual experts. Similar to the Price smart contract, it interacts with 2 parties as well, the core smart contract and the end-users (i.e. investors). To the core smart contract, it gives a list of the available strategies and its properties, such as price, tokens within the portfolio, and weights of the tokens. Strategy providers are also able to set their strategies as private, which thereafter will not be visible to the public. For the end-users, the platform providers an interface for them to control their own strategies according to their expertise and preference.  In the current design, a strategy consists of: 1. Tokens in it. 2. Weights of the tokens in it. 3. Private or not (Future). 4. Price in MOT if it’s private (Future). 5. Dynamic code for adjusting strategy if certain circumstances change. (Future)  For strategy providers, it can be extended to different platforms, like Web-based, Windows/Mac application or a separate app. In the future, it can also provide the end user with the possibility to create their own strategy.  Exchange provider and adapters  This part is responsible for handling all the actual order placements on the exchanges. It includes one smart contract and several adapters.  The smart contract interacts with the core smart contract and the adapters to make sure orders will be correctly processed and put onto exchanges according to cert algorithms. There are 2 kinds of exchanges at this moment, DEX and centralized exchanges. We will be using sub smart contracts to communicate with the DEXes and oracles for the traditional ones.  The exchange provider should determine which exchange it should take for the order sent from the core smart contract based on price/reputation of the exchanges. It should also have events for when a certain order is placed and for when it’s processed/completed. The provider also exposes an interface that if an order takes too long then a user could cancel it manually.  Use Of MOT on the platform  MOT plays a very important role in the Olympus Ecosystem. There are several possible uses of the native MOT token.  For the indexes, the value for the user is that they can use the smart contract service to exchange (for example) their Ether into the indexes through all the possible exchange contracts, without having to manually split their money and create accounts on different exchanges and also benefit from the financial experts by following certain strategies.      Permit to buy OL financial products. This is to require the user to have a certain amount of MOT before they are allowed to buy financial products from our platform. It promotes the use of MOT, yet the downside of this is it limits the size of the active community (depending on the amount of MOT defined) which can make use of the Olympus platform.     Used as a fee on the platform. User pay MOT for a fee when interacting with the financial products. A part of this fee will be rewarded to the oracles/providers because they give the platform added value.     Voting process. By holding a certain amount of MOT, the user is permitted to vote on providers/oracles, with the reward of MOT to the providers/oracles tied to the number of votes. Most likely this possibility on its own is not a goal for users, as it doesn’t directly reward them with anything. Therefore, a rewards mechanism for the end users still needs to be researched.     Buy private strategies. The user can unlock certain indexes with MOT. The price in MOT to unlock the strategies could be decided by the providers for the Strategy Smart Contract. This might involve privacy solutions such as ZK-STARKS or Homomorphic encryption.  All of these possibilities can be used together, but the technology required for the last suggestion is still in active development in the blockchain space, so this should be implemented at a later stage. However, this possibility brings a lot to the table in terms of incentives for the providers to provide more strategies, which in turn attracts more strategy consumers. Similar work on this is being done by the Enigma decentralized Data Marketplace.  Moving forward  The future is very exciting, and the architecture we described above is just the beginning. If we apply the concept of epics, we are currently in epic 1. The future holds a lot of possibilities:      Tokenization: For each index, there is the potential to programmatically create a smart contract and make a token to represent this index. When users buy it, a certain amount of these tokens will be transferred into the users’ wallet instead of the bought tokens. These tokens will be held/locked into the smart contract and the user can actually exchange them back after a certain locking period depending on the specific strategy.     DAO: It’s always interesting to think about how to make the community grow/develop without too much interference. The key is to create a system with reward / punishment mechanisms by using the MOT token.     Rebalancing: What we have created so far is only buying, but in reality, the market changes rapidly, thus it is interesting to think about assets getting rebalanced when certain circumstances change.     Strategy marketplace: Researching different projects requires a lot of knowledge and effort. That deserves respect and needs to be honoured. By paying MOT to the strategy provider, it attracts more professionals to get involved on the Olympus Platform and grow the community.     Tools for strategy organizations/managers: In the traditional financial industry, there are a lot of tools available for different parties/roles. However, in the blockchain space, these tools are still very limited. By creating the index product, it makes it possible to reach this market by creating tools for the organizations/funding managers.

Olympus Partners with bitfwd to Launch Global Blockathon  Olympus is a project dedicated to blockchain development and fostering a community that wants to decentralize the world. Contrary to many of the ICOs that are only focused on hype announcements and viral marketing with no substance, Olympus has been quietly hitting all their roadmap goals and more, and to grow their development community even more, Olympus is officially partnering with bitfwd.  bitfwd is a grassroots community of cypherpunks, Blockchain developers, entrepreneurs, academics and enthusiasts. Olympus Labs sponsored bitfwd’s first Blockathon in Sydney, Australia’s largest blockchain hackathon that drew over 100 developers to compete and work on fundamental technologies around Blockchain tech.  “We are excited to promote decentralization on a global scale. This joint effort will allow us to support developers seeking to make a difference in the world, to promote the importance of decentralized exchanges such as Kyber, 0X, and Loopring, and to encourage developers to build financial products and applications on top of the Olympus Protocol,” Kai explained the long-term strategic value of building a global developer community.  The Partnership  Olympus will sponsor and host a global hackathon tour with bitfwd, spanning the United States, Europe and APAC. NEM Foundation, one of the top public blockchain platforms, is another global partner in this effort.  The eager and talented Solidity developers will have the opportunity to use Olympus’ open-source repositories to build their own unique projects and applications within the blockchain space. For the best projects that come from the hackathons, Olympus will be providing early stage funding as well as the opportunity to integrate their projects in the Olympus ecosystem.  “It’s really exciting that bitfwd community and Olympus Labs will join forces to organize the 2018 #Blockathon global tour. These are the kind of efforts that really bring major technological developments that echo much beyond the developers’ keyboards. Our objective with this partnership is to make decentralized technologies relevant and accessible to everyone by bringing developers, creatives, and entrepreneurs together to build real world products for the future,” said Daniel Bar, Founder and Chairman of bitfwd.  We are calling on all developers to check out the Olympus Improvement Proposal (OIP), which is similar to the EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposal) for the Ethereum network. The OIP is on our Github, and we encourage developers and industry experts to check it out and provide feedback and contribute to the project. We will be making an announcement on the bounty campaign for contributing to the Olympus open-source project.",False
