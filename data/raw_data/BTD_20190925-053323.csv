Ridesharing was created and popularized by Uber, who still remains the King of this brave new industry. They were able to redefine the way we look at transportation. But over the years since the market has become extremely saturated and is in danger from Uber itself.  ⓄRidesharing is a phenomenal concept that is just too good, too crucial and too embedded in the modern psyche to be allowed  to go down the drain. But Uber and other centralized organizations that have consistently abused the industry and the trust that the passengers  and driver vest in them pose the greatest threat to ridesharing and this is why a team of visionary tech experts with decade’s worth of experience at the highest levels have come together to create Bitdrive, the blockchain based  revolutionary platform that is set to disrupt the disruptor and make the present ridesharing giants obsolete in an industry where consumer satisfaction should be driver of innovation   Bitdrive is based on the revolutionary Blockchain Technology which is perhaps the most innovative and versatile technology that mankind has ever known. It’s slowly diverging into different verticals and is providing custom-made solutions for a whole list of complicated problems. From finance to the supply chain and Smart energy grids, the blockchain technology is reshaping the way we do things and the Bitdrive which we have developed is all set to rebrand and redefine the industry and save it from n impending collapse.   BITDRIVE AUTOSURANCE  Bitdrive Autosurance is an effort of the Bitdrive platform to be there for you whenever the need arises, ridding you of worrying over those dreaded rainy days. Bitdrive Autosurance is our sincere effort to be by your side,our esteemed partner in success, not just in times when all seem to be going well but to have your back when things go awry.   How will Blockchain based Bitdrive offer the Perfect solution to today's Ridesharing industry?   ⓄThe versatility and application of Blockchain technology is endless and its importance in the structuring of business models cannot be overemphasized. We developed this unique vision to solve the problems faced by ride-sharing industries by following these outlines mentioned below.  ⓄWell-structured Business model We have used the Blockchain platform to specifically create and be applied for the ridesharing industry. Hence, a specific crypto coin/token will be created to fuel the transactions on the platform. The same cryptocurrency will be used to reward the drivers for their incessant contributions to the platform, contributions like completing more trips, achieving the set targets and even referring other drivers. The increase in the number of transactions will in-turn improve the value of the currency and this will result in better benefits for the investors and the customers      Introducing- Bitdrive App Interface    Legal Disclaimer   ⓄThe steps mentioned above are absolutely necessary for dealing with problems arising out of the centralized concept of nonblockchain ridesharing companies. The Blockchain technology apparently is the onlysystem that gives users the benefits of a thriving marketplace without the middleman and the restrictions. The decentralization of data makes it possible for us shareholders to create values that will prove beneficial to the whole ecosystem rather than just seeking towards the profitability of the company, platform or entity. Initially there might be some problems with the decentralization aspect, especially when it’s trying to verify identities, however, this will be gradually rectified and some new Blockchain companies have created blockchain based digital authentications.     Intricate features of Bitdrive      ❱❱❱Bitdrive is created by a team of highly specialized IT professionals who have deeply examined and analyzed the ridesharing economy, the problems these companies faced and how Blockchain technology will resolve these issues. Bitdrive’s plethora of cutting-edge features that are pushing the boundaries and setting the benchmark in the ridesharing industry. This has been predominantly designed to win back the trust of the passengers and the drivers in the industry. Some of the astute features of Bitdrive are mentioned below  ❱❱❱ Completely Safe and Secure Since safety and privacy of the passengers are our utmost concern, we have addressed a lot of issues that have concerned passengers on our platform. Bitdrive has been developed with a number of safety-first features in order to assure passengers of the maximum safety while using the platform. As previously stated many women passengers have cited being uncomfortable with certain drivers. We have solved this persisting issue by giving an option for women passengers to opt for women drivers and every passenger will have an emergency button with which an urgent SOS message can be sent to the authorities and their pre-registered loved ones in case they smell any foul-play from the driver’s side. Bitdrive is following stringent security measures by incorporating maximum possible checks on drivers to ensure that only the fit and stable people with no history of criminal activity get the privilege of ferrying the people on its platform  ❱❱❱ Highly Economical We have designed the platform to be completely decentralized, unlike the present ridesharing giants which only serves the ultimate interest of its private investors and its board of directors. We passionately believe that ridesharing is a people’s industry and as such, it is the people who should have the final say in how it goes. One of the plus points of our platform is that no single entity will be in absolute control of the platform as both the drivers and passengers will have a level of say which must be considered a significant upgrade to the platform. Decentralization of services achieved by the Blockchain technology is the bedrock that makes this platform the ultimate transparent platform where no foul transactions will ever get processed and no one will ever get a raw deal. For drivers, the lack of intermediaries is proving beneficial to them as in all the transactions no one has to unjustly bear the earning less than the minimum wage as with the likes of Uber, and the absence of high charges means that the cost of ridesharing will finally be what it was originally conceived to be. Bitdrive is set to make ridesharing the most comfortable and most economical option for everyone involved and as it was meant to be in the first place.                        ❱❱❱Bitdrive Team❱❱❱",False
