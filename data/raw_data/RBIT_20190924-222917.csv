Some may consider the Admin's activeness in providing updates to gain trust. Some may gain trust by seeing that the Admin keeps his promises (e.g. sending the bounty tokens, distributing the profit shares). Some may only believe the project if they see the Team in a live interview. My question is, what is YOUR basis of ponzi vs legit project? Then we can discuss further.

Dear, the very point of my question is not to accuse you as a scammers. I am way over that activity these days. If your project turned to be legit, then congratulation, you contribute more to your community and you'll surely can easily answer my questions as I believe those aspect would already on the founding fathers' mind when they built the foundation, and if it wasn't, I didn't need to yell scam with bolded and capped letters as questions after questions about details will soon reveal what is legit and what is not. I've attended so many projects, ones that after several questions, the team decide to dissolve into thin air, as well as projects that the team can always deliver nice explanation, which in turn helps their investors to understand their project better.  And know that my orientation here is to help our community, the crypto community. I have one too many scamming project on my years that I didn't want others, especially newbies and the potential members, to fall into the same hole. If you're legit, I am more than ready to support you, help attending concerns on your thread despite I have no business, investment, or bounty on your project. But if the fact is the opposite, I'll be there too, to drill everything out. Or... just left you be, with enough evidence for people to conclude themselves if it's worth investing or not.  Mostly, I asked things that I can not find on your whitepaper, or things that I am still curios about, that I think would mostly also be on your future investors' mind. I voiced it, pointing things that can be and needed to be explained, essentials that perhaps forgotten when you build your whitepaper. My latest concern and ""help"" for you is how you convince other that you're not a ponzi project? Why should we trust you with our funds, that you won't run with it?  So, what do I expect?  A ""well, we are licensed company, you can track our legitimacy on..."" is very much welcomed.  A ""We would welcome any that curious and doubtful to attend to our office at our open house on.... and hopefully we can help attending your concern"" is well appreciated too, as office buildings, even a joined one, is a good physical evidence of a legit company with such a huge ambition as yours.  A ""We will lock certain amount of fund that is only accessible to third party to compensate the lost fund in case that we run"" is nice too.  But, a ""well, it is subjective"" is definitely not an expected answer coming from a community manager.  A ""you can look this previous post"" is acceptable, if it is related even at the very least. But it was not related. Or maybe you can help me by pointing out on which part of his post does my concern addressed.",False

I must say the argument make sense, although one or two might argue back that the predicted outcome will heavily dependent on project performance and token price nearing the event of snapshot. Just like your representative said, it is very possible that the price is worth more to be sold than to be held, and from this theory, there is a chance that the price increment will tempt an event of panic sell due to people wanting to sell at the current highest.  Nevertheless, I think it is safe to conclude that the decision of holding or buying will be dependent to the current price and performance. Going forward from this, team's performance, and especially as you on a heated debate of scam and not scam, it will be quite fair for people to start thinking and associating your project with ponzi scheme, as you ""ask"" people to buy your service with a promise of some return bi-weekly (and later on, monthly), which potentially will be very profiting for early investors, but will probably, gradually as the project proceeding, mimicking ponzi pyramid.  Thus, what I'd like to know more, is why should people believe in you? What things could help them sure that your project is not another ponzi? What could ensure them that once you gain interests and people start holding your token (simply put, you gain a lot of their money) you'll keep doing arbitrary and not running away with their funds?

Update 04.25.2018: Profit sharing is successful! Everyone got 0.00405161 ETH (approx US$ 2.50) per 1,000 RBIT!   R-Bit gives users access to a fully operational service that gives users variety in the way they trade and less risk when trading cryptocurrencies on exchanges. R-Bitâ€™s service to its token holders is based on arbitrage. So, what does this mean? The definition of Arbitrage is: the simultaneous buying and selling of currency in different markets to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset. R-Bit is simultaneously buying and selling bitcoin, ethereum and other cryptocurrencies in different markets to take advantage of the differing prices for the same assets.  Consistent Profits How easy is it to make profits with R-Bit? Simply hold the RBIT token in your wallet. To this day R-Bitâ€™s algorithm is bringing in returns averaging 20.5% per month. These returns were achieved consistently over 15 weeks of live testing. 100% of all profits will be distributed among RBIT Token holders each month.  Risk Management The cryptocurrency market is notoriously risky. R-Bit minimizes that risk. All trades are executed within seconds and do not depend on market direction. Previous and current market data are used in conjunction with the algorithm to increase the likelihood that every trade has a positive outcome  R-Bit Potential R-Bitâ€™s platform is built to accommodate growth and based on the way the cryptocurrency market is currently growing the RBIT token could potentially be traded for much more than $0.15 USD per token. R-Bit has already arranged for the RBIT Token to be traded on multiple exchanges immediately after the token sale but once traded the R-Bit platform will continue to grow and will hopefully give all future cryptocurrency enthusiasts access to the service  R-Bitâ€™s Arbitrage Algorithm was developed to profit in any market condition. R-Bitâ€™s team describes the algorithm as a bridge. A bridge connects two land masses and if the bridge were to break then no one would be able to travel back and forth. The R-Bit algorithm can be looked at in the same way. It connects exchanges to where profits can be made by buying on the exchange with the lower price and selling on the exchange with the higher price.   R-Bit is taking off and we want you to be a part of this amazing project while you have the chance. With 2 weeks finished in R-Bit's pre-sale and still 2 weeks remaining before the ICO sale starts R-Bit has already raised over $600,000 USD. Become a part of R-Bit today and benefit tremendously.
