DEPO is providing a Platform on Which Banks, Credit Institutions and P2P Lending Platforms can give loans in fiat currencies and accept all types of digital asset as collateral which means not only cryptocurrencies but also digital shares and bonds which are becoming more and more popular gradually.  Depository Network is not a loan provider but the bridge between Lenders and Borrowers whose purpose is to facilitate and maximize the whole process so that the it becomes easy, convenient and trustworthy for both sides.  We are providing Lenders with ""white label solution"" which basically means anyone can use our decentralized platform on his own and rebrand it and implement it in his own system so that i looks like he has full rights of it and like it is his own invention.

Every other project which is trying to operate in the same field is giving loans itself and storing collateral in itself. Everything there is happening on one centralized platform.  Depository Network is nowhere near that. We are the bridge between Lenders and Borrowers. We help both sides find what they are searching for: The Lenders are trying to spread their impact by dragging more customers and thereby increasing their market share whilst Borrowers are looking for a safe environment where they can receive a loan preferably from their favorite Lender.  Depository Network is making this happen by creating its DEcentralized Platform which will be used as a white label solution from Lenders. This means that every Lender himself can use the Platform and rebrand it as if it is his own invention, which saves a lot of money, time an energy for them. This also frees Depository Network of matters like regulation or data storage because the Lenders will take care of this depending on the country they are operating from.",False

This way, every owner of digital assets, holding coins or tokens supported by Depository Network, can pledge his assets as a collateral and receive a loan from a number of lending institutions. On the other hand, any lender, from anywhere in the world, will be able to build its own depository on Depository Network and start accepting digital assets as collateral. Thus, every lender will keep the collateral assets in a separate independent depository. All lenders define their own terms for acceptance, control and release of collateral. Loans will be provided independently from the Depository platform, in any currency supported by the respective lender.  Decentralization Our platform removes the need for state-owned, centralized depositories and allows any lending institution to build independent depositories within the system. We provide a network upon which different and independent Depository platforms can be built by every certified credit or bank institutions around the world.  Security To ensure the full security of our platform we use cryptographically secure multisignature wallets to store the assets, and smart contracts to execute the transactions. The borrower (owner of the assets) is always one of the key-holders whose signature is required to perform a transaction. Keys are also kept by the lender and DEPO so that none of the parties can act on its own discretion. Three, four or five multi-signature wallets will be used depending on the amount of collateral.  DEPO Oracle responds to queries by executing smart contract code —the business logic that runs on the DEPO smart contracts is the following: • Updates are replicated across participants • Authorized participants access data • Existence and validity of the record cannot be denied • All records are encrypted • Only those authorized with corresponding keys can view the data • Automate multi-party business processes. • Reduce the cost and risk associated with using intermediaries • Reduce risk of fraud and improve regulatory compliance • Increase auditability and trust",False

On a global scale, there are more than 50,000 banks, lenders organizations, consumer financing brokerage firms, cryptographic lending and P2P credit platforms. DEPO's goal is to reach a 5% customer market in the global lender market within 7 years. In the process, the Depository Network plans to establish a decentralized cryptographic asset assurance system by creating hundreds of collateral deposit platforms. Thus, a person who has a cryptographic parallax that is supported by the cryptographic paradigm, the Depository Network approach, will be able to borrow from various lenders, especially banks, by showing these assets as collateral. It will also be able to create its own savings on the lender's Depository Network anywhere in the world, and thus begin to accept crypt money as collateral. In this process, you first have to create your account, after you have created your account, you have to find someone who wants to do business with you. Separately from being a lender or borrower, you need to sign a contract to be created by the lender to decide how the process will work and how crypto money will be used as collateral.",False
