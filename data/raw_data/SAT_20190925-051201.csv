While the SAT token is ERC20, the branded tokens that are built on top of the SAT tokens are not. SAT tokens can be traded on exchanges while the branded tokens are limited for trade on the Sandblock ecosystem. Sandblock characterizes it as a “utility” token. France, where Sandblock is registered, has turned a corner on the cryptocurrency market and has been welcoming innovation, including ICOs. But they have yet to develop a regulatory framework for new tokens, including whether they should be classified as securities. Sandblock has assigned a hard cap of USD 8 million for its ICO at an exchange rate of 1 ETH = 3,000 SAT tokens. They accept Ethreum, bitcoin and bank cards, including Visa and Mastercard, as payment methods. The pre-sale is already 100% sold-out, suggesting there is great demand for the Sandblock project. The public crowdsale is scheduled for mid-May. Merchant and other partners are incentivized to join the Sandblock platform sooner than later, as the cost for doing so rises as the number of SAT tokens are depleted. Sandblock has capped the number of tokens at 55 million. Half of them will be offered for sale during the token generating event. The TGE will be split into four separate tiers, and any unsold tokens resulting from each tier will be burnt. Following the crowdsale, the number of SAT tokens will be fixed and unalterable. The rate for the SAT token decreases in each phase of the public crowdsale. The budget allocation isn’t bad, but there’s always a risk when a significant percentage of the fundraising will go toward development. In the case of Sandblock, the pre-ICO is a good indication they will raise the funds they require for product development.  Team Sandblock is a young startup that was only founded in 2017. They feature an eight-person management team on the website as well as a group of strategic advisers, who have an impressive track record for advising successful ICOs. Sarah-Diane Eck is the founder of Sandblock and face of the brand as head of marketing. She holds a “triple masters degree from the business school HEC, the engineering school AgroParisTech and the law university Pantheon-Assas (International Tax Law),” according to her biography. She also leads a French crypto-fueled charity where she is helping to shape the tax treatment of cryptocurrency donations. Fabrice Bascoulergue is a product lead at Sandblock and is also the co-founder of a company called Flashgap. He’s had experience with the development of mobile apps for more than 1 million users, so that should come in handy with the development of the Sandblock mobile app for iOS and Android. Jeremy Grenier is also on the engineering team.  Verdict The Sandblock project has the potential to resonate with consumers, given its focus on rewards programs as well as the anonymity of personal information. Major businesses have invested in successful loyalty rewards programs off- chain, and as more companies adopt the blockchain, Sandblock’s potential user base grows. But major brands might not want to relinquish control of their rewards/loyalty points and might be keen to develop their own proprietary token-fueled programs. With the exception of the partner firms that are already on board with the project, there’s not much of a precedent to determine if merchants will play nice.  Risks     Sandblock says it’s autonomous, yet it’s highly dependent on the participation of partner businesses and consumers for its success. -3     There are also many moving parts. For instance, it’s not just the Satisfaction token at play but also the tokens of the many channel partners that must take off in order for the project to flourish. If it catches on like Kohl’s Cash, great. But for that to happen, Sandblock must be successful not only attracting businesses that are already on the blockchain but perhaps eventually traditional retailers whose brands consumers know and trust. -2     The SAT token is being defined as a utility token. Considering that the partner tokens built on top of the SAT cryptocurrency will be assigned a value and are tradeable, however, it might resemble a security token to regulators. -3  Growth Opportunity     The more that the blockchain and cryptocurrencies make their way into the mainstream, the greater the growth potential for a project like Sandblock that is fueled by consumer activity. Sandblock already boasts several key partnerships across a potential 5 million customers and more than 1,000 shops and online retailers. The partner list includes ETHlend, Innovorder for payments, Europe’s movinga, retailer EspacePlaisir, fashion brand Artumes & Co and Blue Points, another merchant rewards startup. +3      Many major brands are evaluating how they can integrate the blockchain into their businesses, with companies ranging from Sony to Starbucks filing for patents and exploring investments, respectively. This activity bodes well for a platform like Sandblock that is fueled by other brands using their platform to reward consumers. +2     The Sandblock ecosystem is mobile-fueled with an app for both iOS and Android, which is sure to prove an attractive feature for millennials. +4     Successful pre-ICO could be a harbinger for similar results with the public crowdsale. +3     The management team is impressive and the list of veteran strategic advisers adds heft to the deal. +3  Disposition We arrive at a score of 7 out of 10 for the Sandblock ICO.

Joining the ecosystem requires that SAT be acquired. Before the launch of the ecosystem (late Q1 2018) a given amount of SAT will be made available through channels such as the pre-sale, the crowd-sale and bounty campaigns. After the launch, they will have to be traded on compatible exchanges.  Obviously, stakeholders that buy SAT during the pre-sale and crowd-sale will benefit from a much lower price as an incentive to bolster the start of the ecosystem.  Sandblock.io develops all the components of the infrastructure required to allow the ecosystem to function seamlessly, such as :  The decentralised Satisfaction Protocol Mobile applications for customers A desktop/web dashboard for merchants and other professional actors SDKs and widget/plugins to enable custom integrations in payment terminals and various e-commerce solutions so as to make integration as quick and easy as possible for everyone  While sandblock.io will steward the ecosystem in its early stages, our goal is to ultimately reach a point of equilibrium where the ecosystem can stand on its own and be governed by the partner merchants in a decentralised fashion.   The Satisfaction Protocol  The Satisfaction Protocol is the core, open source protocol of the Sandblock project, and underlies multiple sub-protocols, such as the Loyalty, Feedback and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) protocols. It is decentralised, based on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, and handles the project’s most important and sensitive aspects such as the economy balance, the rewards attributions as well as the various merchant rules.  The satisfaction Protocol relies on two types of crypto-currencies, the SAT token and the merchants token. SAT tokens are the fuel of the ecosystem and are universally tradeable (ERC20), while the merchant tokens are the abstraction built on top of the SAT that enable building loyalty and rewards programs and are captive to the Sandblock ecosystem.  The SAT acts as a bridge between the coalition of merchants (and their tokens) and the rest of the economy.  A business wishing to take part in the Sandblock Ecosystem will proceed according to the following steps:  Choose the name of its Merchants Tokens, preferably named after its brand. Decide the nominal value for its merchant tokens (e.g 1 SAT = 100 Merchant tokens) Lock/Stake a given amount of SAT to create its merchants tokens.  After they have been created, the Merchant token can be used within the framework of the various protocols and traded against tokens of other merchants by customers (with peer-to-peer transfer).   Peer-to-peer trading  The following schema shows the process by which a customer (C1) can exchange Merchant Tokens A (MTA) to a customer (C2) against other Merchant Tokens B (MTB). The SAT ratio of MTA is 1/10 and the SAT ratio of MTB is 1/100, MTB/MTA is equal to 1/10, therefore, C1 must send 10 times less tokens than C2 so that there is an equivalent amount of SAT being traded.                           Peer to peer merchant token transfer flow  The Feedback protocol handles the marketing research aspect of the Satisfaction protocol. It gives merchants the capability to seamlessly conduct research about the satisfaction of their customers and reward them for their engagement.  When setting up a feedback program, businesses can choose a type of feedback (review, 5-star rating, survey, etc), the subset of customers they want to target, the conditions of the feedback as well as the reward. Once validated, the feedback protocol generates a smart contract that will autonomously handle everything.  The Loyalty protocol handles the customer loyalty aspect of the Satisfaction protocol. It gives merchants the capability to easily setup and manage complex programs that reward their customers for their loyalty.  The power of smart contract enables all existing types of loyalty programs as well as previously unmanageable ones. The first type of loyalty program implemented will be a cash back scheme. The flexibility of the Loyalty protocol makes it possible to run loyalty programs with a degree of granularity previously only available to the biggest merchants, and for a fraction of the setup and administration resources. The smart contract generated will autonomously manage all aspects of the programs according to its parameters and will be immutable, so as to prevent the policy roll-backs and sunsetting that are common in some industries and harm customer trust in loyalty programs.  So as to ensure liquidity in the ecosystem, customers will be able to convert their merchant tokens to SAT, so as to switch to different loyalty programs. Contrary to the case of peer to peer exchange, trading one’s MT for SAT will incur fees as well as burn a small amount of SAT so as to guarantee the stability of the ecosystem, and prevent gaming its mechanisms      If you enjoyed this, please click the clap button and share to help others find it!

We believe that decentralized customer satisfaction (engagement, rewards, loyalty programs...) is a huge advantage for both merchants and customers. By using a decentralized protocol and the blockchain technology, merchants and brands can join a global coalition without having  to trust each other or pay for an expensive service to ensure the rules and balance of the partner network. They also can enjoy tradable cryptocurrency based rewards which is a huge evolution for this field where customers and merchants are often locked into a biased/unfair relationship.  I could go into further details if you like, but if you want to understand better why we decided to use blockchain technology, I advise you to read our white paper.",False
