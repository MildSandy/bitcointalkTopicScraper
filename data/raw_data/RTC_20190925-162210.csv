Under proof of work, miners may potentially own none of the currency they are mining and thus seek only to maximize their own profits.

The customers also base reviews on the actual use of a service.  Continuous, consistent customer acquisition Partners can assume, going by high user numbers, that new customers are being made aware of their companies via the company presentation in the Rateonium app in a scalable manner.  Individual company presentation opportunities Rateonium’s operating principle allows companies a variety of custom options, and the flexible rewards system gives them the opportunity to set themselves apart from their competitors  Extensive options for analysing reviews The  rating  algorithm  can  be  used  to  automatically  analyse  statistics  from  submitted reviews that are relevant for a given company.  In    the    course    of presenting these statistics, Rateonium can also be used for quality assurance in addition to customer acquisition. Each customer who submits a review becomes a quality controller at the same time.    Best regards,  Ana Lukovic  Communication Assistant Rateonium Limited",False

In individual cases, this leads to market distortion, manipulation and false decisions.  The cause of this defective rating process is usually the unlimited opportunity to submit reviews. In almost all portals, it is possible to publish reviews without providing any form of proof that the service of the respective company has been used. The specially developed RTO two-way verification is a world‘s first and the centerpiece of the Rateonium network. The submission of reviews only works with the aid of on-site verification via the Rateonium card.  By means of an electronically connected feedback system, the rating option of the specific user is only activated for the allocated company after a very brief time delay. By using the most innovative technology, Rateonium is able to offer its users a unique level of authenticity of verified user ratings.  For the first time, genuine reviews are possible across the board for companies in the Rateonium rating system, and the market distortion that can be caused by the misuse of reviews is prevented by the community.

Whether you will do your own research about the company?  We will work only with legit companies, so yes, we will do our due diligence!   Why should companies and community believe your rating?  The verifiability and authenticity of reviews are just as fundamental for companies as they are for consumers.  When looking at the rating systems currently available, it can be seen that in most cases there is no suitable way of checking reviews. In individual cases, this leads to market distortion, manipulation and false decisions.  The cause of this defective rating process is usually the unlimited opportunity to submit reviews. In almost all portals, it is possible to publish reviews without providing any form of proof that the service of the respective company has been used. The specially developed RTO two-way verification is a world‘s first and the centerpiece of the Rateonium network. The submission of reviews only works with the aid of on-site verification via the Rateonium card.  By means of an electronically connected feedback system, the rating option of the specific user is only activated for the allocated company after a very brief time delay. By using the most innovative technology, Rateonium is able to offer its users a unique level of authenticity of verified user ratings.

A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties. These transactions are trackable and irreversible.[1] Smart contracts were first proposed by Nick Szabo, who coined the term, in 1994.[2]  Proponents of smart contracts claim that many kinds of contractual clauses may be made partially or fully self-executing, self-enforcing, or both. The aim of smart contracts is to provide security that is superior to traditional contract law and to reduce other transaction costs associated with contracting. Various cryptocurrencies have implemented types of smart contracts.  You can google more Google is your friend",False

Some of the advantages & features of Rateonium: -The app system that  is based on the blockchain technology of the Rateonium network and offers highest user comfort in combination with multi-layered functionality. -Due to blockchain technology our system enables users to interact anonymously with each other, share their experiences about services and products and hereby creating a secure encrypted community. -The specially developed RTO two-way verification is a world’s first and the centerpiece of the Rateonium network. The submission of reviews only works with the aid of on-site verification via the Rateonium card. -Rateonium collects qualitative and individual consumer data for companies, while the respective consumer is rewarded at the same time with the Rateonium currency by means of an automated algorithm. -Rateonium is an interactive network that even while it provides many advantages for companies, still meets the needs of users, values the role they play, and protects their data.

Since the foundation of Rateonium we have worked worldwide to build up a huge business partner network. Meanwhile we have cooperations on five continents which include for example the sectors of gastronomy, local and long-distance traffic, the aviation industry, blockchain based projects, the automotive industry as well as the travel and hotel industry.  Our partners will be published after the app development has been completed and shortly before the system startup. This prevents customers from influencing the token sale. Furthermore, the announcement of the companies would give their competition an opportunity to take appropriate steps to compensate for the competitive advantage.  Current review system is severely flawed (personal data is passed on,no adequate rewards for ratings due to a lack of incentives, only dissatisfied customers submit reviews etc) and Rateonium solves all those issues.

In individual cases, this leads to market distortion, manipulation and false decisions.  The cause of this defective rating process is usually the unlimited opportunity to submit reviews. In almost all portals, it is possible to publish reviews without providing any form of proof that the service of the respective company has been used. The specially developed RTO two-way verification is a world‘s first and the centerpiece of the Rateonium network. The submission of reviews only works with the aid of on-site verification via the Rateonium card.    Best regards,  Ana Lukovic  Communication Assistant Rateonium Limited",False
