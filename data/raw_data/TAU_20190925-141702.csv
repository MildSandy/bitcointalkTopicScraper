What we can do is to make it harder to obtain 51%.  In the Proof of Work, if the super power such as member of G20 wants to secure 51% of computing power, it is possible through investment into factory. In the proof of stake, the stake could be purchased.  I would love to argue the most hard resource to build is “time” rather than equipment and money. In a fixed blocksize blockchain, the transactions are actually time.  Assuming long range attack is contained by checkpoints, once POT blockchain lives 10 years, in order to secure 51% POT power, one need to either secure enough other miner’s private keys to get power or build your own power for 10 years. The older the chain, the harder to achieve due to time can not be created. In POS and POW, the vintage of chain does not contribute enough into security.  TAU focuses on mobile node to make more people able to mine and secure the chain. We recently removed the mining club to make 51% formation harder. For a currency, security is everything.

Time?  It seems to be natural that blockchain ledger grows along with time recording transactions, and time is the creators of order in transactions. However, on decentralized network, there is never consensus on time accuracy. Time signal as off-chain information can be fake. Just like in human body, it is not “time” to drive biological aging, but gene mutation collectively drives aging. Gene mutation just happens along with time. I propose the true driver of block growing, or “aging”, is transactions them-self. Most of blockchain projects are using specific time interval to create next block ranging from 10 minutes in BTC to seconds in EOS. I found the specific time is not an elegant parameter. TAU team will look at using pure transactions to drive block grow rather than time. A formula in development will not use time but transaction fee accumulation as interval. Our goal is to make Tau block chain grow at automatic interval, automatic size and automatic history weight window. -iMorpheus",False

Many transactions within 60 seconds arrive transaction pool, exceeding 1MB block size capacity. Tau allow miners to generate block when they collected 5000 transactions(a.k.a 1MB). Replacing the idea of counting timer C, we use transaction counters before 60 seconds. When: (Base x transaction number counter x Weight > randomness), that miner can generate block. Both transaction and time counter reset. 2. NO enough transaction within 60 seconds. Time counter becomes effective. When the chosen miner not able to accumulate 5000 transactions, it can generate block when 60 seconds passed. The benefits for above design is the more transactions the faster the chain processing transactions. However, there might be malicious miners want to destroy the chain by generating unlimited transactions to keep blockchain bloating. The way to resist this attack is to limit block number per minute, we can start with 10 blocks maximum per minute. When community feels it is too slow, club leaders can vote on chain using their weight to increase by signal transaction. Under same spirit, we can ask club leaders to vote reduce the time interval from 60 seconds downwards on chain. In summary, TAU will venture into remove specific time interval on block generation. -iMorpheus",False

In seeking of most pervasive, indisputable and decentralized information to protect blockchain progressing, I found holders daily economical behavior, transactions through out history, is a good candidate. Transaction data takes most of size on the public ledger. Using majority blockchain information to protect its own security seems to be nature and logical. Its most efforts goes to protect itself. Transaction history to protect the blockchain future. I am personally enlightened by POW, proof of work. However, applying following thought, I found a problem. When bitcoin network value hit trillion, some of G20 governments will not feel convenient. It is possible to use nuclear power plan to run ASIC rigs to form up 51% computing power in short period to make chain not able to grow. The root of this possibility is from two elements: one, hardware arms race favors G20, two, historical data does not contribute to the security. So that G20 can summit power in short time window to win the battle such as nuclear attack to region, quick and fast. The same situation is more vulnerable in POS, proof of stake. Governments can biologically secure the key stake holders using some top guns in the army. Holders can be forced to burn all the coins, which is going to waste the valuable blockchain token. In proof of transaction situation, it is still possible but harder for government to build 51% attack. One needs build transactions dominance in one year time frame, this is not short time achievable event. Second is transactions are pervasively generated from holders all over the world disregard the coins holding amount, there is no way someone can capture 51% holders population. This gives hope to proof of transaction family likely to be the ultimate base for decentralized blockchain consensus. The risk of POT is also clear that if powerful entity coming to build up transaction numbers to gain more mining weight through long time. My proposal to resist it by auto block size and auto block generation time. I called it project iMorpheus, same as my medium ID. The general assumption is that when someone to build waste transactions, they want to spend low transaction fee then normal. When miners codes found transaction fee is lowering, then generation time will shrink to reduce the number of low cost transactions. This idea is still in nutshell, looking forward to debate.",False
