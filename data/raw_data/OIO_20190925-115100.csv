Maybe a non-staff high ranked member here can give their input an possible reasons for the below?  If some of you could it would be very much appreciated.    Here is what I find strange (I am not making any accusations just pointing out some things that I have observed)  Their ICO was apparently sold out, over $50 Million USD, and their ERC20 contract has over 15 thousand addresses https://etherscan.io/token/0xa3efef1a1e3d1ad72b9d0f4253e7c9c084c2c08b  And they are following their road-map and afaik have not missed any deadlines.  Most ICO ratings websites gave them 4+ stars, so again very good.  So reading the above you would think, all good this is a project with legs and with some potential.  But.....  1.  No one seems to talk about the project online? 2.  Their Telegram has 23 thousand members but there is NEVER any conversation about the project, and nothing close to any in-depth conversations, just the odd comment here or there? 3.  They have 38 thousand followers on Twitter but no one talks or has conversations there either?  4.  On their Facebook page there are posts that receive 2 or 3 thousand likes but no one comments?  And most of the likes are seemingly from India.  (TBH it actually looks like they have paid a click farm for the Facebook likes)   So with that said, can some please explain why this would be?  Does anyone else notice the same? Is anyone posting in this thread actually invested in OIO?  Thank you.",False

Best regards  Quote from: Nivia1st on February 09, 2019, 06:44:05 PM Quote from: Online.io on February 09, 2019, 07:37:49 AM Hello Everyone,  If anyone has any questions about the project or wants to hear the latest news i suggest you join our Telegram group where we post information. We are currently working very hard on the public blockchain along with the Mobile solution for the application which will include also a Residential VPN which will remove any censorship from any country in the world, even from China, Russia, etc. When we will release the VPN it will be connected to over 30M residential IPs and offer IPs from any country and city in the world. Regarding the Exchange, until we are not ready with the full solution we are not interested in listing the token. We are very confident that once we release the solution it will be used by Millions of people and demand for the token will be very big. We prefer doing the solution first then focus on exchanges. Our Extensions for Browsers has already over 20,000 active users and it's growing daily natural without any paid marketing. Once we have the full solution we will also start our global marketing campaign which we expect to bring at least 1M users in the first month.  Best regards  yes you're right, now it's better to focus on developing until the platform is released, exchange is the next destination. so investors must keep holding until the service is ready for use. Congratulations on your achievements, having 20K active users is extraordinary when the service isn't fully working.  Thank you for the support, I promise we will handle the exchanges after the solution is released.  Best regards",False

ICO ended at the end of July but it's a pity they raised $50m but have not even listed the token on a good exchange which could have prevented it from dumping and low rates. I get it it that the product should be primed concern but since they are planning on releasing the Alpha version of the OIO Blockchain in the second quarter of this year, I think the team should not wait till then to list OIO on a good exchange. They must target at least 1 top exchange before the release of the blockchain. Low volume exchanges are killing the potential of OIO token. As of writing this I see on coinmarketcap that OIO's last 24 hour volume is a mere $277!

It generates random numbers (wait time) on miner’s nodes and then chooses the node with the lowest number. So, it works like a lottery but with more complex algorithm designed to provide more optimizations. Intel promises that this algorithm cannot be broken by external actions and provides honest consensus model. This makes PoET perfect for private Blockchain when you need performant distributed storage and don’t want to force your hardware to make complex computations.

If ""your lawyer"" would like a word with me, why hasn't he reached out to me on Telegram, or my email?  You know both, because you and your team have directly reached out to me, begging me to take that YouTube video down that exposes what you did, yet there is no lawyer reaching out to me. https://imgur.com/a/74TYI5r   Yet another blatant lie from Mr. Fraudulent himself.  Just like when you directly threatened us, your major investors, with ""jail time"", or when you threatened to ""call the authorities"" on me via Telegram, when you knew you had no evidence of any blackmail from us. https://imgur.com/a/LFExhlt  Yet you never posted that same screenshot you always use of ""musclepump"" from November, 2018 in our Telegram chat, because you knew we were separate investors, and you knew that was another lie.  Just consider the fact that no random scammer would work this hard to expose you and your teams' corruption, unless those people lost hundreds of thousands of dollars by your criminal acts, and were threatened, attacked, and falsely accused under the numerous false accounts you created, to try and cover up what you did.  What you and your teams' have done, defrauding your investors, will catch up to you.  Must be nice to play with other peoples' money, while you lie to them, and try to walk away.

Notice another new BTC Talk account is created with simply ""Online.io"".  Not even a name or position, so definitely another false account by Sebastian Dracopol.  Notice his own CEO doesn't post again, ""defending"" him, and that's all Sebastian Dracopol can cite.  He avoids LGBTQ's direct question.  You guys at Online.io are now accomplices to assisting Sebastian Dracopol cover up what he has done, and you know it because we spoke with you before this ICO.  What's that feel like to lie directly to your own Online.io community to make more $$$?        How disgusting.  You guys at the Online.io team, know what Sebastian Dracopol and his MNE/ARTE Devs have done to drefraud us of our investments, and I have proven that I myself am one of the major investors in Artemine, on the original Artemine thread.  He and his Devs have many new, false accounts they go by on BTC Talk, since they love to hide their real identity when attacking their major investors they defrauded, intentionally.  We have shown in the videos and screenshots, without a doubt, that Sebastian Dracopol is directly involved in the Artemine project; since he used his full name and the Online.io logo on his Telelgram.  As was explained, he changed the logo and his name once I caught him because he knew their Online.io ICO was abou to launch and did not want to be associated with a failed project, or what it looks like more is a blatant fraud.  He and his Devs are behind all three:  Minereum, Dynereum, and Artemine.  The scheme is they promote other projects like Dynerium and Artemine to help get the Minereum that was worth value, out of their investors' hands; and also pump up the price Minereum so that they may continue to self-mine Minereum for free and sell it on the Livecoin.io exchange to make more $$$.  https://etherscan.io/address/0xf032ce9b154be7329c4c7c8f0031d15aeff451ee#tokentxns   When this was posted in the original Minereum thread, they immediately shut it down to hide it, and have self-censoring threads:  Original Minereum Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1867535.8840  Original Artemine Thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2153950.1960  Since they have censored their own major investors from Telegram, and BTC Talk, they have forced us to post here in the Online.io, much more often to raise awareness of what has happened.  Unforntunately for them, everything is documented on these threads, on the ETH (ERC20) blockchain, and so on just building more evidence for our case against Sebastian Dracopol and his Devs.  After all the evidence shown down below, and they way they have treated their own investors by defrauding them, censoring them, threatening them, and lying to their own communities, these seem to be clear signs of criminal activity, not just some random failed project they tried to make a success.  Investors please go through the evidence for yourselves, and don't take my word for it.  They will say it's ""photoshopped"", and that's why I made a video to prove that it's not, we have been a step ahead of them at every turn in this attempted cover-up by Sebastian Dracopol, his Devs, and even his own Online.io CEO.    Now we see Sebastian Dracopol is will to drag everyone down with him for his own selfish gains.  Actions speak louder than words.  Since Sebastian Dracopol and company want to continue to cover up what has happened we will have our contacts in Europe who invested with his projects, look into taking these matters more seriously; however, we will definitely not stop spreading the word about what has taken place for the safety of other investors.

Regarding online.io team response:   Online.io CEO stated very clear here  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3452258.msg40137125#msg40137125 , quoting also the Artemine team statement, that I do not have anything to do with these false claims.  Artemine team also posted this, explaining without any doubt that i don't have any involvement in their core team, as developer, CEO or otherwise: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2153950.msg40360434#msg40360434  Also, my linkedin profile is posted on out website at online.io, proving that I am a real person, not some Lex Luthor or some dark masterminds as whoever is hiding behind those profiles is claiming. Don't hesitate to ask for his identity also!  Regarding the real situation behind all these claims from Space Cowboy aka Dan the Man aka LGBTQ aka Musclepump aka Joeybeaver1   Whoever is behind Dan the Man, Joeybeaver1, LGBTQ , Space-Cowboy1, musclepump accounts, is ignoring any rational explanation/dialogue and keeps spreading false information and FUD based on 5 screenshots that they turned into a movie. Is like I message you everyday to tell you that you are the CEO of a construction company because you have ""construction"" in your nickname, and i have a screenshot that proves it!  Now, lets change a bit the angle and think about this from a different perspective: If you would have a real proof that somebody did something illegal  and punishable by the law 100%, would you hide behind some forum nicknames and claim it over and over, or would you go against that person through the law? Also, if you have such evidence, why hiding behind some forums users?  Maybe because some investors from the very project he keeps saying he represents the investors - Artemine - complained here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2153950.msg40443236#msg40443236 that he was asking for BTC in order to stop the spam there and delete his own posts. Cheap, just 2 BTC )  Is very easy to invent stories about real life people while hiding behind nicknames, so this person comes here daily and keep asking the same questions over and over, even if I answered many time before, to each of them. Please check the previous posts here.  Also is amazingly how he started to complain EXACTLY when our online.io ICO started. There is no coincidence here.  Hope that this helps, please don't hesitate to ask any question, we have nothing to hide here at online.io!  Thank you!  Best regards,  Seb  Online.io - Development Manager",False

Now he and his devs have gone even further, because they are desperate to cover up what they did with their investors' funds in Artemine after February, 2018 when their roadmap ended; and also cover up the fact that Sebastian Dracopol is directly involved in the Online.io project.  So they decided to post my Twitter account in the Artemine thread, in hopes that I will be scared from speaking out about their fraudulent behavior in the Crypto Space, because they have nothing on myself, since I have done nothing illegal, nor ethically wrong; but they certainly have. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2153950.1940  They did this after realizing I will not be scared by their prior threats towards myself on the Artemine thread, under ""Neal_Astartes"".  Then the Artemine ""team"" comes out on the thread for the second time in the last few days right after ""Neal_Astartes"" to soley defend Sebastian Dracopol, but not give any status to what has happened with the Artemine project.  Both accounts belong to the same people, which has been made obvious.  They have constantly lied, distracted, and deceived both the Online.io and Artemine communities.  It does not pleasure me to say this, believe it or not, we have nothing against the Online.io project; but we certainly do against Sebastian Dracopol, and his teammates who have tried help him cover up what he has done so they can take more investors' money by smearing us, threatening us, and directly lying to the Online.io and Artemine communities.  Crypto Space should be based on transparency, not lies.  Again I ask a simple question, what did you do with our funds Sebastian Dracopol and Devs?  Still they try avoid and distract their own communities, how pathetic and truly sad.  Be extremely careful investing any kind of money with anything Sebastian Dracopol is connected with, don't end up like us with Artemine.  If he and his devs are willing to go this far to cover up what they have done with Artemine, what do you think they will do with your investments?  Again, their actions have spoken louder than their words.

As expected, a lot of individuals are not very happy about this and they try to do their best to cast doubt on us, targeting me as Development Manager, please find my profile on our page https://online.io/ is all public, nothing to hide!  Whoever is behind Dan the Man, Joeybeaver1, LGBTQ , Space-Cowboy1, musclepump accounts, is ignoring any rational explanation/dialogue and keeps spreading false information and FUD based on 5 screenshots that they turned into a movie. Is like I message you everyday to tell you that you are the CEO of Microsoft because you have Outlook in your nickname, and i have a screenshot that proves it! )  Now, lets change a bit the angle and think about this from a different perspective: If you would have a real proof that somebody did something illegal  and punishable by the law 100%, would you hide behind some forum nicknames and claim it over and over, or would you go against that person through the law? Is obvious that all those claims are false!  Is very easy to invent stories about real life people while hiding behind nicknames, so this person comes here daily and keep asking the same questions over and over, even if I answered many time before, to each of them. Please check the previous posts here.  Also is amazingly how he started to complain EXACTLY when our online.io ICO started. There is no coincidence here.  Hope that this helps, please don't hesitate to ask any question, we have nothing to hide here at online.io!  Thank you!  Best regards,  Seb  Online.io - Development Manager",False

As they read this post, they know it.  The evidence I provided shows without a doubt Sebastian Dracopol is directly involved in Artemine, and they he and his devs are directly lying, threatening, and harrasing their major investors on the Artemine thread under ""Neal_Astartes"", a new BTC Talk account.  I proved it was them because they posted my Twitter account reaching out to Telegram, since Sebastain Dracopol banned myself from Artemine telegram thread, only he and his devs would know that.  Also, he is trying to pretend that we are all the same person when we are not, that can be seen by our various writing styles.  He and his devs have run out of deceitful tactics to cover up what they have done with Artemine, to look good for the Online.io ICO.  Anyone reading these posts can go through the material I provided on both threads and see we are major investors; and that Sebastian Dracopol and his Devs have directly threatened us through false BTC Talk accounts, that's why I continue to post, to raise awareness in the Crypto Space of this kind of behavior.  This will not go away Sebastian Dracopol, you and your teammates on both teams know exactly what we are talking about.  What's it feel like to be a liar, and a fraudster, while taking investors' money?

If he truly cared about the Online.io community he would have been out here earlier to help support investors and participants.  His only interest is to selfishly covering up his direct involvement in the Artemine project; and how he poses under false, new BTC Talk accounts to smear his major investors in the Artemine project.  Here you can see him pose as ""Neal_Astartes"" on the Artemine thread. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2153950.msg40322380#msg40322380  Instead of being transparent, and and coming forth about what has been happening behind the Artemine project he has done the complete opposite, and even worse has had certain teammates help him out.  Here is the current Artemine Telegram thread, look at these concerned investors with no support from Seb and the Artemine team. https://imgur.com/a/cPkUJFh  They only come out on BTC Talk (under false accounts) or on Telegram when it's time to cover something up, like in this screenshot, when they knew we were major investors, and banned us.  They banned their own major investors, because Sebastian Dracopol knew the truth would get out.  Just look at all those ""smiley faces"".  That's the most he's ever written on that thread, lol. https://imgur.com/a/0FUsI6C  If this is how he behaves towards major investors on the Artemine project, what do you think he will do with your investments?  Something to seriously consider.  For the record, I have proven on the Artemine thread I am a major investor, and this is the only account I am writing from.  Here is the confirmation of the transaction for 1 ARTE proving I am who I say I am of 1 ARTE sent to the address provided: https://ethplorer.io/tx/0xa2f30c0bd6a09e3d219632e53f968b420854cda41817d89fc9e9e2e5eb88d8a2  Unlike Sebastian Dracopol, I do not waste my time attempt to deceive investors and the Crypto community by creating false accounts to cover up misdeeds.  I will gladly warn other Crypto Space investors about this kind of negative behavior, even if we have already lost ours, due to his and his team's deceit, on the Artemine project.

Now he and his devs have gone even further to create a new, false account and threaten myself, a major investor, with ""going to jail"" under false accusations that I'm trying to ""blackmail"" them for 1 or 2 BTC?  How pathetic.  Why would a major investor in Artemine who has proven he has 4.3 million ARTE being mined attempt to risk everything to gain 1 or 2 BTC?  Lol, this is so sad, it's funny.  Now they have even gone as far as threatening to expose my offline identity, again under false accusations they personally know are FALSE.  Just take a look at the Artemine thread where they are treating me like this, and take this as a warning that you as an investor should definitely not be involved with Sebastian Dracopol and his Devs, after they have displayed this kind of negative behavior with no explanation of what's really happening to our investments.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2153950.1940   Best,  Dan   Here is there threats, and my response from the Artemine thread to make it clear what they have done to me and others as major investors of Artemine:  https://imgur.com/a/N2AcsGT",False

Regarding the real situation:   I never mistreated any investors, because i was never involved in Artemine core team or ICO, it wasn't my project and i was just an investor and part of community, as you are here on online.io.  Whoever is behind Dan the Man, Joeybeaver1, LGBTQ , Space-Cowboy1, musclepump accounts, is ignoring any rational explanation/dialogue and keeps spreading false information and FUD based on 5 screenshots. Is like I tell you everyday that you are a part of Snow Patrol band because you have snow in your nickname and i have a screenshot with this!  Is very easy to invent stories about real life people while hiding behind forum nicknames, so this person comes here daily and keep asking the same questions over and over, even if I answered many time before, to each of them. And i answer now again.  All this started when Dan the Man aka Space-Cowboy1 was banned last month on Artemine chat for spam, this is what he calls bad treatment for investors. Ironically Telegram banned him also 2 days ago for same reason: https://imgur.com/a/236B2oi  Also, even if all this drama took place last month, is amazingly how he started to complain EXACTLY when our online.io ICO started, posting that movie and starting all this FUD.

Why doesn't he mention how he constantly banned and censored Artemine investors from the Artemine Telegram thread and only told them to ""Stop the FUD"" when the Artemine project was already at the bottom with ZERO marketing, and ZERO communication to its investors after Feburary 2018?  Why doesn't he mention how he changed his Telegram identity to cover up his connection from Artemine to Online.io, as was shown in the video? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnb4bbLXnRY  Screenshots of the Conversation with Sebastian Dracopol: https://imgur.com/a/jbnTw7k  Screenshots of Seb trying to play victim, and get the evidence removed; as well as, him lying to his investors on the Artemine thread to cover his deceit up: https://imgur.com/a/LFExhlt  Why doesn't he also mention how he himself, and others working under him go under false accounts to smear his own investors, and cover up his involvement in the Artemine thread, and on here?  He even was dumb enough to use the same writing style under various accounts until I called him out for it, and he deleted those comments. Wow.  I have been nothing but transparent with the Crypto Space community and its investors; how about you Sebastian? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2153950.msg40248995#msg40248995  There are far larger investors who are quite dissapointed and concerned at the negative behavior he and his underlings have displayed, and if no solution is shown for the Artemine community quite soon, they will begin to get involved; and they do have far more influence and connections in the Crypto Space.  That is not a threat, nor blackmail, nor harrassment; it's real investors who are finished being lied to, smeared, and censored by someone who took their investments.  Sebastian Dracopol and company did this to themselves, when he could have simply been more transparent in the beginning, unless he and the others have been hiding something they don't want their investors to know, as is shown by his and their actions.  I been nothing but professional with Sebastian until he banned myself from the Artemine Telegram thread for questioning the status of Artemine; and the evidence provided speaks for itself, don't take my word for it.  These are questions that need to be answered now, to the Artemine community at large.  No more lies and deceit from Sebastian Dracopol, he, the Online.io team members, and Artemine devs knows exactly what he did, since we spoke directly to them directly before the launch of the Online.io ICO.  Sebastian Dracopol and company doesn't mind playing with other peoples' money/investments, and not showing transparency.  He thinks he's untouchable when it comes to mishandling others' investments, which he has been finding out much to his dismay, he is not.  For those working with Sebastian Dracopol, consider the fact that he did this to himself; and you might want to rethink your professional relationship with such a person who has displayed such negative behavior in the Crypto Space, which is not needed, nor welcome.  Keep in mind he rather protect himself, than selflessly remove himself from the Online.io and Artemine projects, so that they maintain some sort of positive reputation for investors and participants.  That speaks volumes.  Here he is lying directly to the Artemine community when he knew I was a major investor in Artemine, and banned me from the Telegram thread: https://imgur.com/a/0FUsI6C  To the specific Online.io team members that have had nothing to do with this, we are truly sorry to you guys, that you have such an individual on your team, and we know you know what we are talking about because you have seen it unfold behind the scenes.    Sebastian Dracopol has given up on the smears because he knows we are far smarter than that, and all he has left is the typical ""customer service"" reply and directly lying to the Online.io community about his direct oversight of Artemine; instead of any real answers to his Artemine investors.  Again this kind of negative, fraudulent behavior should not be welcome in the Crypto Space, nor will it be.  Best, Dan",False

I'm posting this to warn any potential crypto investors what happened to us in the Artemine community by Sebastian Dracopol, Head of Development for the Online.io community.  We have lost a lot of money, and you have been warned.    Lets set the record straight on this situation with Seb, the Artemine project, and the Online.io ICO that Seb is the Head of Development for.  First off, I was the one who made that video because I reached out to the Artemine Admin on Telegram, which Seb served as; and to the supposed Artemine ""team"" via email, like he suggested, and no one ever responded back.  After numerous emails, and keep in mind I am one of the top holders of Artemine; but to make it clear I don't expect special treatment, and many of us investors in this project were quite patient.   The Artemine roadmap ends at February 2018, and there have been no further updates of any sort.  It seems that the Minereum project went quite well at first, and then those tokens of real value were to be invested into the Artemine ICO; which seemed to do weel at first, but drastically took a wrong turn somewhere from the behavior exhibited by Seb Dracopol and this ""team"".   Seb Dracopol has constantly attempted to deny he has any direct involvement in this project, yet it has been proven he has been the main admin for the Minereum and Artemine Telegram threads; and that he constantly censors and bans concerned investors to cover up the fact there is nothing happening with this project.  He also admitted this in the conversation he had with me by ""cleaning up"" the thread.  If he was a mere volunteer, why would he be allowed to treat the Artemine community after they invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into this project, like he has, for so long?  It doesn't make sense.  Plus, he hides his involvement on the LinkedIn account, and anywhere else because the Online.io ICO just launched; so him and the Online.io team doesn't want anyone to know about this dead project, that seems to have take everyone's money.  I finally went ahead and called him out on it directly, so he banned me from the Artemine thread, then he ignored me when I tried reaching out to him.  The only reason he talked to me after that conversation is because I had proof he tried to hide his identity on Telegram.  He is truly an arrogant piece of shit, that doesn't mind manipulating and taking money from his investors and then turning around and censoring them.  This kind of negative behavior will no longer be tolerated by the Artemine and Crypto Community.  If he and his underlings exhibit this type of negative behavior here, what do you expect they will do with your investments in any project in the future?  Think about it.  Here is the evidence, and by the way I am NOT a spammer, and I am NOT paid opposition.  I am also NOT blackmailing or harrasing anyone, I along with many other investors who were screwed over in this project want justice to be done for these grievous actions carried out by Seb Dracopol, and his colleagues who tried to smear our image under newly created fake accounts.  There is nothing in it for me to ""attack"" what seems to be a dead project; especially when I'm one of the major investors, but I will do everything I can to help others from falling into the same trap.  Video of Seb Dracopol treating myself and others rudely and changing his ID on Telegram: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cnb4bbLXnRY&t=2s  Screenshots of that very same conversation with the Online.io logo and his full name on that Telegram account: https://imgur.com/a/jbnTw7k  Screenshots of Seb Dracopol trying to threaten getting the ""authorities"" on me, to try and make me remove the evidence of what he did: https://imgur.com/a/LFExhlt  Email Correspondence of the Artemine ""team"" still lying to me about Seb Dracopol to cover up his negative behavior, while smearing us publicly: https://imgur.com/a/74TYI5r  Why is it they never responded to concerned investors on this thread until now?  And only to cover for Seb Dracopol and company?  Think about it.  Actions speak louder than words, and we need justice for this kind of negative behavior in the Crypto Space.  Now you know, and you have been warned, if there's anything left of this project they need to completely remove Seb Dracopol from it, and be more transparent with the Artemine community, not lie, smear, censor, and try to cover up wrong-doings.  It's extremely dissapointing that it's had to come to this, but they have forced my hand to speak up for all of us investors into Artemine and the Crypto Space.  So the real question is, what have they done with all of our money?  What have they done the hundreds of thousands of dollars, euros, etc; while they censored and banned us?  We need to find out, now, not later.  No more lies.",False

Coins are distributed based on the proof that the user was doing some specific action for a rather long period of real time. Proof of time algorithm was invented by Intel and it is mainly associated with their hardware platform that provides very fast consensus model. It generates random numbers (wait time) on miner’s nodes and then chooses the node with the lowest number. So, it works like a lottery but with more complex algorithm designed to provide more optimizations. Intel promises that this algorithm cannot be broken by external actions and provides honest consensus model. This makes PoET perfect for private Blockchain when you need performant distributed storage and don’t want to force your hardware to make complex computations. The only minus is the restriction on Intel’s platform (Sawtooth Lake). The proof-of-elapsed time has not become popular and well adopted yet. But in the near future it may be intensively developed. Future adoptions may not be the exact algorithm designed by Intel, but rather some variations of the concept.""",False

Quote from: kalehon on May 07, 2018, 07:02:07 PM So what is the purpose of the tokens?  I understand you are raising money for the development of the app but what would someone use these tokens for? Quote from: Tyrannah on May 06, 2018, 04:04:48 PM Why do you need both ICE and OIO ?  OIO are the tokens sold at the Token Generation Event and generated only once. They are the fuel for our ecosystem, website operators that will integrate our solution will require staking OIO tokens in order to mine ICE tokens using the proof-of-online algorithm. OIO Token holders that are not website operators will still be able to earn ICE tokens by using the Proof-of-Stake algorithm and keeping the OIO tokens in a smart contract. A good example is NEO which is required to generate GAS. ICE tokens will be integrated into our merchant system, more details about that can be found in our whitepaper.  Quote from: WillerTex on May 06, 2018, 04:26:25 PM How many tokens you plan to sell during private sale?  If you can disclose that info of course  If all tokens will be sold at private then the Pre and Public Token Generation Event won't take place. You can buy the OIO tokens from the exchanges after the TGE is over if you didn't managed to buy.  Quote from: PlanetCrypto on May 07, 2018, 03:01:04 PM This is a challenging project, the traditional Internet search engine will have a big impact, like a BAT before the project, in fact, people in the use of BAT browser when encryption can also get some money, this is a very good promotion and selection, the OIO's prospects are very seductive. Quote from: Endimyon on May 06, 2018, 06:36:29 PM I was doing some research and from what I was able to see it seems that BAT would be the main competitor, seems to me they are doing exactly those things that OIO is trying to do.  Brave ( BAT ) it's actually a browser while our solution comes with extensions for all major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE and also applications for mobile. Brave shows certain ads that comply with their policy while we DON'T show any ads. Our solution also brings a new revenue stream for the website operators and earn ICE tokens without having to show their visitors any ADS so they can focus more on the quality of their content, websites.

""  I am very interested in this part - how do you plan to achieve it?  Historically, users had to pay a visible or hidden fee to browse the Internet, the most popular methods of payment currently in use are Advertising, Ecommerce and Subscription. There are no/or at least next to none/truly free sites currently operating, even Wikipedia asks for donations from its user base.  Our solution brings a new revenue stream for the website operators that integrate our solution and offer their visitors access to a website without Ads, Trackers, Malware while at the same time earn ICE tokens for their visitors based on time spent on the website. End users will be able to navigate on websites that won't show any Ads or have Trackers, Malware. There will also be Extensions for all popular browsers, mobile applications which will be free for the end users. By creating an ecosystem when ICE tokens are generated from the User's engagement to the content of the website operators, the website operators can generate profits by selling the ICE tokens and the users benefit from an ad-free, private, secure internet browsing experience. In essence, ICE tokens represent the exchange of value between user's interaction, and the content provided.  More information can be found on our website and whitepaper, check also our explainer video. https://online.io  Best wishes  Alexandru Iulian Florea CEO & Founder Online.io Blockchain Technologies ltd  ",False
