Good question. All content placed by rights holders or independent movie producers will be cryptographically protected, using MoviesChain by TVzavr’s own Digital Rights Management (DRM) system based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128).  What if someone records the film off screen and then distributes it elsewhere?   It's interesting how two of my questions were ignored.  I understand that some questions might not be comfortable, but I'm curious how are you going to preserve the filmmakers interests in terms of piracy and competition.  Because from the two questions I asked it may be reasonable to think that these 2 main issues are not solved and the company just uses blockchain to create an ICO, and in reality it's just technology change and upgrade, but not the solution to those 2 problems.  I hope you can answer these. Thank you.",False

This brings the audience closer to a good movie, and the filmmakers closer to fame. MoviesChain by TVzavr’s blockchain technology is now ready to address the needs and interests of the independent film industry. By eliminating third-party in the distribution of content, such as platform providers and royalty collection services, blockchain technology importantly offers up the markets directly to independent film producers and copyright owners. The technological advances of blockchain can more effectively and securely reset pricing, direct advertising, handle revenue sharing and royalty payment processes. With the decentralized platform of blockchain technology, payments and advertising revenues will no longer be collected by a centralized authority, such as a traditional brick-and-mortar bank, thus payment transactions will be less costly. The distribution of revenues will now instead be automated with pre-defined smart contracts. More details about this can be read in the White paper.",False

A Ricardian contract is both readable by humans as well as can be compiled by a computerized machine in ways that both machine and human agree on how to execute the contract. On an executive level, Ricardian contracts are traditionally legal documents that have several components, such as a cryptographic hash, that can be read by a machine. These legal documents are linked through a hash to an equivalent smart contract. By definition, smart contract refers to any contract capable of automatically enforcing itself, without a third-party between the individual participants. Smart contracts are written as computer programs, rather than in legal language on a printed document. Smart contracts are modular, repeatable, and autonomous scripts, usually running on a blockchain, which represent unilateral promises to provide a determinate computation. These scripts are stored in the blockchain at a particular address, which is determined when the contracts are deployed to the blockchain. When an event prescribed in the contract happens, a transaction is sent to that address, and the distributed virtual machine executes the script’s operation codes (or clauses), using the data sent with the transaction.",False

This system of revenue collection will be 100% transparent, and all customers will have the ability to check the collected funds in real time. Once a week, at midnight on Sunday (12:00 AM GMT), there will be a special contest, using the following smart contract algorithm based on the following conditions:  1. The key component of the reward program is the final hash code generated on the Ethereum network by midnight on Sunday. This hash code will be used as a seed in a random number generator embedded in the smart contract. Six winners will be determined from the output of the MoviesChain by TVzavr random number generator.  2. The algorithm used for generating random numbers can only influence existing wallet balances. The more funds owners have in their accounts, the greater their chances of winning. Having a large balance does not guarantee a win; however, it does increase the chance of winning.  3. Six wallets are selected by the smart contract, and the bonus is awarded, according to the following formula: 30% to the winner, 40% to two second places (20% each), and 30% to three third places (10% each).  4. Every MoviesChain by TVzavr customer that has made at least one purchase during the current week is able to participate in the Customer Rewards.  5.

Here you go (page 19 of the White paper): The MoviesChain by TVzavr platform will allocate 10% (less rights holders’ shares) of weekly revenue to a bonus pool. This system of revenue collection will be 100% transparent, and all customers will have the ability to check the collected funds in real time. Once a week, at midnight on Sunday (12:00 AM GMT), there will be a special contest, using the following smart contract algorithm based on the following conditions: 1. The key component of the reward program is the final hash code generated on the Ethereum network by midnight on Sunday. This hash code will be used as a seed in a random number generator embedded in the smart contract. Six winners will be determined from the output of the MoviesChain by TVzavr random number generator. 2. The algorithm used for generating random numbers can only influence existing wallet balances. The more funds owners have in their accounts, the greater their chances of winning. Having a large balance does not guarantee a win; however, it does increase the chance of winning. 3. Six wallets are selected by the smart contract, and the bonus is awarded, according to the following formula: 30% to the winner, 40% to two second places (20% each), and 30% to three third places (10% each). 4. Every MoviesChain by TVzavr customer that has made at least one purchase during the current week is able to participate in the Customer Rewards. 5. Within 48 hours of their being announced, ZVR tokens will be transferred to the wallets of winners. This Customer Reward program will further incentivize TVzavr MoviesChain’s customers to spread the word about the platform, thereby increasing the growth of our customer base.",False

We have 40,000 movies in our library! You can download our apps on www.movieschain.io and enjoy watching movies today! ● TVzavr’s advertising clients are the world’s biggest corporations and include Fortune 500 list members. ● The product is ready!

MoviesChain by TVzavr, an innovative system of decentralized film distribution based on blockchain technology, is a current Skolkovo Fund resident.  The Blockchain Economy Award was presented to MoviesChain by TVzavr at the RAKIB award ceremony, which took place at the Blockchain Congress, the industry’s largest event. At the event, the host, Alexander Liubomov, noted that MoviesChain’s platform and its use of blockchain technology is the wave of the future:   “The industry is on the rise, and the choice of the nominees is not random. Everything is honest and transparent here, the way it is supposed to be in a blockchain system.”  Alexander Pavlov, General Director of the TVzavr Development Company, was presented the Blockchain Economy Award by Yurii Pripachkin, President of RAKIB, who, in praise of MoviesChain’s innovative platform, stated,  “Why MoviesChain by TVzavr? This is a real platform which is completely built on blockchain. This is a breakthrough for the media industry. In the future, copyrights holders and distributors’ relationship in the media industry will change, and MoviesChain is at the forefront of this process. Many have had similar ideas, but it was only TVzavr that has managed to implement them.”  MoviesChain by TVzavr provides a platform that allows Indie filmmakers to distribute their original films online, thereby considerably reducing filmmaker’s marketing and distribution costs. In early 2018, MoviesChain exhibited their platform at both the Berlin Film Festival and Hong Kong Film Market (Filmart), attracting serious interest, especially from independent film studios eager to escape the costs of intermediary distributors.  In addition to reducing film distribution costs, MoviesChain’s revolutionary use of blockchain technology allows copyright holders to generate income in real time, with each viewing of their films. In May 2018, ZVR tokens, MoviesChain’s internal currency, will be released for purchase, which are to be used on the MoviesChain platform.     Alexander Pavlov, General Director of the TVzavr Development Company explains the MoviesChain project:  “The aim of the project is to reduce the gap between copyright holders and viewers, in an effort to allow small independent studios to enter the market and present their content to consumers. Currently, a number of intermediaries participate in the process of signing contracts between copyright holders and internet movie theaters, developing their own  packages of copyright holders and strictly regulating markets, making it difficult for small studios to enter the market. In contrast, MoviesChain by TVzavr’s aim is to  eliminate these intermediaries by bringing copyright holders and their content directly to viewers, thereby opening new windows of opportunities for independent film studios.”  Dr. Jessica Hope Jordan, Professor of Film Studies and Creator and Co-Chair of the University of California, Davis Film Symposium, comments:  “TVzavr's MoviesChain’s innovative VoD platform, with its focus on providing both Indie filmmakers and viewers digital access to the apparatus of Indie film production and unique global film content, as well as access to film festivals and digital venues for film distribution and exhibition, represents the next step in the evolution of cinema by radically shifting the control of film production and distribution away from the large media conglomerates and middle-man distributors and placing this control directly into the hands of independent filmmakers and creative film entrepreneurs.”  In 2017, TVzavr’s MoviesChain project became a Skolkovo Fund resident. The Skolkovo Fund actively searches for and supports solutions for content as well as for associated technologies, such as distribution and advertisement. Alexey Kalenchuk, Head of the Skolkovo Fund IT-Cluster Virtual and Augmented Reality, Gamification Technologies Division explains MoviesChain by TVzavr’s innovative approach,  “There is no secret that blockchain technologies are tentatively used and integrated in  different spheres, far beyond cryptocurrencies. The biggest question is where the usage of blockchain is justified that it is more effective than traditional centralized databases? One of the most promising spheres is in the distribution of different content, such as media or gaming content. The magic lies here, in the exclusion of a mediator (agent) between content producers and consumers, while maintaining transparency. This is what Movieschain from TVZavr rests on. I consider this award well-deserved and wish the MoviesChain team the best of luck!”    STAY TUNED              ",False

It should be noted that currently, global box office growth rates are gradually slowing down. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) reveals that over the past five years, the volume of global box office revenues is growing at an average rate of only 1.5% per year, with 60-70% coming from international distribution. IHS Markit data shows that, in 2016, the number of premium format cinemas increased by 11%. This growth in the number of premium format movie theaters demonstrates that viewers want to watch films in comfort, as well as watch films chosen by the individual viewer. And nothing can compare to the comfort of home, the ease of purchase, and the selection of films that online movies offer. All of these factors combined indicate a strong future for online movies.

I would like to add some information. MoviesChain by TVzavr will be one of the first blockchain platforms using Ricardian smart contracts, which are now legal in several U.S. states. Terms of use for ZVR tokens are written in the Turing-complete programming language, known as Solidity. Independent film rights owners will be able to design the terms of their ZVR’s, using a user-friendly Automated Program Interface (“API”). Specialized technical knowledge will not be required, which is the case with other smart contract programming languages. A Ricardian contract is both readable by humans as well as can be compiled by a computerized machine in ways that both machine and human agree on how to execute the contract. On an executive level, Ricardian contracts are traditionally legal documents that have several components, such as a cryptographic hash, that can be read by a machine. These legal documents are linked through a hash to an equivalent smart contract.",False

Sure, I will try to give you more info on the idea:  This platform makes raising money easier by creating a model that is better than traditional forms of investment. Anyone ( for example, a movie producer)who wants to get funding just has to register and post a project description on MoviesChain by TVzavr. The platform will integrate a system of criteria that will include crowdfunding projects. Project owners will need to set the time period and minimum amount of funds to be raised. If the project fails to collect the necessary amount by a certain date, the funds will be returned to investors. MoviesChain Investment does not charge commission on the funds raised. Unlike many other fundraising platforms, MoviesChain Investment also importantly does not claim ownership of the projects that are accepted for publication on the platform. MoviesChain Investment will be the best platform for discovering great projects and raise funding for creative ideas to become a reality. In contributing to independent film production, users become both investors and insiders as they support projects, all of which will facilitate further growth. Millions of people all over the world visit crowdfunding platforms each day in search of new ideas. In giving filmmakers a platform to launch their projects, Movieschain Investment will be helping to create innovation in cinema, while also supporting upcoming talent in achieving their dreams.",False

Initial investment in the project was $15 million. That gave us an opportunity to build a strong 70 specialists team. Over the past eight years, tvzavr has put together a huge library, containing more than 40,000 films, most of which are available in Full HD. It has also built a VoD platform that is available around the world from different devices, including Smart TV, mobile devices, and web browsers. In order to enhance content quality, tvzavr has customized and launched its own CDN network on 200 servers, mostly in Russia and the CIS. Cooperation with Akamai Tech has allowed the company to broadcast content all over the world.

We have been in this business since 2009. We have more than 40,000 titles in our library and have never had any issues with piracy or hacking thanks to our unique crypto system. You can find more info about that in our whitepaper on page #16:  All content placed by rights holders or independent movie producers will be cryptographically protected, using MoviesChain by TVzavr’s own Digital Rights Management (DRM) system based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128), and distributed to clients via Content Distribution Network (CDN).  Even more importantly, during Berlin film festival two weeks ago we had discussions with the world leading companies such as Celluloid Dreams, Gaumont, Memento Films, SND, TF1, Parche etc and they made commitments to put the content on our blockchain based platform! You can google translate this article from the leading Russian business newspaper (""Russian Wall Street Journal""):  https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3558407  I can assure you if they have not had full confidence in our ability to cryptographically protect the content they would not have talked to us.
