DTE tokens verifications help validate user credentials, to help solve the often first awkard moments of meet up, to help dates find the best places on an affordable prices.   DatEat employs a queuing system built upon distributed ledger technology and includes novel features to maximize user trust. Fast and smart AI automaticlally calculate score based on 100 million users profile to matching couples together.  A large portion of Dateat’s crowdsale, they have plan to sell 200 million DTEs to the public and aiming to raise 3 million US dollars.  How advanced is the project?   Dateat currently has ready products and launch Beta version 2.0 in May 2018 which have fast monetization with Token intergration and use in 2 native dating apps for iOS and Android, 1 website and offline services in 5 countries (Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia).  Dateat also have starting base of 100 million user base and community from existing apps, platforms and services participating as Merchants/Partners from the start.  Dateat has a unique system combine between token system, big data, AI, virtual assistant and data encryption. The users will have a different experience that they never got before.  Here is a summary of their ICO roadmap:  March 15TH- April 30th, 2018: Private sale  May 09th — May 29th, 2018: Pre-ICO  June 05th- June 26th 2018: ICO — 1st round  June 27th- July 23th 2018: ICO — 2nd round  July 24th- August 30th 2018: ICO — 3rd round  What are the tokens used for and how can token value appreciate?  DTE is a utility token for Dateat’s platform and will be used for payment transactions, advertising to growing user-base and community token.  Payment Transactions — DTE token can be used for payment for goods and services in the 10 platforms in our ecosystem and with plans to expand into other partners’ ecosystems/platforms as well.  Advertising to Growing User-base — Merchants/Experts would also buy DTE tokens to advertise the growing database, presenting another strong source of utility besides the transactional utility.  Community Token — Users can ask the community questions and upon great content, responses or ideas given, a reward of DTE tokens will be given. Rewards will also be given for referring new users or merchants who spend on DatEat as a thank you for helping grow the platform. The DTE token is instrumental in building up interactivity and growth traction in the DatEat community who will be encouraged and rewarded by providing great content to benefit other users and which the DatEat engine can learn from, providing the growing data that DatEat can grow better and more accurate from. DatEat is driven by the team behind the Lunch Actually Group, a group of proven, passionate and dedicated entrepreneurs who are convicted to create better lifetime relationships.  Besides just the DatEat app, the DTE token will be integrated with our existing ecosystem of 2 apps, 1 website and offline services (integrated 3rd party Merchants/Partners) so that DTE tokens can used by its owners almost immediately and with decent scale upon its launch.    PRE-ICO  Each day, investors will only have a chance to buy 5% of the 30 million tokens (1.5 million tokens). With such protocol, it is important that investors check their account regularly because unless they bid the highest price ($0.09 USD) they may not be able to buy DTE.  According to DatEat’s officials, even though the first day of Pre-ICO has not finished yet, more than 1.5 million DTEs have been bid. Surprisingly, all bids are placed at $0.09 USD. What this basically mean is that at the end of the day (one day of Pre-ICO started from 22:00 UTC+8 to 22:00 UTC+8 of next day), there may be some investors not able to buy DTEs even though they bid at the highest price.  Kate Truong, DatEat’s Chief Operations Officer, shares her insights: “In this Pre-ICO round, it is crucial for investors to bid early and if they have the financial capability, they should bid at the highest price, meaning $0.09 USD. There will be a lot of investors joining and wanting to buy DTE at this point, because in the next round of ICO, the price of DTE will be much higher. The reason we limit the amount of DTE that can be purchased in one day, 1.5 million tokens, is to make sure that everyone has the chance to buy DTE, not just big sharks who can buy a very large amount of DTE in one day. So hopefully everyone will enjoy this Pre-ICO round.”  We will publish a recap of DatEat Pre-ICO day one. We expect that the heat will only get higher and higher each day as the pool of DTE available for distribution will get smaller and smaller. Stay tuned for more information!",False
