The revamped SOL distribution model is back and live. From the user perspective it feels pretty much the same; you post cards and comments, and receive SOL when other people vote for your content. The major changes are under the hood. What is the difference? Before: fraudulent users were able to affect value distribution significantly, disproportionate to their contribution to the overall value creation. In other words, they were distributing more value than they created themselves. This led to attempts to trick and defraud the system. Now: economy value, created by user for service, defines the amount of SOL they distribute with their votes. With their votes, users define the proportion of SOL distribution, but not its amount. Basically, one vote of one user can easily have more value than one hundred votes of other users. The changes will make it harder for fraudulent players to trick the system without increasing overall value along the way, which ironically is economically beneficial to the system and, as a result, every user. Altogether with the previous SOL distribution system we removed the complicated logic of action points. The new improvements allow us to remove the much disputed semi-manual fraud detection check for withdrawal operations to external wallets. Now, the card reward will be accrued and sent to the internal Sola wallet at the time of card expiration, which is 7 days since its creation.    Boost and revive Along with the improved SOL distribution model we added two ways to use SOL in the app. First, you can get some additional exposure to your cards with clear and simple pricing. Each 100 views will cost you 2 SOL. There is a limit of how many views you can get in this way and at the launch it will be limited to no more than 500. Of course, your cards will still spread naturally, this option is if you want to boost them. Second, you can revive an expired card and make it spread and receive votes for additional 7 days. The date of creation will stay the same so viewers will know when it was actually created. Both boosted and revived cards are prominently marked with the corresponding badges.    New ways to earn and spend SOL will follow soon with two types of challenges: Sola and user-generated ones, improved airdrop program, and more.
