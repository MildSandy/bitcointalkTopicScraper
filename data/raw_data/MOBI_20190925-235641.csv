This simple API bridges the gap between the off-chain world and the blockchain world. Blockchain developer tools are currently hard to use, primitive, and comparable to web developer tools in the early 1990’s. Mobius addresses this problem by building key infrastructure that allows any developer to easily integrate with any blockchain and accept payments or create their own cryptographically secure token. Mobius also allows developers to easily receive off-chain events about blockchain actions such as token payments while simultaneously providing solutions for developers to easily create oracles that update smart contracts with information from the real world, such as predicting and sourcing mission critical parts for assembly line fab equipment in Shanghai.  Mobius is the first organization to use the Stellar platform. Mobius is building innovative universal blockchain API protocols and a DApp Store that will connect billions of people, apps, and devices to the blockchain ecosystem. In fact, there are already a couple apps in the DApp Store, which is live now for developers to plug, play, and build in while accepting micro-payments from the blockchain economy.  There is currently a token Pre-Sale slated to end on August 8th, 2017.  Developer Referral Program: The Mobius team is starting a developer referral program for the DApp Store. People that refer developers who submit an app before Tuesday August 8th, 2017 at 12:00pm PST, that is approved, will receive 7,000 free MOBI in the pre-sale. Just have the developer email referral@mobius.network your name and email address so we can contact you about sending you your free MOBI.  Developers Earn Mobius token (MOBI): Each user that signs up for the DApp Store is given 1,000 free credits to spend in apps. The developer of an app that receives credits will receive an equal number of MOBI after the token Pre-Sale. User credits do not convert or in anyway exchange into MOBI. Only developers that earn credits will be rewarded with MOBI.
