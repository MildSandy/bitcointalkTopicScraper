Chances are that you don’t. What about the purchase of your current car or washing machine? Of course you do! How could one forget all those decisions and info gathering? The higher the price of a product and/or the greater the desire for a specific quality (e.g. low-cost maintenance), the more active we tend to be in the purchase process.  In case of major buys, which are often technical in nature, the average buyer strives to be well-informed. We invest a lot of research time, and eventually become very clear about the specifications that we would like the product to have. In this, the Internet is a major source of information, and often the preferred source of the item. After knowing all the specifications, a tiring comparison on numerous selling sites used to be the next step. The AI of the Eligma e-commerce platform, however, aims to introduce some fundamental changes, and offer you a hand in finding the very best deal. It will do this in two interconnected ways: with the speed and broadness of its smart mega-search, and with the precision of its trained machine learning algorithms searching precisely for the specifications that you may require.  Eligma’s AI helps find the 100% match  ‘The best deal’ may mean different things in cases of different customers and products. Sometimes, the best deal means ALL the specifications that we enter — all the criteria on our search engine list. We may need an item to be in a certain area or by the brand that we are loyal to. In this case, Eligma’s AI will search millions of online products in a just few seconds to find a 100% match. The broadness of this discovery is very good news, especially on the second-hand market, which has traditionally been known as a business where one simply has to compromise because items with all of one’s specifications do not tend to be available. Eligma’s comprehensive AI discovery, however, definitely aims to call that into question. You might be able to get that exact car colour after all!

With the expansion of internet access across the globe and technological changes that are making online shopping more convenient and safer, this figure is projected to rise to almost 4.9 trillion USD in 2021. As these figures grow, so does the number of online stores and the problem that Eligma will solve. You will be able to browse and buy in all stores on one platform!   Paying with cryptocurrencies is the next logical step  Since mankind started bartering 100,000 years ago, payment methods have evolved greatly and that has been even more evident in the last 100 years or so. From banknotes to credit cards and mobile transaction systems, payment systems are becoming safer, faster and easier to use. We believe the time has come to take the next step and move cryptocurrencies from exchanges and wallets into everyday shopping use. Eligma will include its own transaction gateway that will enable the use of cryptocurrencies even in stores that don’t accept them yet.  ⦁ An impressive advisory board  Eligma boasts a renowned advisory board and we are very happy that so many influential people see how big of a project it can become. People like Charlie Shrem, Andy Baynes, Hermann Eul, Jure Leskovec and many others are here to help us in the long term, giving us a vast array of knowledge that will help us on our path.  ⦁ The ELI is a true utility token  Our tokens are not here just so we can distribute them during our crowdsale and then forget about them. They will have genuine usefulness on the platform as the foundation of our loyalty program that will enable users to earn ELI tokens in one store on the platform and spend them in any other partnered store. They will also be able to use them for advanced platform features, such as product hunts, second-hand listings, escrow fees, decentralized item sales on the blockchain, advertising and purchasing selected exclusive items.  ⦁ We have locked the ETH exchange rate at 800 USD  As stated above, we do not only believe in cryptocurrencies, but are doing our best to bring them into the mainstream. To do so, we want to build a large community that will start using Eligma, cryptocurrencies and ELI tokens as soon as possible. As an incentive to do this and to ensure that early investors are not worse off because they bought their ETH early, we have locked its exchange rate at 800 USD, which is well over its current market value.",False

A product with DIP will be traceable from the moment it was purchased to the present day. Events like change of ownership and warranty details will be trackable through publicly accessible sidechain. Unalterable transactions and records - On sidechain, DIPs will be stored as Smart Contracts (transactions), that will form a transparent ledger of blocks, inherently resistant to modification of the data. Sidechain block's hashes will be stored on Ethereum Network and thus enable everyone to check that blocks remained unchanged since the moment of creation. Cryptocurrency - utilizing our services with Ethereum ERC-20 compliant ELI utility token we created a portable and tradeable digital token, exchangeable between users.

Following problems were identified and will be addressed by Eligma:  Online product research and shopping are time consuming: People spend a lot of time researching online to find the product and the deal that suits their needs, but even the most persistent ones cannot check all the online store offers. Users are never certain, whether they found the best possible deal. User privacy issues: Users disclose personal data with every store, where they want to place an order. Their every move on the store’s website is also being monitored. This means that stores are collecting extensive behavioural data about each user and can connect that data directly to the person. Registration with every online store is required: Users have to separately register with each online store they want to shop in. Due to this inconvenience, they can be discouraged from placing an order in a new online store. Keeping track of different accounts can be a hassle and therefore consumers are returning only to stores, where they are already registered. Keeping track of household belongings: Users do not have an overview of what they own and how much their belongings are worth. Every household has many products that still have value, but are never used and people forget about even having them. Creating second-hand listings for faster sale conversions: When trying to sell used items, users are having problems setting the appropriate price and selecting a second-hand market with the highest probability of finding potential buyers. Usually they list products on some of those markets and forget about the listing, as it rarely converts into a successful sale. Payments with cryptocurrencies are not possible: With growing wealth held in cryptocurrencies, the demand for conducting payments in those currencies is growing. Very few online stores stepped into this direction, even though all the indicators are showing that in the future cryptocurrencies are going to become mainstream. Vast number of individual loyalty programs: Big retailers have introduced loyalty programs a long time ago, but those programs are not connected. This means that in order for users to really benefit from a program, they have to keep track of every one of them, which is next to impossible. Incomplete or inaccurate product descriptions: Most online stores provide their own descriptions. The quality of those descriptions varies from store to store and it is very hard for users to know which one of them is relevant. In most cases, when users are searching for products with a higher price, they have to first visit the manufacturer’s website to find the description they can trust. Lack of a personalized approach: Despite the adoption of new technologies, most online stores are still not embracing the personalized shopping experience approach. In many cases, online stores are displaying inappropriate products to the wrong customers and it is up to the users to browse the store and find the product that best suits their needs.  As it is understood for more complex projects, Eligma is a modular platform and features will be added in accordance with the roadmap at latest. Our first solution, which is a cryptocurrency payment gateway called Elipay is already being tested in BTC City (one of the biggest shopping and entertainment areas in Europe) and will be launched very soon and made availabile to its users. Have you seen this posts: https://medium.com/eligma-blog/jo%C5%BEe-mermal-eligmas-cofounder-makes-the-first-elipay-transaction-in-an-offline-store-eae6c3a728df DJ Umek, one of the biggest international stars of the electronic scene, also became one of the first Elipay users! We joined him for his first crypto purchase at the Tomas sport2 Sneakers store in BTC City.  All of the features are already being developed and we will regularly inform the community about our process. For example on the following link you can find an intro for discovery pillar: https://medium.com/eligma-blog/eligmas-minimum-viable-product-demonstration-8611b45dd999. Discovery pillar will be launched in Slovenia already in this year where we will optimise Eligma for our intended market entry strategy that starts already next year.",False

Its president and Eligma’s cofounder Jože Mermal paid for a two-hour spa package with Bitcoins, marking the first payment using the Elipay cryptocurrency gateway.  We caught up with Jože after the big event for a short chat.  What persuaded you to not only join the project, but also invest in it?  The BTC company and myself have always been open to ground-breaking and innovative ideas that simplify and upgrade existing systems and frameworks and society-friendly concepts. With this vision we also managed to establish BTC CITY, the biggest business, shopping, recreational, cultural and innovative centre in SE Europe, which hosts more than 21 million visitors every year. That’s why I believe in Eligma and support it. It is a project that will enable simplified and modern online shopping for people in Slovenia and all over the world. This is how the BTC company will do its part in creating and developing new shopping process trends and provide its visitors with a modern online and shopping experience.  Why do BTC City and its retailers find it important to implement new technologies, especially blockchain technologies?  BTC CITY has always been an environment, whose main goal was the well-being of its visitors, buyers and business partners. Our habits are changing, and every segment of our everyday lives is becoming simpler. The main building blocks of what I mentioned are technologies that we are gradually implementing into our lives and which we have mostly accepted and cannot picture our lives without them. The BTC company has always embraced changing environments, habits and trends as we want to offer our visitors and business partners a modern and advanced surrounding where they will feel good and happily create and develop their business goals. Among a number of other functionalities, blockchain technology enables transparency and traceability, which are the two key building blocks of every system in the private or public sphere. That is what we want to offer all of our visitors and business partners.   Elipay is Eligma’s cryptocurrency transaction gateway. What will it bring to the BTC City? What advantages do you see in cryptocurrencies and what do you personally think about them?  BTC is a free-thinking company that is creating an open, modern and innovative ecosystem. We want to give our visitors and business partners options and opportunities. That includes different methods of paying for services and products. People must have the freedom to decide how they want to shop and pay. We have transited from cash management to card and online payments. Currency exchange has become quick and easy, so I believe it’s time to embrace the future and not hide from it. Cryptocurrencies are already here, so we want to enable all BTC CITY visitors to pay however they want. With the Elipay transaction system we will give them exactly that free will and an open society.  Eligma will perform its initial tests in BTC City. Why are BTC City and its Living Lab so suitable for this purpose?  The BTC CITY Living lab (testing environment) is an ecosystem within the BTC CITY Ljubljana. As a city within Ljubljana, the capital city of Slovenia, it’s unique in a spatial and business sense. Therefore, testing different technologies and prototypes is something that is natural to us, as it allows us to give our visitors access to the latest technologies (Eligma, Nedo, Smart parking, BTC Autonomous vehicle Living Lab, SmartCity, etc.). At the same time visitors provide us with very important information and real feedback and insights that tell us whether that solution, technology or prototype is the correct one for our and / or the international market.  How do you picture e-commerce in 5 years?  People create trends and technologies that help us raise the quality of our lives according to our needs. That’s why I believe it’s extremely important to listen to people’s wishes, needs and changing shopping and processing habits, strive to optimize them and create a people-friendly environment. We can already see the arrival of a hybrid shopping and trading concept that will greatly simplify our shopping practices. Buyers will enjoy a safe, quick and simplified shopping experience that will represent a permanent connection of the physical and digital worlds. ELIGMA is representing a large part of e-commerce and online shopping future. It will change and simplify online shopping with its advanced technological solutions and functionalities and by doing so create new trends, guidelines and online shopping habits. The BTC company will always do its best to implement new technologies that will enable a modern and friendly shopping environment.",False

Nice FAQ    1. When does the public crowdsale start and end?  Our public crowdsale starts 17 April 2018 at 11:00 UTC and ends 8 May 2018 at 11:00 UTC (or until all tokens are sold out).  2. Am I too late to pass the KYC process for the public crowdsale?  No, the KYC process will be open until our public crowdsale is finished.  3. How do I register for the public crowdsale?  Visit https://kyc.eligma.io/kyc-individuals to complete the KYC process and whitelist your address.  4. If I already passed the KYC process for any of the presale phases, do I have to pass it again for the public crowdsale phase?  No, you only need to pass the KYC process once for all phases. The only exception is if you want ELI tokens sent to a different wallet address. In that case you need to repeat the KYC process with a new email and a new wallet address with which you will participate.  5. How many ELI tokens will be available during the public crowdsale?  During the public crowdsale there will be 84 million ELI tokens plus all the unsold tokens from the previous phases available.  6. What are the minimum and maximum contribution?  Minimum possible contribution: 0.1 ETH.  Maximum possible contribution: Our public crowdsale will be carried out in two steps. For the first three hours, we will set a low maximum contribution of 10 ETH to assure that as many of our supporters as possible will be able to obtain at least a small number of tokens with the highest bonus of 8 % (please see all the available bonuses below). If a contributor sends an ETH contribution in one or more transactions that exceeds the maximum set amount, the exceeding amount in ETH, reduced by a transaction fee (gas), will be returned to his wallet. After the first three hours, we will remove the maximum contribution limit until the end of our public crowdsale.  7. Are there any bonuses in the public crowdsale?  Yes, they are broken down like this:  1. 8 % of additional tokens for the first 20 million ELI tokens,  2. 6 % of additional tokens for the second 20 million ELI tokens,  3. 4 % of additional tokens for the third 20 million ELI tokens,  4. 2 % of additional tokens for the fourth 20 million ELI tokens.  5. 0 % for the remaining number of tokens.  8. Can I participate with any other cryptocurrency or only with ETH?  ELI is offered only in exchange for ETH contributions.  9. Which wallets can be used to participate in the public crowdsale?  Please do not use online exchange wallets to send ETH, as you might not be able to receive ELI tokens to those addresses and your tokens will be lost. ELI is an ETH based ERC-20 standard token and participants must use compatible private ETH wallets, such as myetherwallet (MEW). If you are interested in using any other wallets, please check directly with that wallet provider to prevent any potential issues.  10. Can I use the same individualized wallet address to deposit ETH for the public crowdsale as I used for presale?  No. We will use a public ETH address for the public crowdsale phase. We will send this address to everyone who completed our KYC process already. Every potential supporter that completes a new KYC process will also receive an e-mail with the public ETH address for contributions.  11. How many tokens will I get if I invest 1 ETH?  We have locked the ETH exchange rate at 800 $ on April 10th, therefore you will receive:  1 ETH * 800 $ = 800 $  Price of 1 ELI token is 0.1 USD  800 $ / 0.1 USD= 8,000 ELI tokens  8,000 ELI + 8 % public crowdsale bonus for the first 20 million ELI tokens = 8,000 ELI + (8,000 * 0.08) ELI = 8,640 ELI tokens  8,000 ELI + 6 % public crowdsale bonus for the second 20 million ELI tokens = 8,000 ELI + (8,000 * 0.06) ELI = 8,480 ELI tokens  8,000 ELI + 4 % public crowdsale bonus for the third 20 million ELI tokens = 8,000 ELI + (8,000 * 0.04) ELI = 8,320 ELI tokens  8,000 ELI + 2 % public crowdsale bonus for the fourth 20 million ELI tokens = 8,000 ELI + (8,000 * 0.02) ELI = 8,160 ELI tokens  8,000 ELI + 0 % public crowdsale bonus for the rest of ELI tokens = 8,000 ELI tokens  12. When will I be able to transfer tokens after the public crowdsale ends?  When we receive your ETH contribution, you will immediately get your ELI tokens.

Why we decided to lock the Ethereum exchange rate at 800 $ First of all, I would like to extend my sincere thanks for all your contributions in our presale and trust in the Eligma project. You are a great community!  As we announced yesterday, we will lock the Ethereum exchange rate at 800 $ before our token distribution on April 17th for private presale, public presale and public crowdsale phases. I wanted to share my thoughts on why we are doing this with the whole community.   As you all know, the whole crypto market has been very volatile in the last few months, e.g. Ethereum exchange rate has fallen from 850 $ in the beginning of March to as low as 365 $, which was the exchange rate on April 1st.  What would that mean for our contributors?  It would put our earliest contributors, our most loyal followers, at a disadvantage. Let’s assume they bought 1 Ethereum to contribute on March 4th, about two weeks before the start of our public presale. They paid approximately 850 $ for 1 Ethereum, which they contributed in our presale. For that amount they would receive 8,500 ELI tokens (our exchange rate is 1 ELI = 0,1 $). However, since we will be locking the ETH/USD exchange rate on April 17th, there is a very good chance they would receive a much lower number of ELI tokens. If we take today’s exchange rate of approximately 415 USD into account, those same contributors would only receive 4,150 ELI tokens.  How did we come to our conclusion?  This presented us with a dilemma, which in the end proved easy to resolve. While we could have simply blamed the market and say that we cannot do anything about it, that just didn’t feel right. We all felt it would be disrespectful to the people who believe in us the most and contributed early. By locking a higher ETH exchange rate, we created the same playing field for everyone and ensured that bonuses for early contributors do not get lost in the current lower exchange rate.  The second reason that helped us with our decision was our strong belief in the crypto world and blockchain technologies, so we gladly took a large part of the risk upon ourselves. By making this step, we wanted to prove that we are here for the long term and that our vision and roadmap are clear and solid. We are hoping that all of you feel the same and decide to keep our tokens for using them on our platform when it goes live.  I would like to take this opportunity to invite everyone to participate in our crowdsale, which starts April 17th, and join the future of commerce.",False

Eligma’s price predictor tells me how much the product is worth and how that value will change in the future, so I know exactly when to sell it if I want.  Remember the TV I bought 2 years ago? Eligma suggests that I should sell it now. I choose the “Sell” option in the inventory, select desired second-hand stores from the list and hit the “Confirm” button.  Soon, a potential customer finds my TV and wants to purchase it, but he has bad experience with second-hand purchases. He wants to make sure that I am going to send the item and that it is in the condition stated. For this reason, Eligma provides secure and unchangeable product data in the inventory by using blockchain and smart contracts. We agree to use Eligma as an intermediary that holds the buyer’s money until he receives the product and confirms everything is OK. Only then will I receive his payment!    No more coupons There is something else I won’t be needing in 2 years’ time: all those loyalty cards and points I cannot keep track of and can only be used at the store where I received them.  Meet the ELI token, a universal loyalty token. It is a crypto token that Eligma will use for its unified loyalty program. When I purchased my washing machine for 800$, the seller gave me a 50$ worth of ELI tokens as a cashback.

At Eligma, we are working full steam to develop our platform and we are happy to announce that our AI-driven category predictor has reached its alpha stage.

This will enable it to predict detailed product features users are looking for even if they enter very basic specifications. Eligma will “remember” those searches and use that knowledge for even better and more personalized searches in the future!  Because the database we are using at the moment consists mostly from consumer electronics, we conducted a few searches for those kinds of products with very good results already.

You presented a short sum up of our Inventory pillar, but we shall not forget that there are also Discovery and Loyalty pillar of Eligma that aims to holistically address recognized issues. Here is slightly more detailed explaination of Inventory pillar:  Eligma will create a blockchain-tracked Digital Item Profile (DIP) for every item purchased through the platform, where users can store several records, including Proofs of Purchase. Every DIP will be automatically written into the user’s inventory. In order for the user to have an overview of all the items in his household, he will also be able to manually add elsewhere purchased items.  Within the inventory, users will be able to see the AI-predicted current and future item value. Eligma’s household trading agent will notify users when the best time to sell the product is. It will automatically generate and publish listings on selected second-hand online stores with a single click. If a user chooses to replace that product, Eligma will even propose a suitable replacement.  To make C2C transactions safer for the user, Eligma will offer two solutions to both trading parties. With its Escrow service, Eligma will act as a trusted intermediary and ensure fairness of contractual terms. The second option is a completely decentralized sale on the blockchain, where both parties will make a deposit into a smart contract as a guarantee. These deposits and the buyer’s payment will remain locked until the contract terms are fulfilled.  https://www.eligma.io/forum/inventory.png",False

The MVP is projected for August this year, with the first version of the Eligma platform developed by the end of the year and later expanded to other markets in accordance with the roadmap above.  To demonstrate that Eligma is here to stay, we are proud to announce EliPay.

We are hoping EliPay will bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream; all retailers will receive our cryptocurrency transaction systems and consumers will be able to use a mobile app. The iOS version will be released first, and the Android version will follow in the next few months.

MVP is projected for August this year, with the first version of the Eligma platform developed by the end of the year and later expanded to other markets in accordance with roadmap you can find in our whitepaper on pages 49-51: https://goo.gl/aqhn8m.  Simultaneously different features and modules presented will be added. Currently we are developing the data gathering services (scrappers, API connections,...) as well as machine learning algorithm for product matching and categorization. We also already have the database architecture setup. Our ultimate goal is that eventually all stores within BTC City would support Elipay. We are just about to start our testing phase and then add additional stores.  To demonstrate that Eligma is here to stay, we are proud to announce EliPay. Most of the stores we will be working with are currently operating strictly as brick-and-mortar entitites which gives us the opportunity to combine the online and offline worlds of commerce. EliPay’s primary purpose will be to enable visitors of BTC City to use cryptocurrencies in al the center’s stores. We are hoping EliPay will bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream; all retailers will receive our cryptocurrency transaction systems and consumers will be able to use a mobile app. The iOS version will be released first, and the Android version will follow in the next few months.  Consumers will need to download and install the EliPay app, register with the service, and deposit cryptocurrencies in their mobile wallets on the app. At first, BTC and Bitcoin Cash will be supported, and more cryptocurrencies will be supported in the future.  Retailers will have two options: either keep the funds in cryptocurrency, or take advantage of EliPay’s exchange feature, which will contact via API, exchange the funds into fiat, and transfer the appropriate sum into the retailer’s account.  Most funds will be kept in cold storage at a secure location, so even in the unfortunate event that the Eligma platform is compromised, all the funds will be kept safe.

What keeps your team driven?  Belief in the idea. If your whole team feels passionate about the project, no work and effort are too hard.   What was your thought process while assembling your advisory board?   We recognized how complex of a project Eligma is from the start. We wanted to involve people that would cover every aspect of the project (AI, blockchain, finance, etc.). Most of all, we wanted advisors that were not just faces in our whitepaper, but people that genuinely believe in the project and are willing to help make it a reality.  Tell us a little about your team’s culture. What are some key characteristics define your team?  In a way, you answered the question already. They have to be a team, not just a group of individuals. If they don’t get along, everything falls apart. They have to trust in the project and be willing to put in the hard work required.  What about the current online shopping system is broken? Why is decentralisation a good approach to solve this?  The biggest problems are the abundance of choices, unsafe transactions on second-hand markets and fragmented loyalty programs. Decentralization is not a solution for everything but is perfect for improving the security of used goods sales. With smart contracts acting as trustless agents, buyers and sellers can be sure that they are getting the deal they agreed to.   Tell us about the AI component about Eligma? What goes into building a decentralised AI app?  Our AI enables us to implement a few important features – a discovery that will enable users to quickly find the best offer according to their demands, a chatbot which will help refine user searches and the option of tracking the value of household items. In the last case, our AI will also suggest when the best time to sell them is. Let me point out that our AI is not decentralized as that would not make any sense in our case.  What were your biggest product challenges you faced so far?  Acquiring enough data … in order for our AI to function as well as we envision it, we need a huge amount of data. We are confident however that we will be able to collect enough to give our users a not-before-seen shopping experience.   How does EliPay, your offline offering, fit into your overall vision, given your online first approach?  Eligma is being developed as a comprehensive solution, meaning we are not focusing only on online stores. We intend to bring the online and offline worlds of commerce together on one platform. If you think about in this way, EliPay becomes the perfect example of how Eligma will work, bringing cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.  How did your partnership with BTC city come about? What advantages does this give you?  We have worked with BTC City before when I was still the CEO of ABC Accelerator. They have recognised the advantages of start-ups and new technologies very early and developed their city as a polygon for new ideas, companies and technologies, especially blockchain and cryptocurrencies recently. Being able to test Eligma in BTC City is a huge advantage, as it represents a small piece of world commerce with its different business units, online and offline. We will be able to test Eligma on a smaller scale, gather enough data and make corrections where needed for our expansion to the UK and beyond.    Your roadmap looks pretty aggressive. How will you go about executing it?  We are aware how complex of an undertaking Eligma is. We also know how fast the crypto world is moving. We considered both aspects when creating the roadmap. It is designed in such a way that we will achieve milestones as quickly as possible, but with enough time that they function as well as we believe they can. We will ensure that it comes to fruition with two simple words – hard work!  What are your opinions about the current state of the crypto industry?  At Eligma, we are all firm crypto and blockchain believers. A lot has happened in the last year or two. I think the industry is now in the phase of sorting itself out. What technologies are here to stay and what projects are well thought out and backed? These questions will get answered in the next few months and the path forward will be clear.  What do you think about ICOs as a fundraising instrument? Do you think they’re here to stay?  Yes, they are here to stay, but in different forms than we now know them. With the EU and the US preparing stricter regulations, companies that want to do crowd sales will have to adapt. We already planned our crowdsale with strict measures regarding the KYC process and data privacy in mind and crowd sales in the future will have to do the same.  What is your advice to anyone thinking of conducting an ICO today?  Do your research and don’t take it lightly. A crowdsale is by no means a sure thing. You have to have a great idea, a passionate team and enough people to back you. When you hit a rough patch, and that will happen, you have to persevere and remember what you are trying to accomplish. You have to go all in or you won’t succeed.",False

In this case we would need to cope with high transaction costs on Ethereum Network that would occur in completely decentralised system.  Any product, purchased through the Eligma platform or manually added to the user`s Product inventory, will receive a Digital Item Profile (DIP), that will be stored in a sidechain and its block's hashes to Ethereum Network. DIPs include several information (including owners ID) that will be encrypted and not accessible until the user decides so. As an additional security feature for both the seller and a buyer, Eligma will also develop a mechanism to execute a purchase or any trade process in a completely decentralized way using smart contracts on a blockchain. To continue with, Eligma will offer also a completely decentralized universal loyalty program any merhant could join. There will be no need to register with a standalone loyalty program and users will be able to redeem acquire.

For screening out the difference between products we will use different techniques, all depending on the category type. As it is always interesting to go deep into more complex examples, I can tell you that in some cases we will really dissect the products specification up to the point of spare parts the product uses. When we know the spare parts of the product we can compare them and consequentially determine the differences between products.  Hopefully this answers your question.  Thank you for the support, Ziga",False

In this case we would need to cope with high transaction costs on Ethereum Network that would occur in completely decentralised system.  If you are concerned about how the privacy will be ensured when individual lists all the products he/she owns in its inventory, this is how Eligma will achieve it. Any product, purchased through the Eligma platform or manually added to the user`s Product inventory, will receive a Digital Item Profile (DIP), that will be stored in a sidechain and its block's hashes to Ethereum Network. DIPs include several information (including owners ID) that will be encrypted and not accessible. When user decides to sell the product, only information needed about the product to list the offer will be revealed. As an additional security feature for both the seller and a buyer, Eligma will also develop a mechanism to execute a purchase or any trade process in a completely decentralized way using smart contracts on a blockchain.  To continue with, Eligma will offer also a completely decentralized universal loyalty program any merhant could join. There will be no need to register with a standalone loyalty program and users will be able to redeem acquired ELI tokens with any other loyalty network member.",False

By connecting blockchain and business, we will create a modular platform for commerce and save time that users spend on searching and purchasing products by utilizing artificial intelligence. It will advise users which products to buy by taking into account item components, quality, price, shipping time and costs as well as other factors. It will enable users to securely and transparently sell their used items on multiple second-hand markets at the most appropriate time through their personal item inventories - Eligma will transform every household into a business. All of this will be possible thanks to the innovative use of existing AI and blockchain technologies.    ▄▄ ELIGMA EXPLAINED  The concept of Eligma was born as a response to several key trends and problems identified in traditional retail as well as online shopping, where the use of the latter has exploded in the recent decade. The goal of our project is to offer a set of previously impossible or unanticipated solutions to discover, purchase, track and resell items. This is now viable thanks to the development of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Three main pillars, discovery, inventory and loyalty, will enable Eligma to become an AI-driven and blockchain-based platform that acts as a personal commerce agent.     ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ THE ELIGMA PLATFORM  The core of the Eligma platform is an AI-driven module that will help users discover best deals for desired products in any online store based on their preferences. It uses several sources of user data to achieve the optimum results. Eligma also connects the offline and online worlds to upgrade the shopping experience and ensure that each user really finds the best deal. Eligma will also introduce a unified shopping account, meaning that a single shopping cart and checkout process will suffice to complete purchases in multiple online stores at once, whereas the platform`s cryptocurrency payment gateway will enable users to pay with cryptocurrencies even if the online stores don’t support them yet.   ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ ELIGMA INTRODUCTION VIDEO   ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ MARKET  The possibility to shop at any time and the ability to compare prices and find better deals are the main reasons consumers rather shop online than in physical stores (KPMG, 2017). Research shows that the online shopping market is growing yearly (in 2016, retail e-commerce sales worldwide amounted to 1.86 trillion U.S. dollars and e-retail revenues are projected to grow to 4.48 trillion U.S. dollars in 2021 (Statista, 2017)) and that people are already losing a lot of time searching for the right product. The offer is vast and the online shopping ecosystem is very dispersed. The second-hand online market is blooming and will probably grow even faster if certain seller and buyer security measures are implemented.  You can find out more about the state of the market in our WHITEPAPER.  ▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄ TEAM  Team is always the heart of the project and our heartful team members, supported by experienced advisors, are set to develop Eligma to serve its users and save them time.
