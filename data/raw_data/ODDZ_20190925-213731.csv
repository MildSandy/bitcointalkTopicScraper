ODDZ Tokens","Thanks for your question. We considered very hard about bonuses but felt, especially after the recent comments by Vitalik Buterin, the creator of Ethereum, that that wasn't a model we wanted to follow.  ""As Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, has put it: “If an ICO does volume bonuses (“buy at least $50000 of coins, get 20% more”) then they don’t understand the first thing about the egalitarian spirit of crypto (or at least, the egalitarian spirit that I believe crypto should have). Skip them.”""  http://www.newsbtc.com/2017/11/23/generous-ico-bonuses-may-indicate-scam/  We feel our product and branding will be very strong in the market and expect our ICO to be quite popular. The whitelist will give you early access to tokens, allowing you to purchase as many as you would like with no upper limit (but a 1 eth min purchase amount), so it's entirely possible that there will be few left when we open the ICO up for general sale.  We also offer a very large % profit share each quarter and our sole aim is to return eth to our investors, via our profits as soon as possible and to make as much as we can to give back to ODDZ token holders each and every quarter.  We are very much in this to launch a fantastic product and brand and to maximise returns for our investors as soon as possible!",False
