Agree first with the supply and demand. It has long been proven that music should be popular, and not be somewhere there in the archives and wait for money from downloading its users.

Perhaps, you are not from music industry and that's why you believe that fame is more important than revenue. Kindly note, that singers, musicians and songwriters are real jobs! However, is not all about notoriety, there are many unknown artists which they live with the royalties they received every 3 months or at the end of the year or some of them unfortunately  do not receive nothing. So it is important to have a  transparent royalties distribution, to make the music industry fair for the entire ecosystem. Can you imagine if all of us  adopt the option of free music download? We will have the worst scenario ever! Artists will starving and the music industry will collapse dramatically. We have to support legal download to protect people who invest and work for music industry.",False
