I meaned, if their purpose is to verify informations, how can they so sure that the datas and informations they have collected are true and genuine. We know that the world of cryptocurrency are anonymous and no real identities are being given here. Just my only concerns and hopefully it will addressed.   I agree with you, after i read their whitepaper we have the same questions about the project. It really confused me about how would they find the people or event that the person wanted to verify.  Well, this is really quite difficult to do because information need some proof of being authentic/original. Can the team be trusted with what they are going to show about someones information and this is the problem that they need to solve. Same matter here to discuss. Well, I agree with this. This is some kind of confusion for each one of us. The purpose and idea of this project is a bit difficult to understand because it seems like the team Verifier goal for the community of crypto currency is somehow a bit complicated in terms of verifying the informations. And I guess this needs some answers from the Verifier Team for us to put mind into ease.   To minimize the risk of manipulation there is a scoring system for verifiers. If they provide wrong data they would not be able to continue working in the system, also there is always a possibility to ask 2 or more verifiers to check the same object or data. The verifier is always randomly chosen, so it is also a protection.

Quote from: zevl194 on April 13, 2018, 02:22:55 PM I won't understand why the Russian names in team, but flags of Great Britain and China?

This only means that these team members are physically located in these countries and look after these markets.

Hopefully the team will answer different concern and questions that relying on this nice and great project.  It seems like the admin is not that active on this thread, they just posted it here. This project already have a lot of competitors that are up and running, what is the unique concept of this project that can compete to others?   Despite the fact that there were at least 20 startups for identity verification last year, all of them were focused on selfie verification. We believe that it will not be sufficient very soon, that's why we offer crowdsourcing for verification.

VRFs will be sold, with a discount given to the first purchasers.    Pre-ICO At the pre-ICO stage, the VRF tokens are a tool of early attraction of funds into the Verifier project. Smart contracts are not applied here, with the sale being directly done into the Verifier wallet. Tokens amount limit: 143,000 VRF  There would be discounts based on the amount of purchased tokens.

DISTRIBUTION OF TOKENS  Verifier tokens are the internal currency of the Verifier ecosystem. Turnover and liquidity are supported by the operation of the entire system. Verifier Tokens do not entitle the holder in participating in profit distribution. Demand for Verifier tokens is driven by increasing the number of users of the system and the popularity of the system.     Who makes up Verifier’s team?  We assembled a very strong team: EMBA Skolkovo students – CEOs of large companies, the vanguard of the Russian business. This is exactly the kind of team that brings projects capable of forever changing the world into life. We were developing the project, discussing it’s positioning, planning events, monitoring the market. After the end of the studies, all of us together founded Verifier, meticulously gathered the team of effective employees and contractors, who were keen on achieving the result. And it wasn’t slow in coming: the promo version of the product with a complete scenario for verification is ready. The end-product solution will be available in the beginning of December. And now the whole project’s team is preparing for an ICO. - DMITRY NAZAROV, The founder of the project       Verifier is an innovative technology designed to verify identity, events, deals, and any other kind of data.
