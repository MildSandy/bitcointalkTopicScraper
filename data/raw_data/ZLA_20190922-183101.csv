There are ICO listing sites where you can also participate such as: China: icoage.com ico.team beico  US Coinlist.com  The Chinese ones are having a *few problems at the moment and Coinlist is I'm sure still working on ironing out the kinks before they go live. Our services diverge in a number of ways. (their systems are very manual, ours are automated and scalable, they aren't crowd vetted, no credit card, etc) We don't think of them as a competitor and we are actively working to get them to list ICOs that they manage on our platform.  There's also: Starbase, Waves, Comsa etc,  They help teams create an ICO. Again, we are working to partner with them so that the ICO's created on their platforms will automatically be listed on ZILLA.  Indirect competitors are your industry Venture Capital. ICOs have already eclipsed seed/angel round VC funding. What will happen when they are ready for an A round in 18 moths? I suspect they will be able to tap into their reserve of tokens. This coupled with the explosive growth of ICOs will potentially decimate allow ICOs to eclipse early-round VC funding (I give it 12 months actually). What will have to happen? VCs use ICOs to raise funds VCs use ICOs to help mid stage portfolio companies to do reverse ICOs VCs invest in ICOs VCs present another value add by advising ICOs.  #3, and 4 are already happening. ZILLA can help with 1, 2, and 3. We are looking for a VC that would be a good fit to advise us and explore how ZILLA can provide services to help VC /Hedge funds get better returns in the ICO space.

ZILLA will act as a gateway to onboard new Crypto enthusiasts to easily and safely participate in various crowd-vetted ICOs, while also allowing companies to do an ICO more effectively.  ICO crowdsales are becoming more commonplace.With more than 1500 ongoing ICOs and counting, it is becoming overwhelming for buyers to keep track, compare and verify between various ICOs. Moreover, the ever growing complexity of the ICO environment for new-would-be crypto enthusiasts is both astounding and paralyzing. No simple consumer-friendly and intuitive platform exists that enables participants to conveniently grasps and compare competing ICOs.  In addition, there is no central authority or institution (by design) that is a reference point for new crypto enthusiasts. The discovery of new ICOs remains a challenge. Before the decision is made to participate in an ICO, potential participants must painstakingly learn about how proposed projects will work, investigate the backgrounds and qualifications of the team behind the projects, and understand exactly what they are purchasing. The risk of scams and fake crowdsales undermine the credibility of the sector. The process of completing KYC requirements for multiple projects is time-consuming.  These issues reduce the amount of attention each ICO gets, and as the number of ICOs increases, maximizing exposure for quality ICOs becomes more important.   ZILLA aims to provide a unified marketplace for curated ICO crowd sales in one app - presenting it akin to Amazon and its products or Etrade and the Stock Market.  Each listing will have all the information participants will need to make an informed decision, and be able to commit with a couple of clicks.  We aim to target the app at hotbeds of ICO trade we've identified: not just the western markets (in English) but China, Japan and Korea as well.   The product Please see our presentation here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/wj72m3dj6wsafnw/ZILLA%20Investor%20Presentation.pdf?dl=0  ZILLA has already been prototyped; the marketplace app is currently in production, and we’re targeting a December 2017 release. The ZLA merchant API, which will allow merchants worldwide to accept any token for payment, is on track for Q4 2018.

The crowdsale is projected to begin in October 2017.  If any ZLA token remains unsold at its conclusion, ZILLA will sell the remaining tokens on the  app for 10 USD each (price subject to company discretion).  ZLA tokens can be sold on exchanges for any price (subject to market rates), or used on our platform to save on other token sale fees.  Companies, funds, and individuals alike are all invited to participate in the ZILLA Token Crowdsale, with the following exceptions due to legalities: Citizens of the United States are not allowed to participate. Citizens of Singapore are not allowed to participate.   Allocation And Price  There will be a hard cap of 15,000,000 USD worth of ZLA tokens to be distributed. Zilla will issue 60,000,000 ZLA tokens total, of which: 55% of that amount (33,000,000 ZLA) will be traded to public contributors. 40% (24,000,000 ZLA) will go to the founding team. 5% (3,000,000 ZLA) will go to Investors.  Proceeds from the token crowdsale will go towards further development of the ZILLA platform and ongoing operational costs, as follows:  How We Compare  Disclaimer: We do not regard Lykke, Starbase, BitcoinSuisse and ICOAGE to be competitors; rather, we feel that our app is complementary to their services. We focus on a consumer-friendly ICO discovery and shopping app, simplified for the end user, in multiple languages.  https://imgur.com/bUAZLti  If you have any questions about our platform and the upcoming crowdsale, do reply here, and we’ll answer them as best as we can.

The process is as follows:  You send ETH from an exchange to your ZILLA in app wallet. We have the ICO issuer's cryptocurrency addresses so you as the participant don't need to worry about that.  Your name, phone number, address is required when participating (to protect us and the project team legally). When you participate in a project that requires KYC, you register your documentation one time, and for future projects that require it, you authorize it at checkout.  The credit card processing is part of our secret sauce.  Before opening the app and at checkout we require your fingerprint.  We are in early talks with a few exchanges regarding getting in and out of fiat.  There is an additional fee for credit card payments but that is still being hashed out. We expect credit card payments will be for newbies but pro users will participate using crypto. There are fees for ICO issuers and participants however fees for participants are totally waived if you hodl ZLA tokens. Please see the whitepapers for details regarding this.
