Product  An average ICO project most often has a complex product that requires additional development and implementation. ClearCost already has a working MVP (hotel booking service) with a clear and transparent business model.  2. Benefit  An average ICO project promises multiple-times benefit, but without justification. ClearCost benefit is simple and clear: it’s 4-8 times more beneficial to use CCWT tokens than fiat money to pay for the service subscription. The economic basis for the growth of the token price is the cost of the subscription in the fiat money. The cost of the subscription in the token is falling, but in fiat money is growing, so the market value of the token is increasing.  3. Market  Market of most ICO projects is well researched (from marketing angle), but not tested in practice yet. The ClearCost’s market is dynamically developing and tested in practice.  4. Risks  It’s a matter of long discussions and disputes, but the main risk of ICO projects is that the project will not be launched. As for ClearCost, the risk of non-launching is extremely low, since the first version of the service is already working, and people are served.  5. Capital raising goals  Usually, the average ICO project raises funds to develop the product itself and its infrastructure. At the same time, ClearCost raise funds to improve the existing service and to promote it among cryptocurrencies users.  6. And the last, but not the least – the role of a cryptocurrency  In average ICO projects, the role of a cryptocurrency is to attract investment. In ClearCost project, it’s creating of a network of users, since our cryptocurrency – CCWT tokens – is one of the ways to pay the service subscription fee.",False

We try to make the ClearCost service as profitable and understandable to our users as  possible, so we decided to modernize the business model.  Previously, customers purchased tokens, which provided the right to receive a unit of service (night at the hotel) at cost. So the idea that followed was - the more tokens you buy, the more nights you can book. A minimum package of 57 tokens was allowed for a five year period during which you can book approximately 75 nights.  The new business model of ClearCost looks like this: The minimum package of tokens (and its cost) remained unchanged - 57 CCWT, but now it's enough for the SIX-YEAR CLUB SUBSCRIPTION. The annual subscription entitles you to book PRACTICALLY AN UNLIMITED number of nights at the cost price (no more than 365 per year).  In addition, we decided to enter the European markets country-by-country and therefore we increase the deadline for token sale until October 31; this was approved by all the backers and investors.  As it was before, you can pay fiat money on our website; there, annual fee is $ 45.   However, becoming a member of the club using CCWT is four times more profitable, and this profit will only grow.  57 tokens now cost less than $ 50. Thus, it is possible to recoup the entire subscription period on the first trip, if it is  expensive enough.    Take more benefit with ClearCost!",False
