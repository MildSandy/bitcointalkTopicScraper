Tokens are issued at the beginning to project participants. At the end, the tokens are bought back from the participants with the revenue earned. This means that companies using Dogezer don’t need to seek outside funding before they begin work.

Rivetz is happy to announce a new partnership, with the Estonia-based Agrello to develop a hardware-based cybersecurity solution for digital identities.  Based in Tallinn, Estonia, Agrello was founded by a team of lawyers, academics and technologists who seek to create the smartest and securest smart contracts. Their Agrello ID is expected to be as good as presenting your passport in person, though it’s digital and blockchain-based.  Partnering with Rivetz will add an extra layer of hardware-based security As digital identity service, allowing you to identify yourself online with the click of a button. Agrello ID as good as presenting your passport in person and the Know Your Customer (KYC) technology they are using for the ID already is being used by several financial institutions in crypto-friendly Estonia.  Using Rivetz’ toolkit, the Agrello ID application will be able to access the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), bypassing a user’s phone operating system — and thereby the potential malware installed on it. The TEE is installed on most modern mobile devices.  “In cooperation with Rivetz, we can take our ID system to the highest level of security assurance, providing the uppermost form of protection available today,” Agrello CEO Hando Rand said. “This will allow us to expand our client base to new enterprise customers with higher levels of risk in their operations.”  Rivetz CEO Steven Sprague was equally bullish on the partnership.  “Agrello provides state-of-the-art identity services that meet the needs of modern users,” Sprague said. “We are very pleased to work with them to deliver a new token-powered model for identity and security, enhancing the security and simplicity required by the market.”  https://blog.rivetz.com/rivetz-partners-with-agrello-on-secure-identity-solutions-2da20d9a686",True

That’s why Rivetz today announced that it has joined the Trusted IoT Alliance, an open-source software foundation supporting a secure, scalable, interoperable, and trusted IoT ecosystem.  Rivetz CEO Steven Sprague many times has emphasized the importance of having a secure way to send commands to smart devices. It’s great if you have a smart home and can unlock your door remotely. But what if someone can hijack your private key and unlock your house when you’re not at home?  “It is critical that the instruction sent is not just signed by a private key but also includes cybersecurity data about the integrity of the thing that sent the instruction,” Sprague explained recently in a chat with the Telegram community of our partner, Agrello.  “In a decentralized system, there is no network security to supervise all of the transaction,” he continued. “If a private key is stolen, there are no defenses. Rivetz allows a second set of controls that can observe the sender of the instruction using the trusted agent in the device to ask ‘What condition am I in?’ and bind it to the control.”  That use case is why the Trusted IoT Alliance was glad to welcome Rivetz on board, said Zaki Manian, Executive Director of the Trusted IoT Alliance.  “Their Trusted Execution Environment technology has deep potential to link smart contracts with the physical world,” he said.  The Trusted IoT Alliance is a coalition of Fortune 500 companies and startups who are working at the intersection of blockchain technology and the IoT. The Alliance has a blockchain-agnostic philosophy — it doesn’t matter what blockchain the companies are using; it’s the technology that is important.  The Alliance works with companies like Rivetz to develop standards, certification, technical advancements, and business opportunities. This includes registering IoT devices and creating event logs on decentralized systems, creating an ecosystem that links cryptographic registration, identities, and metadata.  “Known devices in known conditions, whether protecting digital assets or creating or consuming provable data, are a fundamental capability to ensuring trust in decentralized applications,” Sprague said. “We engaged with the Trusted IoT Alliance because we believe it is the most appropriate forum to advance these types of capabilities in the blockchain community, working with the organizations who have a vested interest in ensuring the security of the entire ecosystem.”  https://blog.rivetz.com/rivetz-joins-the-trusted-iot-alliance-6549b09c7f61",True

Every ARM and Intel chip ships with a second isolated micro-chip inside it that is independent from the operating system of the phone (or other device). However, this is not widely know as you would not normally come into contact with it. Rivetz makes use of this secure area to remain uncompromised by the daily and highly insecure functions of the device. The device owener can do what they like with the contents of the operating system, download apps or whatever, but Rivetz is securely isolated from this in a 'vault-like' manner.",True

RvT will be available through a token sale open to the community.  The token sale will start on August 10th 2017 17:00 UTC  It will end on September 10th 2017 17:00 UTC   Rivetz cyber security token provides proof and assurance of privacy and security at a hardware level. Rivetz integrates trusted computing with blockchain technology to provide comprehensive privacy protection across multiple devices powered by the RvT token.          Rivetz works through the Trusted Execution Environment: a private hardware “vault” on your phone that is completely independent from the operating system. Inside of this vault, everything is isolated – so no apps or software or operating system can see what’s inside. This is where Rivetz works to securely manage your secrets, your passwords, keys, and other private information.  RvT Tokens power Rivetz: RvT works with the blockchain to cryptographically prove that the vault in your phone is secure, all the way from the manufacturer to your pocket. The RvT blockchain can perform a health check, verifying that your vault’s integrity is intact, and that transactions you send are exactly the ones you intended.  Rivets token represents a pivotal moment in history. For the first time devices can be enabled with tamper resistant hardware with attestation capabilities. This means that security can now be measured and delivered at the transaction level and at the authentication level. Assuring the devices that help us work and play every day can keep our secrets safe and assure the transactions are not altered.    Visit Our Crowdsale Website  Read Our Whitepaper    Only Rivetz provides assurance! Rivetz utilizes the hardware security embedded in devices to truly secures customers' devices and transactions from being exposed, and protects software development companies from financial exposure and public embarrassment. It proves Attestation, Health And Integrity by binding the health and integrity of the device to a transaction.      The Future of Decentralised Device Integrity Rivetz ground breaking design goes where none has gone before to securely enable the machine execution of instructions according to owner-led policy. Rivets checks the status of a device before undertaking a task for example, ‘connecting to the cloud’. If conditions match, then the task can proceed. If they do not match, the task will not be permitted. This represents a pivotal moment for decentralised cyber security by enabling devices to act on behalf of their owners to make a purchase or sign a contract or any number of things. The uses of this pioneering technology are endless and provides a vital piece of the puzzle for securing the Internet of Things.  Over the past year Rivetz has demonstrated that their technology can be widely implemented. The company prototype the RvT security capabilities In late 2016 and is actively integrating it into projects today. The system is compatible with over 2.5 billion devices in circulation and anywhere where Intel and ARM processors can be found. The opportunity is real.
