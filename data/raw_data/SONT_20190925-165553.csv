Let's open a bit about our inner workings and plans.  The company claims that it will be different from other similar projects, but how? Sonata.ai will actually work the way an exchange traders would expect. If you ever used Forex trading tools as a daily routine, you already know that most of crypto exchanges got the core functionality wrong. This is what we will do differently. We believe that we have a excellent business model, great mixture of functions and that Sonata.ai will be more than just a sum of everything. Please have a look on our white paper to find all differences in features section. Do you know any other (currently available) exchange that can offer exactly what we do, including how our tokens is used? Let us know!   What is new to protect your customers from fraud? First of all, there is no such a thing as an impenetrable system that would protect all customers from a fraud. But let me name a few of our things that distinguish us from others: We are directly backed by an investor with 24 years experience in finance industry. Solidni finance a.s. is easily searchable, has a reputable history and a clean slate. We have history in cryptocurrency, albeit a short one. We have already created small fiat - crypto exchange for Czech market. Although it is no wonder, it can still be a clear proof that we can deliver a product. Sonata.ai will be developed whether you decide to invest or not. We will show the progress of our work to insiders and public. It will be only up to you if you find our project interesting enough. There is clear equation: the earlier you will invest, the bigger bonus in tokens and higher risk. The later you will invest, the closer we will be to an actual platform, so you can see what you will invest to.   How many tokens do you need to purchase to replenish your ranks? Work on the exchange is in progress as we speak. On the other side, it is true that we plan to grow bigger if we see positive reaction of general public. Solidni finance a.s. invested $4,000,000 to make this happen. If we sell tokens with this value, we have green light to assemble a team with full potential. That will effectively help us to deliver all promises we have made so far.  Hope I have answered everything. If not, please feel free to ask more!",False
