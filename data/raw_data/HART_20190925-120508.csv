Farmers are struggling with getting a good price for their yields. The price for their goods fluctuates enormously, and sometimes even a single hour could see the price drop from reasonable to outright bad. With this, farmers can use HARA as a business management tool to help them gauge the prices that they are offering for their yields depending on the price that the people are offering. They could then make an informed decision on whether to sell to a distributor (buyer) or directly to the general market. If they decide to sell to the general market, it would eliminate the mark-up prices of the distributors thus, resulting in cheaper products and eliminating the farmer's reliance on distributors without paying their fees or ""cut"".  As a form of insurance, the farmers have a homegrown insurance system called the multi-crop system. This system is where the farmers plant multiple crops at the same time and just in case a certain crop's price fluctuates they would have some type of fallback. Chilies seem to be the most common secondary crop that farmers grow since spicy food is very common in  Indonesia. However, the farmers admitted that there is no real plan in going into what crops they plant.  HARA could assist the farmers by providing transparent market information. Proving this transparency could help stabilize prices on the market and give the farmer a better insight of what they‚Äôll be earning. HARA also identified hydroponic farmers  that grow plants without the need for soil, instead they use an enriched mineral solution. There is a big difference between hydroponic farmers and regular farmers wherein the hydroponic farmers know exactly what nutrients are needed to optimize the growth of their plants, and thus calculate the estimate for their profits. On the other hand, the regular farmers mostly just guess.  The data collected in the HARA data exchange platform can be used to share knowledge and to educate farmers that will improve their bottom lines, therefore they can save money by not unnecessarily overusing farm input materials like fertilizer.

We analyze the country's scope and the data in the Agricultural and Food sector.

We check the country's Internet and Mobile penetration. Internet and mobile penetration are the most important factors to ensure the penetration of HARA platform.

Thus, it is important to have an overview of the financial service industries and its potentials in the target countries. Despite the potentials of banking reach, microfinance institutions are still the key to improve financial access to agriculture workers in developing countries, given its advantage in proximity to the customers and its frequent association with more cooperative financing approaches.

Here's a very good use case of HARA! This article features a story of a farmer that our field agents met in Tojo Una-Una Regency, Central Celebes. The farmers there mostly grow their corn with the intention of selling it as animal feed. Although they produce a high quality of kernel, the overall total yield was quite low! This is because of the practice of seed replanting. The original seed is not designed to have its offspring planted in the next season. The farmer is well aware of this, she simply does not have a choice due to capital limitation.  This problem will continue unless they have an access to a source of capital that won‚Äôt tie them to an unfair price of their yield.  That is where HARA can make a change. HARA collects the data that allows farmers to apply for microcredit loans. With access to these loans, farmers will be able to drastically increase their yield and consequently, their income.

In this system, the farmers plant different types of produce at the same time. That way they at least have something else to fall back on, if the price of one crop turns out to be terrible. However, the farmers admitted that there is no real plan going into what crops they plant. Often they just randomly choose something. In this way, the multi-crop solution serves as a sort of home-grown insurance protecting the farmers from bad prices.    HARA could assist the farmers by providing transparent market information. The data collected on the HARA data-exchange can be used to share knowledge and educate farmers to help improve their bottom lines. For example, by helping farmers to refine their farming practices, they can save money by not unnecessarily overusing farm input materials like fertilizer.  In the deployment partnership, HARA assisted with collecting the data of around 300 farmers to help them apply for the KUR microcredit. While the hydroponic farmers are already inspiring the other farmers with their results, becoming a hydroponic farmer themselves does require a big investment. This is where microloans like the KUR could help out.  ** The HARA Token Pre-sale is now open! You can join the sale through the Liquid ICO Market or the Tokenomy Launchpad.

There is a lot of demand for microcredit in Indonesia. The most prolific form of this microcredit is the Kredit Usaha Rakyat (KUR). The KUR is a state-sponsored credit or investment financing scheme specifically dedicated to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which are unable to meet certain requirements set by banks for regular loans. For banks, actually disbursing the microcredit is often problematic.  millions of these Indonesians are basically immediately disqualified when applying for microcredit. Apart from often lacking proper documentation, they are generally considered too risky for loans or simply live in locations too remote for formal financial services.  Banks need partners that help them streamline the KUR disbursement. Apart from making sure that people do not fall victim to black market lenders, it is also in the banks own the best interest to issue KUR in a quick and reliable way as it can be highly lucrative. This is where blockchain companies like HARA come in. HARA helps both the banks and the MSMEs to profit off of each other. HARA also unlocks access to financial institutions for the MSMEs, like smallholder farmers. Apart from earning an extra income through the HARA ecosystem, this also prevents them from having to approach black market lenders.  Through companies like HARA, banks get easy access to a lucrative untapped market. The involvement of HARA also means that a new influx of capital and confidence in the world of the blockchain, which is especially important in a bear market.  Currently, HARA is partnered directly with BNI and is working together with BTPN through a different partnership. Both banks have been able to disburse the KUR microcredit at an unprecedented rate.

The KUR is a subsidized microcredit and is one of the national economic initiatives aimed at improving access to finance for micro to medium enterprises in Indonesia. To grant microcredit loans, BNI needs data from the farmers ranging from their ID to the land they own and what crops they plant. However, getting this information has sometimes proven difficult. Therefore, BNI and HARA are collaborating to speed up this process.  BNI will benefit from HARA in two ways.  The data that HARA provides will make the data collection process a lot faster, as the bank will only need to do sampling from the data instead of collecting it all themselves and HARA‚Äôs data collection model helps ease the administrative process for the loan applications.  On the other hand, BNI helps HARA to improve access to loans for smallholder farmer.

In America, they can do precision agriculture because the farmland is wide open, not like Indonesia.

In the future, the availability of data will also enable the creation of personalized products that can be provided en masse at relatively low prices.

Farmers in Indonesia have little to no access to agricultural data and market information that could increase their productivity and reduce their losses.

Here's a story of one of the farmers that our team met in August when our team traveled to Tojo Una-Una Regency, in Central Celebes. Our team came across them while they were doing the post-harvest handling of their crops.  Farmers in the region mostly grow their crops, corn, with the intent of selling it for animal feed. The normal process would take around 4 months of planting and another 4 weeks to dry up the corns before harvesting. This process normally would result in a high-quality kernel. However, the overall quality of the farmer's total yield was quite low. This is because the original seed that they planted came from the previous harvest. The seed was not designed to have its offspring planted in the next season.  The quality of the crops decreases significantly when certain seed are reused. The farmer is well aware of this, but they simply do not have a choice due to capital limitation.  This problem would continue unless the farmer can access another resource of capital. That is where HARA can make a change. HARA collects the data that allows farmers to apply for microcredit loans. With access to these loans, farmers will be able to drastically increase their yield and consequently their income.  While our work has just started in Tojo Una-Una, 10 farmers have already been able to get microcredit loans through data collected through the HARA platform. Through a bit of data, HARA helps smallholder farmers make big improvements. This is one way of how HARA will empower billions of smallholder farmers in Indonesia and beyond. ",False
