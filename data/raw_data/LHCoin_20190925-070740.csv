We are planning to launch an additional branch of the broker with all the operations processed in crypto-currencies only.  In other words, the clients’ deposits, replenishments, withdrawals and other operations will be processed in crypto-currencies only. At the final stage of the project these transactions will be processed in broker’s tokens. This minor modernization will radically change the broker’s economy  This opens access to new markets for our services; this expands our client’s database and makes it easier and cheaper to make transfers for clients from the countries with harsh currency regulations (China, Arab countries, and some Latin America countries).

At the stage of ICO our project was joined by the independent expert and appraiser of WhitePaper, a recognized leader in cybersecurity and management – Joseph Steinberg.  Joseph Steinberg was a head of companies and divisions in the field of information security for almost two decades and was recognized as one of the 3 best cybersecurity specialist in the world. Joseph has published his own book on cybersecurity, which is used by many heads of the departments of IT security for the successful completion of certifications and obtaining these certificates. He is also one of 28 people worldwide who is specializing in certification in the field of information security, CISSP, ISSAP, ISSMP, and CSSLP. This fact proves his rare and deep knowledge in the field of cybersecurity. Developed products of Joseph in the field of information security are mentioned in more than 100 patent applications in the USA.  Steinberg is the most widely read author in the field of cybersecurity and other advanced technologies – he has collected millions of readers as a regular author of Forbes and Inc. Joseph acts as an expert and consultant on issues related to information security and the latest technologies. These are the spheres in which he has advised a number of large enterprises and the U.S. government.  Steinberg founded and led several successful businesses. He is the Executive Director of the company SecureMySocial, which has recently introduced the world's first system which warns users in real time about publications of inappropriate posts by them on social networks. Previously, for over 10 years he held the position of Executive Director in the company specializing in cybersecurity, Green Armor Solutions.  Also Joseph was the Executive Director of certain divisions of the company Whale Communications which was later purchased by Microsoft.  Steinberg headed the Financial Advisory Board for the municipality of the state of New Jersey which total municipal and education budget was over 150 million dollars. The authoritative resource NJBiz recognized Joseph Steinberg to be one of the most successful businessmen of the state of New Jersey under the age of forty.  The presence of a professional in the field of cyber security of such a high level that has Joseph Steinberg will undoubtedly strengthen the position of the cryptocurrency broker LH-CRYPTO, and will provide with the maximum level of security to all the project transactions.  www.lh-crypto.io  #LHCrypto #Forex #cryptocurrency #broker",True

We either pay 3% of the acquired sum in ETH. or we pay out this sum in Bounty tokens (#LHCoin_B) at the ratio 1:10. So if the investor you have invited purchases 100 #LHCoin tokens, then you receive 10 Bounty tokens (#LHCoin_B). You can choose the type of your reward. Either in crypto-currency (ETH) or in #LHCoin_B tokens.  All you need to do to take part in our referral program is to register on our site. After the registration is completed, you will get a 6-digit code. You can attract new investors to the project by sharing the information about our company and posting links to our site: For instance, if your code is 123456, then the link you post is https://lh-crypto.io/123456 After one follows this link, his or her computer will be marked with a special code, the so-called cookie.

According to the logic used in our crowdsale, in general 20 million tokens will be sold during the PRE ICO, and the final price of the token will be determined on the last day of the PRE ICO (2nd of December) as the numerator of the amount of the investment denominated by 20 million. This means that from now on, the number of tokens in the personal accounts of those who have purchased them before will be reduced with each new investment in the project, but the price of each token will grow. Thus the total value of the tokens of each investor will remain the same.  Those who have not acquired the tokens yet are free to do it until the 2nd of December at the lowest price. On the 3d of December the PRE ICO will be ended, the final price of the token LHC will be defined.  The next day on the 4th of December a new stage of the ICO will be opened, but the sales price of the token will be immediately increased by 5% and then every week it will increased by 10, 15 and 21%.  The margin on the tokens will be immediately distributed to earlier investors.  Buy tokens until the 2nd of December. Then they will only get more expensive.  www.lh-crypto.io  #LHCrypto #Forex #cryptocurrency #broker",True

The answer is yes! The fact that the size of investments into our project is now over 2 mil US dollars doesn't mean our pre-ICO is also over! Now the price of each new LHCoin is rising with new investments.  The total amount of tokens to be distributed is 20 mil, with the final price for LHCoin to be set on December 3, as a percentage of the total 20 mil investment. This means that from now on, the amount of tokens on the token holder accounts will keep dropping, yet the price will be growing as investments continue flowing in. The amount of investments during pre-ICO is unlimited.  There are enough tokens for everyone, since the amount of tokens sold during the pre-ICO phase will be divided between the participants, proportional to their investments. During the ICO phase, however, the amount of both investments and tokens is strictly limited. Don't miss the chance to buy tokens before December 2. The ICO phase begins December 4, and from then on, there might be not enough tokens for everyone.  www.lh-crypto.io  #LHCrypto #Forex #cryptocurrency #broker",True

Why is it so important? What would it give to investors? The company Larson&Holz has been successfully working on the financial markets since 2004. Today the company has hundreds of thousands of registered Forex traders from all over the world. Monthly incoming customer flow of the company is 3 000 000 USD. All this allows us to guarantee to investors that their contribution to the tokens LHCoin will have annual returns of at least 20%, as we undertake all the risks!  To ensure the profitability of the token LHCoin, the company Larson&Holz has developed within the project Lh-Crypto the program Token Rate Insurance System. If in a year after the start of trading on the exchange the return of the token LHCoin is below 20%, according to the Token Rate Insurance System, the company Larson&Holz will offset the remaining difference from their own funds.  Join our PRE ICO and make the most of bonuses! It is safe and profitable!  More info on the website https://lh-crypto.io/?lang=en.  #LHCrypto #Forex #cryptocurrency #broker",True

The amount of the raised funds will define the token price. We have come to a conclusion that the PRE ICO investors will have our tokens at the lowest price(the exact price is calculated after the PRE ICO), and then the price will go up by 5%, 10%, 15% and 21% each week.  Our smart contract implies that the markup for the token price will be distributed among the previous investors. So the 5%-markup will be distributed among the investors who purchased tokens during the PRE ICO stage.  The following week the price will go up by 10%, which will be distributed among the PRE ICO tokens holders and those who will have purchased tokens during the first week of the ICO, etc. Therefore, all the project participants (apart from the final group) will earn real ethereums, and even before the ICO is over!

But we have chosen a different path!  Our smart contract implies that the markup for the token price will be distributed among the previous investors. So the 5%-markup will be distributed among the investors who purchased tokens during the PRE ICO stage.  The following week the price will go up by 10%, which will be distributed among the PRE ICO tokens holders and those who will have purchased tokens during the first week of the ICO, etc. Therefore, all the project participants (apart from the final group) will earn real ethereums, and even before the ICO is over!

The website recommends LHCrypto to investors looking for speculative gain, and aware of the risks inherent in that field.   ICOrating specifically pointed out that Larson & Holz possesses the required infrastructure, expertise and clientele all over the world. The project is putting a ready-to-operate broker service onto the fast-growing cryptocurrency trading market. The team of professionals working on the project boasts more than enough experience in the field to develop and scale up their current project.  The profit extraction mechanism developed by the founders makes #LHCoin tokens especially attractive to investors. The company guarantees token holders a share in its operational revenue along with a monthly ROI of 20%. If the #LHCoin price falls behind 120% after the first year, the company assumes an obligation to satisfy the difference at its own expense.  The key feature the founders of the LHCrypto project guarantee its clients is providing brokerage entirely in cryptocurrencies, all transactions logged on the blockchain. Today, no existing broker can offer a similar option.  LHCrypto development and ICO were set to motion by the fast growth of the trading market and an opportunity to bypass a lot of inconvenient restrictions currently in effect for its clients. The project will ensure independence from any lawmakers, 100% transaction security along with zero cash-in/cash-out restrictions.  Putting this project into being will allow Larson&Holz cut transactional expenses from 6% down to 1%, attract more players from the cryptocommunity to the trading market, and establish a clearing system with countries operating in harsh financial legislation.  https://lh-crypto.io  #LHCrypto #Forex #cryptocurrency #broker",True

When will the fixing of profits on Ethereum end? Is there a chance for Ripple to wake from a stupor? What awaits the cryptocurrency market in late 2017 – early 2018?  Within the first 10 months of 2017, the cryptocurrency market has already demonstrated a rapid growth. As of today, its cumulative capitalization has exceeded 160 billion dollars, and by the end of the year it may reach 200 billion. According to Coinmarketcap, there are more than 1100 cryptocurrencies in the world, and considering that there are 2 – 3 new ICO projects conducted weekly, it is likely that by the beginning of 2018, the lineup will overcome  and there will be already 1200 altcoins.  Nevertheless, many investors continue to treat the cryptocurrency market with extreme caution. And the point is not even in its youth and size (by and large, both $160 billion and $200 billion are insignificantly small in the scale of the world economy), but for a lack of understanding of the mechanisms for functioning and principles of existence in this world.  The unsettled legal status of the cryptocurrencies gives investors uncertainty. At the present time, for the vast majority of regulators, cryptocurrencies are either commodities or securities, not cash, from the legal point of view.  The topic for a separate and detailed discussion is the volatility of this market. Only investors with a very stable nervous system can feel themselves quietly in stressful situations, as the daily fluctuations in the rate of tens of percent for this market is a given (even for cryptocurrency with the largest capitalization).  Nevertheless, despite all the worries and fears of investors, the cryptocurrency market continues to grow at very good rates. Over time, representatives of small and medium-sized businesses are becoming more and more interested in it, while considering it as an effective tool for attracting investments on conditions that are not too onerous for themselves.  Of course, the political and economic elites will continue to do everything in their power to stop the growth of the capitalization for the country by the end of 2017. All kinds of loud statements and prohibitive measures will appear regularly, but the effect from them is unlikely to be sustainable. Let us recall how terrible the recent statements of the Central Bank of China on the complete ban of new ICOs were, how the market of cryptocurrencies reacted to them by global decline and how quickly this news was discussed, and the market returned to growth.  This situation is very much  trying to extinguish a powerful low-level forest fire by periodically discharging several tons of water from a helicopter – causing some effect, of course, but very soon everything returns to normal. As the US, Singapore, Russia, and China are increasingly resisting cryptocurrencies, an increasing number of zones with favorable crypto-economies, such as the Isle of Man or the canton of Zug in Switzerland, are emerging. And the appearance of such vents is no less, and maybe more active than twisting nuts. Thus, the emergence of new jurisdictions in which both ICO and cryptocurrencies have a clear legal status is the key to sustainable growth of this market, both in the short and medium term.  Of course, it will not be possible to manage it without adjustments caused by various legislative shake-ups, but the effect from them, as we have already said, will be extremely short on the simple basis that no central bank has a decisive influence on the world of electronic money. As for the negative news history, it is in a position to seriously frighten only the most conservative investors, who also bypass the high-risk financial instruments in the traditional market.  Nevertheless, until there is a sufficiently deep synergy of the world of cryptocurrency and fiat money, while they follow parallel courses, approaching, yet then again moving away- the situation at the crypto-exchange markets, continuing the maritime theme, can be compared with Tortuga. The relatively small size of the market de facto made it hostage to speculators, whose actions today account for the behavior of 95% of the world’s largest cryptocurrencies. Just as long as a lazy person doesn’t talk about the fact that each of them is really just an actual soap bubble, and predictions as to when they will collapse amount to tens of thousands.  However, there are scenarios in which the prospect of a global market collapse is minimized. For this, one condition must be fulfilled, by and large: the elements and technologies of cryptology must continue to gradually penetrate into the real sector of the economy, attracting increasing attention and interest from investors. The causal relationship here is extremely simple: the greater the capitalization of the cryptocurrency market, the less influence will be exerted by the speculators, and the reduced volatility will attract even more institutional investors to it.  If we talk about the prospects for specific currencies from the TOP-10, then the picture here is not congeneric. Bitcion’s upcoming trend is not currently threatened by anything: bulls have taken it so much that the curve of quotations can already be entered in the textbooks on stock trading as an ideal example of a game up, where growth periods at almost equal intervals are replaced by short adjustments to fix profits. Thus, no matter how frighteningly high the rate looked, the forecast for the end of the year remains unchanged: $10,000.  Ethereum makes interest to bulls. Now the market has all the signs that the adjustment for this currency has been completed and testing of the levels of 330 – 350 dollars for 1 Ethereum will begin in the very near future. Good prospects for Bitcoin Cash: in most forecasts for this currency, you can find words about trying to test 535 – 540 dollars for one coin. With Zcash the situation is much less obvious: it has about the same prerequisites for growth as it does to the fall. The fact that Zash is trading above the upper boundary of the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo Indicator Cloud is in favor of the first scenario, the intersection of signal lines at level 210, which can be considered a definite signal for sales in favor of the second one.  Investors’ interest in Litecoin, most likely, will continue to fall further. There is a feeling that it will lead to $40- $ 45. Even worse things happen at Ripple. The currency has been in a rut for several weeks, which has already devalued by a third since October 16th. They have something similar to Monero, but the margin of safety of this coin was much more impressive, and the short-term loss of 10% of the value was not so fatal.  #LHCrypto #Forex #cryptocurrency #broker",True

ICO goals   7 things that make our project unique  We already have a working business model. Moreover, we have a long history and a large clientele base.  Larson&Holz is not just a web-site, it is a real company. We have been in the market since 2004, there are numerous representative offices and partners in different countries of Asia, Europe and Latin America. The company staff comprises to more than a hundred of highly qualified specialists speaking in 10 different languages.  We only need to reorient the effective business-model and the marketing campaign for the crypto-environment.  ICO is designed to bring profit to the investors immediately after the PRE ICO stage. This is called “Early Bird Bonus”.  Token holders will be able to earn on the appreciation of the market price of the asset and on the fixed part of the incoming funds flow to the crypto broker’s account. It is absolutely parallel to dividend payments. Also, these payments are included into the smart contract. It is called “CASHBACK”.  Since we already are an effective and profitable broker, we can provide a unique warranty for our token holders. We can guarantee that the market price will increase by at least 20% within the first year. This is what we call the “Token Rate Insurance System”.  Our future clients are active internet users who do not have considerable financial resources and are seeking the opportunities to earn online. Therefore, the huge crypto-currency community is our target audience too.  All the factors combined enable us to claim that this project has no parallel in history. Token price appreciation is confirmed by the existing effective business, which has been bringing profits for more than 10 years  What is Larson&Holz IT Ltd?      Larson&Holz is a Forex and Binary options broker. The company works since 2004. The company clients are individuals who trade on the fluctuations of such financial instruments quotations as currency (including crypto-currencies), shares, oil, gold, etc.  Any person with the deposit over 10 USD can become a company client. Thanks to the company’s open policies, its database contains hundreds of thousands of accounts of traders from Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe.  The client monthly inflow (the amount of funds transferred by clients to their trading accounts) is over 3 mln USD. (*this fact will be relevant later)  You can test the broker’s services on its official site www.lh-broker.com Read more about the brand history on Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larson%26Holz  What are these funds for?  We raise funds to create a crypto version of an existing Forex broker. The proceeds are planned to be invested into a separate branch of the broker, where all the operations will be processed in crypto-currencies only.  In other words, the clients’ deposits, replenishments, withdrawals and other operations will be processed in crypto-currencies only. At the final stage of the project these transactions will be processed in broker’s tokens. This minor modernization will radically change the broker’s economy  Mainly, it will give us access to new markets for our services; it will enlarge our clientele base and will make it easier and cheaper. to make transfers for clients with harsh currency regulations (China, Arab countries, several countries of Latin America).  We believe that in a year the new brocker’s business division will outrun its existing prototype and will bring great profits both to its investors and the owners  How can one earn already during the ICO? What is “Early Bird Bonus”?  We have divided the ICO into 3 stages: PRE ICO, ICO и POST ICO. Each of them will take one month.  The initial funds will be raised during the first stage. The amount of the raised funds will define the token price. As any other company, we are interested in acquiring the largest amount possible. This is why we want to reward those who invest large sums first.  Therefore, we have come to a conclusion that the PRE ICO investors will have our tokens for the lowest price (the exact price is calculated after the PRE ICO), and then the price will go up by 5%, 10%, 15% and 21% each week.  Usually ICO owners either take all the profits of price rise or invest them into the project. But we have chosen a different path!  Our smart contract implies that the markup for the token price will be distributed among the previous investors. So the 5%-markup will be distributed among the investors who purchased tokens during the PRE ICO stage.  The following week the price will go up by 10%, which will be distributed among the PRE ICO tokens holders and those who will have purchased token during the first week of the ICO, etc. Therefore, all the project participants (apart from the final batch) will earn real ethereums, and even before the ICO is over! The reward systems for investors based on the token price markup is called “Early Bird Bonus”.       CASHBACK program   CASHBACK Program is a a fixed proportion of the broker’s operational activity profits which is distributed among the #LHCoin token holders every month.  Background: Accepting funds from clients to Forex broker’s accounts is a very expensive process. With bank cards transactions the broker loses about 6% from the deposit amount as a bank commission. Transition to crypto-currencies would allow us to save 5% from each transaction. Larson&Holz would distribute the saved funds among the investors.  Note that the CASHBACK amount is not calculated from the broker’s profit: it’s the total of all the clients’ payments to their trading accounts. This means tens of millions of dollars, and the amount will be growing relatively to the number of crypto-traders. This accrual is fully automated and the warranty is given by the smart contract itself.    How are we going to keep the minimal yield for our tokens at the 20% level? What is the Token Rate Insurance System?      Traditionally, investors expect to earn on the increased market value of a token. And what if a token doesn’t go up in price? Usually investors take all the risks. But not in our project! We are so confident about the success of our project that we take the responsibility to keep the yearly profit from our tokens at the level of 20%.  The warranty of the minimum profitability is given this way: the broker will provide a Personal Area and will register a real trading account for each ICO investor. This account is registered in MetaTrader as any other account of the broker’s clients. The account can be used just like a conventional trading account, i.e. investors can put a deposit, withdraw funds and make trading deals.  Yet the main purpose of this account is to show the purchased tokens and the funds flow connected to the #LHCoin. If a year later, after the #LHCoin token goes to the market, its price will not have increased by at least 20%, then the broker will accrue the shortfall to the investor’s personal account as a bonus, according to the broker’s standard terms.  You can change it for any other asset from the broker’s list, trade with it or withdraw it from your account, according to the standard rules and regulations of the broker. This system of keeping the token market price at a certain level is called “Token Rate Insurance System”.  Referral program: How to earn by inviting new investors into the ICO?  You can earn by simply recommending our company.  For each investor we pay 3% of the acquired sum in ETH. Or we pay this sum in Bounty tokens (#LHCoin_b) at the ratio 1:10.  So if the investor you have invited purchases 100 #LHCoin tokens, then you will receive 10 Bounty tokens (#LHCoin_b).  You can choose the type of your reward. Either in crypto-currency (ETH) or in #LHCoin_b tokens.  All you need to do to take part in our referral program is to register on our site. After the registration is complete, you will get a 6-digit code.  You can attract new investors to the project by sharing the information about our company and posting such link to our site:  For instance, your code is 123456, then you need to post the link  https://lh-crypto.io/123456  After one follows this link, his or her computer shall be marked with a special code, a so-called cookie.  Then later, if this person, i.e. you referral, buys our tokens, you shall be rewarded for it and will see him or her in your Clients Area.  How much do we expect to raise?  We have set four goals:   Soft CAP > 1’000’000 USD  This is the minimum amount. If we do not reach this point, all the money shall be automatically returned to the investors’ accounts and the project shall be suspended, for it would mean that the interest to the industry is low.  Normal Cap > 5’000’000 USD  This amount will allow us to launch the project according to our Roadmap. We shall follow the Roadmap for about a year.  Optimal Cap > 10’000’000 USD  With more than 10 mln USD raised we will be able to shorten the launch period and will increase the marketing budget, which will help us to win the bulk of the market.  Ultimate Cap = 50’000’000 USD  If the investments amount to 50 mln, the further token sales shall be suspended, for this amount is more than enough for any marketing expenses and will rocket the broker to the TOP-5 in the shortest possible time. There is no point to raise more funds than we need.

It seems that the event planners of the Annual Business Congress with Mikhail Hazin have tried to boil the ocean. The number of topics for discussion and their profundity were astounding. It was hard to believe that three days would be enough to speculate on: world’s major currencies prospects, US economy future, enlarging business profits in the times of crisis, sensible investment tactics, the phenomenon of cryptocurrencies which is gaining more and more popularity nowadays, etc. However, when Mikhail Hazin and Jan Art, the famous experts, come on the stage, any trickiest challenge seems not that unsolvable at all. One of the leading economists (macroeconomists) of Russia in his characteristic vivid manner gave a not-so-bright forecast for the American and global economy and prophesied for the forthcoming reshaping of economic models; he also stated the urging need to seek and implement new ideas. “The global economy cannot survive on the same principles which have been raising it up for the past forty years. Giving people money and hoping for the respective increase in demand is a no go anymore. The developed countries’ population is so deep in depth that some households in the USA cannot cater their credits, not speaking about closing them. The average spending capacity of the US population is on the 1958 level.” said Mr. Hazin. This brings us to a question: what would the management system be after the fundamental changes? According to the economist, there already is an answer: cryptocurrencies. They owe their existence and popularity to the fact that for the past decades the financial system has been coming apart at the seams and the information on the real state of events is more available to people. Vladimir Kuzovlev, Larson&Holz expert, has supported the statement that cryptocurrencies are worth paying attention to. At the very beginning of his speech he claimed that cryptocurrencies in general and bitcoin in particular have long since become real investment instruments, just as fiat currencies, oil or gold. Regarding technical analysis, a popular tool among traders, graphs of several cryptocurrencies look so appealing that it makes investors come to this market again and again. Oleg Dmitriev, an independent specialist from Larson&Holz group, focused attention on how fast cryptocurrencies are evolving, upgrading the convenience of use and its status. “Until recently about a half of what we were talking about could become a reason for criminal investigation, yet today operations with cryptocurrencies are absolutely normal, their invasion to the real world and their synergy with fiat currencies is ever growing” stated Mr. Dmitriev. Currently there are 800 cryptocurrencies, their number is growing (each week there are approximately 2,5 new placements). Due to this there comes a reasonable question: how long will cryptocurrencies survive? All the participants and experts have agreed upon one opinion that there is no place for all 800 cryptocurrencies or more; so there will be some sort of fast natural selection; several dozens (maybe a hundred) of the most powerful, resilient and popular cryptocurrencies will stay and will later represent the whole market. Naturally, the next speech was given by Alexandr Smirnoff, the Head of the Trading Operations and Audit Department of the brokerage house L&H, a top-20 trading guild leader and a famous specialist in market exchange technologies and financial consulting. Mr Smirnoff presented the revolutionary project LH Crypto. It’s not just another exchange platform that Larson&Holz is creating, it starts a fully-featured crypto-broker; it means that from now on the company’s clients will be able to have their accounts not only in USD and EUR, but in cryptocurrencies as well, and make the same operations as with fiat currencies. This step will radically change the broker’s economy, it will open new markets and new regions, where local laws had hindered Forex market development before.
