As stated in the whitepaper:  ""BitCoinage will employ machine learning in their creation of an arbitrage-finding bot, codenamed 'Bloodhound.' This bot will begin by analyzing the last 5 years of trading data across all exchanges in order to uncover patterns in price arbitrages.  The arbitrage bot will be able to understand when a currency is overvalued on a particular exchange and notify users. It will create an entry each time someone trades a currency at a differing value from the average until a pattern is established of those exchanges where arbitrages appear most frequently.  These patterns often point to inexperienced traders, localized exchanges, and newly-listed currencies. Then, the bot will make use of integrated trade API’s with exchanges to buy, sell, and transfer currencies across those exchanges. This process is called “triangular arbitrage trading.” The bot will be able to execute a trade and immediately initiate a transfer back to the user's wallet.  We believe these arbitrage opportunities will exist for quite some time, as newcomers are continuing to enter the market in increased numbers. Exchanges are still localized and new currencies are constantly being listed. Additionally, the volatile nature of Cryptocurrency consistently creates significant price differences between exchanges.""",False

I will be watching this but it will certainly take time before investors see the full potential in this project,False

With that said we understand your concerns and the comment on liquidity deserves a two-fold response. First, when we speak of a liquidity issue we are referring to this very moment, however, things will be different when we begin to see the healthy regulation that the SEC and CFTC want to implement along with growing reality of being able to use cryptocurrency as a daily medium of exchange rather than just a store of value. With that said, we understand that for the moment this is the reality we are operating in. However, the magic really happens when finding the opportunity. We have nicknamed our API ""The blood-hound"" because not only can it notify a trader of an opportunity long before that opportunity closes, but it actually uses machine learning to predict when an opportunity will be lining up so that traders like yourself can be quicker than people or bots simply looking around for these opportunities. The separation between exchanges is wide enough that this opportunity will exist for quite some time. Eventually, we hope that we can actually help close this gap, and when we do margins will become shorter but we will have helped stabilize cryptocurrency volatility while making cryptocurrency a safer place for people to get involved.  We apologize for the long response but we really appreciate all feedback and we want to take the time to answer your question to the best of our abilities.",False

I've been asking myself how does machine learning tech can actually overcome simple bot trading. I mean, although it seems kinda obvious (since ML can recognize trends, adapt itself to breaks, etc. and, as such, is way smarter then a well programmed bot), the crypto market appears to be a harsh environment for AI in general. It's nice to see these breakthroughs coming up now and then.  This is a most interesting topic nonetheless.",False

The biggest threats to security in cryptocurrencies are:  - Hacking and/or stolen storage devices - Forgotten passwords or PINs and - Damage done to storage devices/media  Homeowner policies are already starting to state if your home burns down they will not be responsible for any crypto you may lose. People must be made to feel much more secure in our space.  We at BitCoinage cannot stop any of these things from happening but we can insure you when they do. BitCoinage will be the first company to offer individuals (not just exchanges) insurance on their holdings. Never has a company insured individual holdings for both hot and cold storage. We intend to be the first company to insure against hacking, stolen or lost storage devices and forgotten passwords or PINs.  How can BitCoinage do this?  1. BitCoinage will create an affordable multi-level pricing program to best meet the need of our clients based upon the amount of crypto they expect to insure. Our initial programs will insure against hacking up to $500,000.  2. BitCoinage will secure the services of several security professionals in an effort to establish clearly defined safety/security guidelines. These guidelines will instruct our customers on how to best avoid the most common cryptocurrency security pitfalls.  3. We will have a structure in place to house people's passwords and PINs for later retrieval should they choose to take advantage of that service. Clients may also hold their own passwords according to our predefined guidelines.  If you still have additional questions let us know and we'll make sure this is clear.",False
