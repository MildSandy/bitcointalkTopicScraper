An ETHEREUM-based project can easily write a smart contract and allow its customers to receive the TOKEN at any ERC20 address. I think it is fair to let the customer hold the TOKEN as he wants, even if he is not worth anything at the moment. After all, we paid for that TOKEN. Why 95% of the projects do not allow you to control ....? Something to think thought about .... For example, the MEDOOZA project is the proof otherwise possible: - You are allowed to hold MEDOOZA it wherever you want. - You can realize it at any point you want in their store. - You can move the token to whom you want whenever you want.  * This is not say anything negative about Agate .

Although, iFiats can be used just like other cryptocurrencies, i.e., in a p2p, pseudo anonymous, decentralised, cryptographically secure environment, but they are only circulated inside Agate blockchain to facilitate the payments and real-time settlement and secure the value of funds for both users and merchant as iFiat redemption will not face any pricing or liquidity constraints.  iFiats run on one of the fastest decentralised blockchain platforms, which include a decentralised exchange (DEX), Browser base, wallet encryption, open source, multiparty security and reporting functions and all transaction can be tracked on our blockchain explorer.  iFiat’s one-to-one backing implementation is easier for traditional merchants to understand and accept for their goods or services. Although iFiats are fully redeemable via the options below, the best use case scenario is to spend it with other merchants or suppliers, because it’s real-time and has a very small transaction fee for users.

Yes , in particular there is a contract with a passive card issuer and another one with a financial institution to settle fiat fund in user's bank account  3- Why go for another blockchain instead of say develop a sidechain on ETH itself.

Although, iFiats can be used just like other cryptocurrencies, i.e., in a p2p, pseudo anonymous, decentralised, cryptographically secure environment, but they are only circulated inside Agate blockchain to facilitate the payments and real-time settlement and secure the value of funds for both users and merchant as iFiat redemption will not face any pricing or liquidity constraints.  iFiats run on one of the fastest decentralised blockchain platforms, which include a decentralised exchange (DEX), Browser base, wallet encryption, open source, multiparty security and reporting functions and all transaction can be tracked on our blockchain explorer.  iFiat’s one-to-one backing implementation is easier for traditional merchants to understand and accept for their goods or services.  Although iFiats are fully redeemable via the options below, the best use case scenario is to spend it with other merchants or suppliers, because it’s real-time and has a very small transaction fee for users.

Hamed Taghvaei-   A serial founder of tech companies, including Drone Online, Myservo, King ICO and Business and Demand Group PTY LTD.     Hamid Ostad –  Impressive resume. Since 2016, he’s been the Solutions Architect at BPay Group, a successful Australian bill payment company. He has seven years of experience as tech lead at Creative Digital Technology and five years Dev Manager at Gpayments PTY.     Ali Dorri – PhD candidate at UNSW studying blockchain. He seems to be a blockchain tech expert. No work history listed; his description says he’s worked with several successful blockchain projects already. A few of the team members stand out. Ehsan Jahandarpour – CMO. An influencer, he was ranked top 20 growth hacker in 2016 Forbes. Ariya Chittasy – The website says he’s helped produce four startups over the last eight years, and twi of them are successful. Currently at  Engenesis Ventures, where he “is working with visionaries and innovators to create tech-based companies that serve the world ” Odette Abrenica – UI/UX Designer. She also has the same role at Engenesis. Jaemie Dela Pena – Product Design Lead for Agate and Engenesis. Asi Asgher – Project lead, also works at Engenesis. There are six advisors – they look decent. J Brenton Smith was the VP & GM Asia Pacific & Japan business of Dell Software Group.  Verdict There’s plenty to love about the project including a few unique, possibly groundbreaking ideas. However, there is also plenty of risk. Debit cards for one. Countless blockchain projects have come out with their ICOs talking about how they will have a debit card which can be spent with different cryptos all around the world, yet all of them have flopped so far.  Risks     Their Telegram channel is for announcements only. It’s going to be hard to grow a community around the token if they can’t talk to each other easily. Also seems kind of shady to not allow possible contributors the ability to ask questions in real time. -1     The founders of Agate also recently founded an ICO launching business called King ICO. And most of the team is from a company called Engenesis which is a blockchain project incubator. This means there’s a possibility this team is not serious about making Agate, and are more into making millions of dollars doing ICOs. -1     Laws/Regulations. It’s going to be really hard to get the proper banking licenses required to fully run the Agate platform world wide. -2  Growth Potential     According to the roadmap. Q1 of 2019 is when they will be hoping to get their proper banking licenses. +1     The community seems to like this project, although some of the enthusiasm can be chalked up to their bounty/airdrop program. A large majority of ICO review websites give this project a 90+, or A ranking. And the Bitcointalk page is filled with enthusiastic supporters.+2     If this succeeds, the sky will be the limit. +1     Teams tokens will be locked up for 1 year. +1     50,000 AGT must be staked in the future to run a POS node. +2     GitHub is active and there are several beta demos of diff aspects of the platform. +1.5     Several backers. +2  Disposition High risk/ high reward.

Unlike traditional POS terminal solutions, which are limited to a specific region, Agate POS terminals can be used everywhere in the world without infrastructure limitation! These terminals use the Internet to securely connect to our POS server hosted in the cloud on five continents, and users can use mobile Internet (i.e., 3G/4G) or any other type of common Internet connection (e.g., LAN, WiFi, ADSL) in order to connect their devices to our network.  While currently merchants have to pay between 0.5% and 3% transaction fees to their banks, financial institute or POS providers, as Agate POS terminal sits on Agate iFiat Ecosystem, which run in Agate blockchain, merchants won’t pay anything when they receive the funds in their iBucket wallet. As iBucket is a decentralised wallet, they can spend it anywhere they like—for example, to pay their suppliers or buy items for themselves—or, alternatively, they can request to deposit it to their bank accounts or to load onto their debit cards.",False

For the payment gateway, I think it's enough many of which existed before. But the cryptocurrency payment gateway which easily integrate with traditional online stores, are rare. Things that still stumble over the Market fluctuation problem, many cases and impractical of cryptocurrency characteristics.  Second - Physical POS Terminal. Agate POS designs with very flexible rules for user's convenience. The existing POS network system previously - FIAT, has many rules for users due to cost building and caring is expensive. While Agate POS has different features i.e No lock-in contract, no exit fee and no penalty for return the POS terminal whenever.  So overall, this project is very good, but must be very careful because many others are failing with the same concept. thereby, i hope next tokens sale will be more attractive and get every opportunity for success.",False

It uses decentralised blockchain technology (Agate blockchain) to resolve many of the fundamental issues in the cryptoeconomy, which will facilitate transactions very economically and in real-time.  The blockchain also has its own objects; more details have been described in its section. Fiat-pegged cryptocurrency works like a fiat credit or stable coin and is called “iFiat.” All iFiat will initially be issued on Agate blockchain, so they exist as a cryptocurrency token. Each iFiat unit issued into circulation is backed on a one-to-one ratio (i.e., one iFiat iUSD is one US dollar) by the corresponding fiat currency unit.  Agate iFiat has the following advantages over other fiat-pegged cryptocurrencies.  iFiats exist on Agate blockchain rather than on less developed and tested blockchains, also, not within closed-source software running on centralised, private databases, or on very costly and slow blockchains like bitcoin, which is not viable or practical to use it as a medium to transfer funds or for micropayments.  Agate iFiat Ecosystem is capable of supporting many different iFiats; however, it currently runs on iUSD, which is pegged by USD, and each token always represents $1 USD. In later versions, we plan to add EUR, GPB, JPY and AUD.",False

Although, iFiats can be used just like other cryptocurrencies, i.e., in a p2p, pseudo anonymous, decentralised, cryptographically secure environment, but they are only circulated inside Agate blockchain to facilitate the payments and real-time settlement and secure the value of funds for both users and merchant as iFiat redemption will not face any pricing or liquidity constraints. iFiats run on one of the fastest decentralised blockchain platforms, which include a decentralised exchange (DEX), Browser base, wallet encryption, open source, multiparty security and reporting functions and all transaction can be tracked on our blockchain explorer. iFiat’s one-to-one backing implementation is easier for traditional merchants to understand and accept for their goods or services. Although iFiats are fully redeemable via the options below, the best use case scenario is to spend it with other merchants or suppliers, because it’s real-time and has a very small transaction fee for users.

II.   0% transaction fee  While currently merchants have to pay between 0.5% and 3% transaction fees  to their bank, financial institute or POS providers, Agate’s POS terminal sits on Agate iFiat’s Ecosystem, which runs Agate blockchain. This means merchants will not be charged when they receive the funds in their iBucket wallet, and as iBucket is a decentralised wallet, they can spend it anywhere they like—for example, to pay their suppliers or buy items for themselves—or, alternatively, they can request to deposit it to their bank accounts or to load onto their debit cards.  III.   Instant settlement (24 x 7 x 365)  In legacy POS terminal systems, banks or service providers usually limit their merchants to only perform settlements once or twice in a day . Even after 24 hours of this settlement, they may not access their funds for various reasons—for example, if the merchant’s business bank account is different than the POS provider or if they settle after the bank’s deadline (usually 10:00 p.m.) or over the weekend.

Borderless  Unlike traditional POS terminal solutions, which are limited to a specific region, Agate POS terminals can be used everywhere in the world without infrastructure limitation! These terminals use the Internet to securely connect to our POS server hosted in the cloud on five continents, and users can use mobile Internet (i.e., 3G/4G) or any other type of common Internet connection (e.g., LAN, WiFi, ADSL) in order to connect their devices to our network.  II.   0% transaction fee  While currently merchants have to pay between 0.5% and 3% transaction fees  to their bank, financial institute or POS providers, Agate’s POS terminal sits on Agate iFiat’s Ecosystem, which runs Agate blockchain. This means merchants will not be charged when they receive the funds in their iBucket wallet, and as iBucket is a decentralised wallet, they can spend it anywhere they like—for example, to pay their suppliers or buy items for themselves—or, alternatively, they can request to deposit it to their bank accounts or to load onto their debit cards.  III.   Instant settlement (24 x 7 x 365)  In legacy POS terminal systems, banks or service providers usually limit their merchants to only perform settlements once or twice in a day . Even after 24 hours of this settlement, they may not access their funds for various reasons—for example, if the merchant’s business bank account is different than the POS provider or if they settle after the bank’s deadline (usually 10:00 p.m.) or over the weekend. Running transactions on Agate iFiat Ecosystem resolves these issues with real-time settlement, because as soon as a customer pays the funds become available and spendable in the merchant’s wallet.  IV.   Secure connection  This is a decentralised ecosystem, and because there is no middleman to handle transactions, all transactions are performed on the Agate iFiat Ecosystem blockchain with unique and traceable TX ID, which is trackable in Agate block explorer. For other connections (commands, user data, etc.) from a POS terminal to our cloud hosting, we have used a secure method that included hashing all data with a public key and a nonce; then the hashed payload and nonce would be sent to the cloud, and a server would decrypt it by using a private key while the whole process runs on SSL context with valid CA certificate, which is a symmetric 256-bit encryption on  X.509 certificates .   V.   No lock-in contract, no exit fee  In order to encourage merchants to use Agate POS terminals and, as a result, to grow the Agate POS network, there won’t be any lock-in contracts. They will only need to pay a one-off fee in AGT token to have this service, as shown in the table below, plus a small monthly fee in AGT token for maintaining this infrastructure. Also, merchants can return the terminal as soon as they like without penalty.  VI.   No monthly fee (optional)  Merchants have the choice to own POS terminals by paying a one-off fee to avoid recurring monthly fees; to do so, they can pay from their iBucket wallets or with AGT token.  VII.   NFC/RFID support  In-store terminals (desktop) can support NFC payments, so instead of showing QR codes, users can use NFC to pay (similar to Visa PayWave  or Mastercard PayPass ).  VIII.   Selling virtual goods  In order to incentivise merchants to use the Agate POS terminal, they can also sell virtual goods (e.g., phone charge, iTunes, Google play, Skype credit and similar items) directly on the POS and get commissions for them. As all these transactions would happen on the iFiat Ecosystem using Agate API Suite, these items can be provided by any supplier who is willing to sell their services to Agate users. However, this option is planned for after the ICO. When the Agate merchant app is updated, this feature would immediately be available on all merchant POS without extra hardware or cost.  IX.   Never lose a dollar!  In legacy POS terminals, if for any reason a terminal is damaged either physically, through faults in their applications or because of electronic shock, it’s quite possible that merchants may lose their whole day’s income if they do not settle on time. In the Agate POS terminal, this is prevented because of its decentralised nature; as soon as users pay, the Agate POS terminal will sign into the iFiat Ecosystem and, as all the funds are logged in Agate blockchain, the merchant can access it from any other device and spend it or cash it out.",False

All exchange orders between different cryptocurrencies have a fixed cost of 1.00 AGT  2.   Any trades by Agate Trade Bot at the time of execution would cost 1.00 AGT  3.   Although exchanging cryptocurrency to any iFiat token is free, if users want to load their cards or request bank transfers, Agate will charge them equivalent of 1% of the transferred order in AGT token.  Code: Example: Tim wants to transfer $500 worth of BTC to his card. He exchanged 1 BTC on the best exchange rate (1 BTC = 10,000 iUSD), and his iBucket would charge iUSD 500 (no additional exchange or transfer fee) in the next step; he wants to load $500 to his card then.  As 1 AGT = $0.094 and 1% of $500 is $5, he needs 53.19148936 AGT to authorise this order; so let’s say the value of AGT token increases by 10X, and each token is worth $0.94; to do so, he needs 5.3191489AGT to do the same, so it’s always better to buy and keep more AGT token to save more on AgateChain fees.  4.   In order to bootstrap the Agate iFiat ecosystem while there is no transaction fee to buy any item inside Agate iFiat Ecosystem, for example, customers can go to any Agate Merchant, either in store or online, and pay 100 iUSD to buy some things, and merchants will receive the exact 100 iUSD, which they can use to pay to their suppliers who also are in this ecosystem, or they may prefer to cash out their funds to their cards or to bank accounts. This is when we charge them the equivalent of 1% of a withdrawal fee in AGT token (like when users load their cards).  5.   Ordering cards, POS terminals, printing paper rolls or any physical merchant’s accessories can be paid by AGT tokens; this would immediately add value to the tokens.  6.   Agate Token Generator, as described in its section, allows everyone to create their own customised tokens; to do this they should pay a one-off fee of 50 AGT. This can be done through Agate Token Generator GUI or Agate API Suite.   7.   Any transaction, either inside iFiat Ecosystem or when businesses or developers create their own tokens, should pay by AGT coin (like gas in Ethereum).  8.   Once we switch to Agate’s main net from our existing test net, all AGT coins would be minable, and as we use the Proof-of-Stake(PoS) method in our blockchain, and miners needs to buy a minimum of 50,000 AGT coin or create a public mining pool in order to start mining, this also would highly increase the demand for AGT coin.  9.   Once our smart contract implementation is finished, in order to execute it in Agate, blockchain users need to pay in AGT coin.  10.   B2B income, by having a comprehensive API suite, the whole suite can be used as white-label platform for those, first, who have their own customers and want to avoid banking fees (e.g., big supermarkets or petrol station chains) or companies who have their own customer acquisition methods and go to market strategy or enterprises who want to integrate AgateChain with their existing environment and application or even ERP. While they can generate their own iFiat tokens to make sure there is no other token issuer, all operations inside AgateChain would work only with AGT token, and also they should buy a API call package for each request as in the pricing table below plus 50 AGT tokens for initial account setup fee, which we will waive for the first 50 companies to roll the ball!",False

While we always work to add as many as possible new strong income streams for AGT token, here are some examples for the current Agate token:  1.   All exchange orders between different cryptocurrencies have a fixed cost of 1.00 AGT 2.   Any trades by Agate Trade Bot at the time of execution would cost 1.00 AGT 3.   Although exchanging cryptocurrency to any iFiat token is free, if users want to load their cards or request bank transfers, Agate will charge them an equivalent of 1% of the transferred order in AGT token.   Code:  Example: Tim wants to transfer $500 worth of BTC to his card. He exchanged 1 BTC on the best exchange rate (1 BTC = 10,000 iUSD), and his iBucket would charge iUSD 500 (no additional exchange or transfer fee) in the next step; he wants to load $500 to his card. As 1 AGT ~ $0.079 and 1% of $500 is $5, he needs 63.291139 AGT to authorise this order; so let’s say the value of AGT token increases by 10X, and each token is worth $0.79; to do so, he needs 6.329113 AGT to do the same, so it’s always better to buy and keep more AGT token to save more on Agate fees.   4.   In order to bootstrap the Agate iFiat ecosystem while there is no transaction fee to buy any item inside Agate iFiat Ecosystem, for example, customers can go to any Agate Merchant, either in store or online, and pay 100 iUSD to buy some things, and merchants will receive the exact 100 iUSD, which they can use to pay to their suppliers who are also in this ecosystem, or they may prefer to cash out their funds to their cards or bank accounts. This is when we charge them the equivalent of 1% of a withdrawal fee in AGT token (similar to when users load their cards). 5.   Ordering cards, POS terminals, printing paper rolls or any physical merchant’s accessories can be paid by AGT tokens; this would immediately add value to the tokens. 6.   Agate Token Generator, as described in its section, allows everyone to create their own customised tokens. To do this, they should pay a one-off fee of 50 AGT. This can be done through Agate Token Generator GUI or Agate API Suite.  7.   Any transaction, either inside iFiat Ecosystem or when businesses or developers create their own tokens, should be paid by AGT coin (like gas in Ethereum) which is 0.01 AGT.  8.   Once we switch to Agate’s main net from our existing test net, all AGT coins would be minable, and as we use the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method in our blockchain, and miners needs to buy a minimum of 50,000 AGT coins or create a public mining pool in order to start mining, this also would highly increase the demand for AGT coin.  9.   Once our smart contract implementation is finished, in order to execute it in Agate, blockchain users need to pay in AGT coin.  10.   B2B income, by having a comprehensive API suite, the whole suite can be used as white-label platform for those, first, who have their own customers and want to avoid banking fees (e.g., big supermarkets or petrol station chains) or companies who have their own customer acquisition methods and go to market strategy or enterprises who want to integrate Agate with their existing environment and application or even ERP. While they can generate their own iFiat tokens to make sure there is no other token issuer, all operations inside Agate blockchain would work only with AGT token, and also they should buy a API call package for each request as in the pricing table below plus 50 AGT tokens for initial account setup fee, which we will waive for the first 50 companies to get the ball rolling!",False

While we always work to add as many as possible new strong income streams for AGT token, here are some examples for the current Agate token:  1.   All exchange orders between different cryptocurrencies have a fixed cost of 1.00 AGT 2.   Any trades by Agate Trade Bot at the time of execution would cost 1.00 AGT 3.   Although exchanging cryptocurrency to any iFiat token is free, if users want to load their cards or request bank transfers, Agate will charge them an equivalent of 1% of the transferred order in AGT token.   Code: Example: Tim wants to transfer $500 worth of BTC to his card. He exchanged 1 BTC on the best exchange rate (1 BTC = 10,000 iUSD), and his iBucket would charge iUSD 500 (no additional exchange or transfer fee) in the next step; he wants to load $500 to his card. As 1 AGT ~ $0.079 and 1% of $500 is $5, he needs 63.291139 AGT to authorise this order; so let’s say the value of AGT token increases by 10X, and each token is worth $0.79; to do so, he needs 6.329113 AGT to do the same, so it’s always better to buy and keep more AGT token to save more on Agate fees.  4.   In order to bootstrap the Agate iFiat ecosystem while there is no transaction fee to buy any item inside Agate iFiat Ecosystem, for example, customers can go to any Agate Merchant, either in store or online, and pay 100 iUSD to buy some things, and merchants will receive the exact 100 iUSD, which they can use to pay to their suppliers who are also in this ecosystem, or they may prefer to cash out their funds to their cards or bank accounts. This is when we charge them the equivalent of 1% of a withdrawal fee in AGT token (similar to when users load their cards). 5.   Ordering cards, POS terminals, printing paper rolls or any physical merchant’s accessories can be paid by AGT tokens; this would immediately add value to the tokens. 6.   Agate Token Generator, as described in its section, allows everyone to create their own customised tokens. To do this, they should pay a one-off fee of 50 AGT. This can be done through Agate Token Generator GUI or Agate API Suite.  7.   Any transaction, either inside iFiat Ecosystem or when businesses or developers create their own tokens, should be paid by AGT coin (like gas in Ethereum) which is 0.01 AGT.  8.   Once we switch to Agate’s main net from our existing test net, all AGT coins would be minable, and as we use the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) method in our blockchain, and miners needs to buy a minimum of 50,000 AGT coins or create a public mining pool in order to start mining, this also would highly increase the demand for AGT coin.  9.   Once our smart contract implementation is finished, in order to execute it in Agate, blockchain users need to pay in AGT coin.  10.   B2B income, by having a comprehensive API suite, the whole suite can be used as white-label platform for those, first, who have their own customers and want to avoid banking fees (e.g., big supermarkets or petrol station chains) or companies who have their own customer acquisition methods and go to market strategy or enterprises who want to integrate Agate with their existing environment and application or even ERP. While they can generate their own iFiat tokens to make sure there is no other token issuer, all operations inside Agate blockchain would work only with AGT token, and also they should buy a API call package for each request as in the pricing table below plus 50 AGT tokens for initial account setup fee, which we will waive for the first 50 companies to get the ball rolling!",False

(1-3 Sec)  4- right now in different countries when merchant accepting fund they should pay between %1 to %8 to payment processor where in Agate is $0 (because user pay for transaction fee $0.00076)  5- integration for online websites is easy in 3min and over 80% of all ecommrece platform (Woocommerce, Magento, ,...) can accept via Agate by installing our free app/plugins (please refer to Github)  I hope I could answer your question but if you need to know more please refer to our WP as we mentioned many other reasons and example in there",False

How transferring to card it's instant? By having a strong agreement with card issuer which as a result gave us a chance to have a trust account with them, as soon as user initiating the transfer, Agate using Card issuer API and instantly (30 sec)  transfer fund to card.like when you going to super market to get a gift card and they immediately transfer your desire amount to card.  why we can do and other similar app which only designed for Crypto-to-Card can't?
