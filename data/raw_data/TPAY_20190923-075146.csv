But my suggestion would go like this, from the start of their ICO, we were hired to participate in the bounty campaign and that is to promote the project that we thought is a good one, and now that we have proven they are just a scam project, then maybe we can do the opposite of promotion.  We can make the community aware that Tokenpay has scammed their bounty participants so we can caught their attention and will beg us to stop and they will just pay.

Proven facts:  1. NO CUSTOMERS. They don't have any customers who is using the ""WEG Bank AG"" registered in Germany. 2. NO BRANCHES. There are no branches in Germany or worldwide. 3. NO PRODUCTS. They don't have any product to facilitate customers to interact with the bank. No Web Products, no software products, no mobile apps. Nothing. 4. NO REAL PARTNERS. They don't have any provable partner in place that is actually doing something except press releases. 5. NO BANK PARTNERSHIP They don't have any partnership with any other REAL bank world-wide. As you may know, it is mandatory for a bank to have partnerships with other banks to operate national and worldwide money transfers. 6. SHARES WORTHLESS. Their shares on this ""bank"" are so worthless, that they gave 10% of the bank shares to Litecoin Foundation (a non-profit organization). WTF. How could a bank donate 10% of its shares to a non-profit organization? Even so, it is so illegal that they donated 10% of their shares to a non-profit organization, in case they had any customer. But in reality, they don't have any customer. 7. LESS THAN 5 PEOPLE EMPLOYED. Most probably they have only 1 person hired (namely their CEO ). The website most probably was built by a paid freelance. 8. WEBSITE IS A CMS THEME. The website is a fucking CMS website. They use Contao Open Source CMS. WTF 9. RECENTLY CREATED - JUNE 2015. The company was recently created in June 2015. 10. NET INCOME: 0 EURO IN 2017. According to banking public information: the net income is 0 (ZERO) euro in 2017  WEG Bank AG is a scam. They are just a small company trying to deceive people into believing that they are a huge bank facilitating millions of new people crypto adoption into the banking system. Most probably they receive generous funds from crypto projects to create fake partnerships on press releases. For instance: tokenpay which definitely paid generous bonuses to make a press release that they have partnered up.  Worthless partnership fact:  About 9 months ago, the partnership with TokenPay was made. Nine months had passed and there is no product, no service made that came up of this worthless partnership. All these facts makes me believe that WEG Bank is a scam and a fraud company to deceive crypto investors.  Feel free to discuss other reports on the WEG Bank AG scam.

His relationship with Derek Capo and Tokenpay on the skype images and his problem with Fruitsbasket shows jamalaezaz was culpable too.  Add to that jamalaezaz getting a 3 BTC quotation from a lawyer when he could have searched around for a cheaper one or find a no-win no-fee lawyer instead.  jamalaezaz has to foot most of the blame because he has not been 100% open with everybody either. He lays the blame with Derek Capo from Tokenpay and Fruitsbasket but claims to be 100% innocent himself and that just is not true.  Did Derek Capo and Tokenpay have a right to be concerned about fake bounty participants that might have belonged to jamalaezaz?  Did jamalaezaz satisfy Derek Capo and Tokenpay by allowing an audit?  Why did jamalaezaz insist on getting his payment upfront before allowing an audit?  Did any audit actually take place before Derek Capo and Tokenpay pulled the plug?,False

In the case of this bounty manager jamalaezaz he does not seem to interested anymore. He hides behind the shield of saying that he needs 3 BTC to pay a US based lawyer to start legal action. He did not take the well thought out advice that he was given by myself and others regarding finding a lawyer on a no-win-no-fee basis.  Clearly Tokenpay scammed the bounty participants and very cleverly blamed jamalaezaz but jamalaezaz was the one that could have helped protect the interests of bounty participants before his own ego.  When jamalaezaz posted that he was no longer the going to be involved in Monaco bounty he immediately removed his post and sent a PM asking me to remove my post which I refused to do and still can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1924985.msg20130228#msg20130228  It shows jamalaezaz actively went out to post against Monaco and they came to a fast arrangement to avoid negative publicity during the ICO and the key thing is Monaco paid jamalaezaz as there was no complaints later but in the case of Tokenpay they never backed down and instead switched tables and change their stance from partially blaming jamalaezaz to fully blaming hima nd accusing him of fraud..  I saw the skype screenshots and looked at the situation as best as I could with all information available and can conclude jamalaezaz is highly culpable in this debacle. Simply saying ""Tokenpay scammed the bounty participants"" is an oversimplification.  If a bounty manager cannot articulate himself in all manner and all times including when being accused of fraud then they should stop and return back to their real-world job because they are making a mockery of people participating in the bounties.",False

Do not let these TokenPay scammers deceive you and the bounty participants.  The law firm asking 3 BTC in advance cannot be trusted because any reputable firm would ask for FIAT.

Can you screenshot it and upload it here?  When you say you have no plan to move on without payment, nobody is going to pay you anything ""unconditionally"" so you need to explain which lawyer you spoke to and what was the fee he asked for and what exactly was he going to do to get legal action started?  You should be more ACTIVE here and try to do something. You did not reply to my post: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2400499.msg47395675#msg47395675  Yes I have a possible solution. Look two people have said they are willing to help pay legal fees if you manage to get them to go to court. Send out emails to all your participants that were ripped off and seek investment. Look for a genuine well trusted person here that will act as escrow. If the target cannot be reached then the donations will not be sent but if enough people commit then they can all send to the escrow.  I am sure if litigation documents were served they would settle out of court because it would bring them very bad PR and they would rather pay what they owe you and continue with their project. Do not let these TokenPay scammers deceive you and the bounty participants.  The law firm asking 3 BTC in advance cannot be trusted because any reputable firm would ask for FIAT. Please search around and ask another law firm for an estimated fee if they helped. Try to arrange a deal where they take a percentage of the outstanding TPay tokens instead.   And you did not reply to this one either: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2400499.msg47407325#msg47407325  You also had a problem with Monaco VISA at the time of their ICO.

Look two people have said they are willing to help pay legal fees if you manage to get them to go to court. Send out emails to all your participants that were ripped off and seek investment. Look for a genuine well trusted person here that will act as escrow. If the target cannot be reached then the donations will not be sent but if enough people commit then they can all send to the escrow.  I am sure if litigation documents were served they would settle out of court because it would bring them very bad PR and they would rather pay what they owe you and continue with their project. Do not let these TokenPay scammers deceive you and the bounty participants.  The law firm asking 3 BTC in advance cannot be trusted because any reputable firm would ask for FIAT. Please search around and ask another law firm for an estimated fee if they helped. Try to arrange a deal where they take a percentage of the outstanding TPay tokens instead.,False

Since you are the bounty manager it is important for you to keep active in this thread from to time.  The sad fact of the matter is that TokenPay will not pay voluntarily because if they wanted to they would have done so by now. That does not mean they will not pay if the correct approach is taken. With the length of time that has passed it means a new approach is essential.  About the lawyer, I understand what you mean about lack of fees to pay the law firm. May I ask which country the lawyer is located in because I think these scammers are based in USA.  You say you are the biggest loser in this with 30,000 TPay tokens but is the list of bounty participants still available for all to see? If so where is the link please?  If none of the 2000 bounty participants are stepping forward with a class lawsuit action then to me the reason is because their share would be small. So far my calculations are:  Step 1) 135,000 TPay tokens - 30,000 (bounty manager) = 105,000 TPay Step 2) 105,000 TPay tokens / 2000 participants = 52.5 TPay  If your top handful of bounty participants have several thousand US$ each then they should agree to a class action. The problem is that out of 2000 participants nobody has come forward to share the expenses of the lawyer. So if only 4 or 5 people sue the TokenPay owners by paying for a lawyer and win the case the courts will force TokenPay to pay everybody. Will somebody owed 1 TPay or 0.25 TPay be interested?

EFIN Coin is a product of its own blockchain (not a TPAY fork) with a modern codebase that was developed specifically for facilitating financial transactions. Users will have the ability to exchange EFIN Coins for TokenSuisse financial products on the blockchain. The idea is to tokenize traditional Swiss financial assets and make them available to everybody on the blockchain. Not just access to the select few who have the means and ability to open an exclusive Swiss asset management account with an overpaid broker.  We have made the decision to not sell EFIN Coins. The only way to obtain them is to be in possession of TPAY Coins on the EFIN Coin distribution date. This is NOT a coin swap. TPAY holders will simply receive EFIN Coins as a distribution at no additional cost. The EFIN Coins will be immediately available on the eFin DEX platform and we hope to achieve listing integration of EFIN Coins on third party exchanges as well. EFIN Coin will also be a vital component of our merchant processing platform and added to all aspects of the TokenPay ecosystem. https://medium.com/tokenpay/efin-coins-to-be-distributed-to-tpay-holders-d435d88600f7",False

Investors with us know that they are investing into something real and concrete, and not in one of those bubble soap projects that disappear the day after the ICO because they are not solving any real issue and are just a collection of fancy presentations. We are working on solving a real global issue such as developing a low cost cure solution for AIDS. There were 36.7million people infected by HIV globally in 2016, 17.5million of which were left untreated, according to UNAIDS. Our mission is to develop a low cost cell-based therapy solution for HIV to allow access to the treatment for those individuals who are normally left untreated due to social and/or economic limitations. This is a long term project.  Another thing that sets our ICO apart from other projects is that our Token is backed by actual physical goods. The INNBC Token will be spendable to buy classic iconic JDM cars from our JDM online garage and is therefore backed by the value of actual physical goods. Because we want our Token to also succeed as a crypto used for buying goods. So we need people to get their Token and start using it to make our platform successful. The community we create during the ICO will be important to support our project later, after the ICO ends.  Also, credibility is everything.

While most were attracted to our project for our secure and anonymous TPAY blockchain, there is just so much more to this story and this post is designed to help the community connect all the dots and gain a better understanding of everything that we have to offer.  TOKENPAY CORE PLATFORM First and foremost we have the TokenPay core platform. The features and benefits are best explained in our whitepaper and on our website. But in essence, our platform consists of an anonymous P2P transactional system that utilizes the TPAY coin as a base mode of exchange. Wallet to wallet transfers can be done virtually instantly (within 2 seconds) and on a public or private and untraceable TOR network driven blockchain.  EFIN DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE TECHNOLOGY A couple months ago we began work with a dedicated team of blockchain developers in Costa Rica on our own exchange. This is necessary for us in order to power the various applications that we currently have under development. That is, in order to drive our multi-signature transaction engine merchant processing platform, there needs to be an integrated exchange mechanism with a tight bid and ask spread. To facilitate fast and smooth transactions, a live market for TPAY is essential. One that will ultimately support immediate adoption of TPAY as a form of payment.  Considering all of the hacks and thefts lately like Coincheck and Bitgrail to name just a couple, we certainly did not want to go down that same road by employing vulnerable centralized custody of assets. Furthermore, current decentralized exchanges seem rather clumsy. So we developed our own proprietary decentralized exchange technology. It is anonymous, uses TOR network privacy and it is completely secure. Because we never have custody of funds, no arduous sign-up procedure exists. Trading functions as automatically as possible with a decentralized exchange platform. Atomic swaps will be supported and the first pairs will be TPAY, XVG, BTC and EFIN. The EFIN token is its own blockchain that is built with the Infinitesimal protocol (plenty more about this soon). The comprehensive whitepapers and websites for the exchange token and the associated blockchain protocol will be released soon. EFIN is the ideal DEX token that employs a new blockchain technology that creates the possibility of a tamper-proof consolidated audit trail and increased transactional velocity. Accordingly, the cost of transactions compared to more traditional fees is infinitesimal. So efficiency is effectively streamlined. This token will be the utility backbone of the exchange platform. It will be available to TPAY holders at a later date TBA. Its technology will drive countless TokenPay applications from e-commerce to gaming to banking initiatives. It will also feature a deep integration of Verge Currency.  PARTNERSHIP WITH VERGE As many are aware, we contributed 66,500,000 XVG to the Verge crowdfunding campaign in order to secure a major deal for the coin and solidify a strong lifetime partnership that will ultimately benefit both the TPAY and XVG community. The high level goal is for both coins to be top 10 contenders. Nobody will be sleeping until this objective is achieved. Both of our communities plan to work together in a harmony never before seen in the crypto world in order to advance each others product goals and development. Plenty more will be disclosed publicly about this partnership, but the alliance includes co-branded debit card solutions for TPAY and XVG and several planned deep integrations of XVG in to TokenPay platform rollout initiatives.  EXCHANGE INTEGRATION WITH QRYPTOS While we build out our own exchange, we are pursuing multiple third-party exchange integrations. The first one was with an Asian company called QUOINE. The reasoning for this listing is well documented and summarized in an informative Ask Me Anything call between our CEO Derek Capo and the exchange’s VP of Operations Seth Melamed. Of course this is only the first of several integrations that will take place over the next few weeks and months. We intentionally began early integration on a smaller exchange as a proof of concept and to iron out the listing process with the development of a custom exchange wallet necessary for such an amalgamation. TPAY is now listed on CoinMarketCap. GERMAN BANK PARTNERSHIP & ACQUISITION During our token sale in December we discussed the imminent possibility of a potential acquisition of a Vanuatu bank. While we had an LOI in place, we ultimately took another route and secured a deal with a bank in a top tier jurisdiction instead. About a week ago, we discussed all of the reasoning behind this move and the rationale behind the German bank seeking us out as a partner and hopefully an eventual acquirer. The deal is in the final stages. Contract drafts have been circulated. All major points have been agreed upon.  At this point, it looks like our parent company TokenPay Swiss AG will end up acquiring 9.9% of the German bank with an option to purchase an additional 75% stake in the bank pending regulatory approval. The German bank intends to implement TokenPay blockchain technology immediately upon closing and is already taking measures to accommodate what will likely be a rapid on boarding of new customers from the TokenPay and Verge communities. This includes critical eFin exchange capabilities for account holders. Priority will be given to TPAY and XVG holders. Along with traditional debit cards for account holders, plans are also in place to create a pre-paid gift card store with private label crypto cards.  Recently a second bank in another strong European jurisdiction has approached us about a potential minority stake and partnership. Talks have been initiated and we feel optimistic about a positive outcome. It is our mandate to enter in to as many strong financial deals as we can. Banking is such a critical element to our business plan and we are constantly looking for similar deals with different institutions. We feel that we can replicate our model globally in multiple jurisdictions. Banking licenses supersede all other e-money or financial licenses in most places. It is the holy grail of international commerce and we are uniquely well positioned to capitalize upon this opportunity.  E-COMMERCE SOLUTIONS, TOKENESCROW & AUSTRIAN RETAIL Our Romanian development team led by Vlad Turtoi is developing the TokenPay merchant tools suite of products. This includes the e-commerce platform, which is designed as a crypto payment processing API and platform similar to PayPal but with privacy as the core objective. The first crypto integrations are TPAY, XVG and BTC with associated pairs that leverage our proprietary exchange technology to enable cash outs for merchants. The big selling point is immediate transaction approval, low to zero fees for most merchants, anonymous and secure processing with no chargebacks.  Another major project that our Romanian team is working on is called TokenEscrow. This is a project that isn’t in our whitepaper road map but we feel serves an unfilled demand. As a company that transacts almost exclusively in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin ourselves, we have required the use of traditional escrow services almost daily. Whether we are purchasing a key domain for the company or making an acquisition of a company or product, the need is there.  TokenEscrow works like any other escrow service but with crypto and with licensed and trusted intermediaries. Accordingly, we have entered into a deal with a Switzerland based financial institution that will provide fiat exchange services in conjunction with escrow deals ran through our platform. This gives us a very unique competitive advantage in the market where we can not only do crypto escrow deals but crypto to fiat transactions as well. Licensed partners will work with TokenEscrow to facilitate transactions in multiple jurisdictions using our crypto secure storage and exchange technology platform and financial network.  ACQUISITION OF LATAM GAMING SOFTWARE COMPANY We recently made an acquisition of a notable Latin American gaming software company. This is a B2B platform development firm with several strategic assets. These include a Curacao license and master reseller agreement with Microgaming, that is notoriously difficult to obtain. We believe that the gaming business represents a very significant use case for our blockchain products, most notably TPAY. Secure and private transactions are essential to gaming platforms and its customers. This company that we acquired 60% of also has a unique blockchain protocol of its own of which we hope to leverage in the mid term. It is also almost finished development of a crypto payment platform designed specifically for the gaming industry.  Currently we are working on rebranding this company as TokenGaming. We are also pursuing different licenses such as Malta which covers all of Europe and Colombia for a Latin American focused operation where we hold many competitive advantages. This is yet another TokenPay application that will benefit from the development of our eFin exchange technology. Especially in the regulated markets, the crypto conversion to fiat is necessary. We plan to launch several gaming products shortly, including poker, financial spread betting, casino games, e-gaming and sports betting. The team that we onboarded from the acquisition is primarily composed of Colombian and Venezuelan blockchain developers. As such, we consider this to be an acquihire given the affordable tech talent and immediate head start we now have in this industry. Expect a lot of news to come out of our gaming division.  PAYMENT SOLUTIONS FOR WEBCAM MODELS & AFFILIATES One of the key businesses that we are working on in conjunction with our debit card banking platform is the creation of a network of payment solutions. This is targeted towards webcam models and the affiliates that promote these websites. It is no secret that models want to get paid daily and in cash. Most want to stay out of the limelight as well. Privacy and real anonymity are key elements of this business. Nobody is better positioned to capitalize on market opportunity as we are. The division is called TokenCams and the objective is quite clear. To provide the payment card solutions for models and affiliates of adult webcam sites. We have met with several key players in the industry, both in Japan and Latin America. Everybody we have spoken to is interested in this solution as well as the integration of secure and private TPAY merchant processing for the respective websites. High demand for this service and we will aim to fill it very quickly.  OVERVIEW OF THE TOKENPAY ECOSYSTEM The purpose of this report is to provide enhanced insight to the community on how the various parts of the TokenPay ecosystem work together harmoniously. For instance, the exchange technology powers much more than the eFin exchange itself. It fuels the banking platform, the gaming and cams divisions and all of the merchant services applications. Third-party exchange integrations as well are essential components of the ecosystem. The bank deals open doors. Licenses are still critical components of international finance activity. Sectors that we operate in must make sense and represent long-term viable trends with strong secular tailwinds.  We feel that we are ahead of our original road map both in sum and substance. Our priority is always executing on deals. Even today after significant development expense and various investments, we have more crypto assets on hand than immediately following the December token sale. This is a true testament to our astute financial management abilities and hedging program. We are in a race akin to internet adoption in the mid-90s. By focusing on our multi-niche specific strategy, we feel that we have a unique and once in a lifetime opportunity to position TokenPay and the TPAY coin as the world’s leading platform for crypto payments. At the same time we aim to be transparent and keep the community updated about our deals and progress. Make sure to follow us on Twitter and Telegram for real-time breaking news updates.

Hello Everyone! We have officially sold out of TPAY coins. This has been an amazing journey and we are humbled by the level of interest and demand from around the world. We are excited to focus all of our attention on the goals set out on our roadmap. As for the token sale, we know it has not been a smooth one for some people but we are working hard to fix any and all outstanding issues.  What comes next?   1. First, We would audit all USA transactions to make sure each transaction of purchase has been correctly allocated.   2. Refund all of the USA purchases which should begin later this week and completed by next week.   3. Audit and correct all pending issues with transactions and referrals for all transactions outside the USA.  4. Release new desktop wallets with new UX, paper wallet and MAYBE iOS wallet (under development now). Also, we will enable 2FA security before we distribute any coins. We will make sure ALL ISSUES WILL BE FIXED BEFORE DISTRIBUTION.  5. Lastly, We'll Distribute coins to all TPAY holders - this will be done January 18th to January 31st. At this time the blockchain will be live and we will need everyone to have a personal default TokenPay wallet address submitted in the dashboard. We will not send “Stealth transactions” given we need to track on explorer. As we finish each of the phases we will update everyone. Again, thank you all for your support we are extremely motivated to change the world with TokenPay.  Please note that Further Updates will be emailed to everyone and will be also posted to our Telegram Channel. Feel free to join here: https://t.me/joinchat/GgZih0NrYt2F11oXwQ11Cg",False

This is publicly unlinkable to the original public address and to any other one-time address. Only the recipient can link all of the payments together. Furthermore, only the recipient can derive the secret key associated with the one-time address. By using the stealth addressing protocol, a recipient can publish one address and receive unlimited publicly unlinkable payments. Dual-key stealth addresses add another layer of security.  The TokenPay platform incorporates dual-key stealth addresses. This refers to the pairs of spend/view keys. It allows “decoding” (or removing the unlinkability) stealth addresses without simultaneously allowing them to be spent. This is the ultimate in settlement security and anonymity and it is standard when transacting in TPAY.  https://medium.com/@TokenPay/dual-key-stealth-addresses-represent-the-ultimate-in-settlement-security-and-anonymity-54a320e5354c",False

There are too many idiots these days who think rules can be bent or laws apply to little people.

In that light, TokenPay's choice to copy both ShadowCash and SpectreCoin and develop a bigger vision (debit card, bank, etc.) may be shady, but it's definitely precedented.  At this point, as investors, the question is really which 'version' of SpectreCoin is more likely to succeed in the long term.  On the negative side, TokenPay copied code and may be less familiar with it for now. Until they 'make it their own', they will be less prepared to deal with problems as they arise. There is also concern about the integrity of a team that doesn't disclose all of this, and that deliberately ignores the two projects that are most similar to it (XSPEC and PIVX) in its comparison charts. On the positive side, TokenPay has an ambitious roadmap (debit card, bank, etc.) and claims to have a relatively large team, so IF the plan is truthful and IF they succeed in getting the project going, we have to acknowledge that there is real potential here. If it really is SpectreCoin but with more ambition and better marketing, then it may well be a worthwhile investment.  On the positive side, SpectreCoin (XSPEC) has more experience with the code, is currently better equipped to deal with problems that might arise, and has a longer-established plan. They are further along in their development. On the negative side, XSPEC has a less ambitious plan, raised relatively little in their ICO (i.e., development funds), and has shown less (so far, at least) interest in marketing themselves effectively.  So: do the potential strengths and ambitions of TokenPay outweigh the concerns, and do they support a price of > $5/token vs. < $0.40/token for XSPEC? If you believe that the value proposition of TokenPay is more than 10x greater than that of SpectreCoin, then this ICO is well worth considering. If not, then it isn't.",False

As it stands marketing can be king.  I think the asking price is exorbitant but honestly if they are able to use Spectre technology effectively then it could be a good investment, for sure.  It concerns me that Derek said they had to bring in an outside team to repair the wallet.  I'd still like to see the code AND an actual response to my previous posted concerns.  Perhaps Derek can also explain why SPECTRECOIN was not credited nor compared.  It uses a very similar chart to SPECTRECOIN but with SPECTRECOIN replaced.   I guess the bright side of this is that I'm aware of SPECTRECOIN now and have a stake.  The downside being that it's possible that this is going to be more successful due to marketing but the longterm investment may fall off because they don't know their own technology.",False

The 2010 'TokenPay' wasn't blockchain based; it was just an idea that failed to get off the ground. But the idea hung around, and in 2017 a group of people got together and applied elements of the original TokenPay vision to blockchain technology. So on the one hand you have the high-level idea for TokenPay, which did indeed originate in 2010 (according to the whitepaper); on the other hand you have the specific technology that is now, after 7 years, being used to realize that idea. That technology was only applied to the idea in 2017, and the technology was, indeed, copied over from a combination of ShadowCash and SpectreCoin. Basically, they needed a blockchain on which to run the TokenPay idea (bank, exchange, etc.), and rather than building their own they chose to copy existing tech. No one is saying they copied SpectreCoin's vision per se; they're saying that TokenPay is realizing their own vision by exploiting the work of others. And again, that is a separate question from whether this represents a good investment.  To be honest TokenPay feels like it's rather cleverly taking advantage of the massive influx of new investors who have been attracted by the BTC spike, but know nothing about crypto in general. The branding and whitepaper are very focussed around the 'Bitcoin on steroids' message--like, oh boy, we've taken Bitcoin, you know, that thing that you heard about in the news, and made it even better! That sounds very exciting indeed if you don't know about the literally thousands of projects that have come and gone over the past several years, or the fact that there are many other privacy-oriented tokens (XSPEC? PIVX? Never heard of 'em!), blockchain-based bank/exchange/debit ideas, and so on. It annoys me that people are so ignorant, but at the same time it's also a comment on how bad most cryptos are at branding and self-promotion. I can't really begrudge the TokenPay team for taking advantage of that. If TokenPay does succeed at the expense of other projects that came earlier and do the same thing but failed to market themselves, well, it's a dick move by TokenPay but ultimately the others will have only themselves to blame.",False

Read our whitepaper acknowledgements it is more transparent than Spectrecoin.  2.  If you read point #1 you will know we gave credit to Shadowcash which was one of the first to have this native wallet design.  The wallet design is nice but to be honest it has a lot of issues on the UX level and we hired a designer and QT developer to update the desktop wallets to make it better of which I am more than happy to release the code just as others have to make it possible for us to get this far.  3. I have something that the developers of Spectrecoin do NOT have.  I spoke to the head developer of Shadowcash, who is now running Particl, and asked him for PERMISSION to use certain parts of the code.  He said ""No problem""  and appreciated that I reached out to him.  He is actually really nice and look forward to meeting him one day.  4. Our mission is to do more than than what we have available.  Our management is definitely business oriented and in order for any crypto project to become massively adopted plans and execution need to occur to make adoption spread.  We have the networks that a lot of current block chains would only DREAM of having.    5. Finally, crypto is an open sourced community, remember, Bitcoin was made possible because it was OPEN TO THE WORLD.

I was interested in Tokenpay but have some questions after seeing this thread.  It does appear that Both SPECTRECOIN and TOKENPAY are forks of the same project.  That would explain the similar wallet, but there are some issues I have with your response.  1.  You state that TOKENPAY is more ""transparent"" than SPECTRECOIN.  What does this mean exactly?  If this is transparency as I understand transparency then I cannot see how this is of benefit to people who are interested in anonymity.  When it comes to government, yes I agree that transparency is the best, but when it comes to finances I would like my interactions to be similar to that of cash where only myself and the receiver are involved.  I do not want any tertiary parties viewing my transactions.  2.  I found that the Spectrecoin developers also had to do a lot of work on the wallet.  They said similar things about having to translate the code to another type of code or something... it's all Greek to me.  But at the moment they already have TOR integration up and running.  They also have a selective obfuscation program that allows for people in China and other TOR banned areas to still function under the network.  If you have these things then have you not copied the wallet directly?  Can you post the code so we can compare the current TOKENPAY code to the current SPECTRECOIN code to see how they compare?  3.  This really bothered me.  Because this is a non-issue.  It seems distractive and irrelevant in the conversation.  I'm curious as to why you added this as a point of interest in your response.  4.  Am I reading your mission right?  Do you wish to integrate with the banks?  This doesn't align with my personal interests.  I am a firm believer in the ""satoshi code"" that we shouldn't involve those massive entities in our finances.  I hope that I'm misunderstanding this.  This would be a serious deterrent in my investment.  5.  This is true.  But if you did copy the SPECTRECOIN wallet and then attempt to resell it at $6 dollars with good marketing, then I fear that the integrity that you tried to show in your third point was feigned.  After looking into Spectrecoin I'm astounded that more people haven't heard of it.  It's clear to me that you have money for decent marketing and it doesn't appear to be the same for Spectre.  I really hope you aren't hijacking a superior product and throwing a bit of cash into making it look pretty trying to resell it to the public for more.  I hope that you can quell these concerns of mine because right now with SPECTRECOIN at...   Wow.  It's at .00002033 BTC.  I was going to say it seems like a more sound investment as they are already ahead of you in wallet development, but at that price I'm just going to invest.  I can get 20 SPECTRECOIN for the same price as one of your tokens.  I",False

Aside from that, can you  name just 2 other coins that are endeavoring to build infrastructure which is a must if crypto will be mainstream. The first to market will be huge. How many icos have you invested in that are just a wallet, a blockchain, POS or POW and nothing else ? Don't let skepticism keep you from making money. If you have fears look at the time line and get out before the date they say they will have a bank if you doubt it will happen.  3) Tor is used to send all types of altcoin transactions. Currently a little cumbersome but what do you think is shady about that? Monero is the closest competetor to this. If you use it     you will understand and this is a step up from monero. If not, I hope you are paying your taxes at end of year because EVERY transaction is  taxable and must be reported     to IRS.

All of these crypto's are like cash except that some track every IP address and some do not (that is us).  Cash itself is extremely anonymous yet when you have to pay bills when a bank is involved you have to comply to their and the governments rules.  Now, if you have a network of ways to be able to pay for stuff using cash and cash only then you can remain private forever, however, the systems in place today for cash makes it hard to do that.  With Crypto it is much more possible than cash.  You can earn crypto spend crypto never have anyone know your ip address (like ours given TOR integration) and as long as more and more consumers and merchants accept and transact in this way it becomes more and more anonymous.  Nevertheless, when you need to pay a bill via a bank or you want to buy a large asset such as a house unfortunately today it is difficult to do that with ONLY crypto.  In the future it becomes more and more of a possibility but right now today 99.99% of real estate is done via fiat.  So, if you were to link crypto to your bank account today and transferred from say coinbase 100k to your bank account, I can assure you they will hold that money and potentially close your bank account.  The goal here is that our bank would understand you are a crypto holder from day 1.  Then you have to consider how privacy jurisdictions work this is where the full privacy and anonymity comes into play to make all of the aspects of what we have today and what we plan to have provide a whole solution.

Before we decided to work on the blockchain we analyzed hundreds of coins and poured over hundreds of conversations to deeply understand what the veteran crypto community as well as newbies would be interested in.  We then saw a surge of ETH based coins which overall has no real blockchain technology and was filled of a lot of empty promises.  We felt that if we were to launch a project we wanted it to be one where there would be ultra private and secure technology that would be used by the community.   Our coin was influenced by features made by Blackcoin, Peer coin, Shadow and Bitcoin (which is the core foundation). Once we decided on the blockchain we wanted to make sure that it would be reviewed by an active and privacy focused developer and asked Sunerok who is the lead developer of Verge to check out the code and make sure that it was coded up to the high standards we wanted.   We also contacted the developer of Shadow to get their blessing if we were to use some of the open sourced code from their project, which was closed and converted to Particl.  Nevertheless, we will continue to develop the blockchain technology with the funds for example in adding a Tor based mobile wallet that runs on android or ios (we don't have one yet) or integrate smart contract technology with RSK.  Lots to do!",False

I will address each of your questions  Your questions: If you are a total privacy coin and fully annon does that mean I can sign up for ICO using a pseudonym and not my real name?  My reply: When you use our desktop wallets all of the transactions will be anonymous given its link to the TOR network.  TPAY to TPAY transactions are always anonymous when using our wallets.  The minute you are connected to an exchange chances are there will be no anonymity given most of these exchanges comply with AML and KYC compliance.   For the token sale, if you decide to use a pseudonym and not your real name, you can.  Many have already.   Your question:  If and when you acquire a bank and the Blue Diamond cards are issued, will I be required to go through any ID verification processes or can I use my pseudonym rather than my real name on the card a well?  How will the cards be delivered whilst maintaining total privacy?  If I use the card and fund it from my secure wallet does that then remove my privacy as there is a link between the spending/withdrawal using the card?  My reply: When TokenPay becomes a licensed entity we will be compelled to comply with the regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate.  This is why it is important to have a privacy jurisdiction from day 1. ",False

I am Jamal Aezaz.. I was hired as tokenpay's Bounty program manager.. I have worked with token pay for over 6 months as of now. but it has been the worst experience for me to working with them.. because Derek and His Team is  one of those so many scammers who raised Millions of Dollars in ICOs. but when time of paying the supporters and Contributors come, they start making baseless excuses and try to save every single penny they can.   Bounty Program Scam: 110,000 Tpay Coins = $770,000 They have Agreed to Pay 100,000 TPay Coins for Bounties plus a 10000 Coins for Management fee. but once the bounty program finished ,, they suddenly started finding excuses and tried to keep reducing payment more and more.  Excuse 1: Participants Wallets Tpay is a coin on it's own Blokchain. it is not an ERC or top of any other Blockchain Token. so before ICO start and Bounty Start time there was not any Wallet Available/Launched, We clearly asked Derek and Johny About this and they agreed and asked us to collect every users email addresses at the time of joining so they could pay their payments directly to their wallets at the end of bounty program. but at the end of Bounty program they suddenly changed their minds and asked me for wallet addresses.. I told them that the wallets was not available at the time of members joining bounty program and the agreement was to make their payments in their ICO dashboard. but they didn't listen to that and put me again to collect everyone wallets. if they wanted they could easily deposit everyone's Bounty payment to each participants ICO dashboard as initial agreement. but they started this Wallet Collection bullshit. which cause a long till (even till today still all participants not submitted their wallets)   Excuse 2: Re-auditing / Double checking Bounty Participants when Bounty program ended and we entered in distribution phase. Derek changed his mind to accept the spreadsheet My team have prepared and decided to reject my  checking and counting and do another checking and counting by himself. he delayed that re-audit for 2 months and then at the end he put Danny on the re-audit work after two month of time. lots of actives which were done by bounty participants. were removed from their places. (medium, steemit, tweets, shares etc) and lots of them got rejected again.  Excuse 3: Stake System When the Campaign Started, Johny and Derek Chose to Go with Stake system.. Everyone know about Stake system can confirm how it works.. in Stake system the bounty allocation will be fixed to a specific amount and then that specific amount divided among all participants. no matter if the participants are 100 or 10,000 at the end.. even if a person get disqualified at some point, that participants stakes and tokens will be divided into other participants. this is how stake system bounty program work which was chosen by Johny and Derek them selves. for Blog and media bounty I advised them to go for a fixed pay rate system. but they refused that advise and insist me to continue with stake system.. then when the bounty program finished Derek started a baseless re-audit thing which ended up with a lot of disqualification (mentioned above).. but they decided to not pay the tokens of disqualified users into the rest of qualified users (according to the terms o stakes system), they said everyone will get whatever they've got in my first calculation. (they rejected my calculations and decided to run a re-audit but the allocations I've assigned to each participates they did not agree to change that)  I tried a lot to explain them that they cannot do that. but they did not listen that . so I had to remove them from the bounty spreadsheets and locked the sheets so they do not make any copy for that.. after that they totally opened up and clearly said they'll not pay anything to me and bounty participants..  According to them after locking the spreadsheets, I've violated the initial Bounty management agreement. while they've violated the agreement almost 6 times till that time.. (I'll show everything in the screenshot evidence)      Referral Bonus Scam 25,000 Tpay Coins = $175,000 I have referred tokenpay ICO to a chinese firm and have convinced them to invest in Tokenpay ICO. after that I've arranged a meeting call between that chinese firm and Derek capo which was ended up with 30 Bitcoin investment from that Chinese group.. for that Derek capo Agreed to Pay me 25k Tpay coins as my referral bonus (when the actual referral bonus that time at ICO website was 50%, but Derek Didn't agreed to pay me 50% referral bonus because that group did not joined through my referral link in ICO but they've made a direct deal with TokenPay owner (derek) so I didn't got the actual referral links but Derek agreed to pay me 25,000 Tpay coin for this big investment ) which was not fair but I still agreed. but instead of Paying me the 25k  Coins he paid me only 5000 Tpay coins after 2 month of requests and asking for payment everyday finally he opened up his mouth and refused  to pay me  25,000 Tpay coins. because after such a long delay the tokenpay Coin already gained a value in market and then Derek got jealous to pay the agreed amount for that deal.. according to him I didn't put so much efforts to arrange that 30 Bitcoins (Around 0.4 Million $ at that time's bitcoin price) Deal. so he decided to change his mind to pay the 25,000 Tpay coins and make it only 5000,   in Both Referral and Bounty Programs Derek and his Team Scammed Total 135,000 Tpay Coins which worth Around 945,000 Dollars (Almost 1 Million $) if we include the late/Delay Charges the funds add up more then 1 Million $$ worth of TokenPay...    Now I'll Add All the Evidences and Proofs (Sceenshots) of where Derek and His Team makes agreements, and then the evidences and proofs where they've broke their own agreements and words and finally turned into a 100% scam.    Converstation Between me And Derek: Here Are All The necessary Screenshots, I've took from the Conversation between me and Derek.. these will reveal a lot of things and reality behind this So-called Successful Project:   TokenPay Founder Derek Capo Agreeing to pay 110,000 Tpay Coins.. 100,000 for Bounty and 10000 for Bounty Managers (me and my team).   Below are the Screenshots of the conversation Between me and Derek about That Chinese Company Investment, it is very interesting conversation where everyone can clearly see the real Face of Derek Capo. how first he promised 120% bonus when the chinese Guy agreed to invest 30 Bitcoins. but then suddenly broken his own agreement when he noticed the other people buying from ICO and the though that he do not need to give discounts to big investors. this is the proof that this Derek not only a Greedy person but also very unprofessional, he can break any deal and agreement whenever he get a better offer. so My advise for anyone to stay away from him.    these are the words of a Founder of a Multi Million Raised Blockchain Project.        Below are the Chat logs when the Bounty and ICO newly closed and Tokenpay Successfully Raised 30 Million $. In these Screenshots. you can clearly see, how he started making excuses and started to deny and delay payments with excuse after excuse, useless requirements. and false complaints.   Drama Started.   this is the proof of the referral agreement. derek Agreed to pay me 25,000 Tpay coins for the China Deal which was invested 30 Bitcoins in Tokenpay ICO.  he confirmed the 25k coins for referral again  Here he started showing is real face. it is chat log after early ICO end. First Refusal to not pay 100k cons for bounty and the excuse is just because few translators didn't submit their work on time.    continuously baseless excuse . now he came to that stupid re-audit because of which he delayed the bounties for 4 months.   Here I wanted to be fair.. I clearly told him if the think the management was not done properly he can cut management fee. but can't cut bounty payments.    LOL.. the only excuse he made to not pay me 50% referral (which was the actual referral when I referred that Chinese company to tokenpay) just because that deal was done privately through skype.... besided paying me 50% which was around 15 Bitcoins he only agreed to pay me 25K coins (which was already an unfair and partiality with me) but I still agreed to accept 25K coins. but after few days he again refused to pay 25K coins. I'll post the proof of that too.   Trying to tripping 110k coins when his ICO raised 30 Million $.. this is the real face of Derek Capo and tokenpay if someone wasn't aware before, he should be warned now.    when he see the situation getting out of control he suddenly changed his language. So much Drama Dude.   Again reminding me that he'll do a full audit so he have a reason to delay the payments till the end of January.. he released the whole bounty payment responsibility from himself.   No point to re-audit everything when you already hired a manager to manage  your Bounties.. if you don't trust a manager. why you hired us and wasted our 5 months in this scam project? someone please explain him this.   Drama Continue. First time asking me to collect wallets. when in the initial management agreement we've clearly discussed that the bounties will be paid to everyone's Tokenpay dashboard.   in above messages he said he'll pay at end of January. and now it is 13th January and he's not even started his  so-called re-audit.    keeps avoiding my referral bonus payment requests. see his insulting language when I asked for referral payment.    this message is from Friday 20th January. First he promised to pay bounties in late January and now he is making another excuse and again moved bounty payments to february.. and no response when I asked for my referral bonus. I request crypto community to notice his behavior properly   February 10th: Excuses continuous.     Again no response to my referral payment request    A New excuse to delay the bounties for more time.. as long as ICO investors won't cashout their coins to their own wallet, he will not pay the bounties. even those 5000 users already got their coins in their ICO dashboard. LOL... Derek have crossed all limits of baseless excuses   It is 27th February: The bounties which was supposed to be paid at the end of January (according to Derek him self) because of his none sense Re-audit issue. it's another great example of unprofessionalism     Please somebody tell me if this is not a real scam then what is the scam? see how blatantly he refused to pay the agreed amount of referral bonus (25K Tpay) and threatening me to tak only 5000 or get 0,  after 3 months of waiting, and after so many requests and pushing he finally decided to show his real face. This Derek Capo should be in jail today for such a blatant scam attempt. and see what is his excuse.. "" I am buying Tpay from other users just because of this?? really ? is Buying Tpay Coin ia Scam? then what is the reason of making Tpay? I am a scam because I am buying Tpay coins. and whatever you are doing is fair.. this is the mind of a Well Educated American person who's also the Founder of a Big Blockchain.   No answer of how I scammed people. just repeating accept 5k coins or get zero, dude if I scammed anyone then prove it.   100% scam      After just scamming me for 20k Tpay coins. this guys keeps blaming me and trying to prove himself innocent. everyone can see what he just did with my referral payment. I let this judgement on the community. you people decide who is the scammer.   everyone can clearly see in above screenshot. he have promised to pay the bounties at the end of January. and now he's saying he never promised a date. another example of Derek's breaking his words again   just to delay the bounties for more time. he's putting a big load of work on me of collecting user's wallets. which was not even part of our initial agreement. John and Derek Clearly agreed to pay the participants through the ICO dashboard (I'll post screenshot of this too)   Lying over lying   still didn't started his re-audit which he wanted to do since 3 months   See Friends.. now he set another date. 14th march, and below you'll see how he will fuck up his own words with his team   How can he accept such reasonable options. all of his auditing things. wallet collection things were useless excuses to delay the payments more and more and finally end up with no payment. he was just trying to get more time    just few lines above he's clearly saying he'll not pay the agreed amount of bounties and after few lines. he want to be fair.. what kind of fairness is this? somebody please tell me    these are the all proofs and screenshots taking from between me and Derek Skype Conversation.. there are not finished yet.. I yet to post screenshots of Group conversation. danny conversation. a lot more proofs and evidence yet to be posted. but these are also enough proof of the scam Derek and His team has run behind me and bounty programs. everyone can clearly see he made agreements. he broke agreements. he promised payments. he refused payments. he fixed dates. but never paid on those dates. these scroonshots are enough to show a clear picture of Derek Capo's Greedy personality..   Note: I'll Add more details and all proof here shortly.  Road Map  1: Posting Proofs and Screenshots. 2: Press and News Publications and Public Awareness About Tokenpay's 1 Million $ Scam. 3: A Charity bounty program to Support the 2000 Scammed Users. with help of that Bounty program. we'll Raise our voice against tokenpay scam in entire Crypto Community and let everyone know what they've done with us. 3: Blacklisting from Exchanges and Coinmarketcap. 4: Sending Mass Emails to Verge Team, Tpay's Advisory Group and TokenPay's other partners and request them to boycott Tokenpay untill they Refund the Scammed Coins. 4: Filing a Case in FBI and other American and Chines Agencies about this blatant Scam.     Solution: Here is the Options if Derek and his Team Wants to Sort this out before this get even worst and they don't get any chance to change it:  1: Escrow 110,000 + 50,000 (delay charges) of Tpay Coins to a trusted wallets, 2: Pay the Remaining referral bonus of 25,000 Tpay Coins. 3: Proof me wrong with Valid Evidence and Proofs..

I have a few questions, so glad to see this posted here.  1) I see Sunerok the lead developer of Verge Currency as the Blockchain Audit Advisor. Is he going to lead the TokenPay blockchain development team? If not, what are the plans for onboarding a lead developer to this project?  2) This coin looks ideal for a marketplace due to the security and anonymity features. Are there any plans to roll one out on Tor or on the clearnet?  3) I see a few coins that are planning to integrate a bank. None have to my knowledge have actually completed any bank acquisition deal. I suspect that the regulatory framework would not allow the bank to transact in USD or with US customers. Have you had any advanced discussions regarding this? I see that you mention the HKD. How useful would transacting in the HKD be for people outside of Hong Kong?  4) Is this Token Sale open to all people worldwide? I do not see any geographical restrictions.  I am sure I will have more questions soon and wish you luck with this ambitious project. Thanks for taking the time to put this together.",False

I will address each one below:   1.  Sunerok is the Lead Developer of Verge Currency, which is a coin that I personally find to be amazing and it heavily influenced the scope of this project. He was enlisted by TokenPay to audit the integrity, security and quality of the blockchain. He has completed this task. The TPAY coin has passed his rigorous audit with flying colors. This is why we call it “The World’s Most Secure Coin”. We do anticipate that Sunerok will continue with the project as the Blockchain Advisor. The plan is to use proceeds from the Token Sale to hire a world class team of crypto developers. Our focus is on the blockchain technology and we strongly feel that given the demand for a coin of this nature that it can eventually be a Top 10 coin and the leading privacy product on the market.  2.  We are working on a Tor Marketplace for TokenPay as part of the overall platform buildout. Transactions will naturally be conducted in TPAY. One thing I will note is that this will be a fully compliant Marketplace for the purposes of conducting legal transactions anonymously with no fear of counterparty risk.  3.  We are very aware a lot of other blockchain projects that are making claims about acquiring a bank. However, we believe that we have a unique opportunity given the involvement of actual bankers and financial professionals on board who understand and are capable of securing the necessary licenses. Offshore banking is extremely complex and is still a case of “who you know” and we feel that we are ideally positioned to capitalize on this based on our extensive contacts already in Asia. As far as your question on the USD goes, I’ll defer that to a later date. Most offshore banks do not accept US clients for regulatory reasons.  4. Yes, the Token Sale is open to everyone worldwide. We do have a highly regarded US lawyer on our Team named Senen Garcia along with an attorney who is an International banking and compliance specialist named Carlos Araya. Please make sure to read all of the legal terms prior to participating in the Token Sale.",False
