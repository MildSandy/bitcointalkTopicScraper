We believe this puts us in the privileged position of knowing exactly what clients need as end users and aim to use these years of experience to create a seamless, easy to use and secure cryptocurrency exchange.  Kryptoro aims not only to bring the ability to transact in cryptocurrencies easily to our clients but provide users all the resources they will need to make investment decisions right there on the platform!This includes live news feeds, live social media feeds and sentiment analysis. Having been actively involved in cryptocurrency trading from as early as 2012 we have managed to identify the shortcomings of previous exchanges and will ensure none of these present themselves in Kryptoro.  We have a very experienced and competent team, all of which are available to review on our website, in addition to our whitepaper. The main difference between Kryptoro and other exchanges is our core focus. We focus not on high transaction throughput and order matching, but rather on end user experience and making the exchange as intuitive and fluid to use as possible. This does not mean sub standard order matching ends and latency but rather just sufficient capacity to ensure fluid use.  While our fee structure is slightly less favorable than other exchanges, in our experience in creating technology for end users, we have found that people are willing to pay a premium for peace of mind and convenience. We also offer a myriad of fiat payment railways making it easy to both enter and exit the cryptocurrency market.  Please visit our website at : https://kryptoro.com/ or email info@kryptoro.com for more information",False
