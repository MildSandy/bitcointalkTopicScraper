First let's address the problem.  50% of ever ad dollar goes to the supply chain.  That means that if BMW spends $1.00 to advertise on WSJ, then WSJ only collects $0.50.  That is absurd.  In addition, WSJ has to wait 30-120 days (1-4 months) to be paid for showing that impression.  Last, WSJ has no idea how many companies transact to deliver that ad.  Many times it's 20-30 companies that sit in between BMW and WSJ (that's where 50% of the spend goes.)  Ternio brings transparency to this process, enabling WSJ to understand how many intermediaries sit between their site and BMW.  With this knowledge, WSJ can compress the supply chain to recapture the majority of the $1.00 BMW spends.   In addition, Ternio enables WSJ to be paid in real time.  No more waiting months to collect.    1) Collect a much higher percentage of ad dollars 2) Collect at the time of impression delivery - enabling better cash flow to run their business.",True

Not compete, but complement.  Google has many advertising products.  Some are software tools like DFP (doubleclick for publishers) and DBM (double click bid manager).  Others are closed ecosystem ad networks like adwords/adsense.  With adsense, google is selling the media (advertisements).  Ternio doesn't sell any media.  That's why so many companies are fine utilizing our tech - it doesn't threaten their business   Ternio's technology can be used with all of Google's software and (if Google choses) can be integrated with their ad network as well.

I'm a big fan&hodler of Stellar and that's how I found Ternio.   The fact that Stellar is having companies of this caliber pick XLM over ETH says a lot.  I think Stellar will be a top 5 coin in a year.,True

We had an independent company come in and audit Ternio's Lexicon blockchain.  This was to appease anyone who may be skeptical of the claim.
