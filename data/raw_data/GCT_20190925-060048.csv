Q1) What will heppen if GlobeCas project cannot reach softcap?  If our project cannot reach the softcap, we will refund to the contributors.   Q2) What will happen with the unsold token?  Most of the ICO projects will burn their unsold token. However, it is not fair to the contributors, since the contributors' token will be diluted.  For example, there are 100 token issue the owner holds 50% i.e. 50 tokens, investors bought 30 token and 20 unsold tokens have been burned. The percentage of owner vs investors is 62.5% vs 37.5%.  That is why we airdrop the unsold token to the contributors according to the token they bought. So the ratio remains unchanged.  In the same example, there are 100 token issue the owner holds 50% i.e. 50 tokens, investors bought 30 token and 20 unsold tokens have been burned. Airdrop the unsold tokens will make the same case to 50:50""  Please feel free to let us know if there is any question or let us know about what you think about this project.  Cheers!",True

What we realize during our market study in past years is...  Most of the betting ICO claim they have solid experience, but not many of them get a member at senior management level and holding any authority license.  We cannot totally agree on the 2nd point. It is because people know Gambling industry worth multi-billions, but it could be very dangerous for someone lacking experience in the field.  When I refer to ""dangerous"", it means the penalty of breaking rules & regulations. The team may live in the jail for their entire life.  Applying gambling license is another big big issue, our CEO Mr Sunny Lam will have an interview to talk about it on our official youtube channel soon.  Thanks for your comment & support!",True
