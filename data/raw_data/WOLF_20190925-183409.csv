That dream was based on the vision of our CEO, Phil Longhurst, and the dedicated inner circle that he assembled in the early days of our project’s development.  What if there was a software application that could help ordinary people achieve greater financial independence through cryptocurrency trading?  What if it was backed by its own blockchain, which also had the potential of serving as a source of passive income for those who held the coin?  What if the members of our team, through hard work and dedication could improve not only our own lives, but the lives of human beings around the world through the revolutionary technological development of automated cryptocurrency trading and our own dedicated blockchain?  The dream became a goal, the goal became a project, the project became a company, and we remain as committed as ever to that vision; however, over the past few months, there have been some decisions made that have caused our community to question our trustworthiness.  The success--or failure--of any business hinges on the trust of those the business serves.  Without this trust, no business can hope to survive, and this is especially true in cryptocurrency, an industry that unfortunately has been plagued by bad actors and bullshit artists, especially during the last bull market of 2017 and the subsequent crash.  This led to 2018 and 2019 being particularly difficult years for start-up crowdfunded cryptocurrency projects as those bad actors led to a lack of investor confidence.  Our founders have funded the project from the beginning, and together as a team, we have put in $350,000 of our own money into the WolfpackBOT and Wolfcoin Ecosystem.  Altogether, our crowdsale and IEO grossed $362,218. This means that because WolfpackBOT had no softcap as we were self funded, the project will continue moving forward no matter what.  We have our own hard-earned savings invested in this project, and we are dedicated to its long-term success along with all the members of our community who have helped us along the way.  Obviously, this amount is short of what we hoped to raise, but it was enough, when combined with our own self funding, for us to get the company off the ground and get our initial product, WolfpackBOT software, out to the public. We view our crowdsale as a success, especially when compared to the many cryptocurrency based projects that failed to reach their softcap or even make it to their initial product launch during this bear market.  The fact that we were able to raise these funds through sheer hard work, a dedicated grassroots marketing approach, and allowing our product to speak for itself says volumes to all of us about the amazing potential for the project’s long-term success.  All of the members of our team are still working their day jobs and are putting their time and energy into WolfpackBOT at the same time, and working extended hours including nights and weekends.  We know the long term potential here, and we want to let each and every one of you know exactly where we stand at this moment, so that we can more effectively show you where we are planning to go in the future and address your questions and concerns in a completely honest, forthright, and transparent way.  So, where is WolfpackBot going from here?  Our number one priority is to continue to develop the most advanced cryptocurrency trading bot on the market and to grow our subscriber base, while simultaneously advancing the visibility, liquidity, and buying power of both WOLF and HOWL. Over the next few weeks and months, we will roll out a timeline of goals that will serve as a guidepost for our long-term ambitions.  Goals for future products, services, and exchange listings will be detailed along with our philanthropic and humanitarian ambitions.  The Wolfcoin Ecosystem has never been about profitability alone, it’s also about creating a better world, a world where all can share in the benefits of this revolutionary technology.  The WolfpackBOT and Wolfcoin Community isn’t just our community, it’s also your community, and we will listen to and respond to your logical suggestions and ideas as time permits.  In the shorter term, we have recently launched a marketing partnership with ADVFN, a well-known financial market company that has been providing data and services to investors and has been successfully bringing new customers to companies since 1999.   In addition, we are currently exploring partnerships with cryptocurrency payment networks such as Spend, BTC Pay, Bitpay, Coin Payments, and others, as well as individual merchants and merchant networks.  We are also in communication with additional exchanges, including Coin Exchange, Cryptobridge, Gate.io, Escodex, and others, and we will keep you up-to-date as negotiations move forward.  We hope that having this information and being a bit more informed about not only the situation on the ground but also where we’re heading and what we’re doing will help to give you insight into why we have made some of the decisions we have had to make over the last several months.  We have also had to navigate and ensure that we have been compliant with the ever changing regulatory laws.  Granted, many of these decisions were very difficult and kept all of us awake many a late night, chain smoking and drinking coffee by the gallon as we tried to make the best decisions possible in a very difficult cryptocurrency market situation.  We have also been discussing many of your suggestions internally, and we wanted you to be aware of some of our plans that we are working to roll out over the next few months.  Here are a few of the next steps we have planned for WolfpackBOT, WOLF, and HOWL, in 10 points:  1.  For Bot Subscriptions that are paid in WOLF, we will distribute 15% of the WOLF received to the HOWL revenue sharing wallets.  2.  For BOT subscriptions that are paid in cryptocurrencies other than WOLF, users will receive a 10% HOWL bonus based on the dollar value of the subscription.  At the same time, 85% of the equivalent value of WOLF will be burned from our unsold supply, and 15% will be moved to the HOWL revenue sharing wallets.  So, for example, if someone pays $65 for a bot subscription in a cryptocurrency other than WOLF, $55.25 worth of unsold WOLF will be burned, and $9.75 will be moved to the HOWL revenue sharing wallets.  3.  We are working on shared BOT pools that will be monthly subscription based.  These are the pools that we are planning to implement:  USDT/BTC  USDT/ETH  USDT/BTC & ETH  BTC/Alts  ETH/Alts  The model we are considering is to accept a to-be-determined portion of the subscription fee payable in WOLF.  A to-be-determined portion of the WOLF received will be sent to the HOWL revenue sharing wallets for distribution to HOWL holders, and a to-be-determined portion of the WOLF received will be burned.  4.  We will be introducing our own subscription based trading academy, which will teach our members how to effectively trade cryptocurrencies, read charts, and create trading bot strategies based on the charts.  This will include live videos with live Q&A, just like an online college course.  Again, the model we are considering is to accept a to-be-determined portion of the trading academy subscription fee payable in WOLF.  A to-be-determined portion of the WOLF received will be sent to the HOWL revenue sharing wallets for distribution to HOWL holders, and a to-be-determined portion of the WOLF received will be burned.  5.  We will be selling WolfpackBOT and Wolfcoin promotional merchandise, such as t-shirts, hats, and other promotional materials to help us advance our project’s visibility.  Again, we will accept a to-be-determined portion of the payment for these items in WOLF, with a to-be-determined portion of the WOLF received being sent to the HOWL revenue sharing wallets for distribution to HOWL holders, and a to-be-determined portion of the WOLF received will be burned.  6.  We will be implementing a buy-back/burn program for WOLF.  Beginning Q2/Q3 in 2020, each quarter we will allocate a to-be-determined portion of our revenue to be used to buy WOLF from the exchanges and burn it.  This is similar to the model that Binance follows for BNB coin.  7.  We are planning to make philanthropic endeavors a major part of our ecosystem.  These projects will accept WOLF for donations, and we will match a to-be-determined portion of the WOLF donation amount and burn it.  A few of the projects we are currently looking into partnering with include a childhood cancer foundation and various animal rescue charities.  8.  We are looking into adjusting the Wolfcoin blockchain code to increase the masternode collateral after a future block, while still maintaining the original masternode collateral for the current masternodes.  9.  As we move forward, and our company grows in the coming years, we will continue to develop the capabilities of our bot, while also increasing the number of use cases for both WOLF and HOWL through external partnerships and internal product and service development, which will continuously increase volume, buying power, and liquidity.  10.  In the coming weeks, we will be hosting live AMAs on Telegram, where you will be able to ask our team questions about trading and our bot.  We are happy to continue to answer any additional questions you have for our team, and it is our sincere hope that by “setting the record straight” we can work to bridge the gap between our team and our community.  They say that challenge builds strength, and our team has certainly faced our share of challenges over this past year but these challenges have only made us more determined than ever to succeed.  We will work alongside you, humbly and diligently, to continue to build the greatest crypto project and community in the world.  Our humblest and most sincere gratitude,  Rance Garrison Chief Marketing Officer WolfpackBOT & Wolfcoin",False

In this announcement, by email and every Social Media Channel on May 4th, we informed everyone they would not loose any value of their investment in us lowering the price, in contrary, we wanted to make sure our early investors would be VERY well taken care of, as they are the pillar stone of our project and we thank them for their trust in our project. So your remark of 'shafting all the early investors' is completely wrong. We try to be as transparant as we can possibly be, we have a high moral standard, and the team is on our website with their LinkedIn and Facebook profiles. Why? Because we are NOT scammers, we are a startup trading bot company with a very good product and very bright future, and are not hiding behing fake names, you can look us up. In contraposition to a lot of other ICO / IEO / Crowdsale projects we strive to be as transparant and fair as possible, we conduct business following the law of fair exchange and value.  This lowering of the price was necessary to create a healthy model, this has been achieved and is in the best interest of all Contributors through Wolfpackbot.com, because a healthy financial model is essential for the future of our project and community.  The original email May 4th: ""Our community has spoken, and we have listened!  As you have probably heard, WolfpackBOT will be launching several IEO's, or Initial Exchange Offerings, over the coming weeks.  The first round of IEOs will be launching on May 5th on Biger Exchange and BTex, and will run in three stages on May 5th, 6th, and 7th.   The Stage Pricing for each round will be as follows:   •   Stage 1:  $0.008/WOLF •   Stage 2:  $0.011/WOLF •   Stage 3:  $0.015/WOLF   These stage prices are for a limited number of coins, for a very limited time.  We realize that this is considerably lower than the listed WOLF price during our Crowdsale; however, given the current dormant conditions of the traditional crowdsale market, we changed to the IEO model to increase WOLF's liquidity and ensure the long-term success of the WolfpackBOT and Wolfcoin Ecosystem as IEO's have become the new standard in cryptocurrency fundraising.  This was not an easy decision, but a necessary one to ensure the long-term success of the project.  Out of fairness to those who contributed in our Crowdsale, due in part to the lower price of WOLF during the IEOs, we will be compensating you with our revenue-sharing token, HOWL.  Each quarter, all HOWL holders will receive 15% of our gross revenue from WolfpackBOT subscriptions.  On July 15th, a snapshot of the Wolfcoin Blockchain will be taken, and all WOLF holders will receive one HOWL for each WOLF held in their Wolfcoin wallets.   Originally, in addition to the WOLF to HOWL match, we announced that all Crowdsale contributors would receive HOWL dollar for dollar based on the dollar amount contributed during our Crowdsale; however, as some members of the community have brought to our attention, this still leaves Crowdsale contributors at a disadvantage compared to those who purchase WOLF during the IEO.   As a result of these comments and concerns, and to show that we firmly believe in the principle of fair exchange, and take the concerns of our community seriously, we are making some additional changes to benefit those who contributed during our WolfpackBOT.com Crowdsale.    So what are these changes, and what to they mean for you as a WolfpackBOT Crowdsale contributor?   •   We will be honoring 'dollar for dollar' HOWL to WOLF matching for all WolfpackBOT.com Crowdsale contributors.  •   For all the WOLF you received for pre-ordering WolfpackBOT subscriptions during our WolfpackBOT.com Crowdsale, you will receive HOWL in a 10:1 HOWL to WOLF ratio. •   All non-WolfpackBOT.com Crowdsale contributors will only receive HOWL in a 1:1 ratio. •   IEO contributors will not receive BOT subscription credit with their purchase; you will! •   Receive additional HOWL by taking advantage of this limited-time low price offering in the IEO's to get more WOLF and receive more 1:1 HOWL matching to get a greater share of BOT subscription revenue each quarter.   In the coming week, we will make an official announcement regarding the procedure for how to receive your HOWL. Thank you for being an early contributor, giving us your continued support, and helping us make the WolfpackBOT community and ecosystem as strong as a pack of wolves!   Wolfpack Team""  After this Email some investors contacted us and expressed their opinion about rather having more WOLF instead of HOWL. We have listened to their opinions and made sure we gave everybody a second option, if this isn't following the law of fair exchange and value, I wouldn't know what is!  Underneath an image of the spreadsheet that is offered to our investors to calculate their individual situation and make their choice based upon the outcome and personal preference. We will send out an email with the announcement of a second option and a link to this spreadsheet today.   CLICK IMAGE ABOVE TO DOWNLOAD THE SPREADSHEET FOR YOUR PERSONAL CALCULATION  I hope you've read everything carefully and agree, even admit your assumption was incorrect and will agree we are fair to all our early investors through Wolfpackbot.com, as well as have a good vision regarding building a bright future for our project.

(Offer ends July 1, 2019)  http://www.wolfpackbot.com    IMPORTANT INFORMATION  As you may have heard, the WolfpackBOT and Wolfcoin ecosystem has recently gone through some changes with the lowering of WOLF’s price due to our recent IEO and the introduction of HOWL, our new exclusive revenue sharing token for accredited private investors and WolfpackBOT.com Crowdsale contributors.  The reaction to this news was mostly positive; however, we have also heard the voices of those in the community who would prefer to be rewarded additional WOLF.   Therefore, in response to our community, we are putting the choice in your hands.  Every WolfpackBOT.com Crowdsale Contributor who contributed before April 30, 2019 will be able to choose one of the following options in their WolfpackBOT.com Member’s Area.   We are currently implementing some changes to our website, and the option to choose your compensation method will be included in the Member's Area of our website by the end of the month.  This update will also give you the option to register your HOWL wallet address in your Member’s Area.  Specific instructions on how to register and verify your HOWL and WOLF wallet address(es) will follow shortly.     Option 1:  At the time of the snapshot on July 15, 2019, you will receive 10 HOWL for each WOLF received during our WolfpackBOT.com Crowdsale as well as dollar-for-dollar matching in HOWL.      For example, if you contributed $1,000 during our Crowdsale and received 10,000 WOLF, you will now receive 100,000 HOWL due to the 10:1 HOWL to WOLF snapshot, and you will also receive an additional 100,000 HOWL (valued at $0.01 for accredited private investors) for the dollar-for-dollar match.  Don’t forget you will also receive $1,000 in WolfpackBOT subscription value.  This subscription value in addition to the 10,000 WOLF and 200,000 HOWL equates to an estimated total value of $3,100.   Option 2:  You will receive additional WOLF on June 1, giving you a total of 10 times your original amount of WOLF.  You will also receive 1:1 HOWL to WOLF bonus at the time of the snapshot.  For example, if you contributed $1,000 during our WolfpackBOT.com Crowdsale and received 10,000 WOLF, you will now have 100,000 WOLF. At the time of the Wolfcoin Blockchain snapshot on July 15, 2019, you will also receive the 1:1 HOWL to WOLF bonus, giving you 100,000 HOWL.  And of course, you will also receive $1,000 in WolfpackBOT subscription value.  This subscription value in addition to the 100,000 WOLF and 100,000 HOWL equates to an estimated total value of $3,000.

The staff owns 95% of MNs and coins, and will dump once they hit the exchanges. There are already almost as many MNs as DASH has, and the coin isn't on a single exchange yet - the only one who is allowed to sell during crowdsale is staff. They're absolutely REFUSING exchange listings before then, and banning anyone who tries to sell OTC. I asked politely in their Discord if I could sell OTC since the crowdsale was 3 months from ending, and they screamed at me in DMs & immediately banned me.

I am following up with the Discord admins to find out what happened. You should not have been banned for asking that question, however it is in our pinned message that coins can only be sold on the exchange after the Crowdsale. I understand your impatience and I will follow up with you once I find out from the Discord admins what happened.  FYI: the masternode growth is organic. Also, you can not compare a masternode price of a Dash masternode with ours, as Dash masternode will cost you 1,000 x $90 = $90,000. Dash has currently 4939 masternodes. A Wolfcoin Masternode will only cost you  10,000 x $0.10 = $1,000. Wolfcoin has currently 4004 masternodes. So comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges, as Dash's total value in masternodes is $444,510,000 as where Wolfcoin's is only $4,004,000 at it's current stage value, that's less than 1% of the total value of Dash's masternodes.  Furthermore, I am offended by you calling us a scam, we are very transparent in our company, even displaying our team-member's LinkedIn and Facebook accounts on our website. We HAVE a great product, which is already available for everyone to download and check out yourself.  Lastly, it would be absurd to have trading opened on exchanges whilst still in Crowdsale stage. Wolfcoin will be open for trading after our Crowdsale.  Check out our Bot yourself, it's great! That's our product and is VERY real.  Thank you.",False

Cryptocurrency is about free market determining value. If your bot is valuable, which it looks to be, then that should give your coin utility. Locking a price & making yourself the sole gatekeeper for 3+ months is a bastardization of everything we're here for. It is the very reason people have a problem with Masternode coins, in the first place.  You can play the 'righteous indignation' card with me all day long, but I know people who make good bots, and I know what they're worth. You're saying $4mil mcap before you even have a working alpha is reasonable? And you're forcing every last holder to wait in line behind you, in order to sell ANY of the coins they've already purchased at your price?  k. Feel how you want. I'm telling it like it is.  A ""crowdsale"" is for before your chain ever launches. Once people are holding real coins in their wallets, you shouldn't be dictating the price any more. If you want to talk about how great your bot is - cool. Sell that as a product. You know what's good for subscriptions? BTC. Maybe use that.

Since we are in the ICO stage, yes, a high number of coins are held internally, but this is true of any project at this stage of development since the coins were pre-mined.  Even well established projects, such as Ripple, hold up to 90 percent of their own coins.    Finally, if you have any additional concerns or questions, we would love to have a video call with you to address them.  Perhaps you could help us understand how we could be even more transparent with the crypto community.    ",False

You just compared yourself favorably to Ripple, the most obvious scam in the market. That's not a great look, but it's the only large cap that's handled their business in a way similar to yours. Secondly, as to your above comment, ""making sure the product works right""...  ...maybe that's something to do before putting a $4mil+ price tag on it? This is like a company coming out and saying, ""We're going to make a great phone. We've never done it before, but give us $1,000 & in three months we'll see what happens! In the meantime, here's a paper phone.""  Except those people are now holding useless ""phone utility tokens"" that they also can't sell until the three months is up. At which point, there is NOTHING preventing the team from selling 50%+ of the supply, and leaving zero liquidity for bagholders to utilize. And, no thanks - I don't want to waste my time on a conference call, and it would be a waste - you're past the point of no return, already. This is a bad economic model, and it is already in motion.  I've advised projects in the past, and while I frequently do conference calls - it is BEFORE they start accepting the first dollar from users, and while there is still time to adjust course. This project is well beyond that point. You can't un-sink the ship.",False
