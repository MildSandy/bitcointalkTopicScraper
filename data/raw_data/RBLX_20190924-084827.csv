They are still being paid out though on the daily so we will get to everyone we are hoping within the next 7-10 business days. The program is also still active if anybody wants to join in.",False

There is no volume. <- This is a huge issue. 4)  I firmly believe you should invest capital into marketing as soon as feasible - please update the community on if this is a plan moving forward. 5) Back to liquidity - we are currently at a seven million market cap - do you have a goal you are able to share?  Where do you see Rublix position in the crypto universe. 6) Are there plans to list on additonal exchanges - this will tie in to the liquidity question posed above.  I believe in this project and hope to see more announcements on social media, partnerships, and volume.  Gain the interest of the crypto community somehow - let me know if you need assistance.

We are actively looking for strategic partnerships. A couple are still in negotiation stages so we can't disclose the full details yet until they finalize. 2. There will be updates on our blockchain R&D side and we will be releasing more smart contracts that can be used for performance ranking. Provided partnerships mature within this time-frame, we will be announcing those too. 3. We have applied to several bigger exchanges, we are just waiting to hear back from them. Unfortunately QRYPTOS was the only decent one who was able to fit us in a timely fashion. 4. Marketing at this point has been very minimal as we haven't done an ICO, we don't have a massive amount of funds to work with so almost all of our efforts are organic and from community support. Once we are able to fund a proper marketing campaign, we definitely will ramp it up. Development has always been our first priority. 5. We have big goals, Hedge and our other DApps are just the beginning. Our team has found a huge passion for refining the blockchain aspect of the project so everyone can expect massive developments in this area. Rublix Development Inc itself is a software company and therefore, you will see us expanding in as many directions as possible throughout the blockchain community. 6. Of course.",False

Many mainstream blockchains operate inefficiently and we want to make sure our chain can handle an enterprise load level. Airdrop to Round 1 subscribers will receive their tokens by the end of this month/first week of April. We are in talks with several (reputable) exchanges to have our RBLX token listed on (in April).

Now that our internal workings are in order, we are starting to present our project to the community.  As far as our DApp, we have several smart contracts written that facilitate what we want on the Ethereum blockchain. We are in the works of building a proper UI for the platform and hoping to have an MVP within the next 2 months. This could change obviously as rigorous testing is required before we have a stable preview for the community and token holders.",False
