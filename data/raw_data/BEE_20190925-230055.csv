On becoming an advisor for Effect.AI  Effect.AI is an Amsterdam-based project that is working on a decentralized network for Artificial Intelligence and AI related services on the NEO blockchain. Tony expressed great interest in the way Effect.AI has prioritized making its platform open and accessible:  “The Bee Token was founded to solve real problems for real people. Everyone knows how complicated the housing situation is in San Francisco and when people start using The Bee Token, we should be able to alleviate some of those problems. We couldn’t do that until the technology was there though and you see something similar with Effect.AI: they are on the verge of utilizing blockchain technology to give everyone access to something that previously simply wasn’t accessible in this way. I’m very excited to help them launch their project.”  What Tony can do for Effect.AI  As a veteran advisor with a strong background in machine learning, Tony Tran is perfectly suited to advise the Effect.AI team during development and, perhaps even more importantly, assist in the acquisition of strategic partners that will further strengthen the Effect.AI project. Tony will be consulting with the team on a regular basis.  Join the Effect.AI Whitelist now  Effect.AI’s Whitelist went live earlier today. Interest has been overwhelming, but there’s still room for you to reserve a spot on the Whitelist. The Whitelist is available on the Effect.AI website. Before heading there, you can read this release to learn more about the requirements. The rest will be explained to you during the process. If you have any questions, please join the Telegram channel.  Effect.AI Effect.AI Telegram Facebook.com/effectai Twitter.com/effecaix Github.com/effectai",False
