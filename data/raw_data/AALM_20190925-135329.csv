As ALMBank seeks to engender real-world activities and responses with the charitable marketplace, we aim to create a more inclusive culture and society through altruistic action.  This means, for example, that you can help an elderly neighbor repair their driveway by letting our community fund it by using ALMBank Tokens.  This effectively empowers cryptocurrency users who otherwise would not have the time, resources, or knowledge to help uplift those around them.  This works by enabling people to post requests for charitable ventures; this can be anything from setting up a local small business to serving a community need or helping someone who can’t find a job craft a resume. You then set the fair market price (which will be reviewed by admins) and then someone can complete the task and get paid the fair market value set by the community.  Once the price is approved and the task is completed, the payment is paid out weekly via the blockchain after receiving proof of project completion.
