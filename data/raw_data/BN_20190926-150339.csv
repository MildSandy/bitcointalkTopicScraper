Bitone Network is a platform with its own chain of blocks that connects multiple chains to the Bitcoin network. It consists of a wallet compatible with various cryptoactives, which acts as a decentralized exchange house (DEX) and allows the execution of intelligent contracts from other platforms using bitcoin.  The official token of the platform is the bitone node, which allows its owner to participate in the process of verification of transactions and operations of the network through a consensus system called proof of stake (PoS), and in this way generate incentives from the commissions that users pay when using the application.   What are the advantages?   The current problem is that digital assets are isolated in their respective chains. Therefore, the goal of Bitone Network is to connect Bitcoin with all of them and in this way help it to become a more functional reference currency.  It is necessary that all this infrastructure based on a decentralized economy, possess a currency or a reference system, which acts aas a store of value and allows people around the world to save their money while using the applications offered by other blockchain platforms.  Bitone Network is a decentralized intermediary platform that allows the user to operate with intelligent contracts, decentralized applications (dapp) and anonymous transactions of other chains using bitcoin. In addition, it works with a multi-wallet (Bitone wallet), which allows to store tokens of different blockchain while using its own decentralized Exchange (Bitone DEX), which automates the decentralized exchange of tokens between users and interoperability operations between chains.  It is about offering the world a level of financial integration that has never existed before.  https://i.imgur.com/H8ACo9v.png?1   PARTICIPATE IN THE PRESALE!
