But they can become “truly” smart by applying the Ricardian Contracts pattern, making them human readable, machine readable, accessible, legally binding and enforceable. This is what Contract Vault does.  Contract Vault is basically a raw diamond staying under the radar due to the fact that they do not make false promises à la “today to the moon, tomorrow to mars” and have a fully compliant ICO, which requires KYC/AML. This can be very attractive after the ICO as many tokens lose their value because the teams do not hold what they promise.",False

Seems that it's part of their plans. But it means, someone needs to buy their tokens first before creating such agreements. And for me, it's bit complicated. Because if you are entering legal contracts, usually you need physical presence at one point. So why not simplify your life, just use your fiat money instead. With this, you have fiat money to buy tokens and then enter legally binding contracts. Somewhere there, you lost a portion of your money. But maybe, this has specific advantages in very few occasions. So it means the usability of this project is not that much which would affect the price in exchanges in the future.",False

Generally spoken, Contract Vault encourages the service providers to keep the VLT in the ecosystem, eg. for advertising their services, paying license fees for the use of the editor for internal purposes or collaborating with other service providers (lawyers with other lawyers and smart contract developers and vice versa). This is especially interesting in international or regular cooperations and as such stated on the token sale page and in the white paper. Furthermore, all license fees paid for the white label use of the platform flow to Contract Vault, which allows Contract Vault to stimulate the offer of the VLT on the free market. Contract Vault will also offer discounts for all payments done directly in VLT (by decreasing its fees) so that it may be advantageous to keep the VLT rather than sell it for fiat / exchange it to other crypto and rebuy it later. Due to the limited availability of the VLT token, the price should correlate with the demand for services. If the demand exceeds the market capitalization of the VLT token, then the price should react. Contract Vault believes that there is a market for the platform and - due to the full scalability of the project and the global approach - the demand will exceed the capitalization. We are talking about a 700 billion market only for classic legal services, let alone all alternative legal services and ""new world"" use cases which nobody offers yet. If one does not believe that bringing efficiency to the legal industry and making contracts with smart functionalities accessible, legally binding and legally enforceable, yeah, then it will be difficult to assume that there will be a sufficient demand.",False

It is the solution to get everyone ready for the brave new world of smart contracts - and make them Truly Smart.  VIDEO:  https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjQkbINiXN8   Contract Vault, the Blockchain-powered platform on which anyone can develop, use, resell, customise and repurpose legally sound contracts, is delighted to announce the sale of Vault Tokens (VLT) with a view to raising 45M CHF (Swiss Francs).  Contract Vault, based in Switzerland’s ‘Crypto Valley’ of Zug – a world centre of blockchain talent and resource, is democratising contracts – making them easy for everyone. The project and its Token are fully legally compliant! In this spirit, the Vault Token Crowdsale will be easy for everyone too: accepting fiat currencies as well as cryptocurrencies.  Key Elements of the Vault Token Crowdsale  The early bird phase will run from May 1 – June 30, with a 25% bonus  The standard phase will run from July 15 – August 31  The Vault Token, denominated VLT, will initially exchange at: 10 VLT = 1 CHF (= circa 1 USD or 0.75 GBP depending on rates)  The minimum goal is 1M CHF  The hard cap is 45M CHF  To protect participators, pre-registration is mandatory in order to support banking-grade KYC checks.  The Vault Token Crowdsale is also supported by an airdrop of 50-500VLT for interested parties who join the Contract Vault Telegram group and promote the opportunity to their networks.  About Contract Vault  Every crypto enthusiast knows that Blockchain creates contractual trust – and plenty of crypto startups already promise contracts. But Contract Vault is a much bigger proposition: the Contract Vault platform means anyone can develop, use, resell, customise and repurpose legally sound contracts – including activating smart functionality with no programming at all.  It’s a toolkit for building contracts as simply as drag-and-drop; a marketplace for selling them; and a secure environment for witnessing them. And it’s also a home for tomorrow’s smart contract automation. Effectively “confidence as a service”, Contract Vault empowers everyone from lawyers to ordinary people to make strong, binding agreements. Contract Vault is the new world of trust. And as well as creating seamlessness and reducing cost in existing transactions, the transparency and smart functionality of the platform means Contract Vault is ready to power emerging business models:  Token Sale (TGE): a record of truth, entitlement and ownership on one platform  Tokenized Asset Trading: market functionality, entitlements and transfers, plus complex trading mechanisms all wrapped in transparent smart functionality  Peer to Peer: insurance, crowd-lending, private share trading, micropayments etc. Contract Vault is designed to be a successful business by becoming the foundation for other successful businesses.  Partners  To achieve a position at the heart of the modern legal ecosystem, Contract Vault has already built partnerships with the most advanced and forward-thinking players in the European legal framework, including:  Chain Security AG: the world’s first automated formal audit platform for smart contract  Laux Lawyers AG: Switzerland’s leading technology law firm  Validity Labs AG: Blockchain solutions, testing and independent audit services  Light Paper: https://www.contractvault.io/files/lightpaper.pdf To learn more visit the Website: https://www.contractvault.io Participate in the Airdrop: https://www.contractvault.io/airdrop Read the White Paper: https://www.contractvault.io/token/#document-assets Chat with us on Telegram: https://t.me/cvchat  Media Contact   Contact Name: Ian Simpson Contact Email: ian.simpson@contractvault.io",False

Please note that the Vault Token Crowd Sale has been reviewed by ICOBriefing.com:  https://www.icobriefing.com/2018/05/09/ico-review-contract-vault-legally-enforceable-smart-contracts/  Summary:  ""Contract Vault solves a large issue in smart contracts. By making them easy to issue, easier to read for regular people, and having some translation to actual legal contracts, it ties the world of smart contracts to the real world. Regular folks can draw up personal or business agreements, and businesses can create automatically enforced contracts at low cost. Because of their use of Ricardian contracts, it’s also possible that the contracts created by Contract Vault could be legally valid.  There are some risks to the project, the main one being that regulation will take time to adapt to digital contracts, but as Contract vault provides useful functionality even beyond that, we think it is good project. In terms of return on investment, we like this one as well, however its hard cap of 45M CHF is rather high and should be kept in mind.""",False
